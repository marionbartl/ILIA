The Blum–Viollette proposal of 1936 takes its name from Léon Blum and Maurice Viollette, who acted as the French premier and governor-general of Algeria. The proposal was introduced to the Popular Front government of France in 1936, and aimed to address the issue of longstanding French colonialism in Algeria along with the persistent disenfranchisement of the territory's Muslim majority.
The proposal would have enabled a small number of Algerian Muslims to obtain full French citizenship while still allowing them to be subject to Muslim law on some social issues (such as marriage/divorce, custody, inheritance). An earlier policy, the sénatus-consulte legislation of 1865, had enabled Muslims to apply for French citizenship only if they renounced the provisions of Islamic personal status law, something that the vast majority of Muslims refused to do since many regarded doing so as the equivalent of apostasy. The Blum–Viollette proposal of 1936 would have granted these benefits to the highly educated, as well as to those Algerian men who served in the French military, with the plan to widen the benefits to other Muslims at a later date. The proposal did not apply to Algerian Jews, who had gained French citizenship following the Crémieux Decree of 1870.
The proposal never made it to the French Chamber of Deputies for a vote because of the massive protest staged by French settlers in Algeria. It was the failure of this and other such proposals that eventually led to the emergence of violent resistance on the part of the Algerian National Liberation Front and other militant groups whose members aimed to reclaim sovereignty for Algeria by force.

Rai Benjamin (born July 27, 1997) is an American professional hurdler and sprinter specializing in the 400 m and 400 m hurdles. He is the second fastest man in history in the 400 m hurdles with a personal best time of 46.17 s. He won a silver medal at his first Olympic Games in 2021 and at the World Championships in 2019 in the men's 400 m hurdles, and gold medals in the relay at the same competitions.
In college Benjamin ran for the UCLA Bruins and then the USC Trojans, where in early 2018 he was part of the team that set the world's best time in the indoor relay with a time of 3:00.77. At the time, his relay split time of 44.35 s was the fastest ever recorded in an indoor race. In June of the same year he also helped set the NCAA record in the same event but outdoors, and ran what was at the time the second fastest 400 m hurdles race of all-time in 47.02 s.
Early life and career
Rai Benjamin, from Mount Vernon High School (New York), was the fastest 2015 prep time in the United States in the 400m hurdles with a time of 49.97, fastest 400 m indoor time in the country with a 46.59 and the third fastest outdoor time 46.19.
Benjamin won the 2015 New York Indoor State meet with a national leading time of 33.17 in the 300 meters. He was a three-time New York State Public High School Athletic Association champion in the 400m hurdles.
He was the 2015 New Balance 400 meters National Champion and the 2015 New Balance Outdoor 400-meter hurdles National Champion.
Just after completing his second year, he represented Antigua and Barbuda at the 2013 World Youth Championships. Just after graduating, he won a silver medal in the 400 meters at the 2015 CARIFTA Games.
Benjamin wanted to run for the USA, since he was born in New York, but at the 2013 World Youth Championships in Athletics, he represented Antigua in the 400 m hurdles.
In 2017, the IAAF suspended all transfers of allegiance, meaning Benjamin could not represent the United States until transfers were reinstated in summer 2018. In October 2018, Benjamin's transfer request was approved, allowing him to represent the United States abroad and compete in USATF Championship events.
At the 2018 Meeting Areva in Paris, he ran 19.99 in the 200 meters to take .65 of a second off his previous personal best. He became the 72nd person to break 20 seconds, in what is perhaps his third best event on the track.
At the 2019 Mt. SAC Relays, that year at El Camino College in Torrance, California, Benjamin joined his training partner and previous college teammate, Michael Norman running the 400 meters. Benjamin ran his personal best of 44.31, the 50th best time in history behind Norman's 43.45, which turned out to be the fastest 400 runs in the 2019 season and tied him as the 4th fastest of all time.
College career
Benjamin is a three-time NCAA Division I track champion. As a college student-athlete, Benjamin earned three Pac-12 conference titles, one Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title, and eight NCAA Division I All-America honors (five outdoor, three indoor).
Benjamin's All-America honors were for these accomplishments:
2016 indoor, as part of a seventh-place team finish in the indoors distance medley relay, with a time of 9:34.9.
2016 outdoor, for a sixth-place finish in the 400-meter hurdles in 49.82.
2017 outdoor, for a second-place finish in the 400-meter hurdles in 48.33, and as part of a team finish of 39.89 in the 4x100m relay.
2018 indoor, for a third-place finish in the 200m, and as part of a team that set a college indoor track record of 3:00.77 in the 4x400m relay.
2018 outdoor, as part of a team that won the 4x400m relay in 2:59.00, and for a college record time of 47.02 in the 400m hurdles. His time equalled Edwin Moses's for the second fastest time in history.
Personal life
Benjamin is the son of West Indies international and Antiguan cricketer Winston Benjamin.

Trengereid is a local stop on the Bergen Line. It is located far east in Bergen, Norway, in the Arna borough on the shore of the fjord Sørfjord. The station is between Takvam and Bogegrend stations, at an elevation of above sea level.
Overview
The station was opened when the Bergen-Voss railway line Vossebanen was opened in 1883.
To the south of the station, up on the mountain slope, is the small Trengereid residential neighborhood. Below the station, facing the fjord on the north are the old Trengereid factories, service buildings and docking facilities.
The station is served by all local trains running between Voss and Bergen's main railway station, but express trains do not stop here.
The track layout at Trengereid is somewhat unusual. Originally, the station had only a single track, the topography at the site, with a steep slope to the south and a body of water to the north, made it difficult to add a second track. The line eastwards went in a curve around the mountain shelf. In 1955 a second track was added at the station by building a tunnel on the east side of the station, this became the main line. The station has two platforms, but only the platform next to the tunnel, where trains can stop without blocking the single track part of the platform, is in use for embarking and disembarking. The station building was designed by Balthazar Lange.

The Governor of Ağrı (Turkish: Ağrı Valiliği) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Ağrı. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Ağrı is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Ağrı. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Ağrı provincial police force and the Ağrı Gendarmerie.
Appointment
The Governor of Ağrı is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Ağrı is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Ağrı.
Term limits
The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Ağrı, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Ağrı Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career.
Functions
The Governor of Ağrı has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

The Pulong Tau National Park () is a national park in the Kelabit Highlands of Sarawak, Malaysia, on the island of Borneo.
Etymology
In Lun Bawang and Kelabit dialects, Pulong Tau means "our forests", which signifies the pride of the indigenous people on their forests heritage.
History
The concept of a national park in this region was started as a community initiative in the 1970s. In 1984, Sarawak's National Parks & Wildlife Office submitted a formal proposal together with a petition letter from the local community to the Sarawak state government. The proposal called for a 164,500-hectare park that included Mount Murud (Sarawak's highest peak), the twin peaks of Bukit Batu Lawi, the Tama Abu mountain range, including the water catchment area of the entire northern Sarawak. Between 1984 and 1987, the Sarawak cabinet approved the proposal but the boundaries need to be redrawn to avoid conflicts with areas designated for land development. In 1986, a population of eastern Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) was discovered. It was previously thought that such rhinoceros population would have extinct in Sarawak. During this survey, the importance of Laurel forest in maintaining bornean bearded pig population was recognised. Rafflesia flowers was also found at the base of Mount Murud. Orang utan was found to enter the park occasionally. Therefore, a second proposal in 1987 argued that these areas should be included within the boundaries of the park. By 1998, when the proclamation to create the park was passed, the proposed area has been reduced to 63,700 hectares and did not include either Batu Lawi, or the area where the rhinoceros was found.
When the national park was gazetted in 2005, the total protected areas was reduced to 59,917 hectares which extends from western side of Kelabit highlands to Tama Abu range of mountains in the south and Mount Murud in the north.
Geography
The Kelabit Highlands is thought to developed from the rifted continental crust where water sediments were deposited before Borneo was separated from the mainland Eurasian plate. This is evidenced by the presence of evaporite and limestone found in the area. Evidence of folding and faulting along the NE-SW axis is also found in this area. The types of stones changes from oxidised iron and coal-bearing sandstones in the east of Kelabit highlands, to mudstone and limestone of the Kelabit highlands, and grey sandsones westwards in the Mount Murud region. Pulong Tau National Park covers the water catchment area of Baram, Belait, Limbang, Tutong, Trusan, and Padas rivers.
Biodiversity
The national park's vegetation varies with soil type, altitude and topography. It includes upper mixed dipterocarp forest, oak-laurel forest, heath forest (kerangas), mossy elfin forest rich in Rhododendron species. The boundaries of these vegetation types are not distinct but there is certain degree of overlapping between them. There are many species of orchids and Nepenthes pitcher plants. During an expedition in 1998, a total of 67 species of birds from 29 families, of which 13 species (19.4%) are endemic to Borneo was recorded. Examples were Mountain Imperial Pigeons, Chestnut Crested Yuhina, and Blacknest Swifelet. Meanwhile, bird species found at the peaks of Mount Murud and Batu Lawi were Ochraceous Bulbul, and Mountain Blackeye. Besides, 28 species of mammals, 12 of which are endemic to Borneo was also recorded. Examples were: Mountain Giant Rat (Sundamys infraluteus), Summit Rat (Rattus baluensis), and Civet. In addition to that, 18 species of frogs and four species of snakes discovered. Examples were: Wagler's Pit Viper (Trimeresurus wagleri), and Golden legged bush frog (Philautus aurantium).

Shane Clifton Clements (28 June 1958 – 22 April 2001) was an Australian cricketer who played several seasons for Western Australia during the early 1980s.
From Perth, Clements played several matches at colts level in 1975, but did not make his senior debut until late in the 1981–82 season, when he played one match each in the Sheffield Shield and McDonald's Cup competitions. In his inaugural first-class match, a Sheffield Shield game against Queensland, he scored two half-centuries (73 and 86), and featured in opening partnerships of 127 and 171 with Geoff Marsh. Clements was a somewhat-regular selection at state level for the following three seasons. Alternating between the middle order and the opening positions, he played four matches during the 1982–83 Sheffield Shield season, averaging 26.33 with the highest score of 45.
The 1983–84 season was Clements' most successful, with his seven matches producing 480 runs at an average of 40.00, including one century and three half-centuries. The century, his only at first-class level, was an innings of 151 runs against Tasmania at the NTCA Ground in February 1984, which The Sydney Morning Herald said was "business-like" in comparison to "the flamboyant attitude" he had effected previously. Clements' 1984–85 season was less fruitful, with selectors preferring to trial Rob Gartrell, Peter Gonnella, and Gary Ireland in the middle order at various points during the season. His contributions at List A level remained limited, and he was not selected for Western Australia after that season. Clements committed suicide in April 2001, dying at the age of 42.

Rudi Domidian (born 5 June 1954) is a German artist, who calls himself "Hundefaenger", creating installation art and land art, which he photographs.
Early life
Karl Rudi Domidian was born in Bad Kreuznach. He spent a lot of time in nearby woods, liked to draw. At the age of 17 he walked alone through Scotland. His parents did not support an artistic , but a commercial career. At the age of 23 he organized his first exhibition.
Career
Domidian had his own studio at the age of 27. In 1984, aged 30, he liberated himself with Joseph Beuys' idea of human interactions as social sculpture. His first campaign was to hike the Pyrenees with friends, creating stone circles and to accept this as art.
In 1994, he met his wife Marion, a psychology student, and relocated to Bochum, Wuppertal and Norderney where she was studying. He worked odd temporary jobs, for example in exhibition stand construction, as warehouse clerk, as a toilet man with Opel. He surprised his employer asking for vacation to accept an invitation to attend an exhibition of his work in Korea.
In 2004, he moved to Sigmaringen, where his wife was employed at the hospital, and explored the woods, where he has been laying stone circles, suspending snail shells and arranging found wood. He has called these markings acts of "small anarchy", which cause confrontations with forest workers. His art collides with the demonstration of power by the local mainstream sculpture of the Hohenzollern, owner of the forest.
With the arrival of refugees in Germany in 2015/ 2016 Domidian received an assignment to create a sculpture with found wood. Unlike his installations in the forest, which decay by themselves, he was ordered to remove them for fear that the wood poles could be used as weapons.
Work
From 2002-2015 he created numerous installations, as listed on Domidian´s website.
Exhibitions:
2015. "Roundabout", Weingarten
2016. "Houses of the Holy IV", installation boathouse Sigmaringen.
2016. "landart", 20 years of twin cities Sigmaringen - Feldkirch

Photo book „shit art by birds“ - Art Zines (antipodes 09), V.E.B. Freie Brandstiftung (2016).
Personal life
In 2004, he and his wife settled in an apartment in Sigmaringen. In 2014 his wife died.
He is a board member of the Schwäbischer Albverein, where he is a speaker and coordinator of hiking and trail maintenance.

Tumebacillus is a genus of Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming bacteria. Members of the genus can be motile or non-motile, and form white or yellow colonies on R2A agar.
The genus was first proposed in 2008 from the discovery of a potentially 5000-7000 year-old bacterium from Canadian high arctic permafrost, which would become the type strain of the genus T. permanentifrigoris. The genus name was derived from Latin tume (from tumefacere, to make swollen) and bacillus (small rod), referring to the swollen sporangia produced by T. permanentifrigoris and the shape of the cells.
Members of this genus have been isolated from arctic permafrost, soil samples, cassava wastewater, decomposing algal scum, river water, and the gut of a vulture. Tumebacillus was found during surveys of nasal airways of infants, an underground subway in Norway, and a mountain observatory in Austria.

The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)

The UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) is a card issued by the NHS Business Services Authority on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions in the United Kingdom. It is issued free of charge to anyone covered by the social security system of the United Kingdom and provides evidence of entitlement to the provision of healthcare services under the UK's reciprocal healthcare agreements with the European Union and Switzerland. It is also accepted by Australia as proof of eligibility to enrol in Medicare.
Before January 2021, UK residents, students and European Economic Area/Switzerland-resident UK state pension recipients were entitled to a European Health Insurance Card. Under the terms of the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the UK and EU agreed that reciprocal healthcare provision would continue. The UK launched the Global Health Insurance Card in January 2021 to partially replace the EHIC for this purpose. The UK continues to accept the EU's EHIC and issue EHIC cards to certain individuals who maintain entitlement under previous treaties with the EEA and Switzerland.
Despite its name, it is valid in fewer countries than the EHIC. Because similar reciprocal healthcare agreements have not yet been formed between the UK and the EEA EHIC participants, the GHIC is not currently valid in Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein. However, the UK is currently negotiating arrangements with these countries, and British citizens can continue to receive reciprocal care in Norway with only their passport.
Like the EHIC, the GHIC only covers healthcare which is normally covered by a statutory health care system in the visited country, so the UK government still advises travellers to purchase travel insurance.
Background
The UK and European Union have a long history of reciprocal healthcare agreements. The UK's National Health Service was one of the first universal healthcare systems established anywhere in the world, influencing British dominions such as Australia who then formed reciprocal agreements for their citizens to receive treatment. The European Economic Community (EEC) also agreed in 1971 that members should provide social security services including healthcare to each other's residents, and the UK joined the EEC in 1973.
Entitlement to healthcare in the EEC and later EU is based on residence rather than citizenship, so a passport or national identity card is not sufficient evidence to prove entitlement to reciprocal care. For this reason, the European Commission made the decision in 2003 to create the European Health Insurance Card. As an EU member state, the UK issued this card to all entitled persons between 2004 and 2020. However, in 2020, the UK withdrew from the European Union, meaning that reciprocal healthcare elements of the EU and associated treaties with the EEA and Switzerland ceased to apply to the UK. Initial withdrawal agreements with those respective parties included some provision to continue to recognise EHIC cards for individuals with an entitlement pre-dating the UK's withdrawal from the European Single Market.
In December 2020, the UK and EU concluded the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which allowed for continued healthcare reciprocity and acceptance of EU-issued EHIC cards. The UK opted to begin issuing its own card as evidence for individuals covered by the UK system. The intention is that this new "Global Health Insurance Card" will ultimately be used not only for European reciprocal care, but also reciprocal care agreements with other countries that the UK signs treaties with.
In September 2021, an agreement was reached in principle on social security coordination with Switzerland, which includes re-establishment of reciprocal healthcare recognising the GHIC scheme. This came in to effect in 2022.
Appearance
The appearance of the UK Global Health Insurance Card is derived from the previously issued European Health Insurance Card to facilitate ease of acceptance within the EU. All EHIC fields used on the UK-issued EHIC have been carried over in the same format, however the field numbering system of the EHIC common model have been removed. Fields include:
Name (family names)
Given names
Date of birth
Personal identification number (a number that remains consistent across all UK EHICs and GHICs issued to an individual)
Identification number of the issuing institution (usually 0001 for the Department for Work and Pensions)
Identification number of the card (a number unique to each GHIC issued)
The background of the card consists of a British union flag design and a hologram is fixed on the upper right corner. Where the applicant lives in Northern Ireland, the card can optionally be issued with a plain blue background.
A provisional paper GHIC can also be issued by the UK in urgent circumstances provided that it is signed and sealed by a relevant UK government institution.
Eligibility
Eligibility for the GHIC
Those eligible for a GHIC include:
British and Irish citizens habitually resident in the UK;
All other citizens resident in the UK with valid leave to remain;
Recipients of a UK state pension living in the EU or Switzerland;
Students normally resident in the UK but currently undertaking study or a work placement in the EU or Switzerland;
Workers normally resident in the UK but temporarily posted abroad by their employer.
Anyone with a currently valid UK-issued EHIC does not need to apply for a GHIC until it expires.
Eligibility for a UK-issued EHIC
Those who remain eligible for a UK-issued EHIC include:
EU, Swiss, Norwegian, Icelandic or Liechtenstein citizens living in the UK since before 1 January 2021 (and their dependents);
Recipients of a UK state pension living in the EU registered on form S1 or E121 (and their dependents);
Frontier workers working across the UK border since before 1 January 2021 and registered on form S1 or E106 (and their dependents);
Workers normally resident in the UK but temporarily posted abroad by their employer in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein since before 1 January 2021 (and their dependents);
Students normally resident in the UK but currently undertaking study or a work placement in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein since before 1 January 2021.
Acceptance outside Europe
The UK also has reciprocal healthcare agreements with Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, New Zealand, Serbia, the British Crown Dependencies of the Isle of Man and Jersey and the British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Saint Helena and the Turks and Caicos Islands.
The eligibility rules for each of these agreements may differ from GHIC eligibility, and the scope of treatment offered may also differ from that in the UK-EU GHIC agreement. However, some of these countries now accept the GHIC as evidence of entitlement to their respective bilateral scheme:
- GHIC and UK EHIC is accepted when presented with a British or Irish passport or a valid UK residence visa. The bearer is eligible to enrol in Medicare.

Gangarampur is a community development block that forms an administrative division in Gangarampur subdivision of Dakshin Dinajpur district in the Indian state of West Bengal.
History
Dinajpur district was constituted in 1786. In 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal. The new Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948. In order to restore territorial links between northern and southern parts of West Bengal which had been snapped during the partition of Bengal, and on the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission a portion of the erstwhile Kishanganj subdivision comprising Goalpokhar, Islampur and Chopra thanas (police stations) and parts of Thakurganj thana, along with the adjacent parts of the erstwhile Gopalpur thana in Katihar subdivision were transferred from Purnea district in Bihar to West Bengal in 1956, and were formally incorporated into Raiganj subdivision in West Dinajpur. The township of Kishanganj and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. With the introduction of the Community Development Programme in 1960-61, community development blocks were set up in West Dinajpur district.

AirHop Communications is a privately funded American corporation based in San Diego, CA. AirHop develops radio access network (RAN) software that addresses the installation, operation and performance challenges of multi-layer deployments of small cells in 3G and 4G networks. AirHop's customers are typically base station equipment vendors for wireless network operators.
Technology
AirHop holds 20 patent applications for its eSON™ self-organizing network (SON) software. eSON enables carriers to build a 3G or 4G LTE heterogeneous network (“het-net”) to augment existing macro base stations. Many carriers are using small cells and self-organizing networks to fill in gaps in 3G and 4G networks due to signal attenuation and add capacity.
The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defined a SON specification to allow base stations to discover each other when inserted into a network and to adjust their radio frequency (RF) signal strength to avoid overlap and interference. AirHop was founded to extend this technology beyond initial network start-up to also provide ongoing interference management and spectrum reuse. This gives carriers the ability to both initialize the network and ongoing RAN intelligence to adjust signal levels as small cells come online and overlap with each other. eSON also optimizes spectrum reuse (spectral efficiency), enabling macrocells and small cells to share the same spectrum without interference (communication).
History
AirHop was founded in 2007 by three engineers in charge of 3G research and development at Texas Instruments. They foresaw that the present wireless network infrastructure would have to change as part of the move to 4G technologies to support mobile broadband. They left TI in October 2007 to begin developing SON software.
The company announced a $1 million investment in September 2009 and added several wireless industry executives to its management team. AirHop showcased the first of its 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) solutions by running an HD video transmission demonstration on Texas Instruments' TCI1648x DSP at CTIA – The Wireless Association in March 2009. In November 2009, the company announced its first product, eSON, and in February 2010, AirHop partnered with Continuous Computing and picoChip at Mobile World Congress 2010 to demonstrate a reference design for eSON based on picoChip's High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) platform. In October 2010, AirHop and picoChip announced the integration of eSON with picoChip's 3G PC302 evolved HSPA (HSPA+) platform. AirHop and Argela demonstrated eSON on a commercial 3G femtocell at Mobile World Congress in February 2011 and its first 4G/LTE customer was announced in May with the introduction of Wazco's Metrostorm .
Industry recognition
AirHop has received industry recognition for its technology. The company was named to Light Reading Mobile's list of Top Ten Startups to Watch in 2011, was named a FierceWireless Fierce 15 Top Wireless Company for 2010 and earned the Telecom Council of Silicon Valley SPIFFY Award for Most Disruptive Technology in 2011.

Leaf Brands, LLC is a candy company based in Newport Coast, Newport Beach, California. The original Leaf International (also known as the "Leaf Candy Company") started in the 1940s. Leaf International was once the fourth largest candy producer in North America, producing such products as Whoppers, Jolly Rancher, Milk Duds, Rain-Blo bubble gum, the Heath bar and PayDay, before it sold the U.S. division to The Hershey Company in 1996 and left the United States.
In 2011, the company was revived, and the newly re-formed company made its official debut at the 2011 Sweets & Snacks Expo. Ellia Kassoff, the nephew of Ed Leaf, (possibly a relative of Sol S. Leaf, the founder of Leaf Candy Company), is the CEO. The company registered the Hydrox trademark which had been abandoned by former owner Kellogg's, and re-created the brand of cookies, similar to Oreos, which had been out of production since 1999. Leaf Brands began selling the product through Amazon Marketplace in September 2015.

Philip Jeremiah Schuyler (January 21, 1768 – February 21, 1835) was an American politician from New York. His siblings included Angelica Schuyler, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, and Margarita Schuyler Van Rensselaer.
Life
He was the son of Revolutionary War General Philip Schuyler (1733–1804) and Catherine Van Rensselaer (1734–1803). The Schuyler family were intermarried with other prominent New York families, including the Van Cortlandts and Livingstons, and his relatives included uncle Jeremiah Van Rensselaer. Alexander Hamilton, John Barker Church, and Stephen Van Rensselaer were all his brothers-in-law. He received his education through private tutors.
Career
Schuyler came to Rhinebeck in 1796 and in 1800 erected a mansion he called "The Grove".
From there he managed farms and estates throughout upstate New York which were owned by his and his wife's families. Schuyler served in the New York Militia and attained the rank of major before resigning in 1799. He returned to service with the War of 1812, during which he held the rank of colonel.
He was a member of the New York State Assembly, serving in the 21st New York State Legislature, representing Dutchess County, and in the 22nd New York State Legislature, representing Albany County. He was elected as a Federalist to the 15th United States Congress, holding office from March 4, 1817, to March 3, 1819.
Personal life
Schuyler married Sarah Rutsen (1770–1803), daughter of John Rutsen (1743–1771) and a descendant of Wilhelmus Beekman, and inheritor of a large portion of the Beekman Patent, which encompassed much of what is now Dutchess County. Together, they had:
Philip P. Schuyler (1789–1875), who married Rosanna Livingston
Stephen Van Rensselaer Schuyler (1792–1859), who married Catherine Morris
Catherine Schuyler (1793–1875), who married Samuel Jones (1770–1853)
John Rutsen Schuyler (1796–1875)
Robert Schuyler (1798–1855), who married Lucinda Wood (1807–1882), an 1817 graduate of Harvard and railroad speculator/embezzler.
After his first wife died, he married Mary Anna Sawyer (1786–1852) of Newburyport, Massachusetts. She was a daughter of Micajah Sawyer (1737–1817), a founding member of American Academy of Arts and Sciences and Sibyl Farnham (1747-1842). Together, they had:
William Schuyler (1807–1829)
Sybil Schuyler (1809–1813)
George Lee Schuyler (1811–1890), who married Eliza Hamilton (1811–1863), daughter of James Hamilton. After her death, he married Eliza's sister, Mary Morris Hamilton (1815-1877)
He died of tuberculosis, and was buried at New York Marble Cemetery. His remains were later moved to the Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery.
His home, an estate he called The Grove, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.
Descendants
Through his youngest son George, he was the grandfather of General Philip Schuyler (1836–1906). Schuyler was a prominent society figure who was featured in Ward McAllister's famous The Four A Hundred.

The Enchantress was a 19th-century racing yacht, winner of several national and international Cups including the Royal Yacht Squadron's regatta around the Le Havre to Southampton, and the New York Yacht Club's regatta from Owl's Head Point to Sandy Hook Lightship. She was designed by Robert Fish for George L. Lorillard.
Enchantress's origins
In 1871, the Enchantress was modeled, in New York, by Captain Robert Fish (1812-1883) for George L. Lorillard. She has had several owners (see subsequent owners below). The Enchantress was built by shipbuilder Samuel H. Pine of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. She was berthed at the New York Yacht Club and sailed by Captain Reuben King. Fish designed hundreds of vessels of all sizes, including the Truant, Challenge, Eva, and the Meteor. Her model resides at the New York Yacht Club.
Captain
The Enchantress was captained by Reuben King, the first mate, William Dand, and the Sandy Hook Pilot, Peter W. Roff. There were 18 crew members. Joseph F. Loubat, of the New York Yacht Club, wrote about the Enchantress and Robert Fish in a yachting memoir, A Yachtsman's Scrap Book, or the Ups and Downs of Yacht Racing.
Cape May challenge cup ocean race
On October 9, 1873, the Enchantress was one of the boats that participated in the New York Yacht Club ocean regatta, which was a yacht race from Owl's Head Point around to Cape May Lighthouse in New Jersey, and back to the Sandy hook Lightship. Both yachts and pilot boats were entered in the race. The Enchantress was the winning yacht for the Bennett Cup, valued at $1,000. The pilot-boat Thomas S. Negus won second place and James W. Elwell which came in third place.
The name "Bennett Cup" came from James Gordon Bennett who was the commodore of the New York Yacht Club. At this time, Joseph F. Loubat was the owner, Captain Robert Fish (designer), Reuben King (master), and Sandy Hook Pilot Peter W. Roff were on board the Enchantress in the race.
International English yacht race
Anchored off Stapleton, Staten Island, the Enchantress was overhauled with new rigging, spars and sails to prepare her for the trip across the Atlantic to England. On December 1, 1873, the Enchantress arrived at Cowes, England from New York. On February 15, 1874, Fish left on the steamer Herman to Cowes where he took command of the Enchantress. On July 25, 1874, the Enchantress won the Royal Yacht Squadron's regatta around the Le Havre to Southampton and brought home the Cape May Cup. The Enchantress was commanded by Captain Poland.
Prince of Wales's challenge cup yacht race
On August 8, 1874, the Enchantress entered the Prince of Wales cup race from Cowes around the Shambles Lightship, and back around to Nab, passing the Isle of Wight to Cowes. The race was for American and English schooners and yawls of 100 tons or more. The Enchantress was listed as 320 tons and the owner was Joseph F. Loubat. After a series of mishaps, the Enchantress returned to Cowes.
Other races
Loubat Ocean Cup Race - October, 1876: from Owl's Head Point back to the Sandy hook Lightship
Cup May Race - September, 1877: to Cape May Lighthouse and return to Sandy Hook
Out of service
On February 22, 1922, the yacht Enchantress was not commissioned during the financial year 1922-23 and was decommissioned in Portsmouth Harbour.
Subsequent owners
In 1871, Loubat sold the Enchantress to George L. Lorillard.
In 1873, Loubat bought back the Enchantress from George L. Lorillard.
On October 6, 1877, Loubat sold the Enchantress to Major Owen Williams.
In 1879, the Enchantress was sold in England.

In mathematics, the Pfeffer integral is an integration technique created by Washek Pfeffer as an attempt to extend the Henstock–Kurzweil integral to a multidimensional domain. This was to be done in such a way that the fundamental theorem of calculus would apply analogously to the theorem in one dimension, with as few preconditions on the function under consideration as possible. The integral also permits analogues of the chain rule and other theorems of the integral calculus for higher dimensions.
Definition
The construction is based on the Henstock or gauge integral, however Pfeffer proved that the integral, at least in the one dimensional case, is less general than the Henstock integral. It relies on what Pfeffer refers to as a set of bounded variation, this is equivalent to a Caccioppoli set. The Riemann sums of the Pfeffer integral are taken over partitions made up of such sets, rather than intervals as in the Riemann or Henstock integrals. A gauge is used, exactly as in the Henstock integral, except that the gauge function may be zero on a negligible set.
Properties
Pfeffer defined a notion of generalized absolute continuity , close to but not equal to the definition of a function being , and proved that a function is Pfeffer integrable if it is the derivative of an function. He also proved a chain rule for the Pfeffer integral. In one dimension his work as well as similarities between the Pfeffer integral and the McShane integral indicate that the integral is more general than the Lebesgue integral and yet less general than the Henstock–Kurzweil integral.

He graduated from the Sorbonne and École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris and carried out his PhD under J. Jacques at the Collège de France. Subsequently, he was a research associate with A. Horeau. He then moved to Université Paris-Sud, Orsay where he is a emeritus professor. A landmark in his research was the development of C2-symmetric ligands, e.g., DIOP for asymmetric catalysis. This discovery led to the discovery of many related ligands that support catalysts used in a variety of practical applications.
Honors
Dr Kagan is a member of the French Academy of Sciences and has won many awards in the field including: Silver Medal of the French National Scientific Research Center, Prelog Medal, August-Wihelm-von Hoffman Medal, Nagoya Medal of Organic Chemistry, Tetrahedron Prize for Creativity in Organic Chemistry, Wolf Prize in Chemistry, Grand Prix de la Fondation de la Maison de la Chimie, Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur, JSPS Award for Eminent Scientists, Ryoji Noyori Prize, and the 2005 Benjamin Franklin Medal.
In 2001 controversy was caused when Kagan was not given the Nobel prize which had been shared by K. Barry Sharpless of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, Ryōji Noyori of Nagoya University, Japan, and William Knowles, formerly of Monsanto Company in St Louis, Missouri, for work on catalytic asymmetric synthesis. It was thought that as Kagan was one of the pioneers of the field he too should have been honoured. However, as the prize can be given to a maximum of three people he was left off.

Strategic alignment is a process that ensures an organization's structure, use of resources (and culture) support its strategy. "In its simplest form, organizational strategic alignment is lining up a business' strategy with its culture." Successful outcomes also require an awareness of the wider environment, regulatory issues and technological change. Strategic alignment contributes to improved performance by optimizing the operation of processes/systems, and the activities of teams and departments. Goal-setting theory supports the relevance of clear, measurable operational objectives that can be linked to superordinate goals. This helps ensure resources are used effectively.
The concept of strategic alignment is significant in the context of a global business environment where activities need to be coordinated across regions and time zones. Strategic alignment encompasses not only technical and functional activities, but also issues relating to human resource management (and how best to develop people's motivation and capability). Studies suggest that the alignment of business strategy and HR strategy can impact performance. The process may extend across organizations and groups that share complementary objectives, e.g. business partners. It has also been found that coalignment of business strategy, business structure, IT strategy, and IT structure contributes to performance.
Superordinate Principles
Creating operational alignment involves translating an organization's Superordinate Goals and overall strategy into the more immediate objectives of a team or department. In addition to reviewing systems and processes, leaders also need to develop the skills, competencies and motivation of people in the organization. The McKinsey 7s Framework provides an overview of this type of analysis, highlighting elements that contribute to alignment. This type of review, with follow-up interventions, contribute to key activities (linked to products and services) meeting customer and stakeholder expectations. At the same time, effective internal systems ensure the best use of resources, which contributes to future success.
Strategic Alignment requires awareness of Superordinate Principles that may include the 3BL "triple bottom line" perspective. This emphasizes criteria that take account of Planet, People & Profit (3P Thinking). It raises issues relating to Corporate Governance, which now include social and environmental considerations. KPMG makes the point: "Businesses not taking ESG seriously are beginning to lose customers, employees and financing; eventually they will become unviable."
There are two main models of corporate governance, (i) the shareholder model, which prioritizes the return on investment for investors, and (ii) the stakeholder model that also emphasizes a responsibility towards other groups and wider considerations. Guiding principles relating to Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) is at the heart of the new thinking.
Trevor and Varcoe
In an article in Harvard Business Review (May 2016), Jonathan Trevor and Barry Varcoe suggest two questions. This prompt reflection on strategic alignment.
How well does your business strategy support the fulfilment of your company's purpose?
How well does your organization support the achievement of your business strategy?
Findings suggest that both elements contribute to performance. The article notes that (alignment) 'also leads to a more positive work climate, above-average staff engagement, a strong commitment to values and few(er) energy-sapping turf wars and in-fighting'. (ibid)

Salwa Bakr (born 1949) is an Egyptian critic, novelist and author. She was born in the Matariyya district in Cairo in 1949. Her father was a railway worker. She studied business at Ain Shams University, gaining a BA degree in 1972. She went on to earn another BA in literary criticism in 1976, before embarking on a career in journalism. She worked as a film and theatre critic for various Arabic newspapers and magazines. Bakr lived in Cyprus for a few years with her husband before returning to Egypt in the mid-1980s.
Bakr's father died early, leaving her mother a poor widow. Her work often deals with the lives of the impoverished and the marginalized. In his collection of short stories by Arab writers, the Serbian literary critic Srpko Leštarić wrote: "Part of Salwa Bakr's popularity lies in her being a counterforce to the conservative voices which challenge her work because they feel threatened by it." In particular, many of her stories deal with the problems of women of different social levels in Egyptian society, as exemplified in the stories told by women inmates of a prison in her novel The Golden Chariot.
In 1985, she published her first collection of short stories, Zinat at the President's Funeral, which was an immediate success. She has published several collections of short stories and novels since. Her debut novel of 1993 was called Wasf al-Bulbul (The Description of the Nightingale).
Translations
Several of Bakr's books and stories have been translated into various European languages, including English, German, Spanish, French or Polish. Her work has appeared in Banipal magazine, Words Without Borders, and in a number of English-language anthologies.
Single-volume English translations of her work include:
The Man from Bashmour, American Univ in Cairo Press, 2007 - translated by Nancy Roberts
The Golden Chariot, American Univ in Cairo Press, 2008 - translated by Dinah Manisty
The Wiles of Men and Other Stories, University of Texas Press, 1993 - translated by Denys Johnson-Davies
Such a Beautiful Voice, General Egyptian Book Organization, 1992 - translated by Hoda El Sadda
Awards and reception
The Man from Bashmour was named as one of the 100 best Arabic novels by the Arabic Writers' Union. In 1993, she won the German Deutsche Welle Prize for Literature. Notwithstanding her relatively few novels or collections of short stories, she is highly regarded in Arab literary circles.

Paul Brousse (; 23 January 18441 April 1912) was a French socialist, leader of the possibilistes group. He was active in the Jura Federation, a section of the International Working Men's Association (IWMA), from the northwestern part of Switzerland and the Alsace. He helped edit the Bulletin de la Fédération Jurassienne, along with anarchist Peter Kropotkin. He was in contact with Gustave Brocher between 1877 and 1880, who became anarchist under Brousse's influence. Paul Brousse edited two newspapers, one in French and another in German. He helped James Guillaume publish its bulletin.
Paul Brousse studied medicine and travelled to Barcelona in his youth. He then joined the IWMA and participated to the Geneva Congress in September 1873, seeing anarchism as the only possible social organization. On 18 March 1877 he took part in Bern in a demonstration in remembrance of the 1871 Paris Commune, which ended in riots with the police. Paul Brousse was subsequently condemned to one month of prison. In 1877 he published (initially anonymously) the revolutionary song Le drapeau rouge (known in English as The Standard of Revolt). On 15 April 1879 he was again sentenced to two months of prison, then expelled from Switzerland for having published an article in L'Avant-Garde which legitimized the propaganda of the deed attempts of Giovanni Passannante, Juan Oliva Moncasi, Max Hödel and Karl Nobiling.
Paul Brousse returned to France in 1880 and progressively became more reformist. He began to take part in the French Workers' Party (POF) and then, after a scission, to the Federation of the Socialist Workers of France (FTSF), which became known as the "possibilists". He voted at the 1896 international congress in London along with Jules Guesde for the expulsion of the "anti-authoritarian socialists", as were known the anarchists. The possibilists then joined Jean Jaurès's French Socialist Party in 1902, which fused with others movements in 1905 to create the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO).

The Dana Open Presented By Marathon, is a women's professional golf tournament on the LPGA Tour. It was founded in 1984 and has been played yearly, except in 1986 and 2011, in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb northwest of Toledo. The tournament is televised by Golf Channel.
History
The tournament was founded after PGA Tour caddie Judd Silverman, a Toledo native, sought to bring a ladies professional golf tournament to his hometown. He contacted sponsors and actor Jamie Farr, also a Toledo native, brought his name and several of his celebrity friends to the tournament. Throughout the history of the event, children's charities in Northwest Ohio and Southern Michigan have been the charitable beneficiaries of the tournament. They have received more than $13 million during the event's history.
From 2004 to 2010, the title sponsor was Owens Corning, the world's largest manufacturer of fiberglass and related products, headquartered in Toledo, near the site of the tournament. In 2012, they became a presenting sponsor. Kroger, one of the largest American supermarket chains, with headquarters in Cincinnati, has also been involved as a sponsor of the tournament since 1997. Owens-Illinois (O-I) became a sponsor in 2012.
From 1984 to 1988, the tournament was held in the village of Holland at Glengarry Country Club which became Stone Oak Country Club The event moved several miles north in 1989 to its current home, Highland Meadows Golf Club in Sylvania, just south of the Michigan state line.
The largest playoff in LPGA history took place at the 1999 Jamie Farr, a six-player affair involving Karrie Webb, Carin Koch, Sherri Steinhauer, Se Ri Pak, Kelli Kuehne, and Mardi Lunn. Defending champion Pak won it on first hole of sudden death, sinking a birdie putt.
In 2007, Pak won the Farr for the fifth time, becoming only the fourth player on the LPGA Tour to win the same tournament five times.
The tournament was at risk of ending after 2009, due to a variety of circumstances including the slumping worldwide economy and reported dissatisfaction with LPGA Commissioner Carolyn Bivens. Late in August 2009, after Bivens had resigned under pressure, it was announced that the tournament would continue for at least one more year, albeit with a sharply reduced purse.
On June 29, 2010, LPGA Commissioner Michael Whan announced the Farr Classic would return for at least three more years beginning in 2012. The tournament took a one-year hiatus in 2011, as the Toledo area hosted the U.S. Senior Open, a major championship on the Champions Tour, at the Inverness Club in late July. A similar break occurred in 1986, when the PGA Championship was at Inverness in August.
On December 2, 2011, tournament director Judd Silverman announced that the Jamie Farr Classic would have a new name and a new logo; it became the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic Presented by Kroger, Owens Corning and O-I. On January 8, 2013, the LPGA announced that Marathon Petroleum was replacing Jamie Farr as the title sponsor. In 2016, the event received broadcast network coverage for the first time when CBS Sports televised the final round live.

"Pan American" is a song written and recorded by Hank Williams. It was his final single on Sterling Records after moving to MGM in April 1947.
Background
"Pan American" was Williams' attempt to rewrite Roy Acuff's immensely popular version of the Carter Family's "Wabash Cannonball." Along with the church, Acuff was arguably Williams' biggest musical influence; in 1952 he insisted to Ralph Gleason, "He's the biggest singer this music ever knew. You booked him and you didn't worry about crowds. For drawing power in the South, it was Roy Acuff, then God."
"Pan American" was about the Pan American Clipper, a train that ran daily on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad from Cincinnati to New Orleans via Montgomery, highballing it through Greenville and other small towns that Hank knew well. The song was recorded in Nashville with Fred Rose producing. Williams was backed by Tommy Jackson (fiddle), Dale "Smokey" Lohman (steel guitar), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), and Louis Innis (bass). The single did not chart.

Terence Alister Shand (October 1, 1904 – November 11, 1977) was an American pianist, vocalist, bandleader and songwriter.
Biography
Terry Shand was born in Uvalde, Texas. He started his career by 1920, playing piano at the Kelly Field Hostess Club, where his mother was manager, and then toured with such musicians as Jack Teagarden, Wingy Manone and Muggsy Spanier. Around 1930, he joined Freddy Martin's orchestra, before forming his own band later in the decade and recording for Decca Records.
He was also a prolific and respected songwriter. Among his compositions are "I'm Gonna Lock My Heart (And Throw Away the Key)", co-written with Jimmy Eaton and first recorded by Billie Holiday in 1938; "Dance with a Dolly (With a Hole in Her Stocking)", written with Eaton and Mickey Leader, and first recorded by Tony Pastor in 1940; and "You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry", written with Bob Merrill. The latter song was recorded in 1950 by Jimmy Dorsey's Orchestra, with Shand on vocals, and most successfully by English vocal duo The Caravelles in 1963.
His wife, Violet Ott ( Gossett, 1902–1983), collaborated on some of his compositions and toured with him. He lived for most of his life in Texas, New Mexico, and Miami, Florida. He died in hospital in Houston in 1977, aged 73.

Flavius Anthemius (Greek: Άνθέμιος, 400–414) was a statesman of the Later Roman Empire. He is notable as a praetorian prefect of the East in the later reign of Arcadius and the first years of Theodosius II, during which time he led the government of the Eastern Roman Empire on behalf of the child emperor and supervised the construction of the first set of the Theodosian Walls.
Biography
Anthemius was the grandson of Flavius Philippus, praetorian prefect of the East in 346. He rose to prominence during the reign of Arcadius, when he was appointed comes sacrarum largitionum ("Count of the Sacred Largesses") around or in 400 and later magister officiorum ("Master of the Offices") in 404. He occupied the latter position during the disturbances which followed John Chrysostom's final deposition from the patriarchate (Easter, 404). John's enemies demanded troops from him with which to disperse the crowd. At first he refused, but then yielded, declaring that they were responsible for the consequences.
In 405 he was appointed consul for the Eastern Roman Empire (with Stilicho as a colleague for the Western Empire). After the death of the Augusta Eudoxia he succeeded Eutychianus in the same year as praetorian prefect of the East, becoming thus the second most powerful man in the Eastern Empire after the Emperor himself. On April 28, 406, he was elevated to the rank of patricius. The esteem in which he was held by some can be seen from Chrysostom's letter of congratulations to him on his appointment to the praetorian prefecture, saying that "the office was more honoured by his tenure than he by the office". During the remaining years of Arcadius' reign he tried to maintain the autonomy and integrity of the Eastern Empire despite continuous challenges. According to some Eastern sources antagonistic to Stilicho, the Western general desired to take over the prefecture of Illyricum from the East. At the same time, Anthemius had to deal with the presence of Alaric I and his Gothic people in the Illyricum, and the continued insurgency of the Isaurians, who were devastating the southern provinces of Asia Minor. Furthermore, Anthemius passed a number of new laws against paganism, Judaism and heresy.
When Arcadius died in 408, his son and successor Theodosius II was a child of seven years. Anthemius assumed leadership, and showed remarkable longevity as praetorian prefect. He initiated a new peace treaty with Sassanid Persia, and, thanks also to Stilicho's death, was able to contribute in restoring harmony in the relations of the Imperial courts of Constantinople and Ravenna. He strengthened the fleet of the Danube, which protected the provinces of Moesia and Scythia, after the successful repulsion of an invasion in 409 by the Hunnic king Uldin.
He furthermore regulated the grain supply of Constantinople, which came chiefly from Egypt and was under the authority of the urban prefect. In the past, shortages had occurred due to the lack of available ships, resulting in famines, the most recent one being in 408. In 409 therefore, Anthemius reorganized the grain transport and granted tax remits to the transporters, took measures to procure grain from elsewhere, and created an emergency fund for the procurement and distribution of corn to the citizens. He also took measures to ensure the regular collection of taxes (409), but in 414, he also gave a tax remit of all arrears for the years 368–407.
The one work of Anthemius' that is still standing today is the main wall of the Theodosian Walls. In the early 5th century, Constantinople had begun to outgrow the bounds set by Constantine the Great, and so Anthemius initiated the construction of a new wall, about 1,500 m westwards from the old one, which stretched for 6.5 kilometers between the Sea of Marmara and the suburb of Blachernae near the Golden Horn. The extended new wall was completed in 413 and almost doubled the size of the city, a feat for which Bury later called him "in a sense, the second founder of Constantinople".
In 414, Anthemius suddenly disappeared from the scene, while the prefecture was assumed by Monaxius. His fate remains unknown; some historians postulate he was dismissed by Augusta Pulcheria, while other scholars argue he retired or died of old age. After his departure, however, his descendents still retained political power. Through his daughter's marriage to magister militum Procopius, he became maternal grandfather to the later Western Emperor Anthemius. He was also the father of Anthemius Isidorus, praetorian prefect of the East in 435-436 and Eastern Consul in 436. According to a legendary saint's life, he had a daughter named Apolinaria who lived as a monk.

Shree Krishna Gaarudi is 1958 Indian Kannada language film written and directed by Hunsur Krishnamurthy based on the story by Bellave Narahari Shastri. It narrates the tale of Bheema and Arjuna's pride being crushed by Krishna, after the Kurukshetra War.The bickering and squabbling among the Pandavas for portfolios allegorizes the politics in the then newly formed Mysore state. The movie was remade in Telugu in the same year by well-known director Y. V. Rao starring K.Jaggaiah also titled Shri Krishna Garudi .
Plot
The Kurukshetra War is over and Dharmaraya ascends the throne of Hastinavati. Dharmaraya distributes powers and Bheema and Arjuna are unhappy with the powers and responsibilities vested to them. They fume in private, that they were the reason for Pandavas victory in Kurukshetra War, but have to be subservient to nakula and sahadeva.
Sri Krishna senses this and disguises as Gaarudi, a street player, skilled in warfare. He reaches Hastinavati, challenging men to fight him. He gathers fame, as unbeatable warrior.
When news reaches Bheema and Arjuna, in a fit of rage, they challenge Gaarudi. Arjuna has to set a bow and fails. They get beaten, are pushed below earth and suffer indignity. Bheema has to fight a giant snake that has bound him and made immovable. Arjuna has to fight off a family and infamy. Both suffer, because of their pride and forgetting Lord Sri Krishna.
After what seems a long time, they pray to Krishna and are able to come over their agony.
When they reach their palace at Hastinavati, Lord Krishna informs them, it was he, as Gaarudi, who taught them the lesson.
Nakula and Sahadeva pray to Krishna, before starting the task and easily finish it off.
Shri Krishna's mighty power and bliss fills Bheema and Arjuna. They happily perform the duties, bestowed on them.
Songs by Pendyala Nageshwara Rao were popular.
Songs
Bombeyaatavayyaa song in the movie turned very popular. Penned by Hunasuru Krishna Murthy and sung by P. B. Sreenivas, the Song sung by Naarada in the movie, is the telling tale of the affairs of the World. It was reused in Rajkumar's 1987 movie Shruthi Seridaaga.

The grey-headed kingfisher (Halcyon leucocephala) is a species of kingfisher that has a wide distribution from the Cape Verde Islands off the north-west coast of Africa to Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia, east to Ethiopia, Somalia and southern Arabia and south to South Africa.
Taxonomy
The first formal description of the grey-headed kingfisher was by the German zoologist Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller in 1776. He coined the binomial name Alcedo leucocephala. The current genus Halcyon was introduced by the English naturalist and artist William John Swainson in 1821. The name of the genus is from the classical Greek alkuōn, a mythical bird, generally associated with the kingfisher. The specific epithet leucocephala is from the classical Greek leukos meaning "white" and -kephalos for "-headed".
Five subspecies are recognised:
H. l. acteon (Lesson, R, 1830) – Cape Verde Islands
H. l. leucocephala (Statius Müller, PL, 1776) – Senegal and Gambia to northwest Somalia, north Tanzania and north DR Congo
H. l. semicaerulea (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – south Arabian Peninsula
H. l. hyacinthina Reichenow, 1900 – southeast Somalia to Tanzania
H. l. pallidiventris Cabanis, 1880 – south DR Congo to northwest Tanzania and south to north South Africa
Description
The sexes are similar. The adult of the nominate race H. l. leucocephala has a pale grey head, black mantle and back, bright blue rump, wings and tail, and chestnut underparts. Subspecies H. l. pallidiventris has a darker grey head and paler chestnut underparts but is otherwise similar. The beak is long, red and sharp. This bird grows to an average length of . The song is a succession of notes, ascending, descending and then ascending again, becoming increasingly strident. The warning call is a series of sharp notes, "tchk, tchk, tchk, tchk".
Distribution and habitat
The grey-headed kingfisher is found in tropical and semi-tropical Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Its range includes Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Its typical habitat is woodland, scrub and cultivated areas, up to altitudes of about .
Ecology
A dry-country kingfisher of scrub and woodland, solitary or in pairs, often found near water, but unlike most kingfishers is not aquatic. Perches on a branch, unmoving for long periods while watching the ground for signs of insects or small lizards, bobbing head before diving on prey. In appearance very like the brown-hooded kingfisher but with a red rather than red and black bill and similar to the woodland kingfisher, but the woodland kingfisher lacks the chestnut belly and has greater coverage of cyan feathers on the back. Nests in holes in steep riverbanks and is aggressively protective of its nest by repeated dive-bombing of foraging monitor lizards. It is parasitised by the greater honeyguide. This species migrates at night and is often killed by flying into obstacles such as buildings, towers and powerlines.

Rock School is a 2005 documentary film about The Paul Green School of Rock Music.
History
Philadelphia based filmmaker Don Argott noticed colorful posters advertising concerts by the Paul Green School of Rock Music around the Philadelphia area, and contacted Green. He and his producing partner Sheena M. Joyce attended a concert featuring the music of Frank Zappa. Shortly after the concert began, Argott heard C.J. Tywoniak playing a guitar part that he "didn't think could be played" and decided he had to make a documentary.
They began shooting their documentary in January 2003, using money that DreamWorks had paid Argott for his musical contributions to the Will Ferrell comedy Old School. In the "fourth or fifth month" of the nine month shooting schedule, Argott and Joyce first heard of the Paramount film with Jack Black, a narrative film featuring a lead character who bore a strong resemblance to Green. One third of the $600,000 budget for the film was spent on music rights.
Synopsis
The film opens with the title card and the sound of Carlos Santana's guitar solo from the song "Black Magic Woman". Paul Green, the primary subject of the film introduces the evening's concert. The camera pans to reveal that the guitarist is twelve-year-old C.J. Tywoniak. The School is then introduced, with Green re-enacting a scene from the film The Silence of the Lambs as Jame Gumb for a group of students. This is followed by the first of a number of interview segments with Green throughout the film. He explains why he started a performance-based program. 9 year old twin boys Asa and Tucker Collins are interviewed, followed by an interview with Tywoniak and his parents about his future in music, teenage girl Madi Diaz-Svalgard, a Quaker singer/songwriter who frequently clashes with Green and finally Will O'Conner a less-successful student who credits the School with saving his life. These students are followed closely through the rest of the film.
Green talks about various students and then introduces the All-Star program, which is concentrating on the music of Frank Zappa, and including concert footage of the students playing a Zappa song. He then leads the camera on a tour of the School, dropping in on various classroom lessons including Asa trying to learn Black Sabbath's "The Wizard". The film moves to the Collins' home and introduces the twins' mother Andrea Collins, followed by O'Conner at home with his mother Lisa.
There is a montage of scenes of the students rehearsing for a beginner's Black Sabbath show, and an 80's show by the intermediate students, and interviews with other students including Eric and Julie Slick, and keyboard teacher Eric Svalgard, father of Madi Diaz. Green confesses that, if the school is successful, the students will become better musicians than himself, followed by his personal history and introduces his wife Lisa.
A clip of Zappa musician Napoleon Murphy Brock is played for the students, and Green talks about getting the students to play Zappa's notoriously difficult music. The All-Stars have been invited to play the annual Zappa music festival Zappanale. Green and various students are interviewed about the upcoming event.
Diaz is interviewed about a side project with her Quaker friends, the Friendly Gangstaz who rap traditional Quaker hymns, which Green mocks. Tywoniak's parents discuss their son's focus and drive. Andrea applies make-up to her son Tucker and dresses Asa's hair into the Mohawk hairstyle seen on the film poster in preparation for the twins' Black Sabbath show while singing the song "Sweet Leaf". Several Black Sabbath songs are performed at the concert including "Sweet Leaf", "Paranoid" and "Iron Man". Green delivers a ranting, profanity-laden halftime speech during the intermission of the show. On the commentary track, the directors reveal that the MPAA informed them that the film was rated R, and had 38 usages of the word "fuck". The location switches to Green's home and a scene with his infant son Walden, who dances enthusiastically to a Zappa song.
A title card reveals that Tywoniak had to undergo emergency orthopedic surgery two days before a concert. Green introduces him at the concert, revealing that Tywoniak would not undergo the operation unless he could play the concert. Back at the school, Green tells the students that Melissa Dribben, a reporter from the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper, is to do a feature story on the school. The article is critical of Green and his methods and O'Conner says that it "was written with the composition of a fourth grader". Dribben had called O'Conner "the sad Eeyore of Rock School", and revealed a Green joke about the "Will O'Conner Award for the Student Most Likely To Kill Himself". This caused considerable friction at O'Conner's home, resulting in him leaving the school.
There is another montage of rehearsals for the 80s tribute show which was not going well, a situation exacerbated by a broken air conditioner on a very hot day. Diaz and Green are interviewed about their relationship, Green stating that he believes she is "an extraordinary talent". Green is interviewed in his car in a calmer, more reflective mood, revealing that he created Rock School so that he "had something that he could be the best at".
Tywoniak is shown at the Guitar Gods show playing Eddie Van Halen's cover of the Kinks song "You Really Got Me", followed by more interview footage of Green in the backyard of his home and O'Conner after he had left the school. Another montage of the fraught 80s show rehearsals with Green ranting and slamming doors, screaming "Don't fucking make mistakes! Not on 'Rebel Yell'!" Green is interviewed about his relationship with the students, and motivation. O'Conner is interviewed at an art space screen-printing T-shirts, reflecting on his time at the school.
The All-Stars are shown rehearsing Zappa songs for their trip to Germany and the Zappanale festival, aboard the flight, arriving at the Berlin airport and traveling to Bad Doberan. Green gives a long pep talk about the upcoming concert at the youth hostel at which the kids are staying, followed by a trip to the festival. The next day, Green wakes the kids, followed by interviews with each of the All-Stars about the upcoming show, performing technically difficult music before an audience very familiar with that music.
The All-Stars rehearse "Inca Roads" with Napoleon Murphy Brock, who is interviewed about his experience, recalling being incredulous when first informed of the school and the material the students were playing. Green gives a last-minute set of performance notes before they take the stage. They perform Zappa's "Zomby Woof", followed by an original solo by Tywoniak, intercut with shots of audience members with incredulous looks on their faces. Brock then takes the stage, dropping to his knees, genuflecting to Tywoniak before going to the front of the stage and leading the audience in a mass genuflection before leading the band on "Inca Roads".
As the All-Stars leave the stage, they are greeted by a collection of other festival performers including Jimmy Carl Black of the Mothers of Invention who thanks Green for his work and describes the All-Stars as "phenomenal". The All-Stars are jamming with other festival performers in final concert scene, and Green hugs his performers.
The end of the film features interviews with O'Conner, Tywoniak, Diaz, Green and the Tucker twins trying to sum up their Rock School experience. The credit sequence features the students playing "School's Out" with Alice Cooper at the film's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, intercut with additional scenes of Green and the students of the school.
Reception
The film had a successful run on the festival circuit, screenings often followed by concerts by the students of the school. A showing at Seattle's Egyptian theater was followed by a concert featuring Ann Wilson and Eddie Vedder, and a sold-out screening at the Experience Music Project. It did not do as well in regular theatrical distribution, possibly due to consumer confusion with the similarly named Jack Black film. It was withdrawn from distribution after a single weekend.
Manohla Dargis, writing for The New York Times, notes that "Mr. Green's pedagogic style appears predicated on the idea that if you spare the insults, derision and eardrum-piercing assaults, you spoil the child" while Roger Ebert points out that "What is important is that he doesn't talk down to the students, and he is deadly serious about wanting them to work hard, practice more, and become good musicians. He rants and raves, but at least he doesn't condescend."
Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post called the film "fascinating and funny" and an "entertaining portrait of a volatile but effective educator". Philadelphia Weekly called it an "utterly charming crowd pleaser", described the direction as "inspired" and said the film "makes Jack Black's turn in School of Rock look as punk as Mr. Belvedere".
NPR rock critic Ken Tucker said, "I'd hand out DVDs of Rock School to everyone in the country with a teaching degree, and dare them to match this level of commitment."
Soundtrack
The soundtrack for the film was released May 31, 2005 featuring the students of the School performing with Gregg Rolie of Santana, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple's Ian Gillan, Yes' Jon Anderson, The Police's Stewart Copeland, The Ramones' Marky Ramone, Heart's Ann Wilson, Megadeth's Dave Mustaine, and Billy Idol.

Dalby Söderskog (literally Dalby South Forest) is a small national park in the province of Scania in southern Sweden, situated in the municipality of Lund, near Dalby. It has an area of and consists of broadleaf forest. It was established in 1918, when it was thought to be a unique remnant of primeval forest. In fact, the area has previously been used for pasture. The ground contains much limestone and chalk, which makes the flora rich. In particular, there are many spring flowers. An earth bank of unknown origin, possibly the ruins of an ancient fort, surrounds parts of the park. The national park encompasses the southern part of Dalby hage, while the northern parts (Dalby Norreskog and Hästhagen) form a nature reserve.

Pseudomonas clemancea is a species of Pseudomonas bacteria which was first discovered in the North of England. The specific epithet clemancea was given by microbiologist Pattanathu Rahman at Teesside University to bestow the CLEMANCE (Clean Environment Management Centre). This bacterium has DNA coding distinct from existing species and has unique properties developed in response to the contaminated soil from which it comes.
Biosurfactant from Pseudomonas clemancea
Surfactants work by reducing surface tension between two liquids or a liquid and a solid. Biosurfactants, surface-active agents of biological origin, have environment-friendly properties; they are bio-degradable, non-toxic and can be made organically using local raw material and producers. Biosurfactants can be used in soaps, detergents, medical ointments, or as emulsifiers, i.e. within ice cream, facial cream, or sun lotion. P. clemancea produces rhamnolipids type of biosurfactants to detoxify oil and chemicals contaminants in the ground.

Busk–Ivanhoe Tunnel was a 9,394 ft (2,863 m) long railroad tunnel at an elevation of 10,953 ft (3,338 m) in Colorado. It was built by the Busk Tunnel Railway Company for the Colorado Midland Railroad in 1891 as a replacement for the Hagerman Tunnel at a lower, more direct route.
The tunnel was briefly abandoned following Colorado Midland's 1897 bankruptcy, but returned to use a few years later.
It was converted to auto traffic in 1922 as the Carlton Tunnel, a toll tunnel carrying then-State Highway 104, closing in 1942 when the state discontinued maintenance of the road. The tunnel collapsed in 1945.
Starting in 1921, while it was still a highway tunnel, the tunnel was also used as a water diversion tunnel, moving water from Ivanhoe Lake in the Colorado River Basin to Busk Creek in the Arkansas River Basin. After the tunnel collapse, the Highline Canal Company purchased the tunnel, repairing it at a cost of $50,000. The water was originally used for irrigation of agricultural lands in the Arkansas Valley in Southeastern Colorado. The Board of Water Works of Pueblo, Colorado bought half of the water rights in 1971, and the City of Aurora bought most of the remaining rights in 1988.

J D H Catleugh (April 16, 1920 – January 7, 2009) was a British abstract artist whose career began in the 1950s and continued until his death in 2009.
Timeline of career
J. D. H. Catleugh was born on April 16, 1920. He was originally named King's Lynn and was the son of the late John Harwood Catleugh. In 1949, after serving in World War II, he became qualified as an architect and created a series of Perspex and wood reliefs in 1949 - 50. His series of "Space/Time" paintings was strongly influenced by a Jackson Pollock exhibition he attended in Venice. In 1951, he designed sets for Picasso's play, Desire Caught by Tail, at the Watergate Theatre in London. He began designing furniture in 1952 and, a year later, was the winner of the 1953 Furniture Makers Guild, Coronation Design Competition. The accompanying textile designs were produced by David Whitehead Ltd. He created a series of collages in 1953-54. For the next five years (1954-59), he did a series of relief paintings on plaster, followed by a Scottish landscape series in 1959–62. Catleugh lived in London, England, from 1988 until his death in 2009.
Exhibitions
One-man exhibitions in 1953 and 1954 at Gimpel Fils.
Group exhibitions:- 1951 British Abstract Art, Gimpel Fils, The Redfern Gallery, Summer Exhibition, The Mirror and the Square, A.I.A. - 1952:- Tomorrow's Furniture, I.C.A., Gimpel Fils, Summer Exhibition. - 1953:- Bradford, 60th Spring Exhibition, Gimpel Fils, Collectors' Choice, Collectors' Items from Artist's Studios, I.C.A., Paintings into Textiles, I.C.A. - 1954 Of Light and Colour, Gimpel Fils.1956 - This is Tomorrow, Whitechapel, London. - 1988 Reflections of the Fifties, England & Co.
His work was included in British Abstract Art at Gimpel Fils in 1951 and was displayed alongside the works of British abstract artist John Milnes-Smith, in that same year they also exhibited at The Mirror and the Square organised by the A.I.A.
J D H Catleugh was part of what Herbert Read described as the ‘Tachiste Tornado' of the 1950s; ( Herbert Read-Art Since 1945, Thames & Hudson, Chapter 7) and he showed a highly refined sense of organisation in his work, perhaps a reflection of Catleugh's early architectural training.
In 1949 J D H Catleugh, influenced by Jackson Pollock, became fascinated by the possibilities of the ‘drip and pour' technique. He eliminated his own colour mixtures and worked/poured directly from the paint manufacturer's tin. The result is a rhythmic and polychromatic ‘net-work of trails which loop, entwine and lose themselves in an indecipherable complexity'-(Review of Gimpel Fils exhibition, Manchester Guardian, 19-1-1953 ) These ‘Space/Time' paintings may remind us of ‘electrons around a nucleus' or ‘the trial of a jet plane‘,-(Colin St John Wilson, Notes on paintings by J D H Catleugh, January 1953 ) but they have no subjects as such. Titles like Space-Time Configuration and Bi-planar Structure remind us that these are products of a post atomic world and as contemporary in 2007 as they were then.
October 1953 Painting onto Textiles exhibition at the ICA organised by Hans Juda, editor of The Ambassador to promote textile designs by contemporary painters. Three designs from this exhibition were put into production by David Whitehead Ltd, these same textile designs were included in Artist's Textiles in Britain 1945–1970 exhibition at the Fine Art Society 2003.
By the mid-1950s J D H Catleugh, moving towards Victor Passmore and the British Constructionists, was working on a series of paper collages. Vertical black stripes were cut and pasted down, their orderly rows broken only by the addition of strips of coloured paper. Oswell Blakeston described them as having the effect of ‘looking through slats at a confetti world''-(Oswell Blakeston, Popular Art, Art News & Review, 30-10-1954 )
In 1956 the Tate Gallery exhibition, Modern Art in the United States, devoted one gallery to abstract expressionism. It was followed in 1957 by the landmark Metavisual Tachiste Abstract exhibition at the Redfern Gallery, which registered the influence of the Americans. This American impact was strengthened by the 1959 exhibition of abstract expressionism, New American Painting, also at the Tate Gallery.
In 1959–62 his direction and style changed, using ‘oils and a knife' his series of landscapes, moves closer to the lyrical abstractions of the painters of St Ives, such as Peter Lanyon. Catleugh quotes; ‘As Lawrence Alloway said of St Ives‘, ‘the landscape is so nice that nobody can quite bring themselves to leave it out of their art'-(Lawrence Alloway, Nine Abstract Artists, Alec Tiranti Ltd 1954 )
1984 - A series of Red/Black paintings started around the time of the 40th anniversary of the Normandy Landings, also many painful images were being shown on TV of the war in Bosnia and elsewhere, these led to the red/black figurative paintings which are often of just a single figure, sometimes reminiscent of a/the crucifixion which after all is the ultimate symbol of pain.
In 1988 - Reflections of the Fifties a two-man exhibition with John Milnes-Smith, whose career in the 1950s ran parallel with that of Catleugh's, although each had a different response to post-war directions in abstract art, this exhibition was focussing on two artists whose work reflects a post war world, and was like a time capsule opening to reveal directions in British abstract art of the nineteen fifties and early sixties.
Catleughs's overall career, was that predominately of an architect and whom painted purely for the love, passion and the expression in which art can give and bring. He was a world-renowned expert in the works of William De Morgan and was the author of William Morris Tiles (1983) and many articles on nineteenth century and Islamic tiles. His interest in two-dimensional patterns extends to textiles particularly those from India and Indonesia, of which he had a small collection, in addition he was a devoted collector of William De Morgan's Tiles of which he had extensive collection.
He became the third chairman of the De Morgan Foundation in 1996 and during his term 'The De Morgan Centre for the Study of 19th Century Art and Society' was set up in Wandsworth, London. From 2002, until its closure in June 2014, this exhibited a large collection of the ceramics of William De Morgan and the paintings of Evelyn De Morgan together with considerable archive material.

The Overseas Minangkabau is a demographic group of Minangkabau people of Minangkabau Highlands origin in West Sumatra, Indonesia who have settled in other parts of the world. Over half of the Minangkabau people can be considered overseas Minangkabaus. They make up the majority of the population of Negeri Sembilan (in Malaysia) and Pekanbaru (in Indonesia). They also form a significant minority in the populations of Jakarta, Bandung, Medan, Batam, Surabaya and Palembang in Indonesia as well as Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam in the rest of the Malay world. Minangkabaus have also emigrated as skilled professionals and merchants to the Netherlands, United States, Saudi Arabia and Australia. The matrilineal culture and economic conditions in West Sumatra have made the Minangkabau people one of the most mobile ethnic group in Maritime Southeast Asia.
The young people usually have to go outside the region after their teens to become traders or students. For most of the Minangkabau people, wandering is an ideal way to reach maturity and success. By moving, wealth and scientific knowledge are gained and the prestige and honor individuals in the midst of indigenous environment.
The immigrants usually send part of the wealth home to be invested in family businesses, such as by expanding the ownership of paddy fields, control of land management, or pick up the rice fields of the spout. Money from the diaspora is also used to improve village facilities, such as mosques, roads, or the rice fields.
Waves of migration
The Minangkabau people have a long history of migrating overseas. They would leave their homes and travel in search of knowledge and to seek their fortunes. The first migration in the 7th century when the Minangkabau Merchants sold the gold in Jambi and involved in the formation of the Malayu Kingdom. In the 13th century, the Minangkabau people started colonies along the west coast of Sumatra island from Meulaboh to Bengkulu when they were spice traders under the Aceh Sultanate. In Aceh, they were known as Aneuk Jamee and as Pesisir in west coast of North Sumatra. In the 15th century, the overseas Minangkabaus settled in Negeri Sembilan under the protection of the Malacca Sultanate and later under the Sultanate of Johor. After Portuguese captured of Malacca in 1511, much Minangkabau family moved to South Sulawesi. Datuk Makotta and his wife Tuan Sitti were pioneer of Minangkabau family in South Sulawesi. They supported Sultanate of Gowa, as trader, ulama, and administrator.
In the early 18th century, the three brothers were Nakhoda Bayan, Nakhoda Intan, and Nakhoda Kecil opened up a settlement at Penang island. In the last 19th century most of the Minangkabau people went to the Kuala Lumpur and Deli in East Sumatra as merchants, peddler and artisans.
Utsman bin Abdullah and Haji Mohamed Taib were influential tycoons in Kuala Lumpur and surrounding area. Haji Taib, one of the wealthiest figure at that time, was an important person in the early development centre of city: Kampung Baru. Beside as merchants, the Minangkabaus also overwhelmingly on socio-religious figures, such as Utsman bin Abdullah was the first kadi of Kuala Lumpur as well as Muhammad Nur bin Ismail.
Intellectual migration
After the Padri War, most of the Muslim reformists went to Mecca and Cairo. Among them were Ahmad Khatib, Tahir Jalaluddin, Abdul Karim Amrullah, and Muhammad Jamil Jambek. In Mecca, Ahmad Khatib served as the Imam of the Shafi'i school of law at the mosque known as Masjidil Haram. While Djanan Thaib founded Jamaah al-Chairiyah in 1923 and led Seruan al-Azhar magazine with Ilyas Yakoub and Mahmud Junus at Cairo.
In the early 20th century, many young Minangkabaus migrated to Java and Europe as students. In Europe, most of them studied in the Netherlands and Germany. Abdoel Rivai, Mohammad Hatta, Roestam Effendi, Nazir Pamuntjak, and Sutan Sjahrir were overseas Minangkabaus who studied in Europe and later became activists in the movement for Indonesian independence. Another activist was Tan Malaka who lived in eight different countries including the Netherlands, China, and the Philippines. He was a member of the Indonesian Communist Party and was also a candidate for the Netherlands' member of parliament.
Causes
Cultural factors
There are two explanations of this phenomenon.
One: Because Minang culture dictates that boys need to learn to be an optimal effective man, they need to learn from the outside world, to gain knowledge and experience so that they can hopefully gain enough wisdom to take care of the women (sisters, nieces, mother, aunts, grandmother, etc.), and to gain sufficient skills to be productive men who can provide for their women.
Two: The nomads who returned to their hometown, usually are considered to be more desirable by the girls and respected by the potential in-laws.
Today, the modern Minangkabau women also aspire to wander out of their hometown because they want to earn their living by trade, have a career, or further their education.
According to Rudolf Mrázek, a Czech Michigan-based Indonesianist, two typologies of Minang culture, the dynamism and anti-parochialism gave birth to the spirit of independence, cosmopolitan, egalitarian, and liberal-minded, causing the embedded migration culture of Minangkabau people. The spirit to change the fate of the pursuit of knowledge and wealth, and Minang proverb which says Ka ratau madang di hulu, babuah babungo balun, marantau bujang dahulu, di rumah paguno balun (better go wander, because in kampong not useful) result in Minang youth to migrate since youth.
Economic factors
Another explanation is that because many Minangkabau people have proven to be successful merchants and the family whose men are overseas usually are wealthier at home, it drives the other men who are still at home to want to wander outside their homeland and test their economic skills as well.
Meanwhile, the economic history of the Minangkabau people since long ago has been bolstered by the ability to trade and distribute their crops. Minangkabau inland area has geological reserves of raw materials especially gold, copper, lead, zinc, mercury, and iron. The nickname Suvarnadvipa that appears on legend in India was referred to the possibility of Sumatra as island of gold. In the 9th century, the Arab traders reported that Sumatran people have been using a number of gold in trading system. Continued in the 13th century, king of Sumatra used the crown of gold. Tomé Pires around the 16th century, says that gold was trade in Malacca, Barus, Tiku and Pariaman, originated from Minangkabau inland area. He also mentioned that in the Indragiri area on the east coast of Sumatra is the central port of the Minangkabau kingdom. The manuscripts written by Adityawarman also mentioned that he is the ruler of the earth's gold. It is then encouraged the Dutch to build a port in Padang. And arrived at 17th-century, Dutch still call a gold ruler to the king of Pagaruyung and then asks Tomas Diaz to investigate the matter, which he tried to enter the interior of the Minangkabau from east coast of Sumatra, and Diaz' noted he had found one of the Minangkabau king at that time (Rajo Buo) and also mentioned main of the people jobs was gold miners. The geological record of the Netherlands noted that on Batanghari found 42 places of mined gold with the depth reaches 60 metres, and in Kerinci they met the miners of gold. Until the 19th century, the legend of gold in Minangkabau hitterland, still pushing Raffles to prove it, and he is listed as the first European to successfully achieved Pagaruyung through the west coast of Sumatra.
Influences
They exercised great influence in the politics of many kingdom and states in Maritime Southeast Asia. Raja Baginda migrated to south Philippines and founded the Sultanate of Sulu in 1390. Between the period 1558–1575, Rajah Sulayman was ruler of the Kingdom of Maynila in what is now Manila, Philippines. In 1603, the Overseas Minangkabaus ulamas or religious figure taught Islam in Sulawesi, Borneo, and Nusa Tenggara island. Dato Ri Bandang, Dato Ri Tiro and Dato Ri Pattimang both of whom were prominent ulamas spread the word of Islam to the Gowa and Luwu kingdom in South Sulawesi. Beside as preacher, the Minangkabau were the major trader in Makassar before the Makassar War.
The Overseas Minangkabau were also involved in political rivalry with the Bugis after the death of Sultan Mahmud Shah II in Sultanate of Johor. In 1723, Sultan Abdul Jalil Rahmad Syah I or known as Raja Kecik, founded Sultanate of Siak in Riau. Raja Ismail, a grandson of Raja Kecik, who ruled Siak in 1761 and 1779–1781 has influence in the east coast of Sumatera, Malay peninsula, southern Thai as well as West Kalimantan.
In 1773, Raja Melewar was appointed the Yang di-Pertuan Besar in the state of Negeri Sembilan. The mid-twentieth century, much overseas Minangkabau like Ahmad Boestaman, Abdullah CD, Rashid Maidin, Shamsiah Fakeh, and Khadijah Sidek were involved in the Malaysian independence movement. After Malaysia and Singapore independence, many politician and minister were Overseas Minangkabau, such as Ghazali Shafie, Rais Yatim, Aishah Ghani and Muhammad Eunos Abdullah. While Yusof bin Ishak was the first president of Singapore and Tuanku Abdul Rahman was the first Supreme Head of State (Yang di-Pertuan Agong) of the Federation of Malaya.
Ahmad Khatib was the teacher to many Malay scholars in Mecca and gave influence of Islamic reformism in Malay world. Two of his students, Ahmad Dahlan established Muhammadiyah and Hasyim Ashari founded Nahdlatul Ulama. Muhammadiyah had been founded in 1912 in Java, but its rapid spread throughout Indonesia was due in large part to the efforts of Minangkabau traders and teachers. Tahir Jalaluddin and Hamka were the influential scholars in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Tahir established his own reformist magazine al-Imam and Hamka published Panji Masyarakat.
Mohammad Yamin, one of the Indonesian founding fathers, who had success a unified Indonesian identity with the Indonesian language. Beside Yamin, the other Minangkabau authors, such as Marah Rusli, Abdul Muis, Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, Hamka and Chairil Anwar, who migrated to Java since youth, were considered to be a pioneer of modern Indonesian literature. Their works have influence in Maritime Southeast Asia, in addition to Minangkabau language had a strong influence on Indonesian language.
They are also great influence developing Malaysian culture, mainly language, culinary, music, and martial art. Zainal Abidin Ahmad was a Minangkabau writer who modernized the Malay language. Muzammil Alias who goes by the stage name Waris is credited for giving fresh breathe to Minang culture in Malaysia. Rendang and Lemang, the traditional cuisine of Minangkabau, also popular in Malaysia as well as Singapore. Andalas University historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region when Minangkabau merchants and migrant workers began to trade and migrate to Malacca in the 16th century. Caklempong, the musical tradition instrument, was brought to Malaysia by the Minangkabau people as early as the 14th century.
Present-day, Malay inhabitants in Negeri Sembilan and northern Melaka practiced the Minangkabau system of adat perpatih. As opposed to adat temenggung, adat perpatih system has been studied and analysed extensively by many scholars.
Occupations
Much Minangkabau have established themselves as merchants, writers, government employees and white collar workers in the places that they have settled. A number of them work as merchant, artisans, teachers, preachers, and also in the field of medicine. SM Nasimuddin SM Amin and Mokhzani Mahathir were the example of a very successful Minangkabau businessman. Many Overseas Minangkabaus are affiliated to the Muhammadiyah Islamic organisation. In the cities, they are greatly involved with the mosque activities as well as the modern Moslem organisation. They are also present in the field of academics and many Overseas Minangkabaus hold posts as rector, dean and headmasters in high schools. After Indonesian independence, Minangkabau people migrated as skilled professionals to the Australia, Japan, Europe, and the United States.
Organizations
Today, most of the kanagarian (literally 'little state") in Minangkabau have an overseas link. They have branches and are found in all the big cities in the Malay Archipelago as well in Thailand, the United States and Europe. Their objectives are the promotion of the social, physical, intellectual, cultural and general welfare of its members.
References to overseas Minangkabau (Merantau) in popular culture
The phenomenon of wandering in Minangkabau society often becomes a source of inspiration for artists, primarily literary.

A Hand of Bridge, opus 35, is an opera in one act composed by Samuel Barber with libretto by Gian Carlo Menotti, and is possibly the shortest opera that is regularly performed: it lasts about nine minutes. It premiered as a part of Menotti's Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto on 17 June 1959 at the Teatro Caio Melisso. The United States premiere occurred the next year. The opera consists of two unhappily married couples playing a hand of bridge, during which each character has an arietta in which he or she professes his or her inner desires.
Andy Warhol, a good friend of Barber's, designed the cover for the opera's vocal score.
Roles
Synopsis and musical themes
The contract begins with 5♥ played by Bill, after the opponents competed in ♣. After setting the stage for the hand the singers begin, one by one, to express their inner monologues. Each arietta unveils the unfulfilled desires of the individual and their isolation, even among lovers and friends.
In chapter three of her dissertation Musical Narrative in Three One Act Operas with Libretti by Gian Carlo Menotti: A Hand of Bridge, The Telephone, and Introductions and Goodbyes, Elizabeth Lena Smith describes the opera as being separated into the four ariettas that are connected and denoted by the use of the "card theme." This theme is used to create a common thread, separate the ariettas into three sections of equal length, and set mood throughout the scene, reflecting each character's outer "pokerface."
The card theme is heavily jazz-influenced, with swung rhythms and what Smith calls a "quasi-walking bass line." Melodically, the theme is composed of (014) and (015) pitch sets separated into triplets. The construction allows the theme to complement the varying styles of each arietta.
Sally
Sally, who is frustrated as a result of being dummy ("Once again I'm dummy, forever dummy!") recalls a hat of peacock feathers she saw in Madame Charlotte's shop window that morning and how much she desires to buy it, which is stated repeatedly throughout her arietta,"I want to buy that hat of peacock feathers!" She second guesses herself about wanting the hat by considering two others, a red one with a tortoiseshell rose and a beige with a fuchsia ribbon, before resolving once again that she wants the hat with peacock feathers.
Sally's arietta has a rounded binary form, with the first section characterized by a repetitive eighth note pattern on the words "I want to buy that hat of peacock feathers!" The line is sung over pulsating E flat and B flat major triads. The second section shifts to a bi-tonal suggestion of a C flat major melody over an A flat major accompaniment, before returning to the original driving eighth note theme.
Bill
Sally's husband Bill, the lawyer, worries that his wife's "dummy" outburst is a double-entendre and that she may have discovered his affair with another woman named Cymbaline. He describes his mistress as having "geranium scented breath," and blond hair. He continues his soliloquy with contemplating her whereabouts, jealously wondering who she may be with tonight ("Is it Christopher, Oliver, Mortimer, Manfred, Chuck, Tommy, or Dominic?"), and regretting that he is married to Sally rather than her. Bill's arietta ends with Sally saying, "The Queen, you have trumped the Queen!"
Bill's arietta is primarily constructed of scalar triplet figures, creating a romantic waltz that reflects his preoccupation with his mistress, Cymbaline. Toward the closing of his monologue, Bill's forbidden physical desires are expressed by augmented and diminished intervals in his accompaniment on the words, "strangle in the dark!"
Bill is a caricature of one of Barber's neighbors, a businessman who hid behind religious pretense.
Geraldine
Geraldine wonders why Bill is so distracted, deciding that it is neither by his wife, whom she refers to as his "long discarded queen," nor herself, with whom he used to play footsie under the card table. Her inner-monologue is lamentful, asking who loves her and whom she loves. She lists the people she knows do not love her: "the foolish knave of hearts" in reference to Bill, her father, "my stock market husband" in reference to David, and their "football son." She then regrets not having a relationship with her dying mother when she had had the chance, begging her not to die now that she is "learning to love" her.
Geraldine's lament is set with a G major melody with hints of modal mixture, over a B flat major accompaniment. The only stable moment in the arietta occurs on the subject of Geraldine's ill mother, where the music solidifies on B flat major and the meter changes from 3/2 to 4/2, before returning to the G major melody.
Geraldine is a direct reference to Barber's sister, Sarah, who had an unstable relationship with their mother.
David
Finally, David, Geraldine's husband, expresses how unhappy he is with his life, stating that his epitaph will read, "Worked for Mister Pritchett ev'ry day and ev'ry night played bridge with Sally and Bill." He then fantasizes about what he would do if he were as rich or richer than his boss, whom he loathes and envies. He imagines his life in Palm Beach as "the King of Diamonds," with twenty naked girls and boys "attending to [his] pleasures." His fantasies further the idea of sexual experimentation with a reference to "ev'ry known perversion" in a book by Havelock Ellis, which he keeps hidden from his wife behind their copy of Who's Who. In the end he concedes that he could not have that, even if he were rich, and would still play bridge every night with Sally and Bill.
David's arietta is set to a pentatonic melody on the pitches G-A-B-D-E over E and B pedal tones, creating a strong pull towards E minor. The countermelody adds to the sense of exoticism by creating a semi-tone motion with the pitches B and C. Smith concludes that the composition alludes to David's forbidden and suppressed sexual nature.
Premieres
The first performance took place at Menotti's Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto on 17 June 1959 at the Teatro Caio Melisso, with Robert Feist conducting.
The U.S. premiere occurred the next year on 6 April 1960 in New York at the Mannes College of Music's Fashion Institute of Technology Auditorium, accompanied by the Orchestra of the Mannes College of Music with Carl Bamberger conducting.

Eric Jerome Foster (born March 5, 1985) is an American football defensive tackle who is currently a free agent. He went undrafted in the 2008 NFL Draft. Foster signed a contract with the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent. He played college football for Rutgers University.
High school career
Foster was named All-Dade at linebacker by The Miami Herald following his senior year at Homestead High School where he led the team to 9-4 season and regional final in state playoffs.
College career
After redshirting in 2003, Foster made an immediate impact in 2004 as a backup defensive end, playing in all 11 games. Foster was injured during the second game of the 2005 season, only to return in 2006 as the team's starting defensive tackle, lining up to Ramel Meekins. Despite the unit's lack of size, Foster's six sacks helped Rutgers register forty-one sacks total in 2006, good for fifth in all Division I-A, as well as fourth in total defense.
Foster gained national notoriety in 2006 for his stellar play, as well as for a popular clip aired by ESPN of a locker room speech. Snippets of the video were played at later home games. In addition, he makes a chopping motion with his arms and hands as a reference to his coach, Greg Schiano's motto, "Keep Choppin'."
For his efforts, Foster was named first-team all-Big East Conference. The Football Writers Association of America named him as a first-team All-American at defensive tackle, as well as making Honorable Mention on the AP's team. In 2007, he was named a preseason All-American by Sports Illustrated.
Foster was named to several pre-season All-America teams for 2007 at DT. He was named to the preseason watch list for the Lott Trophy, annually awarded to the best defensive player in the nation.
Professional career
Indianapolis Colts
After going undrafted, Foster was signed as a free agent for the Indianapolis Colts on May 2, 2008. Foster played in 13 games during his first season starting 11 of them.
During the Colts Monday Night Football game against the Buccaneers on October 3, 2011, Foster suffered a gruesome leg injury. During the final minutes of the first half, teammate Tyler Brayton rolled on Foster's ankle, causing his foot to turn painfully the wrong direction. His ankle was dislocated in the process. He was brought to Tampa General Hospital, where he underwent surgery the following day to repair the bone. Foster missed the rest of the 2011-12 season. The incident was compared to Joe Theismann's career-ending injury.
Toronto Argonauts
On June 7, 2013, after sitting out the 2012 season, Foster was signed as a free agent by the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League.
Chicago Bears
On August 17, 2013, Foster was signed by the Chicago Bears. He was released on August 25.

At the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, many shooting events were featured within the concurrent 1900 Exposition Universelle, but only eight events currently are considered as "Olympic" by IOC. Before July 2021 the International Olympic Committee has never decided which events were "Olympic" and which were not. The competitions were held from 3 August to 5 August and took place at the military sporting complex in Satory and at Boulogne-Billancourt. According to Olympic historian Bill Mallon, one of these nine shooting events (20 metre military pistol) was an event for professionals with prize money and therefore does not meet inclusion criteria for 1900 Olympic Games events.
Medal summary
Event that currently is not considered as "Olympic" by IOC.
Excluded events
Competitors in these events had to kill as many live pigeons as possible. Birds were released one at a time from 'traps' in front of the shooters; winners were determined by whoever shot the most birds out of the sky. A shooter was eliminated once they missed two birds. Nearly 300 birds were killed. A prize purse of up to 20,000 Francs was awarded to the winners, though the top four finishers agreed to split the winnings. This was the first and only time in Olympic history when animals were killed on purpose. Animal rights campaigns were mounted to stop live shooting; in 1902 bans came into force in the United States leading to the introduction of clay pigeons. The following results are not included in the IOC Olympic results list:
Live pigeon shooting - 20 franc entrance fee
Live pigeon shooting - 200 franc entrance fee
Running game target
Participating nations
A total of 72 shooters from 8 nations competed at the Paris Games:

The AIR (Automated Image Registration) is a program suite for volume-based image registration constructed by Roger P. Woods from UCLA School of Medicine.
It reads and writes Analyze volume files and can work with 4x4 transformation matrices stored in its own file format with the filename extension .air.
It is especially designed for neuroimaging applications and has primarily been used in research-oriented functional neuroimaging with brain scans from positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance scanners.
The suite provides a number of programs for image registration with different transformation models, such as rigid-body, affine and nonlinear warping.
For example, for affine transformation the registration from one brain scan to another may be found with the alignlinear program and written to the special air-file that stores the transformation matrix.
The transformation may be inverted with the invert_air program and the volume may finally be resliced and interpolated with the reslice program.

Oxacillin (trade name Bactocill) is a narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class developed by Beecham.
It was patented in 1960 and approved for medical use in 1962.
Medical uses
Oxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam. It is similar to methicillin, and has replaced methicillin in clinical use. Other related compounds are nafcillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin. Since it is resistant to penicillinase enzymes, such as that produced by Staphylococcus aureus, it is widely used clinically in the US to treat penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, with the introduction and widespread use of both oxacillin and methicillin, antibiotic-resistant strains called methicillin-resistant and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/ORSA) have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. MRSA/ORSA can be treated with vancomycin or other new antibiotics.
Contraindications
The use of oxacillin is contraindicated in individuals that have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to any medication in the penicillin family of antibiotics. Cross-allergenicity has been documented in individuals taking oxacillin that experienced a previous hypersensitivity reaction when given cephalosporins and cephamycins.
Adverse effects
Commonly reported adverse effects associated with the use of oxacillin include skin rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, acute interstitial nephritis, and fever. High doses of oxacillin have been reported to cause renal, hepatic, and nervous system toxicity. Common to all members of the penicillin class of drugs, oxacillin may cause acute or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. As an injection, oxacillin may cause injection site reactions, which may be characterized by redness, swelling, and itching.
Pharmacology
Mechanism of Action
Oxacillin, through its β-lactam ring, covalently binds to penicillin-binding proteins, which are enzymes involved in the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. This binding interaction interferes with the transpeptidation reaction and inhibits the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a prominent component of the cell wall. By decreasing the integrity of the bacterial cell wall, it is thought that oxacillin and other penicillins kill actively growing bacteria through cell autolysis.
Chemistry
As with other members of the penicillin family, the chemical structure of oxacillin features a 6-aminopenicillanic acid nucleus with a substituent attached to the amino group. The 6-aminopenicillanic acid nucleus consists of a thiazolidine ring attached to a β-lactam ring, which is the active moiety responsible for the antibacterial activity of the penicillin family. The substituent present on oxacillin is thought to impart resistance to degradation via bacterial β-lactamases.
History
Oxacillin, a derivative of methicillin, was first synthesized in the early 1960s as part of a research initiative led by Peter Doyle and John Naylor of Beecham, in consort with Bristol-Myers. Members of the isoxazolyl penicillin family, which includes cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and oxacillin, were synthesized to counter the increasing prevalence of infections caused by penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. While methicillin could only be administered via injection, the isoxazolyl penicillins, including oxacillin, could be given orally or by injection. Following the synthesis of cloxacillin and oxacillin, Beecham retained the right to commercially develop cloxacillin in the United Kingdom while Bristol-Myers was given the marketing rights for oxacillin in the United States.

California Proposition 90 was an amendment of the Constitution of California relating to property tax assessments for older homeowners. It was proposed by the California State Legislature and approved by voters in a referendum held on November 8, 1988.
The amendment allows homeowners over the age of 55 to transfer the assessed value of their present home to a replacement home if the replacement home is located in another county, is of equal or lesser value than the original property, if the county of the replacement dwelling adopts an ordinance participating in the program.
The following counties allow for Proposition 90 transfers into the county: Alameda, El Dorado, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Tuolumne, and Ventura. The county of El Dorado will stop taking property tax transfers through Proposition 90 on December 12, 2018.

Bromley and Chislehurst is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom since 2006 by Bob Neill, a Conservative.
Constituency profile
This constituency is relatively prosperous in terms of income, has low unemployment and is largely suburban with significant parkland and sports areas. Most of the housing is owner-occupied although there are significant proportions of social housing in parts of Mottingham and Bromley Common. The 2011 census shows that the borough is 84.3% White European/British, lower than the national average (86%) and higher than then London average (59%). Until 2006 it was one of the Conservative Party's safest seats but the by-election of that year saw the party's electoral majority fall steeply from over 13,000 (in the 2005 election) to just over 600 votes (see below - "Election results"). They have since rebuilt this majority, which currently stands at just under 11,000.
History
The Bromley parliamentary constituency was created in 1918. In 1974 Bromley became Ravensbourne.
Before the 1997 election western wards of Chislehurst merged with eastern wards in Ravensbourne to form Bromley and Chislehurst.
Bromley/Ravensbourne/Chislehurst summary
The earlier Bromley, later Ravensbourne, seat was markedly prosperous in regional terms and did not elect Labour Party MPs during its 1918 to 1974 existence. One of the Ravensbourne wards, Plaistow and Sundridge, had a Communist Councillor in the 1940s. Prime Minister (1957-1963) Harold Macmillan was the MP for Bromley from 1945 until his retirement in 1964, when he was succeeded by John Hunt. Hunt, on the left of the Conservative party, held the seat (renamed Ravensbourne in 1974) until 1997.
The Chislehurst seat had a Labour Party MP from 1966 until 1970.
A by-election was held on 29 June 2006, upon the death of the previous MP Eric Forth the month before, which returned London Assembly member Bob Neill as the new Conservative MP with an electoral majority of just over 600 votes - compared to the previous Conservative majority of over 13,000 in the 2005 general election. Turnout was down by a significant margin. In 2010 Bob Neill was re-elected with a Conservative majority greater than that achieved in 2005.
Boundaries
1997–2010: The London Borough of Bromley wards of Bickley, Bromley Common and Keston, Chislehurst, Hayes, Martins Hill and Town, Mottingham, and Plaistow and Sundridge.
2010–present: The London Borough of Bromley wards of Bickley, Bromley Town, Chislehurst, Cray Valley West, Mottingham and Chislehurst North, and Plaistow and Sundridge.

Raffaele Ruotolo is a retired American soccer midfielder who played professionally in the North American Soccer League and Major Indoor Soccer League and Continental Indoor Soccer League.
When he was five, Ruotolo moved to Naples, Italy with his family. In 1981, he began his career with local amateur club Casalnuovo. In 1982, he moved to Napoli. In 1984, Ruotolo visited an uncle in San Diego, California. While there, he had a successful trial with the San Diego Sockers of the North American Soccer League. Although signed before the outdoor season, Ruotolo never earned spot on the first team. However, he worked his way into the Sockers indoor team that fall. He gradually became a regular starter, seeing time in forty-five games during the 1987-1988 season. Despite that, the Sockers released Ruotolo on October 20, 1988. Coach Ron Newman stated, ""I felt the roster was too offensive minded. Right now it is critical for us to improve our defense." Ruotolo was a defensive midfielder, but tended to play a more offensive role. On June 1, 1993, the Los Angeles United selected Ruotolo in the first round of the 1993 Continental Indoor Soccer League supplemental draft. In 1994, new ownership moved United to Anaheim and renamed it the Anaheim Splash. In September 1996, Ruotolo left the Splash.
Ruotolo also played in the American Beach Soccer circuit and the United States national beach soccer team during the 1990s.

Bar Royal Palace is a (former) royal summer residence in Bar, Montenegro. The palace was constructed by king Nikola I Petrović-Njegoš in 1885, and was a gift to his daughter Princess Zorka and his son-in-law, Prince Petar Karađorđević. The complex includes the large and the small palace, a chapel, houses for the guards and a winter garden. A spacious ballroom was added in 1910.
At the front of the palace, there was a wooden pier. Between 1866 and 1916, King Nikola owned ten yachts. One of them, Sibil, was bought from Jules Verne, the novelist. The last yacht bought was the Rumija. In 1915, it was sunk in the Bar harbour by the Austro-Hungarian navy.
Currently, the palace houses the city museum of Bar. Also, it is used as a venue for festivals, concerts, exhibitions and literary events.

The Yaesu FT-ONE is an all-mode (CW, SSB, AM, FSK, and FM) solid state general coverage HF amateur radio (HAM) transceiver. The use of FM required an optional FM board to be installed. The unit was designed for fixed, portable or mobile operation, although the size (380 mm x 157 mm x 350 mm) and weight (17 kg) made it more suitable for fixed use. The FT-ONE was built by the Japanese Yaesu-Musen Corporation (usually called Yaesu) from 1982 to 1986. At its release, the FT-ONE was launched as the successor to the FT-902 and as the new Yaesu top-of-the-line transceiver. The FT-ONE was not only Yaesu's first fully synthesized, computer-controlled amateur band transceiver but it was also the first transceiver with a general coverage receiver. The FT-ONE was sold in the U.S., Asian and European markets. It was released in 1982 with a list price of $2800.00 US.
Technical description
The receiver is filtered by a 22 pole crystal filter with switchable extra 8 and 6 pole narrow band CW filters, a 14 pole SSB filter and a separate 14 pole CW filters. The RF circuit is based on a – manually or automatically – microprocessor controlled PIN diode attenuator with 2 bipolar power transistors used as a high level RF amplifier in the reception mode and as a double RF output pre-driver in the transmit mode. This is to ensure continuous output power on all frequencies. To guarantee a clean local oscillator signal to the Shottky diode mixer module, 6 separate voltage controlled oscillators (VCO's) were used. The final power transistors produce >100W through a 3-stage microprocessor controlled low-pass filter.
Accessories
YM-34 through YM-38 base and hand microphones;
SP-980 external speaker;
FL-2100Z linear amplifier, 100W input – 1 kW output;
FTV-107R VHF/UHF transverter;
5 separate crystal filters.
Pros
Mechanically the FT-1 is very well built; at the time Yaesu claimed it to be the top-of-the-line in the amateur radio segment. The set has a nice design, looks very professional and is easy to operate. This standard HAM rig was designed with full general coverage receive. A modification to the standard programmable ROM allows continuous transmitting from 1.8 up to 30 MHz by cutting a wire jumper. The receiver is considered to be one of the best of its time due to the outstanding crystal filters. The AM and FM modes also function quite well for a radio of this era. All components are mounted on easily accessible glass epoxy circuit boards.
Cons
The set is equipped with an early design synthesizer and local oscillator design and was prone to drift, inaccuracy and phase noise. Yaesu introduced circuit modifications in the later production series to improve on the issue, but was not able to completely fix the problem as the underlying concept remained unchanged.
Technical specifications

Grupo Compás, which trades as Alloy Valve Stockist, is an industrial alloy valve stockist and distributor based out of Barcelona, Spain and is recognized as one of the fastest growing service companies in Spain. Their customers come from three areas of activity: chemical and petrochemical refineries, combined cycle plants and companies related to the natural gas business, such as BASF, Repsol YPF, Saudi Aramco, Galp, Petrobras, Petronas and Marathon Oil; integrated engineering companies, like Sener, Technip and OneSteel; and valve manufacturers, stockists and specialized distributors, like Econosto and MRC Transmark. Grupo Compás supplies end users internationally, though the bulk of customers come from the US, Australia and European Union.
Grupo Compás is part of The M Corporation (Norway), a company that specializes in supplies to petrochemical and fine chemicals companies. The company started in 1972, initially as a supplier of mechanical parts, such as nuts and bolts, to workshops and hydraulic maintenance companies. It gradually extended its scope of supply to larger engineering firms and manufacturing plants in Spain. During the 1980s and 1990s, the company obtained representation agreements with several international pump and compressor companies. Given the complexity of these products, the manufacturers of each brand had to be approved by the end user sites, and this part of the business gradually became the company's main focus.
With the proliferation of products of Asian origin, which the market supplying to the petrochemical sector began noting heavily from 2000 onwards, Grupo Compás began withdrawing from the representation business, converting itself into a consultant to the end users to which it used to supply mechanical equipment. The strategy of advising plants on their procurements accelerated such that in 2003, Grupo Compás expanded its service from Spain to the rest of the European Union, then the rest of Europe in 2004, into North America in 2006 and to a worldwide scale in 2008, limiting its business to the valves business. In this business segment, Grupo Compás supplies valves internationally from its Barcelona warehouse.
Processes in which high-alloy valves are used
Exotic alloy valves are designed to meet the complex combinations of corrosion, temperature and pressure in industrial processes.
Alkylation and Hydrofluoric Acid (HF Acid): monel valves in A494 M35-1, N04400 and Monel 400
Alkylation in petroleum refining is a process through which olefins and parafins are combined to form high molecular weight isoparaffins. Alkylation uses hydrofluoric acid (hf acid), a highly corrosive substance that dissolves a wide range of materials, particularly the oxides. Monel valves are generally used in the most critical phases of alkylation due to their corrosion resistant properties.
Sulphuric acid: Alloy 20 valves in A182 CN7M, N08020 and Carpenter 20
Sulphuric acid is a petrochemical derivative used in the manufacture of fertilizers; it is highly corrosive. Alloy 20 valves are used to handle the corrosion, particularly when the acid concentration levels reach 96-98%.
Desalination: duplex and super duplex valves in A182 F51, F55, S31802, S32760, A995 4A and 6A
Desalination plants refine seawater in order to produce potable water. Duplex and super duplex valves are corrosion resistant to seawater salinity are therefore often used in desalination plants.
Thermal interchange: titanium valves in A182 316Ti, B381 F2, B367 C2, R50400, B348 and 1.4571
Heat exchange systems—often found at power stations—are used due to their mechanical resistance properties which in turn makes de tubular plenums resistant to vibrations. This in turn allows the tubes to be thinner and hence allow for [heat exchange]. As titanium produces a stainless cover on its surface, it makes it a heat and corrosion resistant medium. Titanium valves are therefore often used in heat critical parts thermal power stations.
Nuclear reactors: valves in Hastelloy B and C A494 CW6M y CW6, N06022, N10276, B3, C22 and C276
Nickel alloys, such as the different grades of hastelloy are known for their heat resistance properties, as well as their moderate to elevated resistance to head. Hastelloy valves are often used in pressure vessels at nuclear power
Gas turbines: inconel and incoloy valves in A494 CY40 y CW6M, N06600, N06625, N08800, N08825 and B564
Inconel and incoloy valves are used in gas turbine engines in those parts of the process that are subject to heat and require mechanical resistance to creep as well as corrosion and oxidation.
Vapor: copper valves in A182 F91, A217 C12, 904L, Uranus B6 and N08904
Chromium and molybdenum alloys are extremely heat resistant and can tolerate the high pressure-temperature process combination that are typically found at combined cycle plants that use super heated vapor to produce electricity.
Chlorine: super austenitic valves in A182 F44, 254 SMO, 6Moly and A351 CK3MCu
Piping and valves that are exposed to concentrated chlorine require super austenitic alloys that remain inert to the medium. Valves made of 6moly, 254 SMO and A182 F44 are suitable for such process conditions.
Valve trims
Some petrochemical processes do not require valves to be completely made of a particular alloy, but allow that only the valve parts that are in contact with the medium (known as trim or wetted parts). Cost savings are a great catalyst for combining standard material valve bodies with alloy trim. For example, for a valve used at an inland desalination plant may it might be sufficient to use a duplex or super duplex trim, whilst the same valve used offshore might have to be made of duplex or super duplex body and trim. The American Petroleum Institute has standardized 18 trims, amongst others Trim 9 (monel), and trim 13 (Alloy 20). Other trims, however, can be made according to a manufacturer's own standards.

CityCaucus.com was a well-known online multi-author blog focused on coverage of Vancouver municipal civic affairs. It was co-founded by Daniel Fontaine, the former chief of staff of Vancouver Mayor Sam Sullivan, and Mike Klassen, the former vice chair of the Vancouver City Planning Commission. During the Vancouver 2010 Olympics the blog offered a popular free-event guide. The blog was called partisan by some while being acknowledged for its investigative reporting, and being at the front of political conversation in Vancouver. The blog broke the 2010 story on Vancouver city staff being unhappy and having fears of aggressive agenda implementation by the ruling Vision Vancouver party. The Vancouver municipal government made an unprecedented decision to respond to the blog's criticism of a trade mission to China in September 2010.

The Basra Memorial is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission war memorial near Zubayr, Iraq. The memorial commemorates 40,682 Commonwealth forces (99% Indians) members who died during the Mesopotamian Campaign, from the Autumn of 1914 to the end of August 1921, and whose graves are not known. The memorial was designed by Edward Prioleau Warren. It was unveiled by Gilbert Clayton on 27 March 1929. Originally located eight kilometres north of Basra, near the Shatt al-Arab River, it was moved southwest in 1997 to a battleground from the much more recent Gulf War.
The Telegraph reported on 10 November 2013 that the memorial had suffered deliberate sabotage, with some of the its items missing which include the Cross of Remembrance and the bronze plaques from the Wall of Remembrance, carrying the names of the fallen.
The BBC reported that Colin Kerr, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission publicity director, said that a total of 30,000 Indian soldiers are not named on the Basra memorial, despite fallen British soldiers being named, only Indian officers are accorded with the honour. The deaths of the non-commissioned men are commemorated by regiment but simply as "and 258 other Indian soldiers" or "and 272 other Indian soldiers." Kerr added that the commission knows their identities and has launched a project to find ways to publicise them both in India and in Britain.

The Semal III was a parasol wing test bed for a wing with variable camber, intended to increase the speed range of aircraft and to lower landing speeds. It was based on a Nieuport 80.
Design and development
Stefan Malinowski's several aircraft designs were all named Stemal, the first syllables of his names joined together. The Stemal III was a test-bed for his ideas for extending the speed range of aircraft using variable camber wings, which he had begun to develop at the beginning of World War I whilst studying the Gustave Eiffel wind tunnel results on the lift generated by cambered aerofoil sections. His first experiments were with a modified Caudron wing but the external mechanism he used increased the drag unacceptably. Instead, he developed a wing with ribs which were flexible aft of the main, forward, spar together with an internal, rear spar, cam-based mechanism to bend them.
Malinkowski then took the device though aerodynamic tests in wind tunnels in Italy and made some initial practical tests with Ansaldo in Turin, all with encouraging results. The first full scale wing panel for structural and operational tests was built in 1921 at Bydgoszcz, in the workshops of the military flying school there. As a result Malinkowski obtained support from the Department of Aerial Navigation to build and fly a complete wing.
The test aircraft was originally built as a Nieuport 80 biplane, a two seat trainer variant of the Nieuport 12 fighter aircraft. With its wings and the rear cockpit removed and with a new empennage, it was converted to a parasol wing monoplane. The Malinowski wing was held over the fuselage on each side with two outward-leaning inverted V-struts from the upper fuselage to front and rear spars and wire-braced above from a strut pyramid above the wing centre and below with wires from the lower fuselage longerons. The camber changes were confined to the central part of the wing so that the ailerons were unaffected.
Piloted by Jerzy Kossowski, the Stemal III flew for the first time in late August 1922. The subsequent trials yielded promising results, with take-off and landing distances halved, rate of climb increased by 33% and service ceiling by 20%. Its stalling speed was reduced from without camber to with camber and its speed range, about 1:3.4, was much better than that of any of its contemporaries.
These tests generated some interest, particularly at the Technical Services of Aerodynamics (S.T.Aè) in Paris in 1924, leading to studies by Hanriot of a similar wing. In 1925 the Warsaw Technical University made air-tunnel measurements on a wing with a greater camber range over its full span, controlled with a simplified mechanism. Apart from the Stemal III, the only other aircraft to incorporate the variable-camber wing was Malinowski's Dziaba, a highly ambitious flying wing glider. This should have competed in the Second Polish Glider Contest, held in August 1923. It attended but was badly damaged in the run-up to its first launch and though it was repaired before the end of the competition a lack of wind kept it on the ground.
Funding problems limited any further wing development by Malinowski and although he sold his patents in November 1925, nothing more was made of them.

Tanquary Fiord is a fjord on the north coast of the Arctic Archipelago's Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada. It is located in the Quttinirpaaq National Park and extends in a north-westerly direction from Greely Fiord.
History
Radiocarbon dating methods suggest that between 10,000 and 4,100 BP, deglaciation occurred, followed by a period of glacial readvance and the formation of ice shelves until 2,400 BP. Until 1,400 BP, a period of glacial retreat occurred, and since then glacial readvance and nearby ice rises have marked the area.
Radiocarbon analysis of charcoal undertaken by the Geological Survey of Canada has shown that Inuit were present at Tanquary Fiord around 1070 BP at the latest.
Geography
The head of the Tanquary Fiord is the convergence point of four river valleys, three of which end in a floodplain and one in a river delta. Carbon dating findings show that the fjord was free of glacial ice approximately 6,500 years ago. In the past 40 years, the terminal points of side glaciers have receded.
Tanquary Fiord has 65 frost-free days per year (enough to grow lettuce), which is remarkable for its latitude. Summer temperatures of have been recorded.
Human activity
In 1963, the Defence Research Board began 'Operation Tanquary' in the area, with a focus on oceanography. The operation concluded in 1972. As the fjord is in a remote location, there is little human habitation. A Warden Station is staffed by Parks Canada during the summer months, and Tanquary Fiord Airport is located nearby. It is possible to reach the area via charter aircraft, or increasingly, via icebreaker cruise ships. In 1947, a meteorological station was installed at Eureka, about southwest of the fiord. The Fiord was named by Explorer Donald Baxter MacMillan in honor of his friend and fellow explorer Maurice Cole Tanquary. See also the Crocker Land Expedition.

Alex Ibru (1 March 1945 – 20 November 2011) was a Nigerian businessman, founder and publisher of The Guardian (Nigeria) newspaper, who was minister of internal affairs from 1993 to 1995 during the military regime of General Sani Abacha.
Background
Ibru was a son of Chief Janet Omotogor Ibru and brother of Chief Michael Ibru, founder of the Ibru Organization.
Ibru was born on 1 March 1945 in Agbhara-Otor, in today's Delta State. He attended the Yaba Methodist Primary School (1951–1957), Ibadan Grammar School (1958–1960), Igbobi College, Lagos (1960–1963) and Trent Polytechnic in the United Kingdom (1967–1970), where he studied business economics.
Business career
Ibru was chairman of Rutam Motors. In 1983, he met with the newspapermen Stanley Mecebuh of Daily Times of Nigeria, Dele Cole also formerly of that paper and Segun Osoba, formerly of Nigerian Herald. With 55% funding from the Ibrus, they launched The Guardian in 1983, with Alex Ibru as chairman.
The Guardian had various pro-left academics on its board, with a clear bias towards Obafemi Awolowo's Unity Party of Nigeria, and the first editor Lade Bonuola was held to strongly support the UPN. On the other hand, Ibru was from a millionaire business family and Stanley Macebuh was right wing in his views, so the paper tried to maintain a balance. The stated goal of the paper were to provide an independent and balanced view.
The success of The Guardian made it clear that there was an appetite for high quality journalism in Nigeria and it was followed by news magazines such as Newswatch.
The military regime did not appreciate the paper's independence and it was persecuted under military ruler General Muhammadu Buhari (January 1984 – August 1985).
Ibru provided funding to the Civil Liberties Organization (CLO), established during the military regime of Buhari's successor, General Ibrahim Babangida.
Ibru was minister of internal affairs from 1993 to 1995 in the Sani Abacha government. His appointment by Abacha was seen as a gesture of appeasement to the press.
In December 1993, there were violent clashes between the Ogoni and Okrika people in the slums of Port Harcourt in Rivers State. Ibru led a committee to tour Ogoniland and investigate the causes of unrest. Other members were Don Etiebet, minister of petroleum reserves, and Melford Okilo, minister of tourism.The military administrator of the state, Dauda Musa Komo, escorted the group. Embarrassingly for the military regime, during the trip a large crowd demonstrated in Bori blaming Shell Oil pollution for their problems.
Ibru had told his staff on The Guardian that he would not get involved in partisan politics. Despite this, the newspaper was highly critical of the Abacha regime. On 14 August 1994, The Guardian offices were raided and shut down by the government, although Ibru retained his post. The newspapers were only allowed to reopen in October 1994 following an apology by Ibru for any offensive comments that may have appeared.
On 2 February 1996, his car was sprayed with machine gun fire from unidentified men who had trailed him in a deep-blue Peugeot. Both Ibru and the editor-in-chief Femi Kusa were flown to England for treatment of their injuries.
After Abacha's death in 1998, his chief security officer, Hamza Al-Mustapha, and others were charged with the assassination attempt.
Alex Ibru died on 20 November 2011, aged 66.

Sir Edward Dering, 5th Baronet (1705 – 15 April 1762) was an English politician.
Early life
Edward Dering was the elder son and heir of Sir Cholmeley Dering, 4th Baronet of Surrenden in Pluckley, Kent by his wife Ellen, only child of Edward Fisher of Mitcham, Surrey. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1711, while still a child, following his father's death in a duel; his mother had died in 1707.
He entered Westminster School in 1719 and matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford on 31 January 1721/2, where he graduated from MA on 17 December 1725.
Career
Dering's political career began when he stood for Member of Parliament for Kent in the election of 1727; he was unsuccessful on that occasion, but was returned unopposed in a by-election in 1733 following the death of Sir Robert Furnese. He retained the seat in the elections of 1734, 1741 and 1747 but was defeated in 1754.
Politically, Dering was a Tory, and consistently voted against the Whig government. He was to have had a seat at the Board of Trade had Frederick, Prince of Wales succeeded to the throne.
Personal life
Dering was married twice: firstly, 24 February 1727/8 at St George the Martyr, Queen Square, London to Elizabeth daughter and coheiress of Charles Henshaw by his wife Elizabeth, daughter (and sole heiress in her issue) of Edward Roper of Well Hall, Eltham, great-great-grandson of William and Margaret Roper. She was buried at Pluckley 17 March 1734/5. Dering remarried some six months later, 11 September 1735, at St Anne's Church, Soho, to Mary, widow of Henry Mompesson, and daughter and coheiress of Charles Fotherby of Barham Court, Kent, by Mary daughter of George Elcocke. She died 16 December 1775.
Sir Edward Dering died 15 April, and was buried at Pluckley 22 April 1762, leaving issue from both marriages. His heir was Edward, his elder son by Elizabeth Henshaw.

Logo
The logo of the 2010 ASEAN University Games is a Galae, a traditional house constructed with Northern Lanna style intended to prevent bad
things or bad luck from entering the houses. In the logo, the Galae symbol represents the good things and happiness brought to the host nation of the games and visitors and participants from all ASEAN nations.
Mascot
The official mascot of the 2010 ASEAN University Games is a hill tribe youth named Nong Hug. The name Hug was chosen for the mascot, because Hug means Love in Northern Thai language which is also the beginning of unity and harmony. In English, the word Hug defines as to embrace or hold one's arms to show the love shared and to hug each other. Nong is the Thai word for young man, or little brother. The combination of love and hug as shown in the red cloth wrapped around Nong Hug's waist represents the existence of love when being hug for not just people of the host country Thailand but also participating countries of the games from Southeast Asia.

Louis Marullo (born July 12, 1952), known professionally as Eric Adams, is an American singer who has been the frontman of the heavy metal band Manowar since its inception in 1980. Previously, he sang for the group Looks, which also included childhood friend and future Manowar bassist Joey DeMaio. His stage name is a combination of the names of his sons, Eric and Adam.
Early life and education
Louis Marullo was born in Auburn, New York. He first showed interest in music when he was nine years old, playing the guitar. When asked about his musical training, he said, "I took one voice lesson in my life. (Laughs) He taught me the correct way to breathe, and from there I took off and I went to "the school of hardknocks" and took the rest of my lessons myself!"
Career
While a teenager, Marullo and some classmates formed a garage band, The Kids, in 1965. The group performed shows in the mid-1960s, with songs generally focusing on childhood love. The band released the song "Lovin' Everyday" in 1965. It was released as a single for their 1966 album Class of '66.
In 1980, Marullo joined the newly founded band Manowar and has been the lead vocalist since.
Adams can also play guitar and drums; in his hunting DVD, Wild Life and Wild Times, he plays guitar in the soundtrack.
In July 2011, Adrien Begrand wrote about him: "They (Manowar) have one of the most likeable, charismatic frontmen in the genre".
When asked about the band's relationships with present and former band members, he remarked that previous band members remain on good terms with the band, sometimes even contributing instruments to new albums.
Eric Adams can hold high note screams for 30 seconds at Manowar shows. Adams's main vocal influence is Ian Gillan. Adams declared in an interview that he used to go to every Deep Purple show as a young man because he loved Gillan's voice. However, he also worked to create his own, personal style. In his prime, his voice covered more than four octaves, from bass G1 to the soprano C6. As Adams has aged, his vocal high end has decreased, so recent Manowar albums are tuned lower than earlier albums.
Personal life
Adams is a passionate fan of hunting. In an interview with Metal Rules, he stated, "I'm a big time bow hunter and I'm a New York State instructor for bow hunting."
Adams is a father. He has mentioned that he has sons named Eric and Adam.

To the One is an album released by British jazz guitarist John McLaughlin. It is his first album with his band, the 4th Dimension. The album was released in 2010 on Abstract Logix Records and was produced by McLaughlin. It reached number 27 on the Billboard Jazz Albums Chart and was nominated for the 2011 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album.
Overview
To the One was inspired by the 1965 John Coltrane album A Love Supreme. The liner notes were written by McLaughlin and detail how he was influenced by A Love Supreme both musically and spiritually.
The music came to McLaughlin over a five-week period in the summer of 2009. McLaughlin previously honoured the memory of Coltrane on his 1973 collaboration with Carlos Santana, Love Devotion Surrender.
The album was nominated for the 2011 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album but lost to the Stanley Clarke album The Stanley Clarke Band. The other nominees were Never Can Say Goodbye by Joey DeFrancesco, Now Is the Time by Jeff Lorber, and Backatown by Trombone Shorty.
The band
McLaughlin has been playing with this group of musicians live since 2007 but this is their first release of new material. In addition to his keyboard playing throughout the album, Gary Husband also plays drums on two tracks, "Recovery" and "To the One". He also has a piano solo on the track "Special Beings". Bassist Etienne Mbappé, who was born Cameroon and raised in Paris, replaced original 4th Dimension Bassist Hadrien Feraud when he broke his hand in 2009, has a solo on the track "Discovery". Mark Mondesir plays drums on every track except "Recovery" and "To the One". Bandleader and composer, John McLaughlin, of course, provides all of the guitar work and even plays a guitar synth on "Lost and Found" and "To the One".
Reception
Mike Greenblatt called To the One "very heady, complicated, meandering, spiritual, bass-centric yet trebly and deeply satisfying" in The Aquarian Weekly. Thom Jurek of Allmusic called the album an "inspired milestone for McLaughlin and a fine recorded introduction to one of the more exciting electric jazz groups in the 4th Dimension". Stuart Nicholson of Jazzwise referred to the album as "an odyssey through McLaughlin's spiritual awakening and the meaning it has had in his music". John Fordham of The Guardian wrote that the album is a "tight 40-minute document [that] hums with a collaborative energy".
John Bungey of The Times was more mixed in his review writing "a strong group performance but a few more memorable themes amid the bustle might have added to the spiritual uplift". Randy Ray wrote on Jambands.com that McLaughlin "finds a way to pull his listeners under the surface, and into that fourth dimensional point of view".
John Kelman in All About Jazz wrote that there is "no shortage of high octane playing here" and that it is "McLaughlin's most exhilarating work and group since his Heart of Things band in the late 1990s" and closed by saying that the album is "quite simply, McLaughlin's best album in well over a decade". Ian Patterson in All About Jazz wrote that "Simply listening to his improvisations throughout the six originals leaves no doubt that he is in inspired creative form." Robert Bush, also in All About Jazz, called To the One the "most consistently engaging disc in years" and that "McLaughlin's chops have never been better".

Shirley Gillilland (14 December 1856 – 6 December 1927) was an American politician.
Gillilland was born on 14 December 1856 in Mills County, Iowa. He earned a degree in liberal arts at the University of Iowa in 1879, and enrolled at the school's College of Law. Upon completing his legal education in 1884, Gillilland settled in Glenwood to practice law. Between 1891 and 1904, Gillilland was a member of the University of Iowa's Board of Regents. While serving on that body, Gillilland was thrice elected Mills County attorney, in 1892, 1894, and 1896, for six consecutive years in that position. He won the 1903 Iowa Senate election as a Republican candidate for District 8, and was reelected to the same seat in 1908. Gillilland stepped down at the end of his second Iowa Senate term in 1913. He won a fourth term as Mills County in 1924, and retained the position in the 1926 election as well, though he died in office on 6 December 1927.

Dale Boone (born 1966) is an American competitive eater who holds several records for, among others, devouring pelmeni and hot dogs. Having been featured on numerous television programmes, he has proclaimed himself "Mouth of the South". Boone claims to be the great grandson of Daniel Boone.
Early life
Dale Boone was born in 1966 in Brookhaven and was raised in East Point, located south of Atlanta. Boone credits the first eating competition he entered as a watermelon-eating contest in Locust Grove.
Career
Competitive eating
Early career
Boone joined competitive eating as a professional in 2000. That year, he was awarded the title of "Rookie of the Year" by the International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFOCE). Thereafter, he signed an exclusive twenty-four-month contract with the federation.
In 2003, Boone emerged as champion of the Ultimate Eating Tournament at Broadway at the Beach in Myrtle Beach, South California. Boone won the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest at Zoo Atlanta in 2004, having wolfed down fifteen hot dog buns in twelve minutes. However, his performance at the qualifiers were the worst when compared with that of the other qualifiers' and he made a dismal showing at the finals, letting Takeru Kobayashi of Japan snag the title of champion.
2005–2010
After a successful 2004, Boone experienced a dry spell in his professional career. The President of the IFOCE, George Shea, commented, "He [Boone] may have experienced lofty heights too quickly. He seems to be having a sophomore slump." However, he quickly rebounded and won the 84 Lumber baked bean eating contest, beating runner-up Cookie Jarvis by a mere second with a timing of 82 ounces of lumber beans in one minute and fifty-two seconds.
In July 2006, Boone took part in the GoldenPalace.net Memphis Rib Eating Championship and emerged as victor. After which, he was suspended from competitive eating by the IFOCE for unspecified reasons. A spokesperson for the organisation stated that Boone's behaviour was being monitored for further assessment. After returning from his suspension, Boone went on to receive the title of Perry Krystal Champ by finishing, in eight minutes, thirty-seven Krystals. He beat Justin Mih by one Krystal.
In 2007, Boone again won the Zoo Atlanta Qualifier for the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, although he ultimately lost at the finals. To add insult to injury, he was taunted by fellow competitor Patrick Bertoletti, who mimicked his style and even made a Cabbage Patch Doll effigy of Boone.
In May 2009, Boone captured the winner's title at the inaugural World Donut Eating Championship at Bangalore, India, organised by Donut Baker.
2011–present
Boone competed in the Z-Burger's 4th Annual Independence Burger Eating Contest in July 2012. The event, which was held in Washington, aimed to see who could demolish the most burgers in ten minutes. Boone lost out to defending champion Peter Czerwinski, better known as Furious Pete. Immediately after the competition Czerwinski discovered that Boone tried to cheat by concealing some food in his darkly colored Crystal Light drink. Though in the end Boone was not disqualified, he lost in a one-minute eat off against Czerwinski.
In June 2013, he participated in the Big Wiener Eating Contest fundraiser held at Mo's Mustang Market. The same month, he also attended the Taco Eating Contest at the Bethalto City Park. The competition marked the fiftieth anniversary of the Bethalto Jaycees Country Fair.
Records and style
Boone holds a total of 52 world records. Some of them are records for eating hot dogs, including having eaten ten hot dogs in two minutes and fifty-five seconds. He has also set a world record for eating twenty-eight reindeer sausages in twelve minutes. His second world record of finishing two hundred and seventy-four Russian dumplings (pelmeni) in six minutes was included in a compilation by Bleacher Report, titled "Top 10 Unbreakable and Disgusting Competitive Eating Records". His win at the 2009 Indian donut eating contest earned him another world record for chowing down forty-four doughnuts in twelve minutes. Boone is the reigning World Champion of the World League Of Competitive Eating (WLOCE), HQ in Bangalore, India.
Hailing himself as the "Mouth of the South", Boone often attends eating competitions dressed in "overalls and a foxtail-decorated fur hat". His unconventional antics, which have often caused disruption at competitions, have caused his fellow competitive eaters to dislike him, according to his profile at the Major League Eating's official website.
Television appearances
In 2000, following his debut as a competitive eater, Boone starred in Gut Busters in Alaska, a television documentary produced by Discovery Channel. He has also made appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Weakest Link, National Geographic, CNN, and ESPN.
Personal life
Boone is allegedly a direct descendant of American pioneer Daniel Boone. His self-proclaimed favorite foods are gravy and biscuits. Boone is single, and works as a Hindi-language film director for a living. Outside of competitions, Boone reportedly adheres to a "strict diet".

Out of the approximately 11,154 known bird species, 159 (1.4%) have become extinct, 226 (2%) are critically endangered, 461 (4.1%) are endangered, 800 (7.2%) are vulnerable and 1018 (9.1%) are near threatened. There is a general consensus among scientists who study these trends that if human impact on the environment continues as it has, one-third of all bird species and an even greater proportion of bird populations will be gone by the end of this century.
Since 1500, 150 species of birds have become extinct. Historically, the majority of bird extinctions have occurred on islands, particularly those in the Pacific. These include countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea.
Some species are not extinct and seem numerous, but exist in highly reduced numbers from previous years. For example, the Wood Thrush population in North America has declined 50% in the last 50 years. According to the American Bird Conservatory, in the Western Hemisphere 12% of bird species are declining at a rate such that they will be extinct within the next century.
Causes of bird extinction
Human activity is the greatest cause of bird extinction around the world. The top human causes of bird extinction involve: the increased human population, destruction of habitat (through development for habitation, logging, animal and single-crop agriculture, and invasive plants), bird trafficking, egg collecting, pollution (in fertilizers impacting native plants and diversity, pesticides, herbicides directly impacting them as well as the plant and animal food birds eat, including the food for their food source further down along the food chain), and climate change and global warming. Due to the increasing human population, people seek additional space from what was once wild. This is a major contributor to extinction.
Natural
As climate change is caused by a variety of activities, the effect that climate change has on bird extinction is immense. Due to the rapid changes in temperature and climate the bio diverse earth can not progress with these factors. Severe weather conditions and long seasons, as well as a chemical atmosphere within their surroundings, makes it difficult for many species of birds to keep up with. In Hawai'i, climate change is responsible for the decline in the population in Hawaiian forest birds and is resulting in an increase of avian malaria (plasmodium relictum). Because the dynamics of malaria are influenced by ambient temperature and participation patterns, the predicted climate changes are expected to increase the occurrence of avian malaria.
Sea level rise may flood islands killing the birds and other animals native to islands causing extinction.
Disease
Each species of birds carries defense mechanisms like resistances and the ability to fight disease. With the changing climate and atmosphere, many species are losing their ability to fight particular diseases. These bird species are becoming more susceptible to disease, which results to the downfall of extinction. The most common disease affecting birds are Salmonellosis, which originates from the Latin name of salmonella. Infected birds pass bacteria in their fecal droppings, and other birds then become ill when they eat food contaminated by the droppings.
Notable examples
Dodo
Perhaps one of the most widely recognized extinct bird species is the dodo. It was a plump, flightless bird that lived solely on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. With abundant food and no predators on the island, their descendants evolved & grew heavier and bigger, their beaks grew larger, and their wings smaller. Its limited range, inability to fly, and lack of exposure to and fear of humans contributed to its rapid extinction. Humans in the 17th century took advantage of its fearlessness and flightlessness by killing them in their hundreds as a food source for sailors. The dodo likely became extinct before it was fully described by taxonomists. Its sudden extinction highlights the susceptibility of endemic island species, and the dodo serves as an early poster species for anthropogenic extinction.
Great auk
The great auk (or, as it has been nicknamed, “The Dodo of the North” or “Penguin of the North”) was a flightless marine bird that inhabited the cold North Atlantic ocean and islands. Its range once extended to the continental United States and Europe. However, by the 1800's had a very limited range, breeding only on a few rocky islands in the North Atlantic. It was targeted by hunters for its prized skin. Hunters took advantage of the great auk's breeding season, when pairs nested in large colonies on rocky islands. It was much more difficult to hunt when not breeding, as birds were less concentrated and spent most of their time in frigid waters, where they were fast swimmers. The last accepted sighting of the species alive was in 1844, when a breeding pair was found and strangled by hunters hoping to sell the sought-after skins.
Passenger pigeon
A more contemporary bird extinction was that of North America's passenger pigeon. It was a flocking species that once occurred in great densities. Prior to the arrival of colonial Europeans in North America, the passenger pigeon was thought to account for up to 40% of all individual birds on the continent. It was declared extinct in 1914, with the death of the last known survivor of the species, Martha, at the Cincinnati Zoo. However, it had not been seen in the wild for nearly 20 years prior to Martha's death. The main drivers of the species extinction were habitat destruction and hunting. The habitat destruction was also related to the invasive chestnut blight, which greatly reduced the number of American chestnut trees in North America. The passenger pigeon is one of the few recently extinct bird species that has been proposed for “de-extinction”. The entire genome of the species has been sequenced from surviving tissue with the hope of being able to bring it back onto the landscape using novel genetic techniques. However, birds are more complicated physiologically than mammals, which presents practical difficulties to the process of de-extinction.
By region
Australia
In June 2020 the Royal Society of South Australia published a list of 95 Australian bird fossils. The list includes three species of huge flamingos from the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre and Lake Frome areas of South Australia, which were estimated to inhabit the area for 25 million years before becoming extinct about 140,000 years ago, most likely from drought. There were also penguins measuring about tall, which lived between about 60 million and 30 million years ago, dying out in the Oligocene. Researcher Trevor Worthy said that little was known about the evolution of birds in Australia, which stands at about 1,000 species.

Dylanesque is the twelfth studio album by English singer Bryan Ferry, released on 5 March 2007 by Virgin Records. The album consists of cover versions of Bob Dylan songs. It charted at number five in both the United Kingdom and Sweden.
Critical reception
Reviewing for AllMusic, critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of the album, "Ferry has never felt quite so comfortable as he does here, and if that may not be exactly what all listeners are looking for when they listen to his work, this is the quality that will make Dylanesque a small understated gem for certain segments of his die-hard fans."

Sharm El Sheikh (, ), commonly abbreviated to Sharm, is an Egyptian city on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, in South Sinai Governorate, on the coastal strip along the Red Sea. Its population is approximately 73,000 . Sharm El Sheikh is the administrative hub of Egypt's South Sinai Governorate, which includes the smaller coastal towns of Dahab and Nuweiba as well as the mountainous interior, St. Catherine and Mount Sinai. The city and holiday resort is a significant centre for tourism in Egypt, while also attracting many international conferences and diplomatic meetings, it's called the City of peace.
Name
Sharm El Sheikh (meaning "Bay of the Sheikh") is also known as the "City of Peace; Egyptian Arabic: Madinet Es-Salaam", referring to the large number of international peace conferences that have been held there. It was known as Şarm-üş Şeyh during Ottoman rule, and as Ofira when the area was under Israeli control between 1967 and 1982. Among Egyptians and many visitors, the name of the city is commonly shortened to "Sharm" (), which is its common name in the Egyptian slang. The name is also sometimes written as "Sharm el-Cheikh" or "Sharm el-Sheik" in English.
Geography and history
Sharm El Sheikh is on a promontory overlooking the Straits of Tiran at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. Its strategic importance led to its transformation from a fishing village into a major port and naval base for the Egyptian Navy. It was conquered by Israel during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and returned to Egypt in 1957. A United Nations peacekeeping force was stationed there until the 1967 Six-Day War when it was reoccupied by Israel. Sharm El Sheikh remained under Israeli control until the Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt in 1982 after the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979. Egypt's then-president Hosni Mubarak designated Sharm El Sheikh as The City of Peace in 1982 and the Egyptian government began a policy of encouraging the development of the city. Foreign and Egyptian investors contributed to building projects including mosques and churches. The city is now an international tourist destination, and environmental zoning laws limit the height of buildings to avoid obscuring the natural beauty of the surroundings.
A hierarchical planning approach was adopted for the Gulf of Aqaba, whereby the area's components were evaluated and subdivided into zones, cities and centers. In accordance with this approach, the Gulf of Aqaba zone was subdivided into four cities: Taba, Nuweiba, Dahab and Sharm El Sheikh. Sharm El Sheikh city has been subdivided into five homogeneous centers, namely Nabq, Ras Nusrani, Naama Bay, Umm Sid and Sharm El Maya.
Sharm El Sheikh city, with Naama Bay, Hay el Nour, Hadaba, Rowaysat, Montazah and form a metropolitan area.
Before 1967, Sharm El Sheikh was little more than an occasional base of operations for few local fishermen; the nearest permanent settlement was in Nabk, north of Ras El Nasrani ("The Tiran Straits"). Commercial development of the area began when the Israelis built the settlement of Ofira, overlooking Sharm El Maya Bay and the Nesima area, and opened the first tourist-oriented establishments in the area at Naama Bay, to the north. These included a marina hotel on the southern side of the bay, a nature field school on the northern side, diving clubs, a promenade, and the Naama Bay Hotel. The site off the shore gun emplacements at Ras Nasrani opposite Tiran Island is now a diving area.
In 2005, the resort was hit by the Sharm El Sheikh terrorist attacks, which were carried out by an extremist Islamist organisation targeting Egypt's tourist industry. Eighty-eight people were killed, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were wounded by the attack, making it the second deadliest terrorist attack in the country's history.
The city has played host to a number of important Middle Eastern peace conferences, including the 4 September 1999 agreement to restore Palestinian self-rule over the Gaza Strip. A second summit was held at Sharm on 17 October 2000 following the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, but it failed to end the violence. A summit was held in the city on 3 August 2005 on developments in the Arab world, such as the situation in the Arab–Israeli conflict. Again in 2007, an important ministerial meeting took place in Sharm, where dignitaries discussed Iraqi reconstruction. The World Economic Forum on the Middle East was hosted by Sharm el-Sheikh in 2006 and 2008.
Amidst the 2011 Egyptian protests, then-president Mubarak reportedly went to Sharm El Sheikh and resigned there on 11 February 2011.
Climate
The city experiences a subtropical arid climate, classified by the Köppen-Geiger system as hot desert (BWh). Temperatures are just short of a tropical climate. Typical temperatures range from in January and in August. The temperature of the Red Sea in this region ranges from over the course of the year.
Marsa Alam, Kosseir and Sharm El Sheikh have the warmest winter night temperatures of cities and resorts in Egypt.
The highest recorded temperature was on 3 June 2013, and the lowest recorded temperature was on 23 February 2000.
Economy and tourism
Sharm El Sheikh was formerly a port, but commercial shipping has been greatly reduced as the result of strict environmental laws introduced in the 1990s. Until 1982, there was only a military port in Sharm El Sheikh, on the northern part of Marsa Bareka. The civilian port development started in the mid-1980s, when the Sharem-al-Maya Bay became the city's main yacht and service port.
Sharm El Sheikh's major industry is foreign and domestic tourism, owing to its landscape, year-round dry climate with long hot summers and warm winters and its long beaches. Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year and have become popular for various watersports, particularly recreational scuba diving and snorkeling. There is scope for scientific tourism due to the diversity of marine life: 250 different coral reefs and 1000 species of fish.
These natural resources, together with its proximity to tourist markets in Europe, have stimulated rapid growth in tourism in the region. The number of resorts has increased from three in 1982 to ninety-one in 2000. Guest nights also increased in that period from sixteen thousand to 5.1 million. Companies that have invested in the city include Hyatt, Accor, Marriott International, Le Méridien, Four Seasons Hotels, and Ritz-Carlton, with categories of three to five stars. In 2007, the first aqua park hotel resort opened in the area. The four-star Aqua Blu Sharm Resort was built on the Ras Om El Seid, with an area of .
Sharm is also home to a congress center, located along Peace Road, where international political and economic meetings have been held, including peace conferences, ministerial meetings, world bank meetings, and Arab League meetings. The Maritim Sharm El Sheikh International Congress Centre can host events and congresses for up to 4,700 participants.
There is nightlife in Sharm El Sheikh. The colorful handicraft stands of the local Bedouin culture are a popular attraction. Ras Mohammed, at the southernmost tip of the peninsula, has been designated a national park, protecting the area's wildlife, natural landscape, shoreline and coral reef. There are a number of international hotels and restaurants in the centre of Sharm, in the area known as Naama Bay, with golf courses and other leisure facilities further up the coast.
The Nabq Managed Resource Protected Area is a area of mangroves, coral reefs, fertile dunes, birds and wildlife.
As of 2012, nationals from the EU and the US do not require a visa for travel to Sharm El Sheikh if the visit is for fourteen days or less, although those travelling outside the Sinai area may still require a visa, which is purchasable for a small fee on arrival. Visitors are often ushered into a queue to buy a visa after entering the airport upon landing.
On August 23, 2015, Thomson Airways Flight 476, approaching Sharm El Sheikh at the end of a flight from London Stansted Airport with 189 passengers aboard, took evasive action to avoid a missile traveling toward it; the missile missed the airliner by about 1,000 feet (300 meters), and the plane landed safely. An investigation concluded that the missile was an Egyptian armed forces missile that had strayed from a military exercise.
Flight Metrojet Flight 9268 was destroyed by a bomb above the northern Sinai following its departure from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, killing all 224 people on board, on October 31, 2015, while flying from Sharm El Sheikh to Saint Petersburg. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for this incident. This caused the repatriation of British and Russian tourists from November 5, 2015. Following these events, many countries ordered all flights to Sharm El Sheikh suspended until further notice.
Transport
Lampposts on El Salaam Street use solar power.
Taxis and buses are numbered for safety.
Sharm's marina has been redeveloped for private yachts and sailing boats, with a passenger terminal for cruise ships.
The city is served by Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, the third largest airport in Egypt.
Sharm has frequent coach services to Cairo leaving from the Delta Sharm bus station.
Scuba diving and water sports
Sharm El Sheikh has become a popular location for scuba diving as a result of its underwater scenery and warm waters. Other beach activities include snorkeling, windsurfing, kite-surfing, para-sailing, boating, and canoeing.
Ras Muhammad National Park is located at the southernmost tip of the Sinai Peninsula where the waters of the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez meet, producing strong currents and providing a habitat for diverse marine life. Two reefs popular with divers are Shark Reef, a vertical wall descending to over , and Yolanda Reef, the site of the wreck of the Yolanda.
The Straits of Tiran are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and in a major shipping lane. There are four reefs there, each named after one of the British cartographers who first mapped them: Gordan, Thomas, Woodhouse and Jackson. In summer months, hammerhead sharks swim in schools near the reefs.
The Sharm El Sheikh Hyperbaric Medical Center was founded in 1993 by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism with a grant from USAID, to assist with diving-related medical conditions.
Shark attacks
On 1 December 2010, four tourists − three Russians and a Ukrainian − were attacked and injured by an oceanic whitetip shark or sharks in three separate incidents off Sharm El Sheikh. One victim lost a leg, and another an arm. The Egyptian authorities claimed that the shark responsible for the attacks had been captured alive, but the identification was disputed by the diving industry, based on eyewitness and photographic evidence. Four days later, on 5 December, an elderly German woman was attacked and killed by a shark while snorkelling at the resort.
After the closure of many flights to the destination the coral reefs have had a reduced number of divers. Changes in corals and more obviously the marine life are very positive.

The collective formed in early 2009, after meeting one another via their undergraduate studies at Royal Holloway, University of London.
The collective make interactive theatre that sometimes uses game mechanics and digital technology (such as headphones) in order to put the audience at the centre of the work. They often explore the connections between people - whether it be what it is that makes people a 'team', in The Time Out, to the instructions over headphones in Would like to meet, which attempts to ask 'Can you miss someone you've never met?'" or the "Ghosts" of actors past and present in this Is where we got to when you came in.
Shows
Would Like to Meet - 2009–2010. Debuted as part of the company's undergraduate degree programme at Royal Holloway, University of London in 2009. The show was then supported by a Farnham Maltings 'No Strings Attached' grant, before being fully commissioned by the Barbican Centre where it ran in Spring of 2010 as part of their Bite10 festival. The piece is an intricately timed interactive headphone work designed for 6 people, each of whom are guided by a different recorded voice. Alex Turner is quoted as saying that the piece aims to pose "the question: 'Can you miss someone you've never met?'"
They Vote with Their Feet - 2009. A 'scratch' (early stages performance test) performance at Battersea Arts Centre in September 2009.
Hold Hands/Lock Horns - 2010. Developed after the company won a Farnham Maltings 'No Strings Attached' grant, following they vote with their feet at Battersea Arts Centre. Described as an 'interactive game', or 'interactive theatre performance', this piece is 15 minutes long, and is a one-on-one performance, made for one member of the company, and one audience member, and explores "how people can be held accountable for the choices they make".
This is Where We Got to When You Came In - 2011. Devised for the pub theatre venue that The Bush Theatre moved out of in 2011. A show that traces a tour of the backstage areas of The Bush's pub venue of 40 years.
The Time Out - 2011. Developed at the National Theatre Studio, and performed at Latitude Festival 2011, Forest Fringe 2011, before touring to Tate Britain in October 2011, The Junction in November 2011. In an interview with The Junction Theatre, the collective are quoted as saying that "the time out is about teamwork. When we first started work on the piece about a year ago, we were enthralled by questions like: what is it that makes a team? How long do you have to be with a group of people to feel they are your team? What is it you have to experience? How does a team survive?" The show is 1 hour long and is an interactive experience for up to 12 audience members.
Awards and accolades
Best Entertainment Award at the Off West End Awards 2012 for this is where we got to when you came in (at The Bush Theatre)

General elections were held in the British Virgin Islands on 12 November 1990. The result was a decisive victory for the incumbent Virgin Islands Party (VIP) led by Chief Minister Lavity Stoutt. Three other parties contested the election: the BVI United Party (UP) led by Conrad Maduro (which fielded six candidates), the newly formed Progressive People's Democratic Party (PPDP) led by former Chief Minister Willard Wheatley (which fielded five candidates), and the newly formed Independent People's Movement (IPM) which fielded only two candidates. The only candidate from a party other than the VIP to be elected was Omar Hodge of the IPM in the Sixth District (Omar Hodge was a former member of the VIP and would later rejoin that party). Independent candidates won in the Fourth and Fifth Districts, and the VIP won every other available seat.
The supervisor of elections was Eugenie Todman-Smith. The turnout was 69.4%. In the individual seats, turnout was highest in the 9th District (91.1%), a record for district turnout in the British Virgin Islands. The turnout was so high that the losing candidate in the 9th District (Allen O'Neal) actually secured more votes than the victorious candidate in every other district except for Lavity Stoutt in the 1st.
Results
The VIP led by Lavity Stoutt won an outright majority of 6 of the 9 available seats.

The screenplay by S.K. Lauren and Anita Loos was based upon a 1932 play by Rachel Crothers. The film was directed by Robert Z. Leonard, who also co-produced the film (with Orville O. Dull).

Plot
Mary Howard is a novelist with advanced ideas about love and marriage, and is in love with her married publisher, Rogers Woodruf. She decides the only logical thing to do is to lure him away from his wife and marry him. Mary's friend, Jimmy, however, is convinced he's the right man for her and pursues her. He sees through her rationalizations and wrong-thinking and decides to throw Mary and Woodruf's wife Clare together at the house of a friend. The two women do not know each other, but during their chats, Mary appreciates and respects Clare's maturity and wisdom. When Mary learns Woodruf is a philandering womanizer of long standing, she realizes she cannot love him and welcomes Jimmy's attentions.

Carl Erik Oscar Thulin (born 5 July 1999) is a Swedish footballer who plays as a centre-back for Åtvidabergs FF in the Swedish Division 1 Södra.
Club career
Helsinborgs IF
Thulin joined Helsingborgs IF from Svalövs BK at the age of 14 in 2014. He got his official debut for the club on 18 February 2017 against IF Brommapojkarna in the Svenska Cupen. Later in 2017, he also got his league debut for Helsingborgs against Örgryte IS on 29 October in the Superettan. Thulin started on the bench, before coming on the pitch in the 70th minute to replace Peter Larsson. Thulin made a total of three appearances during 2017: two in the league and one in the cup.
On 12 April 2018, Thulin signed a new three-year deal with the club and was permanently promoted to the first team squad. However, he only played two cup games and participated in one league game, why the club decided to loan him out to Ängelholms FF in July 2018 for the rest of the season. During the loan spell, Thulin had the opportunity to play for both Helsingborg and Ängelholms. He made eight appearances in the Division 1 for Ängelholms, while he also made one appearance for Helsingborgs in a cup game in August 2018.
Returning from Ängelholms, Thulin was loaned out again in January 2019, this time to Eskilsminne IF for the rest of 2019. However, Thulin would train and play for both clubs during 2019, but for the most part for Eskilsminne. During 2019, he played 20 games for Eskilsminne and two games for Helsingborgs in the Allsvenskan.
In January 2020, he was once again loaned out to Eskilsminne, for the rest of the season. He returned to Helsingborgs at the end of November 2020. However, the club announced in December 2020, that Thulin would leave the club.

Monroe Henry Freedman (April 10, 1928 – February 26, 2015) was a professor of law and the former dean at Hofstra Law School. He lectured at Harvard Law School annually for 30 years, and was a visiting professor at Georgetown Law School from 2007 to 2012. He has been described as "a pioneer in the field of legal ethics" and "one of the nation's leading experts on legal ethics."
Prior to becoming Dean at Hofstra Law School, at the end of the 1979-1980 academic year, Freedman taught at The George Washington University Law School. He taught Contracts every year, beginning in the 1960-1961 academic year, and Appellate Practice & Procedure, beginning in the 1962-1963 academic year, along with other occasional courses including Current Decisions (for Law Review members), Equity, Agency, and Federal Jurisdiction. During the 1960s, he encouraged many women to attend law school, based on the idea that the law school would benefit from having more women in the student body. One effectual way Professor Freedman taught ethics was to point out and discuss ethical issues that arose in cases already under discussion from the contracts textbook.
Freedman is noted for criticism of restrictions on lawyer advertising, restrictions on trial publicity by defendants and defense attorneys. He has argued that lawyers should be permitted to reveal information necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm, that law professors' sexual relations with students should be recognized as unethical conduct, and that the lawyer's decision to represent a client is a moral decision.
During the 1960s, Freedman served as chair of the National Capital Area American Civil Liberties Union, was counsel to several civil rights organizations, and was a consultant to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. He was volunteer general counsel of the Mattachine Society. He was the first executive director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.
Freedman has received many awards and honors, including the American Bar Association's Michael Franck Award for Professional Responsibility in 1998.
Education
Freedman was born in Mount Vernon, New York, the son of Dorothea (Kornblum) and Chauncey Freedman. He attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School, receiving an A.B. cum laude in 1951, an LL.B. in 1954, and an LL.M. from Harvard Law School in 1956.
Writings
Freedman's first ethics book, Lawyers' Ethics in an Adversary System, was published in 1975 and received the ABA's Gavel Award Certificate of Merit. It received a number of favorable reviews; in the Harvard Civil Rights/Civil Liberties Law Review, NYU professor Norman Dorsen called the book one of the few "monumental contributions to legal education in the past generation."
Understanding Lawyers' Ethics, first published in 1990, is required or recommended reading in many law schools. The ABA journal The Professional Lawyer called the book "thoughtful and eloquent" and "idealistic in the best sense of the word, pragmatic, but not cynical, and rich with practical examples."
Among his many articles on lawyers' ethics is "The Professional Responsibility of the Criminal Defense Lawyer: The Three Hardest Questions" (1966), about which William H. Simon wrote: "Suppose you had to pick the two most influential events in the recent emergence of ethics as a subject of serious reflection by the bar. Most likely, you would name the Watergate affair of 1974 and the appearance [in 1966] of an article by Monroe Freedman." That article provoked controversy because of Freedman's emphasis on the criminal defense lawyer's central duty to serve as an advocate for the client, even when the lawyer believes the client may intend to lie on the witness stand. Warren E. Burger, then chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and later Chief Justice of the United States, was so unhappy with Freedman's position that he unsuccessfully initiated disbarment proceedings.
Personal life and death
Freedman died on February 26, 2015, aged 86. The cause of death was chronic lymphocytic lymphoma. His wife, economist Audrey Willock Freedman, had died in 1998. They had four children, two of whom survived him. Abbe Smith eulogized him.

Ariana is a feminine given name, popular in many languages. Arianna and Ariane are the two most common variations.
Etymology
The name Ariana may be used following several possible following origins.
The name Arianna is the Latinized form of the Ancient greek name Ariadne (; ; "most holy", Cretan Greek αρι [ari] "most" and αδνος [adnos] "holy"), the daughter of Minos, King of Crete, and his queen Pasiphaë, daughter of Helios, the Sun-titan, from Greek mythology.
Ariana, a term in classical history, from Latin Arianus, Ariana, from Greek Arianē, Areianē, names applied in classical times to the eastern part of ancient Iran and to its inhabitants. Ancient Iranians used the name in reference to themselves (Old Persian ariya-), hence Iran. Ultimately from Sanskrit arya- "compatriot;" in later language "noble, of good family.", was a general geographical term used by some Greek and Roman authors of antiquity for an extensive territory in Central Asia, comprising the eastern part of the Persian empire, now all of Afghanistan and a part of Iran and southeast of Tajikistan. The name of Iran (Persia) originates from the Old Persian word airiyanem (Ariana) meaning "[The Land of] the Aryans".
Ariana is sometimes used as a Welsh name, an elaboration of Welsh: arian “silver.”

The International Energy Centre (IEC) is a collaborative initiative established by three of Australia's leading universities (University of Western Australia, University of Newcastle and University of Queensland), and foundation industry member Glencore Xstrata. IEC's vision is to create an established centre of excellence in thought leadership, postgraduate education and innovation management to support the transition to a sustainable low carbon world.
The Centre formed in 2011 with foundation sponsorship funding from Xstrata Coal, a subsidiary of Xstrata,(now Glencore Xstrata). The business model is based on the experience of the formation of the International Water Centre, a joint venture between University of Western Australia, University of Queensland (two of the three universities in the IEC) plus Griffith University and Monash University. Recently Glencore awarded scholarships to six Masters of Energy Studies students.

The Greek community of Melbourne (Greek: Έλληνες της Μελβούρνης) is one of the largest Greek diaspora communities in the world and Melbourne hosts the largest Greek-speaking population outside of Greece and Cyprus. According to the 2016 Australian census, Melbourne has the largest Greek population in Australia with 173,598 Greeks, making up 3.87% of Greater Melbourne's population. Globally, Hellenic identity and values are passed down from one generation to the next and do not depend upon one's location in the world. As such, 88% of Greek Australians (regardless of country of birth) speak Greek and 91% are members of the Greek Orthodox Church.
As a result of the extensive historical and cultural ties between the Greek community of Melbourne and their Greek homeland, Melbourne is a sister city to Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city and one of Europe's most important cultural centres. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade estimates that economic activity (including tourism) between Greece and Australia generates more than $800 million annually with an additional $700 million in investment between the two nations annually, totaling $1.5 billion.
Melbourne makes up one of the six important Greek population centres worldwide. The others are Sydney, Toronto, New York City, Chicago and Boston. In the 21st century, most Greeks outside of Greece and Cyprus live in one of these six cities.
Modern Greek civilisation in Melbourne
Modern Greek civilisation in Melbourne is perpetuated by three Greek Australian day schools, dozens of after-hours 'Greek schools', a network of aged care and welfare societies, many community and cultural organisations, brotherhoods, youth groups, and sporting clubs. The Neos Kosmos newspaper serves the community. The Hellenic Museum located in Melbourne's CBD tells the ongoing story of the Greeks in Melbourne and houses the Hellenic Foundation for Culture's centre. Furthermore, the World Council of Hellenes Abroad maintains a presence in the city.
Hellenic student organisations are present at all seven universities located in Melbourne and maintain a high participation rate by Greek students. The National Union of Greek Australian Students (NUGAS) is based in Melbourne. Additionally, the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, dedicated to Hellenic ideals of education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, family and individual excellence, possesses a chapter in Melbourne.
The Greeks of Melbourne have made a rich contribution to Victorian society through achieving a high level of educational attainment and business ownership. Melbourne's physical landscape has been shaped by Hellenic influence: the Eureka Tower, the tallest building in Melbourne's skyline, was designed by Greek Australian Nonda Katsalidis. Additionally, many of Melbourne's landmarks feature prominent Greek designs including Parliament House, the Shrine of Remembrance and the State Library.
Additionally, the new gallery NGV Contemporary (expected to be completed by 2025) is set to become Melbourne's international iconic landmark. The winning design is that of Greek Australian architect Angelo Candalepas. The experience is focused around the visually arresting ‘omphalos' (the Greek word for the centre of the earth): a central spherical gallery that soars more than 40 metres upwards through all levels of the building, connecting to a lantern in the sky.
Australia's democratic and multicultural atmosphere has allowed Greek culture and community life to flourish in Melbourne. Over the years, various events have been held in Melbourne to remember the state-sponsored destruction of Greek communities in various parts of the world as a result of the Greek genocide and Greek Operation of the NKVD. In March 2021, Melbourne's Greek community received $200,000 from the Victorian Government to fund events commemorating the 200th anniversary of Greek Independence.
Preservation of Greek culture and community is extremely important to the Greeks. One study investigating the 54 most common ethnic groups in Australia found that Greek Australians had the lowest rate of intermarriage (marrying outside their ethnicity) than every other race in the first, second and third generations. Generally, intermarriage results in a loss of culture in the subsequent generation unless engagement with Greek language and education is introduced early and maintained throughout childhood. As observed among other ethnic groups, children born to mixed marriages are much less likely to marry someone of a similar background and the original culture is completely lost within just two generations. Despite Greek Australians exhibiting the lowest rate of intermarriage in the country, the Greek Orthodox Church in Australia reports that the number of Greeks marrying non-Greek spouses is increasing in recent years. Children born to mixed-marriage Greek families more often than not embrace their Hellenic heritage and the appeal of Greek culture in these instances creates an opportunity for the community to grow in number rather than diminish.
Culture
Year round, there are many cultural, arts and sporting events run by and catering to the Greek Australians in Melbourne.
Every year, the Greek community of Melbourne holds the Antipodes Festival at Lonsdale Street's Greek Precinct. The Festival features over 90 food, retail and community stalls, as well as free live entertainment, children's rides and attractions. In 2020, the Antipodes Festival attracted more than 100,000 visitors.
Melbourne began hosting the Greek Film Festival in 1993 which has continued every year since. The Festival offers "a variety of entertaining and informative films from some of the most gifted Greek storytellers in the film industry, with something on offer for everyone" according to Festival Co-Chairs Jim Bossinakis and Leonidas Vlahakis. The Greek Australian Short Film Festival founded in 2010 is also held in Melbourne to showcase local Greek Australian cinema. The festival showcases short films in three categories: International Shorts, Australian Documentary Shorts, and Australian Shorts. Films are judged by a panel of prominent Greek figures in entertainment.
Many singers from Greece and Cyprus travel to Melbourne to perform their own music concerts. Among those who have performed in Melbourne are Michalis Hatzigiannis, Elena Tsagrinou, Eleni Foureira, Greek American Kalomira and Greek British George Michael.
A variety of sporting events harbour a large Greek following in Melbourne including the Australian Open which brings Stefanos Tsitsipas, Nick Kyrgios, Maria Sakkari, Thanasi Kokkinakis and Michail Pervolarakis among others to Melbourne. During the World Cup, Greek restaurants and taverns tend to run watch-party events with extended outdoor seating and large screens.
As soccer is popular among many Europeans, the Greek community of Melbourne established many soccer clubs in the areas that they reside including Oakleigh Cannons FC, Malvern City FC, Brunswick City SC, Kingston City FC, South Melbourne FC, Northcote City FC, Bentleigh Greens SC, Altona East Phoenix SC, Port Melbourne SC, Western Suburbs SC and Heidelberg United FC. Annually, the teams compete in the Hellenic Cup.
Philanthropy to Greece
In response to the Greek government-debt crisis which officially ended in 2018, The Hellenic Initiative (https://www.thehellenicinitiative.org/) was established in 2012 by the Greek diaspora in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The Initiative delivers economic revitalisation and strong leadership to Greece through job creation and education from Greeks in the diaspora. The Hellenic Initiative continues to operate despite the Greek economic crisis having ended with the continued aim of promoting all forms of development, economic or otherwise, to Greece. The global Greek diaspora has been praised for their unity and collaboration in the face of the economic challenges that Greece faced in 2012. The Greek model serves as an example of how a connected diaspora can benefit their cultural homeland.
Bill Papastergiaidis, President of the Greek Community of Melbourne, has been in contact with Nina Paskal, President of the Greek Society "Enotita" in Ukraine in response to the Russian invasion in 2022. The Greek community of Melbourne is making efforts to send medical supplies to the Ukrainian Greeks and provide logistic support for their evacuation to Greece and integration into Greek society as refugees. Almost all of Ukraine's ethnic Greeks, most of whom have resided in Ukraine for many generations, live in areas currently under Russian occupation, specifically the Donetsk Oblast.

Greek Cypriots
The 2016 census recorded 7,575 Cyprus-born people in Victoria, the majority of them being Greek Cypriots. There are many more Australian-born Greek Cypriots. The largest waves of Cypriots to Melbourne came as a result of the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, however Cypriots have been emigrating to Victoria since the Gold Rush. There are significant numbers of Cypriots particularly in the Northern and South Eastern suburbs. Intermarriage of Greek Cypriots with other Greek Australians is common. The Bentleigh Greens Soccer Club (based in Cheltenham, in Melbourne's southeast) was formed in 1986 by the local Greek Cypriot community.

Signum is the name for two Dutch producers, Pascal Minnaard () and Ronald Hagen (). They are producers who create and remix mainly trance music.

Mount Baldwin is a 12,614-foot-elevation (3,845 meter) mountain summit located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in Mono County of northern California, United States. It is situated in the John Muir Wilderness on land managed by Inyo National Forest. It is four miles north of Red and White Mountain, and approximately southeast of the community of Mammoth Lakes. The nearest higher neighbor is Red Slate Mountain, to the south-southwest. Baldwin ranks as the 257th highest summit in California. Topographic relief is significant as the east aspect rises 3,775 feet (1,150 meters) above McGee Canyon in 1.5 mile. The first ascent of the summit was made July 2, 1928, by Norman Clyde, who is credited with 130 first ascents, most of which were in the Sierra Nevada.
Climate
Mount Baldwin is located in an alpine climate zone. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Sierra Nevada mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the range (orographic lift). Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains east to Crowley Lake via McGee Creek, and west into Convict Creek, thence Convict Lake.

The Cinema Travellers is a 2016 documentary film about the travelling cinemas of India, directed by Shirley Abraham and Amit Madheshiya. The film is produced by Cave Pictures, India, a company co-founded by Shirley Abraham and Amit Madheshiya in 2015. It was pitched at the 2013 Sheffield Doc/Fest MeetMarket. The film premiered as an Official Selection at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and won L'Œil d'or Special Mention: Le Prix du documentaire. In 2016, it was the only Indian film playing as an Official Selection at Cannes.
Story
Showmen riding cinema lorries have brought the wonder of the movies to faraway villages in India once every year. Seven decades on, as their cinema projectors crumble and film reels become scarce, their patrons are lured by slick digital technology. A benevolent showman, a shrewd exhibitor and a maverick projector mechanic bear a beautiful burden - to keep the last travelling cinemas of the world running.
Film festivals
The Cinema Travellers had its world premiere on 15 May 2016 at the Salle Buñuel in the Palais des Festival at 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Following that, the film has been invited to play at 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, and 2016 New York Film Festival, becoming the only Indian documentary film to achieve this rare trifecta of topmost film festivals.
Reception
The Cinema Travellers premiered at Cannes Film Festival to a rousing response. The first audiences of the film gave it a standing ovation. Glowing press reviews followed. Graham Fuller of Screen Daily declared, "Whatever masterpieces, if any, bow at this year's Cannes Film Festival, it is likely none will communicate the excitement engendered by movies more headily than The Cinema Travellers." He lauded the film for being "rigorous, aesthetically and intellectually." E. Nina Rothe of The Huffington Post called it a "masterpiece," and further, "a film from the heart and a testament to everything humanity should believe in wholeheartedly." Nick Schager of Variety found the film an "intimate, poignant documentary." Schager wrote, "Recalling Giuseppe Tornatore's 1988 Oscar winner "Cinema Paradiso" in its effusive love of 20th-century celluloid splendor, this five-years-in-the-making film should entice theatrical-loving cinephiles." The film's narrative form drew attention from reviewers. Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave it four stars and wrote "There's not a moment that feels forced or tweaked to ensure an emotional beat gets checked off, which results in both immersion and authenticity at every stage of the film." He summed up the film as "evocative, subtle and heartfelt". David Ehrlich of Indiewire called the film, "wise and wistful." Alex Ritman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, "Its triumph lies in how it also captures the magic of this unique, collective movie-watching experience." Rating the film 9.5 on 10, Alex Billington of First Showing found the film, "jaw dropping," and wrote, "Everyone else who loves the cinematic experience as much as I do needs to revel in the glory of this doc."Tom Brook of BBC Talking Movies interviewed the directors in Cannes and included the film in his special coverage from the festival. LA Times included the film in its wrap-up report from Cannes calling it one of "The most involving films on film history."

The Assumption School is a historic school building in Saint Paul in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It was built in 1864 of local quarter-cut limestone. It had a central cupola, which has been replaced. The school is affiliated with the nearby Church of the Assumption.
The building, in 1974, was "in a good state of preservation although it has not been used as a school since 1888. It presently serves as quarters for the parish caretaker and is maintained by the Assumption Church." The building has been documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey program.

Ibis Dam is a dam built in 1906 on Ibis Creek that serves as a water supply for the town of Irvinebank, Far North Queensland, Australia. It has a spillway height of . Established by John Moffat, a mining entrepreneur, its construction was supervised by Tom Brodie, a Scottish stonemason. It is located about south of Irvinebank and has been providing water since its construction.
A structural investigation was initiated in 2010 on behalf of its owner, the State Government of Queensland by the Department of Environment and Resource Management. This investigation uncovered significant structural concerns with the dam after many long-held assumptions about its initial construction were found to be untrue. After 12 months of negotiations at State level, a proposal was submitted to Tablelands Regional Council to take on ownership of the dam subsequent to a State-funded upgrade. The State's alternative to this option was to decommission the dam. In January 2012 Tablelands Regional Council decided to take on ownership of the Dam and the State began preparations for its upgrade. As of December 2012 upgrade works are ongoing

François Eisen, an engraver, as well as a painter of historical and genre subjects, was born at Brussels about 1685. When twenty years of age he went to Valenciennes, and remained there, painting many pictures for its churches and monastic institutions, until 1745, in which year he removed to Paris. At the age of ninety he, with his wife, was admitted into the Hospital for Incurables, where he was still living in 1778. There are two of his works in the Museum of Valenciennes, a Vision of St. Mary Magdalen, and an Astrologer. He etched a plate from the picture by Rubens of Christ giving the Keys to St. Peter, which was in the church of St. Gudule at Brussels.

The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) was an Australian government department that existed between 1998 and 2013, when it was renamed as the Department of Agriculture. DAFF's role was to develop and implement policies and programs that ensure Australia's agricultural, fisheries, food and forestry industries remained competitive, profitable and sustainable.
DAFF policies and programs were to:
encourage and support sustainable natural resource use and management
protect the health and safety of plant and animal industries
enable industries to adapt to compete in a fast-changing international and economic environment
help improve market access and market performance for the agricultural and food sector
encourage and assist industries to adopt new technology and practices
assist primary producers and the food industry to develop business and marketing skills, and to be financially self-reliant.
Scope
DAFF facilitated the development of self-reliant, profitable, competitive and sustainable Australian farm businesses and industries. Through consultation with industry, DAFF developed and implemented policies and programs that helped to assure product safety and integrity. Particular emphasis was placed on on-farm risk management that related to food safety.
Divisions which fell within the broader department included: Sustainable Resource Management (Fisheries), Climate Change (Drought Assistance, Australia's Farming Future, Forestry), Agricultural Productivity (FarmReady, Animal Welfare, Crops Horticulture & Wine, Food) and Trade & Market Access (Free Trade Agreements). DAFF's Biosecurity function, which was previously performed by AQIS, managed quarantine controls at Australia's borders to minimise the risk of exotic pests and diseases entering the country. DAFF also provided import and export inspection and certification to help retain Australia's highly favourable animal, plant and human health status and wide access to overseas export markets.
At its creation, the department dealt with the following principal matters:
Agricultural, pastoral, fishing, food and forest industries
Water, soils and other natural resources
Rural adjustment and drought issues
Rural industries inspection and quarantine
Primary industries research including economic research
Commodity marketing, including export promotion end agribusiness
Commodity-specific international organisations and activities
Administration of international commodity agreements
Administration of export controls on agricultural, fisheries and forestry industries products
Food policy, processing and exports
Biosecurity role
DAFF managed quarantine controls at Australia's borders to minimise the risk of exotic pests and diseases entering the country. DAFF also provided import and export inspection and certification to help retain Australia's highly favourable animal, plant and human health status and wide access to overseas export markets.
DAFF continuously looked to improve the effectiveness of the quarantine effort by working closely with other areas within DAFF to manage Australia's biosecurity system. The Department also worked closely with other Australian Government agencies – such as Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, Department of Health and Ageing, Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) and state/territory governments – to support their management of post–border detections and incursions of quarantine pests and diseases, and to support our own verification and certification activities for agriculture and food products.

Melbourne-Brighton Bus Lines was an Australian bus and coach operator in Melbourne.
History
Melbourne-Brighton Bus Lines was formed in 1954 when a multitude of operators who operated route 1 Gardenvale to Melbourne City Centre and 2 Middle Brighton to Melbourne City Centre combined. A depot was established in Brighton to house the 24 vehicle fleet.
In September 1958 route 140A Middle Brighton to St Kilda station was purchased from Eastern Suburbs Omnibus Service. In 1959 the depot was relocated to Elwood. In 1971 routes 140A, 1 and 2 were renumbered 600-602. Short journeys to Beach Avenue and Head Street were renumbered 603 and 604.
In March 1979 the Denning service agency and spare parts agency was gained. A coach operation was founded under the Melbright Coaches brand. In April 1985 the route operations were sold to the Metropolitan Transit Authority with 37 buses.
The Melbright Coaches operation was retained moving to Port Melbourne. Melbright Coaches ceased operating in November 1992 after it was unable to recover debts from Austral Denning following its entering receivership. The licences were sold to the Driver Group.
Fleet
The initial fleet consisted of Bedfords, Daimlers, Internationals, Leylands and Reos. From 1961 the company purchased heavy duty Leyland buses, for its charter operations Denning coaches. At the time of the sale of the route bus operations in April 1985 the fleet consisted of 43 buses and coaches.
In 2012 Bayside Coaches restored a Denning Landseer into Melbright Coaches livery.

RMS Carinthia was an ocean liner built in 1956 as one of the four Saxonia class ships. She sailed for Cunard Line from her completion until 1968 when she was sold to Sitmar Line, rebuilt into a full-time cruise ship and renamed SS Fairsea. She sailed with Sitmar until 1988, when Sitmar was sold to P&O. She was renamed SS Fair Princess and sailed for Princess Cruises and P&O Cruises until 2000. She was then sold to China Sea Cruises and renamed SS China Sea Discovery. In 2005 or 2006 she was scrapped in Alang, India.
Concept and construction
Near the end of 1951 Cunard Line designed new ships for Canadian service on the Liverpool-Montreal-Halifax route. Cunard originally decided to build just two ships but later on two more were ordered. These ships were the largest ships to be operated to Canada at the time. The ships were built in Clydebank and they were designed for luxury and speed including carrying passengers and cargo up the St Lawrence River in summer and to Pier 21 in Halifax in winter when the St. Lawrence froze.
Service history
RMS Carinthia started on her maiden voyage to Montreal on 27 June 1956 with 890 passengers and crew on board. After four more voyages, she proved with her running mate that the new Canadian Cunarders were so successful that other ships operating on the route were all scrapped leaving the four ships on the Montreal route. During 1960, the Carinthia suffered a fire in one of her cabins. In June of that year, some deck hands set up a skiffle group on a public deck; some passengers complained of the noise and the deck hands were fined a day's pay causing the "skiffle strike". The ship's crew went on strike and others came out in support leaving many liners tied up in the Liverpool docks for several weeks. During 1961 she collided with the . In 1962 her propellers failed during a voyage. During 1964, the crew went on strike again. Carinthia was still operated from Liverpool to Montreal until the end of 1966, and from Southampton to Montreal and New York until after March 1967.
Cunard Line decided to start operating the Carinthia as a cruise ship during the winter months. She was used on 10 day cruises from New York City to Bermuda. During 1968, along with RMS Sylvania, she was sold to Sitmar Line, initially renamed Fairland and laid up at Southampton for two years. Following year-long major refurbishments of both vessels in Italy, Fairland became Fairsea and in 1972 commenced cruising from the United States West Coast, for the re-styled Sitmar Cruises.
As the "Fairsea" appeared in the U.S. TV series The Partridge Family in the episode "The Last Howard ", season 4, episode 7, airing 11/2/1973. The family was performing while on a cruise. The episode centered on daughter Laurie and a ship board romance.
Following the sale of Sitmar to P&O in 1988, the vessel was transferred to Princess Cruises and used for Pacific Ocean cruises as the Fair Princess.
In 1995, Fair Princess was transferred to the fleet of P&O Holidays (now P&O Cruises Australia) but was immediately chartered to Regency Cruises where she was to sail as their Regent Isle. Regent Isle was advertised for Regency's 1996 season, but due to their September 1995 bankruptcy, she never made a voyage for them.
In 1997 the ship commenced voyages for P&O Holidays, replacing the recently retired Fair Star. She remained with P&O Australia for the remainder of the decade.
In 2000, the ship was sold to China Sea Cruises and renamed China Sea Discovery. She operated as a casino cruise ship but was unsuccessful. During 2001 she operated in Taiwan. Finally after many unsuccessful voyages she was moved to Alang, India, to be scrapped. While under scrapping, a fire broke out in the engine room, killing five workers, and injuring another fifteen people. In the end, the ship was scrapped in either 2005 or 2006.

Adams is an unincorporated community in Lake County, California.
It was formerly Adams Springs, a summer resort developed around a small group of mineral water springs.
Springs
The Adams Springs are beside Big Canyon Creek.
They are south of Seigler Mountain.
The springs are at an elevation of 2815 feet (858 m).
They are in a deep ravine about east of Astorg Spring.
Along the steep slopes of the ravine the exposed rocks are sandstone and shale.
Higher up these sediments are covered by basaltic or andesitic lava.
A 1914 description stated, "The main spring is at the hotel, and is an alkaline carbon-dioxated water very pleasant to drink. Its temperature is , and it has considerable free carbon-dioxide gas. There are also several other smaller springs. They have been bottling water from the main spring for the past twenty years. but only during the summer season.
The spring water is alkaline, strongly carbonated, with a petroleum odor and taste.
Community
Adams Springs is north of Whispering Pines.
It is southwest of Lower Lake and north of Calistoga.
Adams is north of Hobergs and south of Loch Lomond.
It is bounded by the CA175 highway to the west, and by the Boggs Mountain Demonstration State Forest on the other three sides.
Adams Springs Golf Course is on the other side of CA 175 to the south of Adams.
The zip code for Adams is 95461.
History
The springs were discovered by Charles Adams in 1869.
He bought them in 1872.
A small campground with tents was laid out near the springs.
William Robert Prather was the son of a successful self-taught dentist.
He completed dental school and qualified as a doctor.
He acquired Adams Springs about 1885, and later increased his land holdings to about .
Prather transformed the springs into a high quality health spa.
Development of the resort started in the late 19th century.
A large drain pipe was laid in the stream bed to carry off storm water, and the ravine was widened and levelled to make space for buildings.
Prather corresponded with Thomas Edison in the late 1890s, who told him how to build a Pelton wheel in Big Canyon Creek to generate electricity for the resort.
Prather planted fruit trees, ran a farm and raised cattle where the Adams Springs Golf Course is today.
He added cabins and campsites around the spring, and advertised aggressively.
The resort became popular about 1900.
A post office operated at Adams from 1908 to 1960.
In 1910 the resort had a large frame hotel and several cottages and tents.
There was a swimming plunge on the hillside above the springs supplied by water piped from the stream.
Some people used the water for its medicinal value, but it was mainly a summer pleasure resort.
There was a well equipped hotel and a number of cottages, with accommodations for a total of 350 guests.
In 1927 Prather erected a large new hotel on the edge of Big Canyon, with many windows, surrounded by a large covered deck.
In the period before World War II (1939–1945) the Merced Band would play dance music in the evenings to visitors who had motored up from San Francisco for the weekend.
Prather died in 1938 after his second son Clarence Prather had taken over management.
The new hotel caught fire and burned to the ground in 1943.
After this Clarence Prather ran the resort at a loss for a few more years before breaking up and selling the property.
In the 1960s the remaining buildings were condemned and destroyed by burning.
What remained of the resort was destroyed in the Valley Fire of 2015.

Lugnaquilla (), at , is the 11th–the highest peak in Ireland on the Arderin list, and 13th–the highest on the Vandeleur-Lynam list, and the highest Irish mountain outside of Kerry. Lugnaquilla is the highest point in Wicklow, and in the province of Leinster. Lugnaquilla is in the Wicklow Mountains, and overlooks the Glen of Imaal to the west and Glenmalure to the east.
Naming
Irish academic Paul Tempan wrote in his 2010 Irish Hill and Mountain Names, that the summit plateau is marked as Percy's Table, named after an 18th–century local landowner, Colonel Percy. This is similar to Dawson's Table on the summit of Galtymore. Tempan also notes that P.W. Joyce gave the original form as Log na Coilleach, which translates as "hollow of the (grouse) cocks", however, Tempan says that "this seems doubtful".
Tempan clarifies the name has no connection with the deity Lug, despite the common use of the term Lug as shorthand for Lugnaquilla, and that in some spellings of the name, several OS maps and guidebooks for example (e.g. Paddy Dillion's guidebooks), an "i" is added to give "Lugnaquillia"; however Tempan settles on "Lugnaquilla" as the proper name for the mountain.
Geology
The Geological Survey of Ireland ("GSI") describe Lugnaquilla as a "slate capped, granite rooted, relatively flat-topped mountain". Crags of dark-grey schist protrude from the upper cliff walls of Lugnaquilla's corries which are Ordovician in age. The protrusions of lighter grey rock are granite. The cap of schist overlying Lugnaquilla's granite core is the remnant roof of the magma chamber into which the Lugnaquilla granites were emplaced. Cosmogenic dating on exposed bedrock showed that these schists were not covered by ice during the Last Glacial Maximum, and thus Lugnaquilla was a nunatak.
Geography
Lugnaquilla is described as a "bulky mountain", with a large plateau-type grassy summit (known as Percy's Table), bounded on two sides by steep glacial corries called the "North Prison" (looking into the Glen of Imaal), and the "South Prison" (looking into the glen of the River Ow). On Lugnaquilla's eastern side is the cliff-lined hanging valley of Fraughan Rock Glen, which falls into the glacial U-shaped valley of Glenmalure. Lugnaquilla is the source of the River Slaney.
Lugnaquilla does not have a rocky summit or summit ridges, and its large massif is described as a "sprawling mountain moorland". Lug's massif includes several major summits and corrie lakes, often lying in a "horseshoe-shape" with Lug at the apex around deep valleys. Around the Fraughan Rock Glen and Arts Lough in the east are Benleagh, and Clohernagh; around the glen of the Carrawaystick River and Kelly's Lough in the south-east are Corrigasleggaun, and again Clohernagh; around the glen of the River Ow in the south are Corrigasleggaun and Slievemaan; and finally, around the larger Glen of Imaal in the west are Ballineddan Mountain, Slievemaan, Camenabologue, Table Mountain, Lobawn, and Sugarloaf.
Lugnaquilla is the highest mountain of the Wicklow Mountains range, and the highest mountain in Ireland outside County Kerry. Lugnaquila's large prominence qualifies it to meet the P600 classification (mountains known as the "Majors" in Britain and Ireland), and the Britain and Ireland Marilyn classification. Lugnaquilla is the 4th-highest mountain in the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains.
It is the 432nd–the highest mountain, and 21st most prominent mountain, in Britain and Ireland, on the Simms classification. Lugnaquilla is regarded by the Scottish Mountaineering Club ("SMC") as one of 34 Furths, which is a mountain above in elevation, and meets the other SMC criteria for a Munro (e.g. "sufficient separation"), but which is outside of (or furth) Scotland; which is why Lugnaquilla is referred to as one of the 13 Irish Munros.
Hill walking
The shortest route to the summit of Lugnaquilla is the 13-kilometre 4–5 hour Glen of Imaal Route (the "Tourist Route"), that starts at Fenton's Pub in the Glen of Imaal, and goes along the military access road via a grassy hill to Camarahill () , and then up to the summit of Lugnaquilla. The route crosses into the military artillery range, so walkers should check the range operating times in advance.
The 15–kilometre 5–6 hour Glenmalure Loop is described as "the most scenic circuit to Lugnaquilla". It starts in the Baravore car park () at the head of the Glenmalure valley and summits Lugnaquilla via the cliff–fringed hanging valley, Fraughan Rock Glen (the Glen is entered via the path at the Glenmalure Hostel); but returning via Cloghernagh , and down to the scenic Arts Lough , described as "one of the region's most beautiful sights", before descending back to the start of the Fraughan Rock Glen (or descending via Kelly's Lough and the glen of the Carrawaystick River).
The third, and least frequented route is the 16–kilometre 6-hour Aghavannagh Route, which starts at the Aghavannagh Bridge () and walks the long forest tracks along the River Ow to the dramatic "South Prison" of Lugnaquilla, which is exited via the grassy–ramp of Green Street; return via same route. The 12–kilometres of forest trails (getting to the south prison, and then on the return to the bridge) can be cycled instead.

Confusion Hill is a roadside attraction in Piercy, California. The attraction, which opened in 1949, includes what is dubbed as a "gravity house", a structure built to give the interior visitors tilt-induced optical illusions, similar to the perspective on a gravity hill. Occupants experience the need to stand upright when they actually already are. Also included in the attraction is the Mountain Train Ride a narrow gauge built in a switchback layout along the side of a steep hill.
For 60 years, Confusion Hill was on the heavily traveled US 101 highway, also known as the Redwood Highway. Due to repeated mudslides obstructing the road, US 101 was realigned in 2009 to the Confusion Hill Bridges, bypassing the attraction. In 2010 Confusion Hill was granted California Points of Historical Interest status.
Gravity Falls
In August 2016, Alex Hirsch, creator of the television series Gravity Falls, installed a statue of series villain Bill Cipher at Confusion Hill after it was removed from its initial home of Reedsport, Oregon following a global scavenger hunt to locate the statue known as Cipher Hunt.
In 2020, Confusion Hill faced closure due to financial troubles brought on by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A GoFundMe was set up and with help from Alex Hirsch and the Gravity Falls fanbase, the target goal was raised and exceeded.

"Christmas Wishes" is the tenth episode of the eighth season of the American comedy television series The Office, and the show's 162nd episode overall. The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on December 8, 2011. It was written by executive producer Mindy Kaling and was directed by Ed Helms in his directorial debut. The episode guest starred Lindsey Broad, Ameenah Kaplan, and Eleanor Seigler.
The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) attempts to "make everyone's Christmas wishes come true", including those of a drunken Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper). Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) are entangled in a prank war in which each tries to frame the other.
"Christmas Wishes" received mostly positive reviews from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, "Christmas Wishes" drew 5.79 million viewers and received a 2.9 rating/8% share in the 18–49 demographic, staying even with the previous two episodes, "Gettysburg" and "Mrs. California." It ranked first in its timeslot, and was the highest ranked NBC series of the night.
Synopsis
Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) attempts to "make everyone's Christmas wishes come true". At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries to be nice to Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica, by accusing her of flatulating in public. In a drunken stupor, Erin tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off.
Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, greatly desires sex, and spends a good deal of the party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a wistful smile on his face.
Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) pranking has caused Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to ask Andy to move her to a different desk. In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and the target of the prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in his desk and blames Jim. However, Jim tricks Dwight into stating the porcupine's name (Henrietta), causing him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter Cece, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will not touch their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.
Production
The episode was written by executive producer Mindy Kaling, who also portrays Kelly Kapoor on the series, her 24th writing credit for the series. This marks her first writing credit as an executive producer. Before this, it was speculated that she might not return to the series as a writer, before she confirmed that she would be writing the Christmas episode. She has also written the previous two Christmas episodes: "Secret Santa" and "Classy Christmas". The episode was directed by cast member Ed Helms, making his directorial debut. The episode also marks the fourth appearance of Lindsey Broad who plays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. She appeared in a recurring role for the season and she initially appeared in "Pam's Replacement". Due to Jenna Fischer's actual pregnancy, Pam did not appear in the episode. The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include shoots of several of the staff members' Christmas wishes being revealed, Dwight and Jim's pranks start turning on Cathy, and Meredith hitting on a newly single Robert.
Cultural references
Midway through the party, Dwight enters the conference room and sets up his own speaker system to play "Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24", a heavy metal medley of traditional Christmas songs performed by Savatage and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. The song acts as a backdrop to a brief montage of various scenes of members of the office exchanging gifts while shots of Dwight, Nate, Creed, and Gabe air-guitaring along are interspersed.
Reception
Ratings
"Christmas Wishes" originally aired on NBC in the United States on December 8, 2011. The episode was viewed by an estimated 5.79 million viewers and received a 2.9 rating/8% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 8% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode matched the ratings with the previous episode, "Mrs. California." Despite this, the episode ranked first in its timeslot, beating CBS drama Person of Interest which received a 2.8 rating/7% share in the 18–49 demographic, Fox drama series Bones which received a 2.4 rating/6% share, and ABC reality series America's Funniest Home Videos which received a 1.9 rating/5% share. Despite place third, all three of these shows received more total viewers than "Christmas Wishes". For the week of November 5 – December 11, 2011, "Christmas Wishes" placed twenty-third in the ratings among all prime-time broadcasts in the 18–49 demographic.
Reviews
"Christmas Wishes" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Hollywood.com writer Hannah Lawrence enjoyed the episode, writing, "as an episode, ['Christmas Wishes'] had that certain… 'spirit' that I enjoy from Office episodes." She also complimented the Erin-Andy relationship arc. IGN writer Cindy White, although noting that the episode "had some big obstacles to overcome" with the absences of both Michael Scott and Pam Halpert," concluded that the episode had a "high rewatch factor." She wrote, "If my Christmas wish was to watch an episode of The Office that made me laugh a lot, consider that wish granted." She ultimately gave the episode 8.0/10. M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode a "B+". Margaret Lyons from New York wrote a mostly positively review, saying Christmas Wishes' filled me with holiday cheer, proving that there's still some juice left in this show," before noting that "There are still some issues left, too, though." What Culture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer praised Mindy Kaling and Ed Helms' writing and directing work, and said, "If this is what happens when cast members... take the reins then the writing and directing duties should be kept in house much more often."
The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt wrote a slightly more critical review, noting the episode's lack of structure. He wrote that "['Christmas Wishes'] is not a terrible episode of television, but it's formless to the point where it avoids having to make any sort of statement." He did, however, positively comment on the Andy and Erin subplot and suggested that the episode was "positioned as a transition point," featuring an Andy-Erin-Jessica love triangle and a darker Robert California. He ultimately gave the episode a "B−". Many reviews considered "Christmas Wishes" to be the best episode of the first part of the season.

Joris van der Paele or Georgius de Pala (ca. 1370–1443) was a scribe in the papal chancery, a successful career ecclesiastic, and a patron of the painter Jan van Eyck.
Life
Joris van der Paele was born in or near Bruges around 1370, into a family with considerable clerical connections. Among these, both his uncle and his brother were to hold positions in Saint Donatian's collegiate church in Bruges. Joris became a clerk in minor orders of the diocese of Tournai at an early age, and was later ordained subdeacon but never received higher orders. He was appointed a prebendary of St Donatian's in 1387 and installed on 22 March 1388. In 1394, during the Western Schism, he was deprived of his prebend due to his loyalty to Pope Boniface IX in Rome, the city of Bruges recognising Avignon as the seat of the papacy. By 1396 he had been appointed to a position in the Roman chancery, and by 1409, while still working in the papal chancery, he had been appointed to prebends in Utrecht, Maastricht, Strasbourg, Cologne and Huy. In 1410 he was reappointed to a canonry of the church of St Donatian in Bruges. In July 1418 he began a process of retirement. From 1425 he was permanently resident in Bruges.
In 1432 Van der Paele's health declined markedly. From 1434 he began to work on his legacy to the church, founding a chapel and commissioning a painting from Jan van Eyck. This was to become Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele. He would have been in his sixties and suffering from temporal arteritis, when the painting was begun. In 1442 he founded a second chapel.
Van der Paele died in Bruges on 25 August 1443 and was buried in the chapel he had founded in the church of St Donatian.

"U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D." is a popular song from the musical Starlight Express, with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Richard Stilgoe. It is performed by Dinah the Dining Car, after being dumped by her macho boyfriend, Greaseball. It is a pastiche of the Tammy Wynette song, "D-I-V-O-R-C-E."
Lyrics
The lyrics are packed with humour. The song starts with Dinah describing to her friends that "I've been..." before confessing that she "can't say the word." So she spells it out for them instead. She then goes on to explain how she can't stop "C.R.Y.I.N.G." She announces that she will have her "R.E.V.E.N.G.E." on Greaseball, who she now sees as a complete "B.A.S.T.A.R.D."
Music
Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the song in the key of B flat major. It is played in a country and western style.
Thematic value
The song is reprised when Greaseball can't find the word to apologise to Dinah. She recommends he spell it instead, so (being a bit of a dunce) he tells her he is "S.O.R.R.R.Y."
History
Starlight Express has had many revisions made to the costumes, make-up, choreography, wigs, set, characters and musical numbers. Of all the notable musical numbers in Starlight Express, U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D (along with 'Right Place, Right Time') has had no revision made to the number at all.

Romanian Australians may include those who have immigrated to Australia from Romania, and Australian-born citizens of Romanian descent. According to ABS (2006 census) figures, there are 18,320 people with Romanian ancestry in Australia.
Romanians were registered in Australia for the first time more than 80 years ago having emigrated for work seeking a more prosperous economic status, or as missionaries. But the first wave of Romanian emigrants to Australia came after World War II, when Romania was experiencing severe economic and political problems. The Romanians who were then emigrating to Australia principally settled in areas around Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. The number of Romanians who came to Australia at the time is estimated to be around 2,000 people.
The second wave of Romanian emigration to the Australian continent began after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, when the Communist regime fell and citizens received the right to leave Romania. They came in large numbers for the same reasons as the first-wave immigrants.
Demographics
the largest communities of Romanian-Australians could be found in Melbourne (6,482), Sydney (4,145)and Brisbane (1,912).
In the 2006 Census, among Romanian-born persons, the religious breakdown was as follows: 80.6% Christianity, 5.8% no religion or atheism, 4.4% Judaism, 3.0% other religions and 5.6% did not answer the question.
A small number of Romanian Australians are ethnic Greeks. They founded the Greeks from Romania NSW Association "The Acropolis" based in Sydney.

Redu (also called The Radio) is a 2018 Marathi-Malvani language Indian film directed by Sagar Chhaya Vanjari and produced by Navalkishor Sarda and Vidhi Kasliwal. The film stars Shashank Shende and Chhaya Kadam in lead roles. A Landmarc Films Presentation and a Naval Films Production in association with Blink Motion Pictures, Redu was released in theatres on 18 May 2018 after a successful run in National & International Film Festivals.
Plot
Redu is the story of Tatu and his family living in a humble village in Konkan, set in the early 1970s. Tatu a short-tempered, irate middle-aged simpleton, is fascinated and curious to see a ‘redu', a small portable radio, for the first time in his life.
Serendipitous circumstances allow him to possess a ‘redu' himself. The gadget makes his ordinary life full of excitement and fun. And the people in his village start looking at him in a different light once he possesses this marvel of an innovation. It ups his common status to a special one. And Tatu gets very attached to this ‘redu', the newest member of his family, and everything it brings with it. But nothing lasts forever ... a sudden loss of his prized possession leaves Tatu disheartened and dejected. Refusing to accept this altered reality, Tatu embarks on a quest to reclaim what once belonged to him. Redu is a humorous bittersweet story of one man's life, love, values, and his will to go on despite the odds, set against the spectacular backdrop of rural Konkan.

Critical reception
Mihir Bhanage of The Times of India gave the film a 3.5 out of 5 ratings, saying that Redu warms up with a light-hearted approach and gradually develops into an emotionally rewarding experience. Though the film is in Malvani, the language doesn't act as a barrier. This one is definitely worth a watch.
Just a couple of weeks prior to its release, Redu won Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and 4 more Maharashtra State Awards.

"Watch Out" is a single by Alex Gaudino featuring Shèna, released on 28 January 2008. It is the third single released from his debut album My Destination. The second release topically coincided with UEFA Euro 2008, as the music video features a "video-game" football match played by raunchy women in spandex shorts/tops. The song contains a SCORCCiO replayed sample of Pigbag's "Papa's Got a Brand New Pigbag", produced by Mark Summers while Shèna's vocals play a considerable part in track.
Music video
The music video starts with Alex Gaudino and his friend playing a virtual game of football (soccer) on an unknown video game console. The two men select a player type (all are female); Gaudino chooses blue tops and his friend plays Team Diablo in white tops, and they play in the Gaudino Arena. The game starts with a shot between one of the player's legs and doors then open behind her. They enter the arena wearing tight Lycra tops and shorts which are both short and revealing. The two teams start doing exercises including star jumps, stretching and bending of the legs, with some angles showing close-ups of buttocks and cleavage. The game eventually kicks off. Team Gaudino scores a goal, and later tackles team Diablo causing one girl to trip. A nurse is called out by the referee and she uses a "magic sponge" which miraculously heals the bruise. The play continues and team Diablo scores a goal. A player from team Gaudino then pulls on the shorts of a Diablo player, which causes the referee to give Gaudino a foul and Diablo gets a free kick. Team Diablo scores another goal and the game ends. Diablo then shakes hands with Alex Gaudino at the end of the video.
The soccer players are played by Amy Perfect and Sophie Burles.

Pope John Paul II () created 231 cardinals in nine consistories held at roughly three-year intervals. Three of those cardinals were first created in pectore, that is, without their names being announced, and only identified by the pope later. He named a fourth in pectore as well but never revealed that name. At his 2001 consistory, where he elevated 42 prelates and announced the names of two created in pectore earlier, he created more cardinals at one time than ever before or since. His consistories in 1985, 1994, and 2003 were among the largest ever.
In his first three consistories, John Paul adhered to the limit of 120 that Pope Paul VI set on the number of cardinal electors in 1975. and he included that maximum when he reformed the papal conclave procedures in 1996. His appointments exceeded that number for the first time in 1988 when the number of electors rose to 121, and then again in 1998 when it reached 122. In each of his last two consistories, in 2001 and 2003, he raised the number to 135, a record figure never surpassed by his predecessors or successors.
He was the first pope to allow someone not a bishop to become a cardinal since Pope John XXIII mandated that cardinals be bishops in 1962. His appointments included one future pope, Pope Francis.
30 June 1979
John Paul created fourteen cardinals at his first consistory and he announced he was withholding the name of a fifteenth. That additional cardinal's name was not made public until 1991. All those named were archbishops, including six Italians and two Poles. These appointments, excluding the name withheld, brought the number of cardinals who had not passed their 80th birthday to 120, the maximum set by Pope Paul VI, while the entire membership of the College of Cardinals reached 135.
Cardinal "in pectore"
2 February 1983
John Paul created 18 cardinals on 2 February 1983, including the first resident of the Soviet Union (Vaivods of Latvia) and four others from countries with Communist governments. This brought the College to 138 members, of whom 120 were young enough to serve as electors in a papal conclave. Another cardinal was created in pectore or secretly. John Paul granted a dispensation from the requirement that all cardinals be bishops to Henri de Lubac, the first such dispensation since Pope John XXIII established the rule in 1962.
25 May 1985
John Paul created 28 cardinals on 25 May 1985 in a ceremony held outdoors for the first time in St. Peter's Square. They included the first from Ethiopia and Nicaragua and an archbishop of the Ukrainian Rite. It raised the College's membership to 152, with 120 eligible to vote for a new pope.
28 June 1988
On 29 May 1988 John Paul announced he would create 25 new cardinals in 28 June, though the death of Hans Urs von Balthasar of Switzerland reduced that number to 24. This consistory took the number of cardinal electors from 97 to 121, which fell within a month to the maximum of 120, a majority of them appointed by John Paul. It brought the total number of cardinals to a new high of 160, of whom John Paul named 84.
28 June 1991
On 29 May 1991, John Paul announced he would create 22 cardinals at a consistory on 28 June and revealed the name of one he had created in pectore in 1979, Ignatius Kung Pin-mei. This increased the number of cardinal electors to 120 from 100. It also raised to 13 the number cardinals from the Soviet Union and nations of the recently dissolved Warsaw Pact. The total number of cardinals reached 162 after the consistory.
26 November 1994
On 30 October 1994, John Paul announced the names of 30 new cardinals from 24 countries, scheduling the consistory for 26 November. He said others were deserving but he "thought it appropriate to adhere to the limit set by my Predecessor Paul VI". The total number of cardinals reached 167 after the consistory.
21 February 1998
John Paul announced on 18 January 1998 that he would create 22 new cardinals, but withheld the names of two of them. He had also planned to include Josip Uhač, a Vatican diplomat and curial official who died that morning. The consistory was scheduled for 21 February. Excluding the two not named, this brought the membership of the College of Cardinals to 165, of whom 122 were eligible to vote in a conclave.
Cardinal created "in pectore"
21 February 2001
On 21 January 2001, Pope John Paul II announced plans to raise 37 prelates to the rank on cardinal at a consistory in February. He also said that at the consistory he would announce the names of two cardinals he named in pectore in 1998. He followed that by announcing the names of five more on 28 January and revealed the two made cardinals secretly in 1998, Marian Jaworski and Janis Pujats. The 44 cardinals created at this consistory was the largest ever created at a consistory. It increased the number of cardinals eligible to vote in a papal election to 135, despite the maximum of 120 set by Pope Paul VI in 1975 and reiterated by John Paul II in 1996; he said in each of his announcements that he was setting aside this limit. The total number of cardinals reached 183 after the consistory.
21 October 2003
Pope John Paul II announced on 28 September 2003 that he would create 31 new cardinals in an October consistory, but withheld the name of one of them, apparently a resident of a country where Catholicism was the object of government persecution. Twenty-six of those publicly named were young enough to vote in a papal conclave, and seven of those were members of the Roman Curia. This consistory increased the number of cardinal electors from 109 to 135. The total number of cardinals reached 194 after the consistory. Because the withheld name was never published, that cardinal's appointment expired when the Pope died.
Demographic adjustment
In 2004, the birth year of Cardinal Henryk Gulbinowicz, long reported as 1928, was corrected to 1923. The adjustment meant he was past his 80th birthday and no longer counted as a cardinal elector. In 1942, as a young man, Gulbinowicz had falsified his birth records to escape being sent to a Nazi labor camp. The correct birth date was reported in the Italian press as early as March 2004 and printed in the Pontifical Yearbook presented to John Paul on 31 January 2005.

Flavian art is the artistic production of the Roman Empire during the Flavian dynasty (emperors Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian) from 69 to 96 AD.
Already at the time of Claudius and Nero, the style of sculpture began to separate itself from the neo-Attic Athenian art that dominated the late Republic. This style was almost definitively abandoned under the Flavian dynasty. It is not fully known what the catalyst for this change was.
Two major trends emerged in sculpture: the use of a more nuanced chiaroscuro in the bas-relief, and the use of placing the figures in a three-dimensional space with regards to the perspective of the viewer.
Arch of Titus
The greatest symbol of the Flavian era is the Arch of Titus, dated between 81 and 90. The architecture is denser and heavier than the arches of the Augustan era, such as the Arch of Susa. This is a clear deviation from the traditional Hellenistic influence. Here for the first time in Rome the Ionic/Corinthian Composite order appears, a more ornamental style. The numerous internal reliefs of the archway are extraordinarily significant and show two moments of the triumphal procession which took place in 71 after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus.
In these pieces, we see the innovation of Roman relief. Evident are the thickened figures, with the height of the figures consistent with their location in space. Individual figures are represented as if they were moving within three dimensions. Furthermore, the figures do not move on a straight line, but on a convex curved line, clearly visible in the relief of the procession. On the left it appears the figures are moving towards the viewer, and on the far right, moving away as they enter under the Porta Triumphalis. This trend continued to be developed further during the Nerva–Antonine dynasty.
Other sculptures
This era saw the commission of the Cancelleria Reliefs likely by Domitian, constructed around 90. These are imbued with classicism found in the era of Claudius, but also display the arrangement of the figures along a convex line.
Architecture
The Great Fire of Rome in 64 destroyed much of the city, making it necessary to rebuild. New squares were opened, the streets became wider and lined with arcades, and houses were constructed to a more limited height. Domitian rebuilt the burnt monuments at the Campus Martius, plus the Piazza Navona and the Odeon of Domitian.
The Flavian dynasty, in particular under Domitian, oversaw the monumentalization of the Palatine Hill. The emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero all had residences on the hill, but the most grandiose palace was built by Domitian. The Palace of Domitian, constructed by the architect Rabirius, had at least three parts; the Domus Flavia, the Domus Augustana, and the gardens.
Architectural development in the Flavian era was of fundamental importance for the implementation of new techniques. This period saw an increase in the use of the hemispherical domes (Domus Transitoria, the nymphaeum at the Villa of Domitian), the development of rib vaults (the Colosseum), the use of ogives with brick arches in series, and the development of barrel vaults, which reach 33 meters in diameter in the Domitian vestibule of the Roman Forum.

The 2010 Texas gubernatorial election was held on Tuesday, November 2, 2010, to elect the Governor of Texas. Incumbent Republican Governor Rick Perry ran successfully for election to a third consecutive term. He won the Republican primary against U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and political newcomer, Debra Medina. The former mayor of Houston, Bill White, won the Democratic nomination. Kathie Glass, a lawyer from Houston and previous candidate for Texas Attorney General, won the Libertarian nomination. Deb Shafto was the nominee of the Texas Green Party. Andy Barron, an orthodontist from Lubbock, was a declared write-in candidate.
Exit polls showed Perry winning Whites (71% to 29%), while White performed well among African Americans (88% to 12%) and Latinos (61% to 38%)
Perry's fourth inauguration for a third full four-year term began on January 18, 2011, on the State Capitol South Grounds.
Election rules
Texas does not have term limits for its governors; thus, gubernatorial incumbents are free to run as often as they want if they are eligible for the office.
The Republicans and Democrats chose their gubernatorial nominees based on the results of primary votes held on March 2, 2010 (the first Tuesday in March.) Both parties' candidates received at least 20 percent of the total votes cast for governor in the 2006 election; thus, they must nominate their candidates via primary election.
Any third-party which obtains ballot access must nominate its candidates via a statewide convention, which by law must be held on June 12, 2010 (the second Saturday in June.) The Libertarian Party obtained ballot access automatically due to its 2008 showing, in which one of its nominees attracted over one million votes.
In the primary election the party's winning candidate must garner a majority (over 50%) of votes cast; otherwise, the top two candidates face each other in a runoff election. However, in the general election, the winning candidate needs only a plurality of votes to be elected Governor (as was the case with the 2006 election and the 1990 election, in which Libertarian Jeff Daiell attracted over 129,000 votes).
Independent and write-in candidates may seek ballot access; however, the criteria for such access are quite strict (see "Ballot Access" below). Nevertheless, in the 2006 election, two independent candidates, Carole Keeton Strayhorn, the Republican State Comptroller, and Kinky Friedman, a popular Texas country musician, obtained enough signatures to qualify. The Libertarian nominee, James Werner, was on the ballot automatically because of that party's Texas showing in the 2004 general election.
Ballot access
Political party candidates
Any political party whose candidate for governor, during the 2006 election, garnered at least 20 percent of the total votes cast, must nominate all its candidates for all offices sought via primary election. In the 2006 election, both the Democratic candidate (Chris Bell) and the Republican candidate (Rick Perry) received this many votes; thus, both parties must hold primary elections using the two-round system. The primary elections must be held on the first Tuesday in March, and a candidate must receive a majority of votes cast in the primary election; otherwise, a runoff election between the top two finishers must be held on the second Tuesday in April.
A political party whose candidate for governor, during the 2006 election, received at least two percent but less than 20 percent of the total votes cast, may nominate its candidates for all offices sought via either a primary election (using the two-round system) or a state convention. If the party chooses to conduct a primary election, it must notify the Texas Secretary of State at least one year prior to the general election date and must nominate all its candidates via primary election. No third-party candidate met this requirement in 2006; the last to do so was the Libertarian Party in 1990 (when nominee Jeff Daiell polled over 3.3% of the vote).
All other political parties must nominate their candidates via state convention, which by law must be held on the second Saturday in June. In order to qualify for ballot access at the general election, the party must either:
have had at least one candidate, in the previous statewide election, garner at least five percent of the total votes cast for that office (only the Libertarian Party met this requirement), or
within 75 days after conducting its precinct conventions, submit lists of said conventions, whose total participant count equals at least one percent of the total votes cast in the previous gubernatorial election.
If the political party cannot meet the precinct convention count requirement, it may file a supplemental petition, the number of signatures on which, when added to the count from the precinct convention lists, totals the required one percent, but must do so within the 75-day period above. Any person signing a supplemental petition must not have voted in any party's primary election or runoff election, or participated in any other third-party's convention.
Independent candidates
Should an independent gubernatorial candidate seek ballot access in the state of Texas, the candidate must meet the following requirements:
The candidate must obtain signatures from registered voters, in an amount equalling at least one percent of the total votes cast in the prior gubernatorial election, the same as for third-party access.
The signatures must come from registered voters who did not vote in either the Democratic or Republican primaries or in any runoff elections for governor.
The signatures must come from registered voters who have not signed a petition for any other independent candidate. If a supporter signed more than one petition, only the first signature counts.
The signatures cannot be obtained until after the primary election (if either political party primary requires a runoff election, the signatures cannot be obtained until after such runoff election) and the petition must be filed no later than 5:00 pm (Austin time, the filing must be with the Texas Secretary of State) on the 30th day after the scheduled runoff primary election day (even if none is held).
Write-in candidates
In the event a candidate does not qualify for independent status, the person may still run as a write-in candidate. The candidate must either:
pay a $3,750 filing fee, or
submit 5,000 qualified signatures. However, the petition must be filed by 5:00 pm of the 70th day before general election day, and cannot be filed earlier than 30 days before this deadline.

Gaasbeek Castle (, ), today a national museum, is located in the municipality of Lennik in the province of Flemish Brabant, Belgium.
History
The fortified castle was erected around 1240 to defend the Duchy of Brabant against the County of Flanders. The castle was destroyed however by Brussels city troops in revenge for the assassination of Everard t'Serclaes, which was allegedly commanded by the Lord of Gaasbeek at the time, Sweder of Abcoude.
At the beginning of the 16th century the Dominium of Gaesbeeck was inherited by the House of Hornes; they constructed a brick castle on the ruins of the medieval fortress. In 1565 Lamoral, Count of Egmont, acquired the castle and its domain, including feudal rights in 17 surrounding villages. Accused of high treason by Philip II of Spain, the Count of Egmont was beheaded three years later.
In the following centuries the castle was inhabited by several noble lords, amongst them René de Renesse, 1st Count of Warfusée, who acquired the castle and restored the buildings. It obtained its pseudo-medieval appearance as the result of a renovation during the years 1887–1898. The works were executed by the architect Charles Albert and ordered by the Marquis d'Arconati Visconti who owned the castle at that time. His widow Marie Peyrat donated the castle to the Belgian state, including the art collection and the grounds.
Museum
Since 1980 the castle has been owned by the Flemish Community (Vlaamse Gemeenschap). The castle contains impressive art collections displayed in lavishly decorated historical rooms. A remarkable collection piece is the authentic testament of the famous painter Peter Paul Rubens
The castle and its grounds (a park of 50 hectares or 124 acres) are open to the public.
From 30 August 2020 to 2023 the castle museum is closed due to renovation works to the castle. The park and the museum garden remain accessible during this period.

Antarā is the equivalent of a verse in Hindustani classical music.
In Hindustani classical music, the fixed (dhrupad/bandish) section is in four parts of which only the first two are performed regularly: Sthāyī (pallavi in Carnatic music) - the first line of the Sthāyī serves as a cadence (music), while the section itself serves as a base for the singer returns to the Sthāyī time and again after each part; Antarā (Anupallavi in Carnatic music) - the intermediate part sung in a high register focusing on the tar shadja, with a good deal of text manipulation and repeated forays into sthāyī; the third section Sanchari (charanam in Carnatic music) - created by the division of the Abhoga and it remains a free-moving section; the fourth and concluding section Abhoga (Pallavi in Carnatic music because this section is often replaced by the Sthāyī) includes notes from all three registers, and in present-day performances, may well be sung with the Sanchari, if these two sections are included.

The Benvenuti Situla is a bronze situla that dates to ca. 600 B.C. It is a product of the situla art that spread north from the Etruscans in this period, in this case to the Este culture that flourished in Este, Veneto during the 7th century BC. The vessel is now conserved in the local National Museum Atestino. The relief work on the vessel depicts scenes of aristocratic life. These include banqueting as well as scenes of military victory. The iconography of the relief scenes of the situla may indicate Etruscan influence.

The Collectors were a Canadian psychedelic rock band active in the 1960s.
History
The Collectors debuted in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1961 as a house band (the C-FUN Classics) for CFUN radio, and renamed itself The Collectors in 1966. The band featured Howie Vickers (Howard Vickberg) on lead vocals, Bill Henderson on lead guitar, recorder, keyboards, and lead vocals (these last mostly on Grass and Wild Strawberries), Claire Lawrence on tenor saxophone, harmonica, keyboards, flute, organ, recorder, and vocals, Glenn Miller on bass and vocals, and Ross Turney on drums and percussion.
The Collectors' biggest hit was their first single, 'Looking at a Baby', released in March 1967 on the Valiant label in the U.S. and on New Syndrome in Canada. It reached #4 on Toronto's CHUM-AM on April 24, 1967. Valiant was then acquired by Warner Bros. Records. In 1967 the group released its first album. The Collectors, on the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts label and appeared on sessions for the US group The Electric Prunes' album Mass in F Minor.
In the fall of 1968 they released Grass and Wild Strawberries. The lyrics of this album were written by Canadian poet and playwright George Ryga ("The Ecstasy of Rita Joe") complemented by the music of The Collectors. Between 1968 and 1969 the group composed soundtracks to three Canadian films: "Don't Let The Angels Fall," (1968) "Canada The Land," (1969) and "The Land" (1969). The Collectors also appeared on the CBC national television program Let's Go.
Howie Vickers left the group in 1969, and the remaining members of the band reconstituted themselves as Chilliwack, with Bill Henderson taking over lead vocals.

The men's light bantamweight (51 kg/112.2 lbs) Low-Kick category at the W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Belgrade was the lightest of the male Low-Kick tournaments, involving twelve fighters from three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa). Each of the matches was three rounds of two minutes each and were fought under Low-Kick rules.
Due to there being too few competitors for a tournament that was meant for sixteen, four fighters had a bye through to the quarter finals. The tournament gold medalist was Azerbaijan's Zaur Mammadov who beat Italian Ivan Sciolla in the final by way of split decision. As a result of reaching the semi finals, defeated fighters Kyrgyzstan's Utkin Hudoyanov and Bulgarian Aleksandar Aleksandrov were rewarded with bronze medals.

Colonial Gardens is a former entertainment complex located in the Kenwood Hill neighborhood across New Cut Road from Iroquois Park in Louisville, Kentucky. In its early existence, it was a part of Senning's Park, the site of the first zoo in Louisville.
Beginnings as Senning's Park
Senning's Park was started in 1902 by a German immigrant to Louisville from Kesse, Germany named Frederick Carl Senning, who immigrated to the city in 1868. Prior to opening the park, he and his wife Minnie founded the Senning Hotel at 2nd and Jefferson in downtown Louisville, as well as the first bowling alley in Louisville, at the corner of 8th and Main, also in downtown.
The park started on two and a half acres owned by Fredrika Oswald before he died. It benefited from being only a block from the loop that electric streetcars used on Fourth Street. Initially it did not have a zoo, but instead focused on dancing and dining; picnics and political rallies were common at the facility.
The zoo was started during the Prohibition era, and barely survived the Great Depression. In 1920, the Sennings' son William began the zoo operations, with his parents going on a trip to Europe. Animals present in the zoo included alligators, bears, deer, exotic birds, leopards, lions, monkeys, ostriches (for riding), and tigers. However, the keep of the exotic animals became expensive, and in 1939 the park was closed due to Frederick Senning's death. The park was sold at auction for $15,000 the following year. The new owner, B. A. Watson, opened a restaurant on the property called Colonial Gardens, and promptly closed the zoo. Its successor, the current Louisville Zoo, would not open until 1969.
Colonial Gardens (1940–present)
Colonial Gardens featured big bands during the 1940s. However, it had its own difficulties as well; it lost its right to sell rationed foods in 1944, and was found to have an illegal gambling device on the premises on January 13, 1948. A fire on August 16, 1950 caused $10,000 in damages. In the 1950s it served as both a hangout for teens, and a bar. Jerry Lee Lewis is said to have performed at the restaurant; also, local oral history holds that Elvis Presley had an unscheduled performance at the restaurant in 1956, as it was close to the home of his grandparents, whom he was visiting at the time.
The last business operating in Colonial Gardens closed in 2003, and the building was then abandoned by its owners. By mid-2008, it was in danger of being demolished by investors interested in developing the property. In hopes of saving the building, a petition to declare the building and adjacent property an "Individual Local Landmark" was begun simultaneously. One rationale for the petition, among several other historical distinctions, was the fact that the building was the last of the beer gardens that once dominated the South end of Louisville. On November 20, 2008, the petition was passed, and the Louisville Metro Landmarks Commission named Colonial Gardens an Individual Local Landmark.
In 2012, Louisville Metro Council member David Yates proposed an ordinance to change how the commission designates an individual local landmark, so residents in the immediate vicinity of the property in question would have more input in the commission's decisions, such as the one regarding Colonial Gardens. The ordinance also would give the council final decision authority. In August, the ordinance was passed 18–7 over Mayor Greg Fischer's veto.
In June 2013, in a 16–3 vote, the Metro Council approved an ordinance allowing the city to purchase the Colonial Gardens property. The city subsequently sold the property to local developer Underhill Associates for $1 and gave $1.2 million toward the property's redevelopment.
In 2017, Underhill Associates began construction on the $5 million redevelopment of Colonial Gardens and surrounding property, including renovating in the original building, demolishing a 1939 addition, and building three new one-story buildings. These buildings will be used to house three additional restaurants, which the developer prefers to be locally owned and mid-priced. though this was delayed to August.
In April of 2021 the last restaurant B.A. Colonial which was named after the second owner B.A. Watson opened its doors in the original corner building completing the project and carrying on the rich traditions of the South End and the historic property.

Johann Sebastian Bach composed (Delightful rest, beloved pleasure of the soul), 170, a church cantata for the sixth Sunday after Trinity in Leipzig. It is a solo cantata for alto that he first performed on 28 July 1726.
History and words
Bach composed the cantata in Leipzig for the Sixth Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans, "By Christ's death we are dead for sin" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew a passage from the Sermon on the Mount about better justice than the justice of merely observing laws and rules (). The text of the cantata is drawn from Georg Christian Lehms' (1711) and speaks of the desire to lead a virtuous life and so enter heaven and avoid hell.
Bach first performed the cantata on 28 July 1726. Its brevity, compared to the cantatas in two parts written before and after, such as , can be explained assuming that in the same service another cantata Ich will meinen Geist in euch geben, JLB 7, by Johann Ludwig Bach was also performed. It is regarded as part of Bach's third cantata cycle.
Bach performed it again around 1746. Bach's son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach performed the first movement around 1752 in Halle.
Scoring and structure
The cantata is one of three Bach cantatas written in Leipzig in the summer and fall of 1726, in which an alto soloist is the only singer, the others being , and . It seems likely that Bach had a capable alto singer at his disposal during this period.
Bach structured the cantata in five movements, alternating arias and recitatives. He scored the work for an alto soloist and a small ensemble of oboe d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), obbligato organ (Org) and basso continuo (BC). The duration of the cantata is given as 24 minutes.
In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4).
Music
The first aria is a da capo aria in a pastoral rhythm. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes: "The first stanza is enigmatically poetic and its essence is an evocation of that peace and inner contentment". The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr describes the mood as contemplative, and the melody of the voice as expansive, on a background of repeated quavers in the instruments.
The first recitative is secco, only accompanied by the continuo.
The second aria is set without continuo, rare in Bach's compositions, and symbolic of the lack of direction in the lives of those who ignore the word of God, as spoken about in the text. The organ plays the upper parts, which the violins and viola in unison form the lowest part.
The second recitative is accompanied by the strings and continuo. The strings play mostly long chords but illustrate the words "" (to live with God, whose name is love) by more lively movement.
The final aria is a triumphant song of turning away from the world and desiring heaven. The words "" (I feel revulsion) are expressed by an unusual tritone opening the melody. The voice is ornamented by figuration in the organ, which Bach set for flauto traverso for a performance in his last years.
Recordings
Notable singers in the alto range recorded the cantata, male (as in Bach's time, also called altus or countertenor) and female (contralto or mezzo-soprano), including Alfred Deller, Maureen Forrester, René Jacobs, Julia Hamari, Paul Esswood, Jochen Kowalski, Nathalie Stutzmann, Andreas Scholl, Michael Chance, Guillemette Laurens, Magdalena Kožená and Robin Blaze.

Secretary of the Expediency Discernment Council and former Chief Commander of the Sepah Mohsen Rezaee launched his campaign in June 2010 for the 2013 Iranian presidential election after losing in the previous election. Rezaee made the announcement that he would run for President on 16 October 2012. He was the candidate of the Moderation and Development Party, a conservative party. He was also supported by Green Party of Iran. He lost the election, receiving 3,884,412 votes and ranking fourth behind winner Hassan Rouhani, runner-up Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and Saeed Jalili.
Background
2005 and 2009 nomination
Rezaee was a candidate of the presidential election of 2005, but withdrew on 15 June 2005, only two days before the election. He mentioned he was withdrawing from the race for "the integration of the votes of the nation" and "their effectiveness". He did not endorse any candidate. On 23 April 2009, he announced that he had entered the 2009 presidential race, after trying to find another conservative to run against President Ahmadinejad; he lost.
Positions
Rezaee was a military commander during Iran–Iraq War and also became chief of Sepah (Iran's second army) after the assassination of Mostafa Chamran. He held this position until 1997 when he announced his retirement from all military services. After that, he became a member of Expediency Discernment Council and also its secretary after six months. Tabnak, a news website, is close to him.
Early stages
Rezaee was one of the candidates who began his campaign just months after the 2009 election. His campaign headquarters was begun in early 2010.
Announcement
Mohsen Rezaee announced he would run for the presidency on 16 October 2012 during a trip to Tabriz.
Headquarters
The campaign was based in Tehran in Tajrish street, in a blue twelve-floor tower.
Political platform
His major goal was about economics. He had a federalism platform and said he would do the same as People's Republic of China and Turkey had done in their economics. He also proposed green subsidies for farmers. He also had packages for resolving problems in foreign affairs relations and for the nuclear program of Iran.
Potential vice presidents and cabinet members
He said that he would install a woman as head of the Central Bank and a famous economist as his Minister of Finance. He also said he would use Sunni Muslims in his cabinet.
Polls
His chance in the polls was high before the candidates registered. After the nomination of other conservative candidates like Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf and Saeed Jalili, Rezaee's chance became lower.

Esoteric Buddhism is a book originally published in 1883 in London; it was compiled by a member of the Theosophical Society, A. P. Sinnett. It was one of the first books written for the purpose of explaining theosophy to the general public, and was "made up of the author's correspondence with an Indian mystic." This is the most significant theosophical work of the author. According to Goodrick-Clarke, it "disseminated the basic teachings of Theosophy in its new Asian cast."
From history of compilation
Through the mediation of Blavatsky Sinnett began a correspondence in 1880 with the two adepts, who sponsored the Theosophical Society, the mahatmas Kuthumi and Morya. Hammer noted that between 1880 and 1884 Sinnett received from the mahatmas circa one hundred twenty letters with explanation of "occult cosmology". From this material, he attempted to formulate in his new book "the basis of a revised theosophy." By foundation of the book became "Cosmological notes" received from the Mahatma Morya together with a long series of answers to questions sent by mahatma Kuthumi during the summer of 1882.Subba Row received from his Master mahatma Morya the instruction to provide assistance to Sinnett in his work on the book, but, according to the memoirs of the author, he did it reluctantly, and with little help. The main help came from the mahatmas through Blavatsky in the form of answers to the questions referred to her by the author.

In preface to the original edition author says that exoteric Buddhism "has remained in closer union with the esoteric doctrine" than any other world religion. Thus, specification of the "inner knowledge" addressed to modern readers will be connected with the familiar features of the Buddhist teaching. Sinnett argues that esoteric teaching "be most conveniently studied in its Buddhist aspect."
Esoteric teachers
At the beginning of the first chapter the author makes the following statement:
"I am bringing to my readers knowledge which I have obtained by favour rather than by effort. It will not be found the less valuable on that account; I venture, on the contrary, to declare that it will be found of incalculably greater value, easily as I have obtained it, than any results in a similar direction which I could possibly have procured by ordinary methods of research."
On the question of the whereabouts of his teachers Sinnett says that for a long time in Tibet there is a "certain secret region," hitherto unknown and inaccessible to ordinary people and for those living in the surrounding mountains as well as for visitors, "in which adepts have always congregated. But the country generally was not in Buddha's time, as it has since become, the chosen habitation of the great brotherhood. Much more than they are at present, were the Mahatmas in former times, distributed about the world." But the development of civilization has led to the fact that many occultists gathered in Tibet. The system of rules and laws for them has been developed in the 14th century by Tsong-ka-pa.
The constitution of man
The author argues that "a complete, or perfect man" is made up of seven elements:
The Physical Body (Rūpa).
Vitality (Prana, or Jiva).
Astral Body (Linga Sharira).
Animal Soul (Kāma Rūpa).
Human Soul (Manas).
Spiritual Soul (Buddhi).
Spirit (Ātma).
The world periods
A French philosopher René Guénon stated that the central place of the Theosophical doctrine [which there is in Sinnett's book] is occupied the "idea of evolution." He then wrote that, according to the Theosophical teaching, there are
"seven 'mother-races' succeed one another in the course of a 'world period', that is to say while the 'wave of life' sojourns on a given planet. Each 'race' includes seven 'sub-races', each of which is divided into seven 'branches'. On the other hand, the 'wave of life' successively runs through seven globes in a 'round', and this 'round' is repeated seven times in a same 'planetary chain', after which the 'wave of life' passes to another 'chain', composed likewise of seven planets which will be traversed seven times in their turn. Thus there are seven 'chains' in a 'planetary system', also called an 'enterprise of evolution'; and finally, our solar system is formed of ten 'planetary systems'... We are presently in the fifth 'race' of our 'world period', and in the fourth 'round' of the 'chain' of which the earth forms part and in which it occupies the fourth rank. This 'chain' is also the fourth of our 'planetary system'."
Man after death
In the fifth chapter of his book, Sinnett explains the fate of man after death. Of the seven components that make up our personality, the three lower at the time of physical death, moving away from us. The four upper components move on Kama loca, and "from there [soul] proceed to Devachan, a kind of theosophical version of heaven." (The analogy should not be carried overly; Sinnett argues that Devachan is a state, not a place.) Then these four components divide themselves, the law of karma specifies that it will happen to them—different souls receive different devachanic experience. Only after a long stay in this state, the soul reincarnates. New incarnations on the earth plane are actually rather rare, "but re-birth in less than fifteen hundred years is spoken of as almost impossible."
Sinnett says that the mediums contact with the inhabitants of Devachan, but very rare, and in this time occurs the following:
"The spirit of the sensitive, getting odylized, so to say, by the aura of the spirit in the Devachan, becomes for a few minutes that departed personality, and writes in the handwriting of the latter, in his language and in his thoughts, as they were during his lifetime. The two spirits become blended in one, and the preponderance of one over the other during such phenomena determines the preponderance of personality in the characteristic exhibited. Thus it may incidentally be observed, what is called rapport, is, in plain fact, an identity of molecular vibration between the astral part of the incarnate medium and the astral part of the disincarnate personality."
Occult philosophy
Lavoie noted that in Sinnett's book there are the two major questions – "the structure of the universe and spiritual evolution." He selected "some key terms" in the book.
Avitchi is a state "of punishment reached only in exceptional cases and by exceptional natures." The usual man will work his karma out in a new incarnation.
Devachan is a state of the greatest bliss where "the levels of intensity and the duration of stay are based on the karma one produces in his/her lifetime."
Eighth sphere is a planet associated with our planetary chain that is more materialistic than the earth. The Soul in the mean of the fifth round "can be sent to the eighth sphere for annihilation if it has developed a positive attraction to materialism and a repulsion of spirituality."
Kama loca are "an unconscious state of gestation. It is here that the fourth principle (the animal soul) is separated from the others." The fourth component and some of the fifth component stays in Kama loca while "the rest of the principles continue on in their spiritual evolution." The Ego's duration in Kama loca can last from few moments to years.
Manvantara is a period of activity or manifestation. There are three different manvantaras: 1) the mahamanvantara, 2) the solar manvantara, 3) the minor manvantara.
Monad is upper triad of the seven principles of man (Atma-Buddhi-Manas).
Pralaya is a state of nonbeing. "Pralaya is described by Sinnett as a type of sleep, rest, or a time of inactivity." There are three different pralayas: 1) the mahapralaya, 2) the solar pralaya, 3) the minor pralaya.
Round is a full turnover via the seven globes. "During each round there is a maximum of 120 incarnations for each monad in each race with the average of 8,000 years between incarnations."
Man begins as a monad and dwells in seven major races on each of the seven planets. Each race takes circa one million years. Only 12,000 of those will be used for objective existence on the planets. The rest of that time will be used mainly in a subjective existence on the devachanic plane. "This meant that out of one million years – 988,000 years are spent reaping the effects of karma." A branch race is one of seven belonging to a subrace, itself one of seven belonging to a main race. "If each monad in each race incarnates once, the total number of incarnations in each globe would be 343 (7 branch races x 7 subraces x 7 root races); however, each monad incarnates typically at a minimum of two times and some even more frequently." In Mahatma Letters it is said that "one life in each of the seven root-races; seven lives in each of the 49 sub-races – or 7 x 7 x 7 = 343 and add 7 more. And then a series of lives in offshoot and branchlet races; making the total incarnations of man in each station or planet 777."
Theosophical Buddha
The ninth chapter of Sinnett's book called "Buddha". It begins with the words:
"The historical Buddha, as known to the custodians of the esoteric doctrine, is a personage whose birth is not invested with the quaint marvels popular story has crowded round it. Nor was his progress to adeptship traced by the literal occurrence of the supernatural struggles depicted in symbolic legend. On the other hand, the incarnation, which may outwardly be described as the birth of Buddha, is certainly not regarded by occult science as an event like any other birth, nor the spiritual development through which Buddha passed during his earth-life a mere process of intellectual evolution, like the mental history of any other philosopher. The mistake which ordinary European writers make in dealing with a problem of this sort lies in their inclination to treat exoteric legend either as a record of a miracle about which no more need be said, or as pure myth, putting merely a fantastic decoration on a remarkable life."
According to Lopez, author of Esoteric Buddhism "has a broader view of the Buddha" than that of Western Buddhologists and scholars of Oriental studies. Sinnett stated that the Buddha is simply one of a row "of adepts who have appeared over the course of the centuries." Buddha's next incarnation happened approximately sixty years after his death. He appeared as Shankara, the well-known Vedantic philosopher. Sinnett noted that for the uninitiated it is known that date of Shankara's birth is one thousand years after Buddha's death, and that he was hostile to Buddhism. Sinnett wrote that the Buddha came as Shankara "to fill up some gaps and repair certain errors in his own previous teaching." The Buddha had departed "from the practice of earlier adepts by opening the path" to adeptship to men of all castes. "Although well-intentioned, this led" to a deterioration of occult knowledge when it was penetrated into ignominious hands. Sinnett wrote that to further appeared a need "to take no candidates except from the class which, on the whole, by reason of its hereditary advantages, is likely to be the best nursery of fit candidates."Sinnett claimed that the Buddha's next incarnation was as the great Tibetan adept reformer of the 14th century Tsong-ka-pa.
Against blind faith
In the tenth chapter Sinnett expresses (as well as the Mahatmas) his very negative attitude to religiosity of any kind. He argues:
"Nothing can produce more disastrous effects on human progress, as regards the destiny of individuals, than the very prevalent notion that one religion followed out in a pious spirit, is as good as another, and that if such and such doctrines are perhaps absurd when you look into them, the great majority of good people will never think of their absurdity, but will recite them in a blamelessly devoted attitude of mind."
Criticism
The presence of a secret or esoteric teaching in Buddhism is "not accepted by orthodox Buddhist." For example, Rhys Davids wrote:
"In this connection, I shall doubtless be expected to say a few words on Theosophy, if only because one of the books giving an account of that very curious and widely spread movement has been called Esoteric Buddhism. It has always been a point of wonder to me why the author should have chosen this particular title for his treatise. For if there is anything that can be said with absolute certainty about the book it is, that it is not esoteric, and not Buddhism. The original Buddhism was the very contrary of esoteric."
Guénon's opinion on the subject was the same. He wrote that never was genuine "esoteric Buddhism." The ancient Buddhism was substantially an exoteric teaching "serving as theoretical support for a social movement with egalitarian tendencies." According to Guénon, Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make Theosophism known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks."
Some Theosophists did not share the views presented by Sinnett in his new work; for example, according to Kingsford, this book was very distant from the esoteric, and the main mistake of the author was that he thought about the symbols as reality.
New editions and translations
After its first publication in 1883 the book was reprinted several times: in the same 1883 came 2nd edition, in 1885 – 5th, 1898 – 8th. This work has been translated into several European languages: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian.

Actinocyclus is a genus of diatoms in the family Hemidiscaceae.
In 2006, a study was carried out which included finding traces of extinct Actinocylidae in Russia, which ultimately assisted geologists in dating its prevalence and significance to history. Out of 7236 samples found, they concluded that this species belongs to a group of known as Actinocyclus gorbunovii. Freshwater species of Actinocyclus were also found to have a major part in playing a stratigraphic marker, also known as an estimated time in which geologists can use to help order things in a sequence of events. Using K–Ar dating, scientists concluded that Actinocyclus species were found to be most optimal in the middle-age Miocene era.

Israel Bonds is the commonly-known name of Development Corporation for Israel (DCI), the U.S. underwriter of debt securities issued by the State of Israel. DCI is headquartered in New York City, and is a broker-dealer and member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Dani Naveh is president and CEO.
Bonds are sold in Canada through Canada-Israel Securities, Ltd. and in Europe through Development Company for Israel (UK) Ltd. Sales have increased steadily since the initial Independence Issue was offered in 1951, with total worldwide sales exceeding $47 billion.
Initially, investors in Israel bonds were largely Jews who wanted to help Israel. However, private and institutional investors alike viewed Israel bonds as an investment. Over 90 U.S. state and municipal pension and treasury funds have invested more than $3 billion in Israel bonds to date. Other investors in Israel bonds include corporations, insurance companies, associations, unions, banks, financial institutions, universities, foundations and synagogues. Israel uses the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds for general purposes of the state. Bonds cannot be sold or transferred. Sales of Israel bonds have increased during times of crisis for Israel.
History
1950 to 1951
The idea to float bonds issued by Israel's government was conceived by Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, when Israel was short on economic resources and did not have access to capital markets.
Ben-Gurion turned to the Diaspora community for help. Ben-Gurion's goals were to obtain millions of dollars in funding for immigrant absorption and the construction of national infrastructure and to engage Diaspora Jewry as active partners in building the new Jewish state. In September 1950, he convened a meeting of American Jewish leaders at Jerusalem's King David Hotel, where he proposed issuing bonds to raise funding. The Knesset voted to launch Israel's first bond issue in February 1951. The American Jewish leaders supported Ben-Gurion's plan and, in May 1951, the prime minister traveled to New York City to help launch the inaugural Independence Issue at a Madison Square Garden ceremony, raising $35 million. Expectations for first-year sales were $25 million. Instead, final results for 1951 more than doubled projections, exceeding $52 million.
1952 to 1966
By September 1952, $140 million had been raised. Proceeds were used to help fund projects in Israel's industrial and agricultural sectors, including the Dead Sea Works and National Water Carrier.
By 1957, "bond sales alone amount(ed) to an astonishing 35% of Israel's special development budget." Foreign Minister Golda Meir emphatically stated, "the central role in building our economic strength has been played by Israel bonds."
1967 to 1992
Over subsequent decades, sales continued to increase, particularly in times of crisis. During 1967's Six-Day War, sales exceeded $250 million, and in 1973, the year of the Yom Kippur War, sales exceeded $500 million. From the mid-1980s to 1992, the bonds were the primary way the Israeli government obtained external funding.
In 1991, the year of the Gulf War and Iraqi missile strikes on Israel, sales exceeded $1 billion.
1993 to Present
In October 2011, Israel Bonds launched an eCommerce site to facilitate investing in Israel bonds online.
In 2013, U.S. Israel bond sales surpassed $1.12 billion, the first time domestic sales exceeded $1 billion. Sales exceeded $1 billion in each of the 5 following years.
In June 2016, the Bonds organization launched a new initiative to counter anti-Israel activism on campus. Entitled "The Alternative BDS - Bonds Donated to Schools," the program encourages donations of Israel bonds to universities.
In October 2016, Israel Maimon became the organization's president & CEO.
In 2021, Israel bonds are expected to raise $1.3 billion, including $1.1 billion from the United States.
Securities
Initially, Israel Bonds offered one security. As the program became more successful, multiple investment options were made available. The following bonds are currently offered:
Jubilee Bonds – fixed rate 2, 3, 5,10 and 15-year bonds; $25,000 minimum investment and increments of $5,000. Interest is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1.
Maccabee Bonds – fixed rate 2, 3,5, 10 and 15-year bonds; $5,000 minimum investment and increments of $500. Interest is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1.
Sabra Bonds – fixed rate 3-year bonds; $1,000 minimum investment and increments of $100. Interest is paid upon maturity.
Mazel Tov Bonds – fixed rate 5-year bonds; $100 minimum investment and increments of $10, limited to $2500 per month for each purchaser and holder. Interest paid upon maturity.
eMazel Tov Bonds – fixed rate 5-year bonds; $36 minimum investment and increments of $1. Maximum allowable amount purchased by one person during each monthly sales period, registered in the name of one holder, is $2,500; interest paid at maturity. Only available online.
Jubilee Fixed Rate Financing Bonds – 2-year bonds; minimum subscription of $100,000 and increments of $25,000; interest paid every May 1st and November 1st.
Although Israel has never defaulted in the payment of principal or interest on any of its internal or external debt, prospective purchasers are warned of sovereign credit risk.

"TVC 15" is a song by English musician David Bowie, released on his 1976 album Station to Station. RCA Records later released it as the second single from the album on 30 April 1976. The song was recorded in late 1975 at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles. Co-produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin, the recording featured guitarists Carlos Alomar and Earl Slick, bassist George Murray, drummer Dennis Davis, pianist Roy Bittan and Warren Peace on backing vocals. The upbeat song is mostly art rock performed in a style reminiscent of the 1950s. Lyrically, the song concerns a character's girlfriend being eaten by a television set. It was inspired by a dream of Iggy Pop's and Bowie's role in The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). Some lyrics are also influenced by the Yardbirds and Kraftwerk.
Upon release as a single, "TVC 15" peaked at number 33 on the UK Singles Chart and number 64 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Its release coincided with the European leg of the Isolar tour. Initial reviews praised the song as one of the album's highlights, although some reviewers found the lyrics difficult to comprehend. Later reviews continue to praise the song, with some considering it one of Bowie's best. It has appeared on several compilation albums and was remixed by Maslin in 2010 for reissues of Station to Station and remastered in 2016 for the Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976) box set.
Recording
After completing his work on The Man Who Fell to Earth in September 1975, David Bowie returned to Los Angeles to begin recording his next album. Personnel-wise, Bowie brought back the same team used for "Fame": co-producer Harry Maslin, guitarists Carlos Alomar and Earl Slick, drummer Dennis Davis and Bowie's old friend Geoff MacCormick (credited as Warren Peace), while bassist George Murray was recruited to play bass; pianist Roy Bittan, a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, joined the sessions in mid-October. For the studio, Bowie and Maslin chose Los Angeles's Cherokee Studios, which featured five different studio rooms, 24-track mixing consoles, 24-hour session times, and a lounge bar.
Recording for the new album began in late September 1975 and ended in late November. Recording for "TVC 15" began shortly after the completion of "Golden Years". Like the majority of the album, the song's elements were primarily built in the studio rather than written before. According to biographer Chris O'Leary, the dual guitars on "TVC 15" "out-grew" the 24-track mixing console, requiring Maslin to "keep bouncing down guitar and vocal dubs". Bowie later remembered almost nothing of the album's production, due to his heavy cocaine use during the sessions.
Composition
Musically, "TVC 15" is described as art rock, while O'Leary calls it an "avant-garde novelty song". The writers of Rolling Stone later found the track to be a mix of new wave and boogie-woogie. According to David Buckley, it is the most upbeat track on the album. James Perone notes the music as " a pseudo-late-1950s style", comparing it to the sound of the American group Sha Na Na. NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, who call the track "incongruously jolly", note an influence of the Yardbirds, as evident by the opening "oh-OH-oh-OH-OH", which is borrowed from the Yardbirds' 1964 song "Good Morning Little School Girl". O'Leary describes the "Oh my TVC 15" refrain as "half-mantra, half-jingle". Music critic Robert Christgau noted the track's "spaceyness" and blend of "Lou Reed, disco, and Dr. John", while Ultimate Classic Rocks Michael Gallucci found influences of krautrock.
The song is primarily in the key of C major, featuring a blues-style chord progression in the verses, with an additional F minor sprinkled throughout. The bridges are in F7/A7, containing a Kraftwerk-inspired sequence of "trans-sition" and "trans-mission" lines. These are undercut by Alomar plucking on his guitar's B string. Alomar described his and Slick's guitars as "drones": "The music would stay in one place and just keep going." Alomar later revealed that Bowie "really wanted [the nature of the track] fucked up like when we did [the Lodger track] 'Boys Keep Swinging', kind of loose and stupid. But then when it got to the end, he really wanted it to drive home." Perone notes that the guitars during the ending section move into late-1970s hard rock territory, while simultaneously including a "rhythmic stumble that suggests changing meters", which he believes provides a direct musical link to the album's title track.
Lyrically, Pegg calls "TVC 15" the album's "odd man out". Described by multiple commentators as a "surreal comedy", the song concerns a character's girlfriend being eaten by a television set. The narrator mourns her ("My baby's in there someplace") and is left staring at the TVC 15; he knows the only way he and his girlfriend will reunite is if he ventures into the set. The subject matter was inspired by a dream of Iggy Pop's featuring a similar premise, as well as a scene in The Man Who Fell to Earth in which Bowie's character, Thomas Jerome Newton, fills a room with television screens, each tuned to a different channel. The song also contains religious themes, which are prevalent on numerous Station to Station tracks. Writing for the Spin Alternative Record Guide, Rob Sheffield interpreted "TVC 15" as "Major Tom appear[ing] as a woman who beams herself to a satellite, leaving poor David stranded on earth."
Release
RCA released Station to Station on 23 January 1976, with "TVC 15" sequenced as the first track on side two of the original LP. It was then released in edited form as the second single from the album on 30 April 1976, with the Diamond Dogs track "We Are the Dead" as the B-side and the catalogue number RCA 2682. Its release coincided with the European leg of the Isolar tour. It peaked at number 33 on the UK Singles Chart and number 64 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song was also a top 20 hit in Sweden. Pegg notes that the same year Bowie recorded "TVC 15", Helen Reddy topped the US charts with the single "Angie Baby", which featured a similar premise to "TVC 15", where a boy is devoured by a transistor radio.
"TVC 15" was performed throughout the Isolar, 1978 Isolar II, 1983 Serious Moonlight and 1990 Sound+Vision tours. A performance from the first Isolar tour was included on Live Nassau Coliseum '76 (2017), while performances from the Isolar II tour have appeared on Stage (1978) and Welcome to the Blackout (2018). The song was also a part of Bowie's set during an appearance on Saturday Night Live in December 1979. For this performance, Bowie wore a what O'Leary calls a "pencil skirt" with high heels while a "stuffed pink poodle" held a television screen in its mouth; he was joined on stage by Klaus Nomi and Joey Arias. Years later, Bowie performed the song at Live Aid in 1985. This performance featured saxophone by Clare Hurst and piano by Thomas Dolby. AllMusic's Dave Thompson found Bowie's choice to play the song as a "far cry" from the mostly the greatest hits setlists of other performers at the event.
Reception
"TVC 15" received very positive reviews from music critics on release, including from Ian MacDonald, who called it an "objective masterpiece" in Street Life magazine. Reviewing the record for The Village Voice, Christgau expressed some reservations about the length of the songs and the detached quality of Bowie's vocals, but deemed "TVC 15" his "favorite piece of rock and roll in a very long time" and wrote, "spaceyness has always been his shtick, and anybody who can merge Lou Reed, disco, and Dr. John ... deserves to keep doing it for five minutes and 29 seconds." Meanwhile, John Ingham of Sounds magazine gave immense praise to Station, naming "Golden Years", "TVC 15" and "Stay" some of Bowie's best songs up to that point. Ingham found the lyrics difficult to comprehend, including on "TVC 15", but felt that adds to the track's overall charm. Cash Box said that "the music is exuberant ragtime rock, filled with hooks and that "Bowie's voice is in excellent form, and he really pushes himself." As Station to Station was Bowie's first album not to include a lyric sheet in its packaging, its absence was felt by Teri Moris of Rolling Stone when listening to "TVC 15".
"TVC 15" has continued to be viewed in a positive light, with Spin magazine calling it one of the album's highlights. Consequence of Sounds Frank Mojica stated that although it gives the impression of being a "straightforward piano-rocker" at its start, by its end it becomes the album's "most compelling song after the title track". Mojo magazine later listed it as Bowie's 15th greatest song in 2015. Following Bowie's death, Rolling Stone named it one of the 30 most essential songs of Bowie's catalogue, calling it the "catchiest tune" on Station to Station. In a 2016 list ranking every Bowie single from worst to best, Ultimate Classic Rock placed "TVC 15" at number 12.
Subsequent releases
"TVC 15" has appeared on several compilation albums. The single edit has featured on The Best of Bowie (1980), The Singles Collection (1993), The Best of David Bowie 1974/1979 (1998), and Best of Bowie (2002); the full-length album version appears on Fame and Fashion (1984) and the Sound + Vision box set (1989). The single edit also appeared on the Christiane F. soundtrack in 1981.
Station to Station was reissued in 2010 and released in different special and deluxe editions. Included in both editions was a new stereo mix of the album created by co-producer Maslin. In The Complete David Bowie, Pegg is critical of Maslin's remix. He writes that it "surrenders all the subtlety of the original [mix] in favour of unimaginatively pushing everything to the front", resulting in a "messy racket", particularly evident in the backing vocals for "TVC 15".
The song, and its parent album, was remastered in 2016 for the Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976) box set, with an individual CD release made available the following year. Both the original mix and 2010 Maslin mix were included.

XPRESS was launched in the UAE on 15 March 2007 as a free weekly newspaper and competitor to the likes of 7DAYS and Emirates Today. XPRESS was set up as a multicultural community paper for all UAE residents, both UAE nationals and expatriates.
The magazine, published in Dubai by the Al Nisr Group as a sister paper to Gulf News, covers news, leisure and entertainment and sports, with an emphasis on the local.
Development and launch
Work on XPRESS – then known as Project X – began in the basement of the Gulf News offices off Sheikh Zayed Road near Safa Park in early 2005. Rumours of the secret project began to leak into the UAE media industry over the next few months, but the details of the publication – including its name – remained a closely guarded secret until its launch was announced on 12 March 2007.
Initial media reports indicated that Al Nisr Media intended to publish XPRESS twice weekly, and hoped to obtain a licence to publish daily.
However, by the time it launched, XPRESS itself confirmed it would be published once a week, on Thursdays. The publishers have not confirmed whether they intend to seek a daily licence from the Dubai authorities.
The newspaper was designed by Mario Garcia, president of the Tampa-based Garcia Media, who described it as "a vibrant, contemporary newspaper totally created for the reader of the 'always on' culture".
Reception from Dubai's media circle to the inaugural issue was mixed, with one pundit describing it as "a headache on every page" and accusing it of running parochial stories. However, the same reporter praised the new paper's dedication to printing original stories and said it helped fulfill a growing desire for local news in fast-growing Dubai.
Since 2009 Xpress has been reduced in pages, and has let a number of staff go. As part of its downsizing, its own dedicated website was absorbed by Gulf News.
In March 2013, XPRESS launched an Abu Dhabi edition.
Mazhar Farooqui is the editor for both editions.
Distribution
Al Nisr Media print between 80,000 and 100,000 copies of XPRESS for distribution every Thursday.
The primary means of distribution are newspaper stands in many of Dubai's petrol stations, with others in apartment block foyers and malls. Subscribers to XPRESS'''s sister paper, the paid-for Gulf News'', have copies delivered to their homes on a Thursday or Friday.

Felicia macrorrhiza is a small, evergreen shrub in the family Asteraceae. This species grows in the Karoo region of South Africa. It is called Aspoestertjie in Afrikaans.
It is more or less strongly branched, growing up to high. It has narrow leaves, crowded on the younger stems, which leave a dry, persistent leaf base on older branches. The flower heads lack ray florets but contain many yellow disc florets.
Description
Felicia macrorrhiza is an evergreen, more or less strongly branched dwarf shrub of up to high, with a strongly gnarled woody base. The branches are covered with gray brown bark and some long hairs. Older branches are densely set with persistent dry leaf bases, the younger ones with leaves. The leaves are alternately set, linear, sometimes spoon-shaped, more or less succulent, 1–2 cm long and wide, with up to wide, pale, ciliate margin, the inner base with long woolly hairs, evenly long-haired.
The large flower heads are set individually on top sparingly hairy, towards the top more densely hairy, up to long stalks with some small leaves along their lengths. The involucre is about 1 cm in diameter and consists of about four rows of lance-shaped, green, overlapping bracts, often with the margin tinged reddish, hardly papery and ciliate towards the tip. The outer involucral bracts are about long and wide with long hairs, the inner bracts long and 1 mm wide with fewer long hairs. The flower heads never have ray florets. There are many disc florets with a yellow corolla of up to long, in the center of each of these are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. At the tip of both style branches is a triangular appendage. Around the base of the corolla are many yellowish white pappus bristles of two different lengths. The longer pappus bristles are about long, toothed, with a long pointy tip. The shorter pappus bristles are up to 1 mm long. Below the base of each corolla is a red-brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruit called cypsela that is about long and wide, inverted egg-shape in outline, with a slight ridge along the edge. The surface has few scales and long silky hairs, often with a narrow hairless zone bordering the edge.
Heads without ray florets also occur from time to time in related species of the section Lignofelicia, in particular F. whitehillensis, F. filifolia subsp. bodkinii and subsp. schaeferi.
Taxonomy
This species of daisy were first described in 1800 by Carl Thunberg, who named it Aster macrorrhizus. In 1836, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle assigned Thunberg's type to the genus Felicia, so creating Felicia macrorrhiza. He also described another collection in the same publication, which he called Fresenia scaposa. When Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel accepted De Candole's name, a printing error was made, and the name Fresenia stuposa was published in 1840. In 1917, John Hutchinson distinguished Fresenia nana. In 1973, Jürke Grau considered all these names synonymous to Felicia macrorrhiza. The species is considered part of the section Lignofelicia.
Conservation
The continued survival of Felicia macrorrhiza is considered to be of the least concern because its population is stable.

Global neurosurgery is a field at the intersection of public health and clinical neurosurgery. It aims to expand provision of improved and equitable neurosurgical care globally.
Definition and history
Global neurosurgery is "the clinical and public health practice of neurosurgery with the primary purpose of ensuring timely, safe, and affordable neurosurgical care to all who need it." The term global neurosurgery was first used in 1995 by Canadian neurosurgeon Dwight Parkinson to describe comprehensive clinical neurosurgery care in Manitoba; however, the field as defined today was born in the mid-2010s. The modern definition of global neurosurgery was born from a combination of global health and neurosurgery. Hence, global neurosurgery is conceived as a subspecialty of global health within global surgery.
Burden of diseases amenable to neurosurgery
Around 22.6 million people are affected by diseases amenable to neurosurgery each year, and 13.8 million require surgical intervention. The burden of diseases amenable to neurosurgery is disproportionately distributed globally, with low- and middle-income countries bearing more than 78.1% of cases. Low- and middle-income countries lack the workforce, infrastructure, funding, and data needed to address the disease burden. High-income country patients, especially in rural areas and from economically-disadvantaged backgrounds, face unique challenges in accessing safe, timely, and affordable neurosurgical care. For this reason, most global neurosurgery work has focused on access to care in low- and middle-incomce countries despite the global nature of disparities in accessing neurosurgical care.
Practice
Global neurosurgery practice involves advocacy, education, policy, research, and service delivery. The components of global neurosurgery practice are interdependent but global neurosurgeons tend to focus their practice on one or two of them. This trend has allowed for specialization within the field and greater collaboration between individuals and institutions.
Advocacy
Advocacy efforts happen at the international, regional, and local levels and in collaboration with health initiatives that share similar goals with global neurosurgery - universal health coverage and sustainable development. Internationally, global neurosurgery advocacy groups participate in high-level health policy events like the World Health Assembly and the United Nations General Assembly. Global neurosurgery advocates have contributed to numerous high-level decisions including folate fortification, detection and management of congenital malformations, and injury prevention. Locally, global neurosurgery advocacy groups are constituted of health workers and other patient advocates. These groups affect local decision making but they are equally active internationally. Many local advocacy groups are members of international advocacy groups like the G4 Alliance, People and Organisations United for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus (PUSH!) Global Alliance, and International Federation Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus (IFSBH). Local global neurosurgery advocacy groups work within these international organizations to coordinate advocacy efforts regionally and globally.
Education
Global neurosurgery education focuses on two aspects. First, global neurosurgery educators train specialists to serve under-resourced regions. The training focuses primarily on safe and quality service delivery within underserved communities. These global neurosurgery education efforts can be divided into non-specialized and specialized training. Non-specialized training or education for task-sharing/-shifting targets non-specialized healthcare workers such as general surgeons, clinical officers, and general practitioners. Non-specialized training is especially important in increasing access to essential and emergency neurosurgical care rapidly. Non-specialized training, unlike specialized training, can be done in shorter periods, with larger cohorts, and with fewer resources. Specialized neurosurgery training can last anywhere from a few months to 8 years depending on the training level. Postgraduate medical fellowships in one of the neurosurgical subspecialties are open to graduate neurosurgery residents/registrars and can last between three and 24 months. On the other hand, neurosurgery residencies last between 4 and 8 years.
The other focus of global neurosurgery education is fellowships that introduce trainees to global and public health concepts. Global neurosurgery fellowships are relatively new but increasingly popular with institutions like Cambridge, Cornell, Duke, Harvard, and the University of Cape Town offering specialized training.
Policy
Global neurosurgeons contribute significantly to the design and implementation of health policies that improve access to safe, timely, and affordable neurosurgical care globally. Prime examples of global neurosurgery policy efforts include the comprehensive health policy guidelines for traumatic brain and spine injuries and for spina bifida and hydrocephalus. The comprehensive policy guidelines address challenges that affect the patient continuum of care and suggest solutions for every component of the healthcare system. These documents were designed for policymakers in areas with a large burden of diseases amenable to neurosurgery. Traumatic brain and spine injuries were chosen because they constitute more than 47.1% of the global neurosurgical disease burden while hydrocephalus and spina bifida were chosen for their deleterious impact on children.
Research
Research is an indispensable aspect of global neurosurgery practice called academic global neurosurgery. Academic global neurosurgery has a broad focus and uses concepts from epidemiology, health economics, health policy, health services, health systems, implementation & dissemination science, and patient safety & quality improvement research. Academic global neurosurgery's exponential growth since 2016 is the result of increased interest and support from the neurosurgical community characterized by the creation of an ad-hoc committee within the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies, publication of special issues in reputable peer-reviewed journals, creation of a specialized journal, and the creation of global neurosurgery centers. Academic global neurosurgery identifies challenges to accessing neurosurgical care and proposes solutions that increase access to care. The evidence generated by academic global neurosurgery informs the other aspects of global neurosurgery practice.
Service delivery
Service delivery is the oldest component of global neurosurgery practice and can be traced back to the colonial era when surgeons would deliver care in colonies. Global neurosurgery aims to reduce barriers to essential and emergency neurosurgery procedures such as those needed for acute stroke, neural tube defects, traumatic brain injuries, and traumatic spine injuries.
Low- and middle-income country patients have worse outcomes than their high-income country counterparts because they regularly face barriers to accessing timely and safe neurosurgical care.
The workforce deficit in low- and middle-income countries constitutes a significant barrier to receiving care. Although former colonies have trained local neurosurgeons since their independence, the neurosurgical workforce density in many low- and middle-income countries remains below the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies' recommendation of 1 neurosurgeon per 200,000 people. In addition, the majority of low- and middle income countries have geographical disparities in the neurosurgical workforce with most neurosurgeons working in urban areas whereas the majority of people in these countries are rural-dwellers. In addition, surgical non-governmental organizations from high-income countries help fill the service delivery gap in some low- and middle-income countries. Although most neurosurgical non-governmental organizations offer short-term service delivery in low- and middle-income countries, some like CURE International offer long-term care.
The neurosurgical workforce in low- and middle-income countries has increased gradually in the past decade thanks to targeted efforts from the global neurosurgery community. For example, the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies supports the training of aspiring neurosurgeons from understaffed countries through scholarships at accredited centers in Africa, Asia, and South America.
Young neurosurgeons from under-resourced regions who have been trained in advanced neurosurgical techniques report their patients do not get safe and timely care because of inadequate infrastructure. Access to neurosurgical infrastructure can be assessed summarily using the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies facility three-tier classification or using hospital assessment tools. The World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies facility three-tier classification groups facilities into level 1 (equipment for emergency neurosurgery procedures), level 2 (equipment to perform basic microneurosurgical procedures), and level 3 (equipment for complex and advanced neurosurgery).

Albert Talmon Morgan (June 9, 1842April 15, 1922) was an American farmer and politician. During the Civil War he served as a Union Army officer in the famed Iron Brigade of the Army of the Potomac. A Republican, he was elected to office in Mississippi during Reconstruction and was a delegate to the convention which produced Mississippi's new constitution after the American Civil War. He was forced to flee the state in 1875 due to White terrorism against Reconstruction. He wrote a memoir of his life in the Reconstruction-era South, called Yazoo: On the Picket Line of Freedom in the South.
Early life
Albert Morgan was born in Theresa, Jefferson County, New York, in 1842. As a child, he moved with his parents to a farm near Fox Lake, Wisconsin, where he was educated and raised. He had been set to attend Oberlin College in Ohio, but at the outbreak of the American Civil War, he abandoned his college plans to volunteer in the Union Army.
Civil War service
Morgan enlisted as a private with Company A of the 2nd Wisconsin Infantry Regiment and went with them to the front in Washington, D.C. The 2nd Wisconsin Infantry was organized with the 6th Wisconsin, 7th Wisconsin, and 19th Indiana regiments into a brigade which soon became famous as the Iron Brigade of the Army of the Potomac.
The 2nd Wisconsin Infantry saw intense fighting through the first two years of the war and suffered heavy casualties. Morgan was wounded and taken prisoner at the Battle of Gainesville, but was subsequently paroled. He was wounded again at the Battle of Gettysburg. He was promoted to corporal, sergeant, and first sergeant in the company, and re-enlisted as a veteran after his term expired in January 1864. He's finally receiving a commission as 2nd lieutenant in March 1864. By June 1864, however, the 2nd Wisconsin Infantry had been so badly decimated by the war, that it could no longer be sustained as a regiment and was instead reconstituted as an independent battalion of two companies. Morgan was designated 1st lieutenant in the independent battalion.
The independent battalion was assigned to provost duty for the division, but participated in further fighting at the Siege of Petersburg. Morgan was wounded again at the Battle of Globe Tavern, but again returned to duty. He was promoted to captain of Company B of the independent battalion in September. The two companies of the independent battalion were absorbed into the 6th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment in November 1864, Morgan's company became Company H of the 6th Wisconsin Infantry.
After the Union took possession of Petersburg and Richmond, the Iron Brigade was instrumental in the Appomattox campaign, the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, and the capture of Confederate president Jefferson Davis. They participated in the Grand Review of the Armies in May 1865, before mustering out of service in July.
Mississippi Reconstruction
After mustering out of the Union Army, Morgan moved to Mississippi with his brother, Charles, in November 1865. They rented a large farm, but ran into problems with the landlord, resulting in months of legal disputes.
Morgan was an avid Republican and became active in Reconstruction politics. He started a Republican newspaper in Yazoo County, and established the first Republican Party organization in the county. In 1868 and 1869, he helped organize, and was then a delegate to the convention to draft a new constitution for Mississippi.
He was elected to the Mississippi Senate in 1869, taking office in 1870. He subsequently was elected chancery clerk of Yazoo County. As a result of his holding the county office, his eligibility to simultaneously serve as senator was called into question. In the Fall of 1873, the Mississippi Legislature passed a law disqualifying Morgan from his Senate seat, along with several other legislators who were also serving as county officers.
Death of F. P. Hilliard
That same Fall, Morgan pursued election as sheriff of Yazoo County. His opponent was Francis P. Hilliard, who had been appointed to the position by the Union military governor—with Morgan's recommendation. In the 1873 election, Morgan won an overwhelming majority. Hilliard did not contest the election, but on the beginning of Morgan's term, Hilliard refused to relinquish access to the sheriff's office at the court house. On January 8, 1874, Morgan, with a band of allies, took possession of the office when Hilliard and his allies were absent.
On hearing this, Hilliard formed a posse of roughly 30 people and marched back to the court house. Morgan went out to speak to him in the street, leaving his brother and a few men in the office. Hilliard ignored him, and took his crowd into the court house. Hilliard broke down the door and was quickly shot by one of the men inside. Both sides then exchanged fire. According to Morgan's testinmony, he feared his brother and friends were in mortal danger. Hilliard was shot in the head at this point, but sources differ on who was responsible. Witnesses agree that Hilliard was walking toward Morgan at the time of the fatal shot. A medical examination suggested that Hilliard was shot in the back of the head.
Morgan immediately surrendered himself to the mayor, and was detained in prison. After several months, however, Morgan was able to secure bail, and subsequently the grand jury failed to produce an indictment against him. He was thus able to resume the office of sheriff in April 1874.
Political violence
In 1874 and 1875, white reactionary violence against reconstruction was reaching a climax in Mississippi. Morgan, as sheriff, received reports of several bands of white men organizing and arming themselves. Morgan reached out to them and heard, in response, that these companies were organizing to defend themselves against rumored black mobs and insurrection. Morgan insisted that if such mobs existed, they were a matter for the sheriff; he offered to accompany them to locate and defuse any such insurrection. Morgan's offers were refused. His own investigations found no black insurrections being planned. Nevertheless, rumors of insurrection persisted through 1875.
The situation reached a climax for Morgan at a September meeting of the county Republican Party. While Morgan was speaking, armed white gangs entered the hall and began disrupting the speech. A shouting match ensued between supporters of either faction, and then gunfire erupted.
Morgan fled the meeting and went into hiding. Armed bands roamed the streets. Under threat of lynching, Morgan left the county. Subsequently, a number of black men and Republicans living in the county were lynched; Republican election tickets and lists were seized and destroyed. The violence succeeded in preventing those populations from participating in the 1875 election and effectively ended reconstruction in Yazoo County.
Morgan left Mississippi in January 1876, and went to Washington, D.C., where he testified at United States Senate hearings on the violence in Mississippi.
Later years
Morgan went on to live in Lawrence, Kansas, and work as a lawyer. In addition to his memoir on Reconstruction, he authored a number of works of financial literature. He subsequently moved to Denver, Colorado, to prospect for gold. Upon the release of the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation, which glorified the actions of the Ku Klux Klan against reconstruction in the south, Morgan spoke out against the film with the historical events he experienced.
Morgan died at Denver on April 15, 1922.
Personal life and family
Morgan was the son of George and Eleanor Morgan, baptist missionaries and avowed abolitionists. He had many siblings, but was most closely associated with his older brother Charles, who also served in the Union Army, and worked with him throughout the Reconstruction effort in Mississippi.
While living in Mississippi Albert Morgan married Carolyn Victoria "Carrie" Highgate, an "Octoroon" school teacher from Ithaca, New York. James Aaron Moore presided at their wedding. The marriage was only legally possible because of Morgan's own efforts in the Mississippi Senate to repeal laws against inter-racial marriage. Morgan's marriage to a woman with black ancestry was another inciting controversy during his time in office.
Carrie was a teacher in post-war Mississippi, and much of Morgan's political efforts in Reconstruction were geared toward developing free education in Yazoo County. They had at least six children, including Angela Morgan, who earned notoriety as a poet.

Lucien-Anatole Prévost-Paradol (8 August 1829 – 20 July 1870) was a French journalist and essayist.
Background
Prévost-Paradol was born in Paris, France, conceived through an irregular liaison between the opera singer Lucinde Paradol and the writer Léon Halévy. When Halévy later married Alexandrine Le Bas, his wife agreed to adopt the child, who was then brought up with their own children.
Education and works
Prévost-Paradol was educated at the College Bourbon and entered the École Normale. In 1855 he was appointed professor of French literature at Aix. He held the post barely a year, resigning it to become a leader-writer on the Journal des débats. He also wrote in the Courrier du dimanche, and for a very short time in the Presse.
His chief works are Essais de politique et de littérature (three series, 1859–1866), and Essais sur les moralistes français (1864). He was, however, rather a journalist than a writer of books, and was one of the chief opponents of the empire on the side of moderate liberalism. He underwent the usual difficulties of a journalist under that regime, and was once imprisoned. In 1865 he was elected to the Académie française.
August Strindberg referred to him in his novel The Growth of a Soul:
Opposition and death
The accession of Émile Ollivier to power was fatal to Prévost-Paradol, who apparently believed in the possibility of a liberal empire, and consequently accepted the appointment of envoy to the United States. This was the signal for the most unmeasured attacks on him from the Republican Party. He had scarcely installed himself in his post before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War occurred. He shot himself at Washington on 19 July 1870, and later died.

Pascual Fort Pascual (Reus, 1927 - Barcelona, 1991) son of writer Jaume Fort i Prats, was a Catalan enameller, printmaker and gallery owner.
From a family of goldsmiths and silversmiths (Joieria Fort in Reus) Pascual Fort dedicated himself to artistic experimentation through printmaking, enamel and reliefs. He settled in Tarragona, where he founded the Galeria Fort, which the artist kept open for ten years (1964-1973) on the Rambla Nova, with his wife Mercè Barberà i Rusiñol. He was part of the artistic groups Cercle Pere Joan and Grup de Tarragona. He soon gained prestige in promoting the innovative art of the time. Both renowned artists (Miró, Rouault...) and promising young people from the Camp de Tarragona exhibited in the gallery. The chronicles of the various events and exhibitions were often collected by collectors and critics such as René Metras, Cirici Pellicer, J. E. Cirlot, Corredor-Matheos, Giralt-Miracle, Miralles and others, interested in the trend of the Pascual Fort gallery.
Pascual Fort and his wife spent several stays in New York —in those times already considered the artistic capital of the world— during the years 1965, 1966 and 1969. In 1965 he set up a workshop in that city, together with Núria Musté, also from Reus. Fort was awarded by the Brooklyn Museum and awarded a scholarship by the Institute of International Education in recognition of his work as an avant-garde artist and promoter.
In 1973, the Fort Barberà couple and their four children moved to Barcelona and Cadaqués. In 1978 Fort won the first prize at the III International Enamel Biennial in Limoges, with an enamel mural of 148 x 128 cm. He exhibited again in New York in 1976.
In 1981, he conceived and carried out the first Mini Print International of Cadaqués, still in force thanks to the drive of his widow. This competition annually invites printmakers from all over the world to take part with works sized 10 x 10 cm (3.9 x 3.9 in). The works of the winners of the previous year, and of all the participants of the current year are exhibited annually during the summer months at the Taller Galeria Fort in Cadaqués and then the exhibition makes an itinerant circuit through several cities of the world.

The siege of Varna () took place between 21 and 24 March 1201 at Varna, on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines. The Bulgarians were victorious and captured the city.
Prelude
After the youngest of the three Asen brothers, Kaloyan, was crowned Emperor in early 1197 he immediately showed his resolution to continue the war with the Byzantines by all means and liberate all Bulgarian lands. In the next year Kaloyan even allied with Ivanko, the murderer of his eldest brother, Ivan Asen.
The siege
At the turn of the new century he seized the strong castle of Constancia (near modern Simeonovgrad) and then struck in the opposite direction and besieged the last Byzantine stronghold to the north of the Balkan mountains, Varna. Varna was defended by a large garrison including western mercenaries who were known to be the bravest soldiers in the Byzantine army. To take the fortress the Bulgarian engineers constructed an enormous siege tower which was wider that the outer moat. With the help of the siege equipment the Bulgarian army was able to cross the moat and reach the walls of the city and on the third day of the siege, on 24 March 1201 the Bulgarians made a breakthrough. According to the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates Kaloyan did not hesitate to kill all defenders despite the fact that it was Easter. The Byzantines were thrown in the moat and buried alive. This action earned Kaloyan the moniker "Romanslayer". After that he destroyed the city walls and returned to the capital Tarnovo.
Aftermath
By the end of the year Bulgaria and Byzantium started negotiation which ended with a peace treaty in the beginning of 1202. The Bulgarians secured their new gains and now were able to face the Hungarian threat to the north-west. After several battles in the valley of the Morava river, the Hungarians were defeated.

The National Curriculum of Northern Ireland identifies the minimum requirements of skills for each subject and the activities to develop and applied the skills .
History
Before 1988 schools had total autonomy and teachers devised the curriculum for their pupils. Margaret Thatcher imposed the first 'common curriculum' for three of the four nations. Teachers opposed this prescriptive move. The first curriculum review took place in 1998–1999 in England and 2000–2004 in Northern Ireland, with a further review in Northern Ireland in 2010.
The 1988 curriculum was rigidly defined by subject., prescribing both the content and the pedagogy, and had neither teacher input nor testing. It proved over-ambitious and content-laden and was unmanageable. Cross-curriculum working and personal development was not covered. In England the Dearing Report trimmed the content, but did not change the structure; the review in Northern Ireland was more thorough, and addressed the issue phase by phase.

Key stage 3
Key Stage 3 students are 11-14 year olds (Years 8, 9, and Year 10 in the Northern Ireland system). This is the first post-primary keystage.
Key stage 4 - Entitlement Framework
"Every school must offer at least 24 courses at Key Stage 4, and 27 in the post-16 category. In addition, at least one third of the courses offered must be general and one third applied; that is the minimum figure", said Peter Wier.
This was subsequently reduced to 21- of which one-third must be general courses, and one third applied courses. All secondary schools in Northern Ireland are in Area Learning Communities (ALC) where they are encouraged to co-operate, and deliver 'shared education'. To fulfill the required 21 courses a school is encouraged run a joint course with a neighbouring school and extra funding is available to help them do so.
Key Stage 4 students are 14 to 16 year olds (Year 11 and Year 12 in the Northern Ireland system). These students will study for GCSEs or an equivalent. Schools offer GCSE courses that map to the areas of learning- to provide a balanced offer.

More Card is a rechargeable smart card for paying transportation fares in public transport systems in India. Tipped as a nationwide interoperable transport card, the card aims to be a single point of transaction, applicable in state buses, Metro and even parking. The card was launched in 2012 in Delhi, initially acting as a common card for the Delhi Metro and its feeder buses.
Name and logo
The brand name More has been chosen to signify the national bird peacock (in Hindi & related Indian languages - such as those using the Devanagari script - मोर [mor] means peacock) as also literally, to convey that you get more and more by using this card. The logo of the card is an illustration of peacock.
History
In a move to aid commuter convenience, and to mitigate its cash handling pains, BEST, adopted a new alternative method of paying for bus fares. From January 2007, the multi-application card system called GO Mumbai card was made available to the desired commuters. The purpose of the "Go Mumbai" card was to have a uniform currency for various kinds of transactions like paying tolls, paying for fuel, payments at railway canteens, etc. The GO Mumbai card scheme was introduced by Kaizen Automation Pvt Ltd in April 2008. The card intended to help users travel in Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses and local trains.
The card, launched first for BEST buses, was later extended to Central and Western Railway services and promised to be a transport card for seamless connectivity in Mumbai. While BEST conductors were provided with hand-held devices to validate the cards, Go Mumbai devices were installed at all railway stations. There were also plans to extend it to toll collection, taxis and autos. The railways' efforts to popularise the GO Mumbai card scheme proved futile. But the dreams crashed after Kaizen Limited, the company involved in the project, failed to supply enough number of hand-held devices to check the card's validity. Another reason for its failure was that the commuters did not find it easy to use. According to railway officials, of the 37 lakh commuters who travel every day by CR, only 12,000 used the Go Mumbai card. Of the 33 lakh commuters on WR, only 39 used it. The BEST and railways have decided to do away with the 'Go Mumbai ticketing' smart card by the end of 2010. The State Bank of India that was the payment operator between the railways and Kaizen had expressed willingness to do the project but was given up later.
With the failure of the Go Mumbai card, The National Urban Transport Policy has envisaged a common mobility card — a single ticketing card for public transport — that can be used anywhere in the country. It can be used on national, state, and city modes of transit and will have a common framework. “For rolling out a common mobility card and an automatic fare-collection system across India, it is important to have national standard specifications so that various systems can be integrated seamlessly,” said S.K. Lohia, officer on special duty (urban transport), in the central ministry of urban development. He has written to all public transport undertakings in the country, including the chairman of the railway board and operators of the metro and monorail systems. A company owned by the finance ministry has already embarked on the project following guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India. This national common mobility card (NCMC), named 'More', was unveiled by Union Urban Development Minister Kamal Nath by December 2011 and was expected to take five years before the card becomes operational throughout the country.
The implementation of 'More' was decided to be partly funded by the Central government under the JNNURM scheme covering the buses sanctioned under it. To roll out the card on an all-India basis to ensure the standardisation of the NCMC, UTI Infrastructure Technology and Services Limited has been appointed as the technology aggregator to implement the project. An agreement was signed with the Jaipur City Transport Services Limited and the card will be operational in buses across Rajasthan's state capital by March 2012. The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation and Bhopal Municipal Corporation were also at an advance stage of entering into an agreement. In Mumbai, to begin with, these cards may be issued to those having monthly passes.
More Delhi
The More Delhi card was available for sale from August 2012 and can be used both in the Delhi Metro and feeder buses. Like the Delhi Metro smart card, the More card can be purchased from Rs 50 onwards. The government is planning to integrate it with Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) as well. Incidentally, the More card is designed to be used across the country. In Delhi NCR region it can be used in Metro, DMRC run feeder buses and would have the future provision of use in DTC and Cluster Buses run by DIMTS. This is first such card in India. The card was launched for use by commuters in Metro and 10 DMRC run Feeder Buses on route no ML 5 & 56 plying from Shastri Park Metro station to Mayur Vihar Phase III via Akshardham, NOIDA Link Road, Mayur Vihar Phase I, Dharamshila Cancer Hospital, Vasundhara Enclave.
More Mumbai
The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority has conducted a meeting for initiating National Common Mobility Card (NCMC), which has been launched by the Union Ministry of Urban Development for cashless travel across the city. UTI Infra will offer MMRDA and other transit and para-transit corporations various services to implement unified ticketing solutions to avoid the repeated inconvenience of small cash transactions. The unified card will be called ‘More Mumbai.' Top officials of the railways, bus transport corporations and municipal corporations attended the meeting convened by MMRDA for the purpose.
Card usage
More cards can be used in the same way as any other smart cards to enter and exit Metro stations, by tapping on or holding within an inch of the designated space on the automatic fare collection (AFC) gates. Delhi metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) launched online recharge for its smart card users. This facility is being introduced in order to make services more and more automated and reduce manpower and associated problems. It is launched in association with ICICI Bank as the gateway provider. Currently, the payment can be done with only debit and credit cards but soon the other net banking facilities will also be provided. The users can log on to www.dmrcsmartcard.com to get the recharge done with a minimum amount of INR 100 and maximum INR 1,000 per card. Multiple smart cards can also be recharged by a single user. However to complete the process, users will have to physically validate their recharge by using the Add Value Machine (AVM). Add value machine is a touch screen based machine which provides information about the amount available and the last recharge done. For now, around 39 AVM's are being installed in 13 metro stations.

Turn Me On is the Korean solo mini album debut of Kim Kyu-jong of South Korean boy band SS501. It was released on September 27, 2011 under B2M Entertainment and distributed by LOEN Entertainment. On October 28, the album was also released in Taiwan by Warner Music Taiwan.
Background and development
Following the other four members of SS501, Kim was the last to debut as a solo artist after he left his former agency DSP Media in October 2010. While the other members released their own solo albums in the early 2011 one by one, Kim was concentrating on his acting career. Since their last album Destination in 2010, the only time that Kim got active in music was during his and Heo Young-saeng's Kyu Jong & Young Saeng Story joint fan meeting in Seoul and other countries across Asia. Kim was also featured in Heo's debut solo album Let It Go in the song "Rainy Heart", though he was not seen in the music video.
On September 19, B2M Entertainment announced Kim Kyu-jong music comeback with the release of his own solo album. During this time, Kim had been busy with his Goong musical, a spin-off of the Korean television drama of the same title, at the Kyoto Minami-za, Japan. Nevertheless, Kim participated in the album's concept and song production. On the same day, photo teasers for his upcoming album were released.
On September 22, a 34-second video teaser of his titular single "Yesterday" was released through B2M Entertainment's official YouTube account. The story-line of the video involves Kim's unpleasant relationship with a woman.
Release and promotion
Five days after the video teaser's release, the agency officially released Turn Me On album and the music video for Kim's lead single "Yesterday" through its official YouTube channel on September 27. The album was also released in Taiwan by Warner Music Taiwan later on October 28. It comes with two versions: Limited Edition and Deluxe Edition with a bonus DVD.
The album contains five songs including the mid tempo dance lead track "Yesterday" (부제: 어제보다 슬픈 오늘…), a high tempo dance track "My Love" featuring rap by fellow member Heo Young Saeng, and R&B track of "Get Ya' Luv" with an acoustic version of it. The overall album was co-produced by Taewan and Han Sang Won, who also participated with SS501's "U R Man".
For the music video, the video features Yang Jiwon, a member of the pre-debut girl-group of the same company called Spica. On October 24, B2M Entertainment released a dance version of "Yesterday" uploaded onto their official YouTube account. The video features the dance of the single, emphasizing its suspender dance move.
It's thanks to people. I realized that there are still many people who care about me. I made the decision to work really hard thanks to people to whom I feel really thankful towards. I used to complain when I had many things to do, but now I try to enjoy it.
The album debuted at number three on Gaon Album Chart for the week starting on September 25, 2011. It then reaches the tenth and eighty-second spots on the Monthly and Yearly Charts respectively.
Two days after the release of his mini album, Kim Kyu-jong revealed during an interview that he almost quit the music industry. Despite that his disposition was generally considered cheerful, he said that he was disheartened by the words and actions of others. Nevertheless, he continued performing after receiving encouragement from his fans and friends, particularly his label-mate and fellow member Heo Young-saeng. Being the last SS501 to release a solo album, Kim stated that he tried not to feel pressured, and decided to work at his own pace.
Music shows
Kim Kyu-jong had his first comeback stage on September 29 on Mnet's M!Countdown, performing his lead single "Yesterday". He also performed on KBS' Music Bank and SBS' Inkigayo.
Artwork
On September 19, Kim Kyu-jong released photo teasers of him for his upcoming album. The photos (e.g. image on the right) show Kim Kyu-jong in a heavy white make-up with white-dyed hair before a white background. Initially, mixed reaction from the crowd and various online communities were heard and seen, from curiosity to criticisms. B2M Entertainment stated during his pre-release album: "Kim Kyu Jong participated in the concept meetings and song production himself to show a new image never seen before in his new album. The photos from his album revealed today also reflect this strong will."
On September 29, two days after the album release, Kim Kyu-jong said that the photos would get the attention of people whether their reactions are positive or negative. In addition, he said that the reason why he dressed as a woman represents two things: breaking-off from the inside to show his own colors on the outside and; putting one's own image to the person he or she likes. For the latter, he particularly mentioned the struggles of women in grooming their outer appearances to look good. Despite his initial plans of looking like a woman, however, he stated that he looked more of a transvestite. Regarding the cover art, he wanted to make sure the look was different than anything he had done during SS501 days. He explained:
Even though it would be great to hear many nice words about it but getting away from that, I thought that I should do something that I have never done before, and it attracted many people's attention on it... Even then, I think they will say 'What's this?' when they see the photo. Besides cursing over the photo, I am thankful simply that they found and saw the photo.

Rock Pile Point () is the east point of Bermel Peninsula on the Bowman Coast, Graham Land. This feature was photographed from the air and roughly positioned by United States Antarctic Service (USAS), 1939–41, which applied the descriptive name Rock Pile Point to the peninsula; the name was subsequently reapplied by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) to the east point as described.

Roslyn Place is a small wooden-paved cul-de-sac located in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The street was built in 1914 in the Nicolson Pavement style and is home to the historic Roslyn Place district.
History
The land on which the current Roslyn Place sits was owned by a multitude of different owners, including J.W. Friday, until the late 1800s. By 1904 English immigrant Thomas Rodd bought the area, and the land adjacent to the southwest. Thomas Rodd emigrated from London at the age of 5, and following a short career as a naval officer during the American Civil War, he joined the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. After becoming chief engineer of all lines west of Pittsburgh for the railroad company, he and his family moved to Pittsburgh in 1889. The Rodd family quickly became members of Pittsburgh's social elite joining the Pittsburgh Club, the Duquesne Club, the Allegheny County Club, the Pittsburgh Golf Club, the University Club of Pittsburgh, the Metropolitan Club of New York, and the Chicago Club. Rodd was also responsible for the designing and constructing of many buildings in western Pennsylvania and the Midwest. He also designed and funded the construction of the Roslyn Place district and the street. Construction began in 1914 when the City Council passed ordinance No. 181, which approved of the plans for creation of Roslyn Place. The street was made in the Nicolson Pavement style, which is a form of wooden block pavement. Oak blocks were used for construction of the street, resulting in around 26,000 blocks in total. The construction finished later in 1914, and the street remained in that condition for decades, only undergoing minor restorations and repairs. By the 1980s though, the street had significantly deteriorated. The city opted to undergo a significant restoration project in 1985, in which extensive repairs were made. Since then, there have only been minor repairs using surplus materials from the 1985 project. The street was nominated in January 2016 to become a City Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.
Architecture
Roslyn Place is one of the few examples of Nicolson Pavement left in the United States. Nicolson Pavement is a street paving technique that involves creosote-soaked wooden blocks laid down, and was patented by Samuel Nicolson in 1859. The paving of wooden streets was accomplished with four different approaches, and they are each tailored to particular uses for the streets. The advantages of using wooden streets can be seen when they are compared to cobblestone and Belgian block. Cobblestones had rounded edges which made it difficult for horses to can traction, and although Belgian blocks were slightly preferable, their rounded edges also made it tough for wheels to travel over. Nicolson Pavement was not rounded, but flat, which made it easier for pedestrians, wagon wheels, and horses. Other benefits of Nicolson Pavement were the lower costs, the reduction of noise-level, the more humane surface for horses, and there was evidence that wherever Nicolson Pavement was laid, the rents of the buildings nearby rose by more than a third. Roslyn Place is the last remaining example of Nicolson Pavement in Pittsburgh, and is the only street in the United States entirely paved in accordance with the Nicolson paving techniques. Roslyn Place also featured in notable urban designer Allan Jacobs' book Great Streets where it is compared to the likes of the Champs-Élysées in Paris and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.

Soulbury is a village and also a civil parish within the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the Aylesbury Vale, about seven miles south of Central Milton Keynes, and three miles north of Wing. The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means "stronghold in a gully". In the Domesday Book of 1086, the village was recorded as Soleberie.
The parish
The parish contains the hamlets of:
Hollingdon in the west,
Chelmscote on the Stoke Hammond to Leighton Buzzard road,
Bragenham to the east of the River Ouzel, and
Stockgrove near Stockgrove Country Park on the border with Bedfordshire.
Other places mentioned in historical records include:
Lortun Hill and
a road called London Street, (mentioning William Holynden)
Hongurhell
The parish extends as far as Rammamere Farm on Watling Street. Rammamere Heath is managed with King's Wood in Heath and Reach as a nature reserve.
Liscombe Park
A 17th-century mansion, Liscombe Park was originally the seat of the Lovett family, of whom the most famous member was Colonel John Lovett (c. 1660–1710), patron of the Eddystone Lighthouse. The house was rebuilt in the 1920s by the Bonsor family who live there today. The house is built of brick with small turrets and crenelations, in the style of an 18th-century pseudo gothic castle. The interiors are a mixture of panelling and some 18th-century styles. Near to the house is the former much older chapel, this today has been converted to a billiards room. The house is not open to the public, but the gardens are sometimes used for fairs and fetes.
The stable block has been converted to a leisure and health complex, with a polo cross field. There is a riding stable, open to the public, adjacent to the complex.
An early mention of the name as Lyscombe appears in 1418, where Roger Stok and his wife, Sara, lived, suing people from Stewkley (appearing as Stucle) and Burcote.
Soulbury gave its name to Solebury Township, Pennsylvania, which was founded by Quaker settlers from Soulbury.
Glacial erratic rock
A glacial erratic lies in a road in the parish. The stone originated in Derbyshire, and was deposited by the retreat of glaciers at the end of the last ice age. Oliver Cromwell is said to have used the stone as a podium during an attack on the village church during the English civil war. Local tradition holds that the stone is the petrified foot of the devil.
In March 2016, the stone was hit by a motorist who made complaints of it being a hazard, prompting the county council to investigate its removal. The parish council and villagers strongly opposed its removal and the stone still remains in its ancient position.
There is a public house in Soulbury called the Boot. Its pub sign features a boot of the Duke of Wellington, but the tradition of the Soulbury Boot is said to be much older than that. It is said that the Devil himself once came to the village, but the villagers came together to fight him off. One of them took his sword and cut off the Devil's foot and as it fell to the ground it turned to stone. The stone came to be known as the Soulbury Boot. This story is said by some to have been made up by a previous pub landlord in order to attract visitors.
Soulbury Millennium Green
This public greenspace is owned and run by a local charitable trust and was created as part of the celebrations for the turn of the Millennium in the year 2000. It is one of 245 such Millennium Greens throughout England and the only one in Buckinghamshire.

Cesare da Bagno (1530–1564), also known as Cesare di Niccolo di Mariano Federighi, was an Italian sculptor and medallist.
As his nickname implies, Cesare was born in Santa Maria al Bagno. Most of what is known about da Bagno is based on his surviving works. He produced a statue of Alfonso d'Avalos, Marquess of Vasto which now resides at the National Gallery of Art. He also produced a medal featuring Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. He died in Milan in 1564.

The snake in the tunnel was a system of European monetary cooperation in the 1970s which aimed at limiting fluctuations between different European currencies. It was the first attempt at European monetary cooperation. It attempted to create a single currency band for the European Economic Community (EEC), essentially pegging all the EEC currencies to one another.
The tunnel collapsed in 1973 when the US dollar floated freely. The snake proved unsustainable, with several currencies leaving and in some cases rejoining; the French franc left in 1974, rejoined, and left again in 1976 despite appreciating against the US dollar. By 1977, it had become a Deutsche Mark zone with just the Belgian and Luxembourg franc, the Dutch guilder and the Danish krone tracking it. The Werner plan was abandoned. The European Monetary System followed the "snake" as a system for monetary coordination in the EEC.
Background and implementation
Pierre Werner presented a report on economic and monetary union to the EEC on 8 October 1970. The first of three recommended steps involved the coordination of economic policies and a reduction in fluctuations between European currencies.
With the failure of the Bretton Woods system with the Nixon shock in 1971, the Smithsonian Agreement set bands of ±2.25% for currencies to move relative to their central rate against the US dollar. This provided a tunnel within which European currencies could trade. However, it implied much larger bands in which they could move against each other: for example if currency A started at the bottom of its band it could appreciate by 4.5% against the dollar, while if currency B started at the top of its band it could depreciate by 4.5% against the dollar.
If both happened simultaneously, then currency A would appreciate by 9% against currency B. This was seen as excessive, and the Basel agreement in 1972 between the six existing EEC members and three about to join established a snake in the tunnel with bilateral margins between their currencies limited to 2.25%, implying a maximum change between any two currencies of 4.5%, and with all the currencies tending to move together against the dollar. This agreement also led to the formal end of the Sterling Area.
According to Barry Eichengreen, the snake was troubled by economic shocks (such as the 1973 oil crisis and commodity market disruptions), which had asymmetric implications for different European countries, leading to greater unemployment in some countries than others. As a consequence, some European countries were pressured to respond in expansionary ways. Officials in different European countries also had different views as to the correct response to economic difficulties, with some preferring to maintain price stability while others preferred expansionary monetary initiatives. These differences, coupled with a lack of political integration in Europe, made it difficult for national governments to cede power to a common European monetary policy.

A Wildland fire module (WFM), formerly fire use module (FUM), is a 7–10-person team of firefighting personnel dedicated to planning, monitoring and starting fires. They may be deployed anywhere in the United States for resource benefits (fire use), prescribed fire and hazard fuel reduction projects.
As inter-agency national resource personnel, fire use modules have expertise in the areas of fire monitoring, ignition, holding and suppression, prescribed fire preparation and implementation support, hazard fuels reduction, and fire effects monitoring.
Fire use modules are funded by different US government agencies including the National Park Service, USDA Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. The Nature Conservancy is the sole non-government entity to sponsor and support a Fire Use Module.
History
In 1995, the US National Park Service (USNPS) founded fire use modules and hosted them in five different park units across the United States: Bandalier NM, Saguaro NP, Whisky town NRA, Zion NP, and Yellowstone NP. In 1999 the USMPS created four more modules; Black Hills FUM, Cumberland Gap FUM, Great Smokes FUM, and Buffalo River FUM.
The modules were developed with the primary purpose of assisting the National Park units with fire use (wildland fire use and prescribed fire), meeting the objectives of the agency in the areas of project preparation and execution with narrow burn prescription windows. Secondarily the modules were intended to be used in monitoring fire effects, and manually reducing hazard fuels on various park units. Modules were also anticipated to be used to assist other agencies in fire use and fuels treatment projects when all the park unit objectives were met.
Other modules came into existence as the use and flexibility of fire use modules became more apparent. Most notable of these fire use modules includes those on the Stanislaus National Forest (Calvarase FUM, Summit FUM, etc.), The Ashley National Forest (Flaming Gorge WFM, Kings Peak WFM), The Bureau of Land Managements Unaweep WFM and The Nature Conservancy's Southern Rockies.
Since 2005, The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Forest Service) has also implemented the use of fire use modules (known as wildland fire modules) as well throughout the country. As of 2010 there were 17 wildland fire modules in the United States. These modules are highly qualified and extremely effective in a variety of fire ground operations ranging from basic suppression to extremely accurate fire behavior analysis and other tactical predictive services.

(2) Lead crewmember (squad leader) – GS-5/6 subject-to-furlough and permanent full-time
(3–6) Crewmembers – GS 3/4/5 temporary, subject-to-furlough, and permanent full-time.
Minimum qualifications
(1) CRWB or ENGB – Single Resource Boss
(1) FIRB – Firing boss (separate from CRWB/ENGB)
(1) ICT4 – Incident commander Type 4

General elections were held in the British Virgin Islands on 20 February 1995. The result was a victory for the incumbent Virgin Islands Party (VIP) led by Chief Minister Lavity Stoutt. The VIP won a plurality of six seats, and thus were able to form a minority government as no other party or coalition could muster a larger number of seats. The BVI United Party (UP) won three seats, and the Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM) won two seats. The two other seats were won by independents. Shortly after the election Alvin Christopher joined the VIP upon being offered a Ministerial seat, giving the VIP an outright majority.
It was the first election to be fought in the British Virgin Islands after the introduction of Territorial at-large seats. Lavity Stoutt had fought hard against the introduction of at-large seats, fearing it would undermine the strong territorial base of the VIP. After his victory he said: "The at-large system was a plot, a plot designed to derail H. Lavity Stoutt. Well it failed. The people have had their say. Their voice has been heard."
The 1995 general election also witnessed the first ever female representatives elected: Ethlyn E. Smith in the Fifth District, and Eileene Parsons as an At-large representative. Eileene Parsons would later join the ruling Virgin Islands Party and become the first ever female Minister for Government in the Territory.
Former Chief Minister, Willard Wheatley ran as an independent in at the at-large seats and was resoundingly rejected by the voters, only winning slightly more votes than were recorded as spoiled ballots (265 against 232).
It was the last election in the British Virgin Islands to be fought prior to the death of Lavity Stoutt.
The supervisor of elections was Eugenie Todman-Smith. The turnout was 68.8%.
Results
Notable candidates
Notable candidates who were elected to the Legislature for the first time included the first two women elected to the Legislature, Ethlyn Eugenie Smith and Eileene Parsons; and future Minister, Alvin Christopher. Conversely, Willard Wheatley suffered the worst electoral defeat of his career, and would never run again. Cyril Romney was defeated for the first time since 1975, although he would run again (unsuccessfully) in 1999. Longtime legislators Oliver Cills and Terrance Lettsome were both elected, but neither would stand again after the 1995 election. Lavity Stoutt was also elected, but would die later in the same year. Andre Penn was elected for his only ever term of office; Penn would later be convicted of sexual crimes involving children and sentenced to 12 years in prison; and is believed to be the only elected official in the British Virgin Islands to be subsequently convicted of an indictable offence.

Matthew Olson Guerrier (born August 2, 1978) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs.
Amateur career
A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Guerrier attended Shaker Heights High School. He was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the 33rd round in 1996 but did not sign, opting instead to play college baseball at Kent State University. While at Kent State in 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox.
Professional career
Chicago White Sox
Guerrier was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 10th round of the 1999 MLB Draft. He pitched in the White Sox minor league system through 2001, reaching AAA with the Charlotte Knights.
Pittsburgh Pirates
On March 27, 2002, he was traded by the White Sox to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Dámaso Marte. He spent the next two seasons pitching in AAA for the Nashville Sounds.
Minnesota Twins
He was selected off waivers by the Minnesota Twins after the 2003 season. Guerrier made his Major League debut on June 17, 2004 against the Montreal Expos as the starting pitcher. He worked four innings and allowed two earned runs. On the season he appeared in nine games, making two starts for an 0–1 record and 5.68 ERA.
He did not pick up his first win until September 23, 2006 against the Baltimore Orioles but he became a mainstay of the Twins bullpen.
In 2008, the Twins lost primary setup pitcher Pat Neshek to injury early in the season and Guerrier took over part of that role for a short time. He pitched poorly in the second half, however, sporting an 8.88 ERA. In innings, he was 6–9 with a 5.19 ERA. He improved greatly in 2009, posting a 5–1 record with a 2.36 ERA and leading the American League with 33 holds.
Los Angeles Dodgers
Guerrier agreed to a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 16, 2010. He appeared in a team high 70 games for the Dodgers, the fifth straight season he pitched in at least 70 games. He finished the season 4–3 with a 4.07 ERA in 66.1 innings worked and became the first pitcher in baseball history with exactly one save in six straight seasons.
In 2012, Guerrier pitched in 7 games in April and was then shut down with right elbow inflammation. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list and did not rejoin the Dodgers until the last week of August, ending his string of 5 straight seasons with at least 70 games pitched. Due to the injury, he only appeared in 16 games for the Dodgers in 2012, with a 3.86 ERA.
He pitched in 34 games in 2013 with a 4.80 ERA before he was designated for assignment on June 30.
Chicago Cubs
On July 2, 2013 he was traded to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for Carlos Mármol. He appeared in 15 games for the Cubs and was 2–1 with a 2.13 ERA in 12.2 innings. He was shut down for the season in August after tearing the flexor muscle in his right forearm.
Second stint with Minnesota Twins
On January 29, 2014 he signed a minor league contract to rejoin the Minnesota Twins. The Twins released Guerrier March 24, 2014 a week prior to the end of Spring Training. He was re-signed the next day. He was designated for assignment on July 23. He elected free agency on July 29.
Pitching repertoire
Guerrier's most commonly thrown pitch is alternately called cutter thrown in the high 80s. He also has a four-seam and two-seam fastball (low 90s), a curveball (78-80), and an occasional changeup to left-handed hitters.

The Enemy Below is a 1957 DeLuxe Color war film in CinemaScope about a battle between an American destroyer escort and a German U-boat during World War II. Produced and directed by Dick Powell, the movie stars Robert Mitchum and Curt Jürgens as the American and German commanding officers. The film was based on the 1956 novel by Denys Rayner, a British naval officer involved in anti-submarine warfare throughout the Battle of the Atlantic.
Plot
The American USS Haynes detects and attacks a German U-boat that is on its way to rendezvous with a German merchant raider in the South Atlantic Ocean. Lieutenant Commander Murrell, a former officer in the Merchant Marine and now an active duty officer in the Naval Reserve, has recently taken command of the Haynes, even though he is still recovering from injuries incurred in the sinking of his previous ship. Before the U-boat is first spotted, one sailor questions the new captain's fitness and ability. However, as the battle begins, Murrell proves himself a match for wily U-boat Kapitän zur See von Stolberg, a man who is not enamored with the Nazi regime, in a prolonged and deadly battle of wits that tests both men and their crews. Each man grows to respect his opponent.
Murrell skillfully stalks the U-boat and subjects von Stolberg and his crew to hourly depth-charge attacks. In the end, von Stolberg takes advantage of Murrell's predictable pattern of attacks and succeeds in torpedoing the destroyer escort. Although the Haynes is sinking, it is still battle-capable, and Murrell has one final plan: he orders his men to set fires on the deck to make the ship look more damaged than it actually is. He then orders the majority of his crew to evacuate in the lifeboats, but retains a skeleton crew to man the bridge, engine room and one of his ship's guns. As Murrell had hoped, von Stolberg surfaces before firing his torpedoes, keeping the deck gun trained on the ship. Murrell orders his gun crew to fire first at the U-boat's stern to immobilize it, and then at the deck gun. Murrell rams the U-boat. With his boat sinking, von Stolberg orders his crew to set scuttling charges and abandon ship.
Murrell, the last man aboard, is about to join his crew in the lifeboats when he spots von Stolberg standing on the conning tower of the sinking U-boat with his injured executive officer Oberleutnant zur See Heini Schwaffer. Murrell tosses a line to the submarine and rescues the pair. It is clear that Schwaffer is dying, but von Stolberg refuses to leave his friend behind. Lieutenant Ware returns with American and German sailors in the captain's gig to take the three men off before the U-boat's scuttling charges detonate. Later, aboard a ship that has rescued both crews, the German crew buries Schwaffer at sea as the American crew respectfully watches.

Production
Writing
The screenplay, which was adapted by Wendell Mayes, differs substantially from the original book. In the novel, the ship is British but in the film it is American. The screenplay's final scenes of mutual respect between the protagonists are not taken from the book. In the book, the destroyer captain takes a swing at the U-boat captain while they are in the lifeboat because the U-boat captain claims that the destroyer crew are his prisoners. The film also vaguely alludes to evil as such (or the devil), not specifically the Nazis, being the "enemy" ("You cut off one head and it grows another..."). This gives the title of The Enemy Below a double meaning not present in the book.
The screenplay has historical precedence. On 6 May 1944, , which was the lead ship of the same destroyer escort class portrayed in The Enemy Below, actually rammed and sank a U-boat in combat capturing many of the German crew.
Casting
The anti-Nazi U-boat captain was portrayed by actor Curd Jürgens, who had been an actual critic of Nazism in his native Germany. In 1944, after filming Wiener Mädeln, he got into an argument with Robert Kaltenbrunner (brother of high-ranking Austrian SS official Ernst Kaltenbrunner), SS-Obersturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny and a member of Baldur von Schirach's staff in a Viennese bar without knowing who they were. Jürgens was arrested and sent to a labor camp for the "politically unreliable" in Hungary. After a few weeks he managed to escape and went into hiding. Jürgens became an Austrian citizen after the war.
The destroyer escort USS Haynes (DE-181) was represented in the film by the , provided by the US Navy in Pearl Harbor. Many of the actual ship's crew appear in the film; such as the phone talkers, the gun and depth charge crews, and all of the men seen abandoning ship. The Whitehursts commanding officer Lieutenant Commander Walter Smith played the engineering officer. He is the man seen reading comics (Little Orphan Annie) during the lull before the action while an enlisted man is reading The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. The Whitehurst was sunk as a target in 1971. The real DE-181 was , a (scrapped 1974).
Filming
Despite being set in the South Atlantic, filming took place in the Pacific Ocean near Oahu, Hawaii.
Music
The tune sung by the U-boat crew on the ocean floor between depth-charge attacks is from an 18th-century march called "Der Dessauer Marsch," known by the first line of lyrics as "So leben wir" ("That's how we live"). The burial hymn in the final scene is "Ich hatt' einen Kameraden."
Awards and nominations
For the audio effects, Walter Rossi received the 1958 Academy Award for Best Special Effects. The film was also awarded as the best sound-edited feature of 1957 by the Motion Picture Sound Editors.
In popular culture
The 1966-Star Trek episode "Balance of Terror" is closely based on the film, with the USS Enterprise cast as the destroyer and the Romulan vessel, using a cloaking device, as the U-boat.
Nicholas Meyer has cited the film as an inspiration for The Wrath of Khan.
The Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode "Killers of the Deep" reused substantial amounts of footage from the film. David Hedison (then Al Hedison), who played Lieutenant Ware, the executive officer of the Haynes, also played Commander Lee Crane on Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.
In the 1995 film Crimson Tide, two USS Alabama officers debate about the cast of The Enemy Below.

German submarine U-679 was a Type VIIC U-boat built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine for service during World War II.
She was laid down on 3 September 1942 by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, Hamburg as yard number 828, launched on 18 September 1943 and commissioned on 29 November 1943 under Leutnant zur See Friedrich Breckwoldt.
Design
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-679 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert GU 343/38-8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .
The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-679 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, (220 rounds), one Flak M42 and two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns.

The boat's career began with training at 31st Flotilla on 29 November 1943, followed by active service on 1 August 1944 as part of the 8th Flotilla. U-679 took part in no wolfpacks. U-679 was presumed sunk on 9 January 1945 in the Baltic Sea at by depth charges from Soviet anti-submarine vessel MO-124. However, the wreckage was located in August 2015 and initial reports suggest that actually U-679 had run into a mine and sank after that. Wreckage lies at depth of 90 metres at a location, which is somewhat different from the information given earlier.

Her television work includes series regular and recurring roles on Grey's Anatomy, 24, Queen America, and Notes from the Underbelly, among others, and guest-starring turns on This Is Us and Girls. She recently completed a four-season arc as Pauline Turner Brooks on TVLand's series Younger, created by Darren Star.
She made her Broadway debut in 2003 in the revival of Wonderful Town opposite Donna Murphy, for which she received a 2004 Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Musical, a Theater World Award for Outstanding Broadway Debut, and a Drama League Award for her role as Eileen Sherwood.

Burns' The Library at The Public Theater opposite Chloe Grace Moretz, directed by Steven Soderbergh.
Early life and education
Westfeldt is the daughter of Constance "Connie" Perelson, a therapist, and Patrick McLoskey Westfeldt Jr., an electrical engineer. Her stepfather is Michael Perelson, also a therapist. Her older sister is journalist Amy Westfeldt. Westfeldt grew up in Guilford, Connecticut, where she attended Guilford High School. She then attended Yale University, where she received a B.A. in Theater Studies. While at Yale, she starred in numerous plays and musicals and sang in the a cappella group Redhot & Blue. Her family is a part of the Swedish nobility, with the original name Wästfelt Nobel family Wästfelt/Westfeldt
Career
Upon graduating from Yale University with a B.A. in Theater Studies, Westfeldt started her career as a New York-based theater actress, starring in dozens of regional and Off-Broadway productions, including the long-running Off-Broadway musical The Fantasticks. In 1997, she was cast in a series regular role on the 20th Century Fox/ABC sitcom Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place, alongside Ryan Reynolds, Traylor Howard, and Richard Ruccolo.
Kissing Jessica Stein
In 1997 Westfeldt co-wrote and co-starred with Heather Juergensen in an Off-Broadway play based on a series of sketches called Lipschtick: The Story of Two Women Seeking The Perfect Shade, which caught the attention of major Hollywood studios. The play was optioned by Radar Pictures to be made into a film, but after two years of studio development, Westfeldt and Juergensen bought back the rights to the script and decided to make the film independently.
Kissing Jessica Stein debuted at the LA International Film Festival in 2001, where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature, and a Special Jury Award for Writing and Acting for Westfeldt and Juergensen. The film was released by Fox Searchlight Pictures in March 2002.
Westfeldt received the Golden Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for her role as Jessica, and an Indie Spirit Nomination for Best First Screenplay. The film won the Audience Favorites Award at the Chicago International Film Festival, the Audience Award at the Miami Film Festival, Best Feature at the Louisville Jewish Film Festival, and the GLAAD Media Award, and it was included on more than a dozen top ten lists in 2002. Variety wrote, "A fresh take on sex and the single girl, this buoyant, well-crafted romantic comedy blends pitch-perfect performances with deliciously smart writing." In Newsweek David Ansen said the film "knows what it wants, what its limits are, and delivers its delights accordingly."
In 2014, The Advocate listed the movie as an essential film for LGBTQ+ viewers that "encourages exploration and self-awareness." In 2020, Kvellar writer Mara Reinstein looked back on the impact that this "authentic" and "nuanced" movie had, writing, "I can't overstate how much Kissing Jessica Stein pioneered the gay rom-com."
Other film work
Westfeldt's next feature, Ira & Abby, marked her first solo screenwriting effort. The film debuted at the Los Angeles Film Festival in 2006, where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It was acquired by Magnolia Pictures and released in the fall of 2007 to strong reviews.
Westfeldt won Best Actress at the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen in 2006 for her performance as Abby, where Ira & Abby also took home the Jury Prize for Best Feature. The film won Audience Award for Best Feature at the Boston Jewish Film Festival.
In 2011, Westfeldt wrote, produced, starred in, and made her directorial debut in Friends with Kids, which was a breakout hit at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions obtained the rights to the film, and it was released in 2012. Westfeldt starred opposite Adam Scott, with a cast including Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, Chris O'Dowd, Ed Burns, Megan Fox and Jon Hamm.
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Friends with Kids "an indelibly funny and touching comedy with a real sting in its tail," and deemed Westfeldt "an actress of rare wit and grace, and now a filmmaker with a keen eye for nuance. In front of the camera and behind it, she's the live current that pulls us in and makes us care. Westfeldt is the pulse of Friends With Kids, presenting us with life in all of its vibrant, messy sprawl."
The film was included on New York Magazine's Top Ten List, as well as NPR's Top 12 of 2012.
Other film roles include the 2016 short Lemon opposite Noah Bean, which premiered at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival and, in 2017, a supporting role in director Marielle Heller's Can You Ever Forgive Me? opposite Melissa McCarthy, which later ended up on the cutting room floor.
In 2017, Westfeldt produced the documentary Circus Kid, based on Lorenzo Pisoni's life growing up in a circus family, which was bought and distributed by Sundance Now.
Television
After one season on Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place, 20th Century Fox Studios cast Westfeldt as the lead of another series, the short-lived Holding the Baby on Fox.
She went on to star in multiple pilots, including the WB's The Gene Pool opposite Chris Eigeman; The Untitled Paul Reiser Pilot on F/X; and Steve Levitan's Dante on NBC, opposite Morris Chestnut and Kevin Hart.
In 2006, she was cast as the female lead in ABC's Notes from the Underbelly, which ran for two seasons. Andrew Johnston wrote in TimeOut: "Jennifer Westfeldt is a total babe, with physical-comedy skills that, if properly honed, could approach Lucille Ball territory. In other words, she was basically born for TV. [Westfeldt] gets to show her serious side, too, and if the series gives her enough exposure to start competing with Hope Davis and Laura Linney for blond-WASP roles, Underbelly will have more than justified its existence."
Her varied TV credits include memorable arcs on Younger, Queen America (opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones), Grey's Anatomy, 24, Judging Amy, and Hack; and guest-starring turns on NBC's hit drama This Is Us, HBO's Girls, and Childrens Hospital, among others.
She provided the voice of Kit Luntayne in the Martha Speaks episodes "Cora! Cora! Cora!" and "Cora Encore!" on PBS.
In 2022 she wrote several episodes of the Showtime series The First Lady.
Theater
Westfeldt made her Broadway debut in the fall of 2003 in the critical and commercial hit Wonderful Town, starring opposite two-time Tony winner Donna Murphy and directed by three-time Tony winner Kathleen Marshall. Westfeldt received a 2004 Tony nomination, a Theater World Award for Outstanding Broadway Debut, and a Drama League Award for her role as Eileen Sherwood.
Of her Broadway debut, John Simon of New York magazine wrote: "Jennifer Westfeldt leaps onto the Broadway stage in full-fledged acting and singing splendor as the adorable Eileen." Ben Brantley of the New York Times wrote, "Jennifer Westfeldt makes a charming Broadway debut as Eileen, Ruth's boy-magnet of a sister." "Ms. Westfeldt's delightfully un-self-conscious interpretation suggests a virginal answer to the Vargas pinup girls," he added.
Westfeldt's other stage work includes the world premieres of Scott Z. Burns' The Library at The Public Theater opposite Chloe Grace-Moretz, directed by Steven Soderbergh; Nell Benjamin's The Explorers Club at Manhattan Theater Club, directed by Marc Bruni; Nicky Silver's Too Much Sun at The Vineyard Theater opposite Linda Lavin, directed by Mark Brokaw; Cusi Cram's A Lifetime Burning at Primary Stages, directed by Pam MacKinnon; Joe Gilford's Finks opposite Josh Radnor at The Powerhouse Theater/NYSAF, directed by Charlie Stratton; Stephen Belber's The Power of Duff opposite Greg Kinnear at The Powerhouse Theater/NYSAF, directed by Peter Dubois; and Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros' Big Sky at The Geffen opposite Jon Tenney, directed by John Rando.
Development
In 2002, Westfeldt, along with her journalist sister Amy, sold a one-hour newsroom drama pitch to Touchstone/ABC, with Westfeldt attached to star. Called The Independent, the series was loosely inspired by her sister's experiences as a career journalist at the Associated Press.
In 2010, with Alan Ball attached as executive producer, she sold a TV dramedy to HBO with her attached to star about the bird's nest custody agreement in divorce cases.
Westfeldt sold to Amazon an adapted screenplay based on the novel The Idea of You by Robinne Lee, which is set to star Anne Hathaway.
Personal life
Westfeldt was in a long-term relationship with actor Jon Hamm from 1997 to 2015. She divides her time between New York City and Los Angeles.

The following lists events that happened during 1938 in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan made rapid strides towards western civilization. Roads were laid out for motor traffic; industries, based originally on military requirements, were developed; and education spread. Three colleges were instituted in Kabul, and schools were set up everywhere.
Incumbents
Monarch – Mohammed Zahir Shah
Prime Minister – Mohammad Hashim Khan
Early 1938
Treaties of friendship are concluded with Liberia and with Brazil, and the treaty with Turkey is extended for ten years. On the other hand, on the proposal of the Soviet government, the Afghan consulates in Russia and the Soviet consulates in Afghanistan are closed.
June 1938
A number of Wazirs from South and West Waziristan cross the Afghan frontier with the object of looting and of stirring up a rising against the reigning Afghan house. This movement is the result of an agitation carried on for some months in Waziristan by one Syed Mohammad Sadi, commonly known as the Shami Pir (Syrian imam), a priest from Damascus whose family is connected with the ex-king Amanullah. A rebellion breaks out in southeast Afghanistan, headed by the Suleiman khel, and the number of the insurgents soon rises to 2,000. The government, which has been watching the activities of the Shami Pir, is not taken unawares, and quickly sends to the scene of the disturbances two brigades with ten aeroplanes, which are soon after reinforced by two more brigades. The insurgents are defeated in two battles on June 22 and 24, and the revolt soon comes to an end.

The silvery grebe (Podiceps occipitalis) is a species of grebe in the family Podicipedidae. It is found in the western and southern part of South America at altitudes of up to . Its natural habitat is freshwater lakes but it also feeds in saline lakes.
Description
The silvery grebe is about in length. There are two different subspecies which differ in the colouring on their head and facial plumes. The southern form has a black cap and the sides of its head are grey. The neck, chest and belly are white while the back is dark grey and the sides and flanks blackish. The beak and feet are black and the eye red. It is similar in appearance to the Junin grebe (Podiceps taczanowskii).
Subspecies
P. o. juninensis, (von Berlepsch & Stolzmann, 1894), Colombia to north-west Argentina and northern Chile
P. o. occipitalis, (Garnot, 1826), central & southern Chile & Argentina, Falkland Islands
Distribution and habitat
The silvery grebe nests in Argentina, the Falkland Islands, Chile, and the western parts of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. It is a migrant in Paraguay and southern Brazil and possibly also in Uruguay. Its habitat is freshwater lakes, lagoons, reservoirs and ponds at altitudes between sea level and . In the Andes it is sometimes found foraging on hypersaline lakes and also inhabits saline lakes in Patagonia where it is found in the company of flamingoes.
Biology
The silvery grebe is found in small groups and feeds on aquatic invertebrates which it catches while diving under the water. Its diet includes adults and larvae of caddisflies, water beetles, chironomid midges and water boatmen.
The silvery grebe tends to breed in colonies on freshwater lakes. The nest is often composed of floating mats of vegetation. Nesting has been recorded in February in Colombia and between September and March in Peru with most eggs being laid between November and January.
Status
The silvery grebe has an extremely wide range and large total population. Although the population trend is downward, the rate of decline is insufficient for the IUCN to rate the bird as "vulnerable" and it is therefore listed as being of "least concern".

Ávneh Vinny Diniz da Silva Aragão (Sobral, Ceará, July 14, 1989), known as Ávine Vinny, is a Brazilian singer and composer. He began his career in 2009 by creating with his friends the band Xé Pop. In 2016, he began his solo career. His last album, Avine Naturalmente, was recorded in October 2018, in Porto de Galinhas.
Biography
Vinny was born on July 14, 1989, in Sobral, Ceará. The same is the son of Maria do Socorro Silva. Its baptismal name, Ávneh, has Jewish origin and was given by its mother. He began singing at the age of 12 in the church, where he remained for six years. Already in majority, began to sing in local bars.
At the age of 20, Vinny and his friends formed the band Xé Pop. The following year they released "Namorar Escondido", which was re-recorded by Wesley Safadão, Babado Novo, among other artists. In six years in the group, the songs "Primeiro Olhar", "Você Aparece", "Segura Coração", "Melhor Que Eu", "Meu Abrigo" and "Vai Novinha" were released. After great repercussion, he moved to Fortaleza.
In 2015, he released a trilogy of video clips. "Você Aparece", "Eu e Você" and "Se Você Quer Saber" were recorded in tourist spots in Rio de Janeiro, such as Christ the Redeemer, Copacabana and Selaron Steps. In 2016, the singer left the band. In an interview with the G1, he said that the group created a "characteristic of its own", that its name "is very strong and we will take advantage to exploit it better and demystify".
With A3 Entretenimento, he released the album O Cara Do Momento in July 2016. "Tô Limpando Você da Minha Vida", in partnership with Solange Almeida, became the fourth most performed music in the northeastern radio stations. In February 2017, he released the album Na Contramão, which contains the presence of Xandy Avião, Márcio Victor and Léo Santana. The album features nine songs.
In the same year he released Acústico and Férias com Avine, in May and August respectively; The first counts with nine tracks, while the next seven. The video for "Acabou, Morreu" reached over one million views on YouTube. In August 2018, he released the album A Queda Foi na Sua Cama which contains four tracks. In September, in partnership with funk singer Ludmilla, released the single "Tô Fechado Com Ela". In October 2018, he recorded the album Avine Naturalmente at Porto de Galinhas, Pernambuco.
The single "Maturidade", in partnership with the duo Matheus & Kauan, reached the 66th position of the top 100 list of Spotify Brazil, besides occupy the 30th position of the list of viral hits, surpassing the singers Madonna and Selena Gomez. On its YouTube channel, the clip, released in November, outnumbers 12 million views.
Personal life
Vinny is an evangelical and declared that he always prays before going on stage. He is the father of Isla Aragão, along with a nurse, Laís Holanda. The same has several tattoos: A microphone cable on the right arm, which binds to another tattoo, heartbeats, on the chest; the phrase "my music, my voice comes from the sky" and a microphone in the left arm; the phrase "turning boredom into melody" on the left side of the thorax; and a microphone, a guitar, a saxophone and a battery in the right calf.
Controversies
In 2017, Sony Music removed from YouTube the video clip of the song "Whisky, Cigarro e Violão". The reason alleged by the record company was the granting of copyright to another singer, Israel Novaes. The composer stated that the song was granted for both, but in different musical genres; Vinny would record it as forró and Novas as sertanejo. Armando Carneiro, Vinny's manager, said that the composer gave "a year of exclusivity under music. In the document itself he says that we can change the rhythm of the phonogram. Nothing prevents us from recording at whatever pace. This gender exclusivity does not exist". The singer Israel Novaes, after being criticized in his social networks, said that "it is very sad to be right, acting right and ill-intentioned and uninformed people criticize".

Hadera Stream (), known in Arabic as Nahr Mufjir () and previously also as Nahr Akhdar (), is a seasonal watercourse in Israel.
The Crusaders called it the "Dead River" due to its sluggish character.
Nahal Hadera flows from the highlands in the northern West Bank and empties into the Mediterranean Sea at Hadera. The Hadera Water Park, located between Givat Olga and the Orot Rabin (Hadera) power plant, is a 750-dunam park that holds a 40-metre-wide creek banked by a 1.3-km-long promenade. A dam is being constructed where the water park meets the Coastal Highway and is supposed to prevent the rehabilitated section of the stream from being polluted by water from the watercourse itself.

The 2nd Division () was a unit of the Finnish Army during the Continuation War. It participated in the Finnish invasion of Ladoga Karelia at the start of the war and defended against the 1944 Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive on the Karelian Isthmus where it suffered heavy casualties.
History
Subordinated to the II Corps, the division participated in the Finnish invasion of Ladoga Karelia on the northwestern shore of Lake Ladoga under the command of Colonel Aarne Blick. During the initial invasion, it took part in an encirclement of Soviet forces along the northern shore of Lake Ladoga, reaching the shore of the lake on 7 August. During a subsequent reorganization of the Finnish forces in the region, it was subordinated to the Finnish I Corps, participating soon after in a pincer movement aimed at the capture of Sortavala. While Soviet forces were largely able to escape encirclement, the town was captured by Finnish forces on 15 August.
In June and July of 1944, the division suffered heavy casualties during the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive under the command of Major General Ilmari Martola, who had taken command in 1942. Part of the IV Corps, it was located on the western Karelian Isthmus. It first fell back to the VT-line, where it held off Soviet attacks for four days before being ordered to retreat from those positions on the evening of 12 June.
The division eventually took up positions on the VKT-line in the Äyräpää-Vuosalmi sector as part of the III Corps. Despite temporal breach of the Finnish line at Vuosalmi, the Finns stabilized the situation and held the VKT Line of defenses. Actions in the sector quieted down, with both sides settling for trench warfare in mid-July. The war came to an end with the signing of the Moscow Armistice on 19 August 1944.

Nazra for Feminist Studies is a women's rights organisation based in Egypt. This group contributes to the continuity and development of the Egyptian and regional feminist movement in the Middle East and North Africa. The group believes that feminism and gender are political and social issues affecting freedom and development in all societies. The group provides support in relation to gender-based violence and discrimination as well as gender equality and women's presence in the public sphere. Nazra has a particular focus on youth groups seeking support for gender-related causes.
Women human rights defenders (WHRDs) working in Nazra face strong traditional and patriarchal structures which make campaigning against gender violence and inequality difficult. The group has documented many cases of violations against women in which members of the police and medical personnel engaged in victim-blaming or caused further discrimination or harm when the original rights violations were reported.
Founder
The group was founded by Egyptian feminist activist Mozn Hassan in Cairo in December 2007. Having received the Charlotte Bunch Award for her work on Women's Human Rights in 2013, a travel ban order was imposed on her in 2016, which prevented her from leaving Egypt. She has received the Right Livelihood Award, known as the Alternative Nobel Prize, for her work on women's human rights and is a board member of the Global Fund for Women.
Interrogation
In March 2018, the assets of the group and of Mozn Hassan were frozen by the Egyptian government at Cairo Elementary Court, in a case referred to in the Egyptian media as the "foreign funding" case 173/2011. This asset freeze was unprecedented, with Nazra being the only NGO targeted and some staff members received a summons for interrogation.
Volunteers work on behalf of the group, despite the lack of a stable office space. The Nazra worker's case is part of a wider movement of human rights groups who are making public their fear of a #aShutteredPublicSphere.

This is a list of squares in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Terminology
In Danish, a square is typically called a Plads (Højbro Plads, Israels Plads etc.) or a Torv (or -torv, Christianshavns Torv, Nytorv). The Danish use the word "plads" where an English-speaker would generally use the word "square." This follows the pattern established in other European languages: the German use the cognate "platz" (Berlin's Potsdamer Platz); the French "place" (Paris' Place de Vosque); the Spanish "plaza" (like Madrid's Plaza Mayor); and the Italian "piazza" (Rome's Piazza Navona). The word "torv" literally means "market" and in toponyms often commemorates a market that used to take place at the site: Amagertorv was the place where the Amager farmers used to sell their produce and Kultorvet (literally "The Coal Market") was Copenhagen's main coal market. However, this is not always the case: Søtorvet was never a marketplace, nor was Sølvtorvet ever a hub for trade in silver. The word "byrum" (literally "urban room") has a somewhat broader meaning then "plads" or "torv", roughly similar to "urban space" (or public space"), but is purely a generic term which is not used in toponyms.

A roof seamer is a portable roll forming machine that is used to install mechanically seamed structural standing-seam metal roof panels, as part of an overall metal construction building envelope system. The machine is small and portable to be handled by an operator on top of a roof. The machine is applied to the overlapping area when two parallel roof panels meet. The action of the machine bends the two panels together to form a joint that has weather-tight qualities superior to other types of roof systems and cladding.
History
Commonly, a roof seamer is developed as an afterthought. Since roof seamers are dependent on the metal roof system being used, their development was secondary to the roof panel. A roof seamer is a development that replaced a manual process and hand tools of the past. A hammer and small anvil were tools that were used for hemming and seaming roof panels together at the edge where they meet with the next roof panel in sequence.
In 1976, a German immigrant and inventor, Ewald Stellrecht, helped develop an early version of a metal roof panel portable roll forming machine in Exton, PA. From this a version of the roof seamer was also created. Since that time, great strides and innovations have been made in the development of roof seaming machines. Also, in the 1970s, Butler Manufacturing developed and released a proprietary roof system that featured the use of an electric roof seamer, dubbed the Roof Runner®, along with hand tools and an operating platform. Many developments have been made since that time to make roof seamers lighter, faster, and more user-friendly. In 1989, Developmental Industries refocused the niche market by developing a line of roof seamers that were universal to many different panel manufacturers' products and were available to rent by the end-user. Traditionally, purchasing a roof seamer meant that it would work with one specific roof panel, manufactured by a specific roof panel manufacturer. By opening up builders and installers to the option of renting, this allowed them to have the option of buying from different sources and greatly reducing their cost, making metal roofing a more accessible option for many that would not consider it before.
Design and function
Today roof seamers are used around the world. As the rise in popularity in sustainable building products has risen in recent years, the need of a roof seaming tool has also increased. Most roof seaming machines can have a life expectancy of 20 or more years, if proper maintenance and care are exercised.
Variables
Many variables exist when using a roof seamer that may affect the final product outcome. All of the following variables should be considered and decided on during the design process of the building:
Material: Metal roof panels are made from a variety of materials including coated carbon steel, aluminum, zinc, and copper. The type and strength of the material must be considered, not only for tensile strength but also flexural strength. The quality of materials should be considered based on the mill and country it was sourced from. Most often these materials come to the panel manufacturer in the form of a coil, then fed into a roll forming machine to produce the finished roof panel shape and dimension.
Material Coating: A coating can be layers of other metals (material treated through the process of galvanization), paint, or extruded coatings.
Thickness: Different gauges of metal will present a range of thicknesses that must be accounted for with the forming dies of the roof seaming machine. This, in addition to the thickness of the coating, should be factored in to produce an acceptable seamed profile, but not to compromise the coating.
Geography: The particular location of the structure will play into its performance over time. Weather patterns, temperature ranges, and prolonged exposure to the elements can affect the thermal movement of the metal roof panels.
Structural Load: Many things can produce "load" on a roof. The most common that will be combated by the roof seamer are considered environmental loads, such as wind, snow, rain, and seismic considerations.
Sealants: Sealants are almost always used inside of the panel lapped seams. These sealants can be applied in a factory setting or at the construction site. In either case, liquid caulk sealant and butyl tapes are the most common. In either case, the amount, location, and application method are specified to cause maximum protection for the building system as a whole.
Desired results: The "finished seam profile" can be specified by a roof panel manufacturer as an option for the architectural designer to consider. Factors that can affect the desired results would be aesthetic appearance and environmental loads.
Roof Pitch: A roof's pitch is simply the angle of the roof. This will create resistance for the roof seamer to overcome. The steeper the pitch, the greater the roof seamer may have to work to ascend and descend the roof panels.
Fastening method: Mechanically seamed standing seam roof systems use a hidden fastener system. This system consists of a "clip" that is fabricated out of metal and attached to the structure's substrate with screws. When the panels are installed over these clips, they will be hidden from view and formed into the seam of the panels with the roof seamer. This prevents penetrations from fasteners and screws through the metal roof panel that would be used to secure them to the structure with other types of metal roofs.
Ancillary Attachments: Roof-mounted HVAC, solar panels, snow guards, and many other products are often attached to standing seam metal roofs. This additional load, attachment methods and the use of dissimilar materials must be considered. Specifically the use of other materials to prevent galvanic corrosion and premature compromise and degradation of the materials.
Power and usage
Traditionally, roof seamers are powered by electricity-driven motors. Depending on the operator's location, either 120-volt or 240-volt power may be required. On most construction sites, either temporary electrical power is supplied or power is offered by an electric generator. This gives the operator the flexibility to take the power source onto a roof with them instead of using extensions cords, which can depreciate the power supply and possibly damage the motor of the roof seamer.
Training
While simple in concept, the effective use of the roof seamer requires a trained person to operate. Training is both practical and effective in on-site troubleshooting. While classroom and practical training are options to learn how to operate a roof seamer, on-the-job training is recommended as being the most effective method. Manuals, videos, and field guides are also methods that will support training. In all cases, training should be completed before operating alone with a roof seamer to teach proper preventive maintenance steps, simple adjustments and troubleshooting in the event of a machine problem.
In 2015, the Metal Construction Association published a "best practices" guide for proper use and operation of roof seaming tools.
Maintenance
As with any tool, proper maintenance will increase the usefulness and life expectancy. Proper maintenance extends beyond the roof seamer, to the working surface on the roof. Before operating the roof seamer, ensure that the roof panel and seam are clean and clear of debris that could mark or gouge the forming dies. During operation check lubrication points and other recommended maintenance steps. In addition, most manufacturers will recommend scheduled service on an annual basis to ensure internal components are not worn or damaged.
Other tools
In conjunction with the roof seaming machine, there are an array of hand tools that are used. The most common tool that is usually required when operating a roof seamer is a "hand crimper". The hand crimper is used to "flat form" the panel seams into the appropriate configuration to prepare the seam for the roof seamer to be applied. Other common tools are snips, nibblers, and shears.
Support organizations
There are numerous professional and trade organizations that support metal roofing, metal construction and the core market where roof seamers are used. The Metal Roofing Alliance (MRA), Metal Construction Association (MCA), Metal Buildings Manufacturers Association (MBMA), the Metal Buildings Contractors and Erectors Association (MBCEA), and the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) are just a few. In addition, many distributors and suppliers offer resources and support documentation for their particular product offerings.

Treasure Hunt is a UK game show, based on the format of the French show La Chasse au Trésor, created by Jacques Antoine. It appeared on Channel 4 between 28 December 1982 and 18 May 1989 and was revived by BBC Two between 16 December 2002 and 2 August 2003.
The game
A team of two contestants in the studio had to use a library of maps and reference materials to solve up to five clues, and communicate instructions via a radio link to a skyrunner who had the use of a helicopter. Although viewers could see the skyrunner, the contestants could not, and all communication between them was by sound only. The contestants were given the first clue for free, the solving of which would lead to the location of the second clue and so on until a trinket or other significant object was found by solving the final clue.
The contestants won a higher cash prize each time they solved a clue correctly. This was all done against the clock. Even once the contestants had solved the final clue, the skyrunner still had to confirm they were correct, by reaching the final target. On a few occasions, the contestants solved all five clues with time to spare, in which case, a bonus clue was given to the contestants. This typically resulted in their winning a bottle of champagne.
The skyrunner and helicopter did not have freedom to fly and land anywhere they wished. Although the pilot could to an extent request permission from airspace authorities to fly off-course, as happened on occasions, landings needed to be agreed in advance with landowners of a suitable location near the clue. On occasions the helicopter would land in a clearly marked out area, especially at public places. Kenneth Kendall always stressed that he did not know the clues and locations in advance, and any help that he gave the contestants was from his own knowledge.
According to a "making of Treasure Hunt" programme, Anneka Rice was confined to the hotel on the day that the camera operator, video and sound recordist; and helicopter pilot undertook a rehearsal (typically the day before the programme was recorded), so she had no advance knowledge of the locations. This did not stop her carrying out research about the general area in order to have a stock of facts to fill in any silences that might arise while the contestants were thinking.
Presenters and crew
In the original version, the presenter was former BBC newsreader Kenneth Kendall and the "skyrunner" was broadcaster Anneka Rice. In the first series, Kendall was joined briefly in the studio for the handover of the first clue by the original clue-setter, Ann Meo. She would later rejoin the contestants if they had been successful in finding the treasure to offer her congratulations. If they had been unsuccessful, she would be heard as a voiceover explaining where they had gone wrong.
From the second series onwards, this role was expanded, another studio-based person acted as adjudicator, giving the contestants tips on how they were doing against the scheduled time, and providing additional information about the locations visited. In series 2, this was Annette Lynton ("Nettie") and from series 3 onwards, TV-am weather girl Wincey Willis.
In 1988, Rice left to have a baby, and her place was taken by tennis player Annabel Croft. In this series, the set was revamped due to a move to Thames Television's facilities (the original studios were at Trilion in Soho, London, and then Limehouse Studios on Canary Wharf in Docklands, East London which was later earmarked for demolition to make way for One Canada Square), and Willis was promoted to sharing main billing with Kendall. Croft was billed as "Guest Skyrunner" for the first episode of the series, and it was stated at the time that Rice would return after giving birth, but it turned out to be the show's final series and the "Guest Skyrunner" credit was dropped.
In the BBC's 2002–2003 version, newsreader Dermot Murnaghan presented, the "skyrunner" was Suzi Perry, and there was no adjudicator. Advances in broadcasting technology meant that this new version could come from a much greater range of locations; however, the new version was short-lived.
Keith Thompson of Castle Air Charters was the usual helicopter pilot in both versions, though for overseas editions a local pilot was often used. There was always a "chase" helicopter which relayed radio signals back to London and, although this could never be used tactically by the contestants, it was not hidden from the viewers. This communications helicopter had dark green with gold stripe livery, registration G-SPEY. The two crews would sometimes fly in formation to generate exciting footage. During one episode, G-SPEY was utilised to film pictures instead of Graham in G-BHXU; Keith was required to land on a submarine in Plymouth Sound, and footage from a second cameraman in G-SPEY was used to show his landing.
Both helicopters were usually Bell 206 JetRangers; the helicopter usually used by the skyrunner was registration G-BHXU (which crash landed at sea in 1995 due to engine/gearbox failure).
A feature was made of the camaraderie between the female presenter and the male recording and flight crews. Shots from the rear as the presenter ran from clue to clue in a jump-suit were satirised on Spitting Image. Cameraman Graham reaching in front of the camera to wipe away rain, sea spray, etc. with a cloth also became a well-known image from the series.
In 1985, the cameraman, Graham Berry, was awarded a BAFTA for his contribution to the series.
The contestants would win a cash prize of £1,000 (£2,000 in the revived version).
Broadcasts
When first shown on Channel 4 on 28 December 1982, Treasure Hunt was one of the earliest major series on the then-new channel. The unusual format earned extra publicity for both the programme and the channel, which was striving to justify itself with new and different programming.
The 1982–1989 series were repeated on terrestrial television several times, and during the 1990s appeared on the Challenge satellite and cable channel, as well as Sky Travel. The first episode was repeated on 30 October 2007 on the digital channel More4 as part of Channel 4's 25th anniversary celebrations. This was a one-off and there are no current plans to repeat the TV show.
On 21 November 2013, Challenge announced that they re-acquired the first two series. The first episode was repeated again on 28 December 2013 as part of Challenge's First Ever Episodes weekend. Challenge confirmed that the re-run of series 1 and 2 would air on Saturdays and Sundays from 8 February 2014. The Saturday episode was screened at 6pm and the Sunday episode aired at 5pm (times varied afterwards).
The original run of the first series was watched by up to 900,000 viewers; however, by the mid-1980s, ratings were some of the highest for Channel 4 at around seven million.
Two charity editions of the show were produced, one locally in the London area for the Thames Television telethon in 1985 and another broadcast across the UK as part of the ITV network's Telethon '88. The show was also featured in an edition of the BBC children's aspiration show Jim'll Fix It, in which a young viewer joined Anneka Rice in the famous helicopter over the county of Surrey for a scaled down version of the show, in The Paul Daniels Magic Show (BBC) and in The Krypton Factor (Granada for ITV).
For all the UK series, the programme was a Chatsworth Television independent production in association with Tele Union Paris.
Spin-offs
An eponymous board game based on the show was published in the UK. It involved moving pieces around a map of England and Wales.
There was also a computer game released for some home computer formats in 1986, including for the BBC Micro, published by Macsen Software. This game featured very basic graphic layout and was text-driven, and had the options of four locations to find clues in.
A one-off Welsh language version, (Welsh for "Treasure Hunt"), was produced for S4C in 1985.
BBC Three Counties Radio aired Treasure Quest each Sunday from 9am to 12 noon. Andy Gelder was in the studio and varying assistants in the radio car help two contestants to solve clues over the three-hour period. This format has now changed to Saturday mornings and now hosted by Jonathan Vernon-Smith, sharing with BBC Radio Northampton, with two runners running simultaneously in the two radio areas during the same programme. It currently airs from 10am to 12pm.
BBC Radio Norfolk began their own version of Treasure Quest in 2008, on Sunday mornings from 9am to 12 noon. David Whiteley presents in the studio, with Sophie Little in the radio car. On 6 September 2009, Wincey Willis stood in for the then clue hunter Becky Betts, and on 14 February 2010, Anneka Rice took part in the programme, appearing at the fifth clue location, Norwich Castle, and then teaming up with Betts to find the treasure.
On London's talk station LBC, presenter James O'Brien hosted The Treasure Hunt on Wednesday lunchtimes as part of his weekday show. In this format, callers rang in and requested things they had been trying to get hold of, hoping that other listeners had the required items. Although otherwise unrelated to the original concept, the programme opened with the Treasure Hunt television series theme tune, and in August 2007, Anneka Rice recorded a voice-over lead-in for it.
BBC Radio Shropshire present their own version of Treasure Hunt on Sunday mornings with presenter Ryan Kennedy reading out a set of clues to various locations. Prior to the first COVID-19 lockdown, the answers gave directions with a colleague driving to that location in the county. Currently the quiz operates as a virtual tour with the answers providing locations both in the county and worldwide.

The House of Tęczyński was a powerful family of nobility (szlachta) in the Kingdom of Poland, during the times of the late Piast dynasty, the Jagiellon dynasty and in the early decades of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (from 14th century to early 17th century). They were an important family from Lesser Poland (Małopolska), active in Polish politics of their time.
Family's history and importance
According to a legend, the family traced its origins to the 12th century magnate, Sieciech, or even to some older individuals, rumored to be powerful "princes" before Mieszko I created the Polish state. According to historians, the first verifiable member of the Tęczyński family was Nawój z Morawicy (d. 1331), castellan of Kraków, who laid the foundations of his family greatness. They used the Topór coat of arms. His son Andrzej Tęczyński (d. 1369), voivode of Kraków, begun the construction of the family's castle, continued by his descendants. Jan Tęczyński (d. 1405), starost and castellan of Kraków, was also one of the most important advisers to the first King of Poland of the Jagiellon dynasty, Władysław Jagiełło. Jan Tęczyński (d. 1470), castellan of Kraków, voivode of Kraków and Lublin, was recognized as one of the two most important Polish magnates of his time (the other one was cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki. Andrzej Tęczyński (d. 1536), castellan of Kraków, voivode of Kraków, Lublin and Sandomierz, in 1527 received a hereditary title of a count from the Holy Roman Emperor.
The family had numerous possessions, most of them in the Lesser Poland, Kraków Voivodeship (including a large latifundium near Kraków). Its members often held the posts of castellan of Kraków and voivode of Kraków. The family, recognized during the 14th to mid-17th centuries as one of the most important in Lesser Poland, lost influence after the death of its last male member, Jan Magnus Tęczyński in 1637.
The family seat was the Tenczyn Castle (also known as Tęczyn Castle), now a ruin in the village of Rudno. The castle would fall in ruin after being pillaged by the Swedes, looking for rumored treasures of the Tęczyński family, during The Deluge in the mid-17th century. Subsequently, rebuilt, after a fire in mid-18th century it was never rebuilt again.
Polish poet Jan Kochanowski wrote a poem Pamiątka Tęczyńskiemu [A memory for Tęczyński]. Polish writer Józef Ignacy Kraszewski dedicated one of his works to the family: Tęczyńscy: dramat historyczny w pięciu aktach prozą [Tęczyńscy: a historical drama in five acts in prose] (1844).

Michiko Sellars (born 7 April 1985), known by her stage name MiChi, is a Japanese British pop singer who began her career as an independent artist, but later signed to Sony Music Entertainment.
Biography
Early life and early career
Michiko was born in Bromsgrove, England to a Japanese mother and an English father. She moved to Kobe, Japan at the age of two in 1987, but returned to England in 1995 after the Great Hanshin earthquake. Determined to be a singer, she performed in an acoustic duo before returning to Japan when she was 18. The following year, she met Tomokazu Matsuzawa, producer for acts such as Mika Nakashima, Miliyah Kato, Soulhead, and Chemistry. The pair worked together for three years developing her talent before MiChi entered Japan's dance club scene. In March 2007, she released the track "Surrender" on a dance compilation titled Freedom House Mode Collection. It was followed a year later with her independently released English language album Michi Madness, which entered the Japanese Oricon weekly albums chart, but only peaked at number 148.
Up To You
Later in 2008 she officially debuts under Sony Music Entertainment and produced her first single titled "Promise," peaking at number 12 on the Oricon weekly charts. Her second single, titled "Change the World," was released on 18 February 2009 and was used in the drama Kiina: Fukanō Hanzaisōsa-kan.
On 30 September 2009, MiChi released her debut major album Up to You, which was successful and peaked at number 4 on the Oricon weekly album chart. Her song "Something Missing" was used as the theme song in the Sega video game Bayonetta, as well as for commercials promoting the game.
Second major album: Therapy
In April 2010, she released the single "All About the Girls (Ii jan ka Party People)/Together Again". "Together Again" was used as the theme song for the movie Bushido Sixteen directed by Tomoyuki Furumaya. The music video for "All About The Girls", which features a mix of stop motion, studio and computer generated footage was produced in collaboration with Tokyo dance-troupe Handsome Boyz. In July 2010, she released "Wonder Woman," featuring the Japanese indie band The Telephones. MiChi's final 2010 release was her first Japanese language EP, Love Is. Released due to the delay of her second studio album, the album features four previously unreleased recordings, including three original songs, and a cover of The Offspring's "Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)." The title track from the EP received a stop motion music video, filmed from back to front.
In response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, MiChi released online the demo of "One," a song she had been working on. The song, featuring emotional and supportive lyrics, received heavy radio rotation in the days and weeks following the disaster. This led to her label allowing MiChi to finish the song, and release it as an official single. It eventually peaked at 85 on the Oricon charts. Later in 2011, MiChi released her eighth single, "Find Your Way." It charted at number 93, selling just 674 copies, despite a high-profile promotional appearance at the MTV VMAJ awards. On 1 February 2012, MiChi released her ninth single, "Tokyo Nights" featuring Swedish-Japanese indie musician, Leo Imai. The music video, which shows MiChi in various locations throughout Tokyo, including at the Tokyo Tower, was released shortly before the single hit shelves. On 11 February, MiChi finally released details of her second major label album, titled Therapy. Alongside the album title, MiChi also revealed that the album would be released in three different versions, CD, 2CD, and CD/DVD, with the DVD featuring six of MiChi's music videos, and the second CD version having an extra seven-track "Remix collection" with remixes from the likes of Busy P and DSL from the French label, Ed Banger Records.

The Empire Wrestling Federation (EWF) is an independent wrestling promotion based in Covina, California. It is owned and operated by Jesse Hernandez. The EWF is also tied to Hernandez's wrestling school, The School Of Hard Knocks. The EWF is the longest running promotion in Southern California, running continuously from 1996. The EWF is a former affiliate of the National Wrestling Alliance.
History
EWF was founded in 1996 by Bill Anderson and Jesse Hernandez. The promotion's name comes from the Inland Empire, the popular name of the area surrounding San Bernardino.
It saw its first show in May 1996 at the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino as Bobby Bradley defeated Tom "Zuma" Howard to become the first EWF Heavyweight Champion. In 1999, Bill Anderson left the EWF and formed his own promotion and wrestling school, the International Wrestling Council in Riverside, California. In June 1996, a tribute to Superstar Billy Graham was held.
Several EWF wrestlers from the past have gone on to national fame, including Rico Constantino, Awesome Kong, Louie Spicolli, Frankie Kazarian, Christopher Daniels, Shelly Martinez and Melina Perez. In 1997, Chris Jericho and Lee Marshall of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) mentioned EWF on WCW broadcasts and Marshall attended a show in Hemet, California. Other pro wrestling stars have made appearance at EWF shows including Mando Guerrero, Peter Maivia, Ludvig Borga, The Honky Tonk Man, Tony Atlas and Tom Brandi. Many EWF wrestlers appear as jobbers on World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) broadcasts, and at the 1999 Royal Rumble the orderlies sent to apprehend Kane were performed by the EWF roster, including then owners Bill Anderson and Jesse Hernandez.
They held their 20th Anniversary Extravaganza at the EWF Arena in Covina, Ca on May 6, 2016.
School of Hard Knocks
The EWF School of Hard Knocks is owned and operated by Jesse Hernandez and is currently located at the American Sports University, 399 North "D" Street in San Bernardino, CA.

The EWF's School of Hard Knocks has sent several wrestlers to prominent promotions across the globe including Melina, Rico Constantino, Frankie Kazarian, Awesome Kong, Rocky Romero, Ricky Reyes, Alex Koslov and Shelly Martinez. The School of Hard Knocks also has served as the training area for Chris Jericho, Layla, Eve Torres, Rhaka Khan, Lena Yada and others, who looked to brush up on their in-ring skills. The school and some of its students are set to be promoted in the upcoming reality show, "Slam School".

More generally, a nilpotent transformation is a linear transformation of a vector space such that for some positive integer (and thus, for all ). Both of these concepts are special cases of a more general concept of nilpotence that applies to elements of rings.
Examples
Example 1
The matrix
is nilpotent with index 2, since .
Example 2
More generally, any -dimensional triangular matrix with zeros along the main diagonal is nilpotent, with index . For example, the matrix
is nilpotent, with
The index of is therefore 4.
Example 3
Although the examples above have a large number of zero entries, a typical nilpotent matrix does not. For example,
although the matrix has no zero entries.
Example 4
Additionally, any matrices of the form
such as
or
square to zero.
Example 5
Perhaps some of the most striking examples of nilpotent matrices are square matrices of the form:
The first few of which are:
These matrices are nilpotent but there are no zero entries in any powers of them less than the index.
Example 6
Consider the linear space of polynomials of a bounded degree. The derivative operator is a linear map. We know that applying the derivative to a polynomial decreases its degree by one, so when applying it iteratively, we will eventually obtain zero. Therefore, on such a space, the derivative is representable by a nilpotent matrix.
Characterization
For an square matrix with real (or complex) entries, the following are equivalent:
is nilpotent.
The characteristic polynomial for is .
The minimal polynomial for is for some positive integer .
The only complex eigenvalue for is 0.
The last theorem holds true for matrices over any field of characteristic 0 or sufficiently large characteristic. (cf. Newton's identities)
This theorem has several consequences, including:
The index of an nilpotent matrix is always less than or equal to . For example, every nilpotent matrix squares to zero.
The determinant and trace of a nilpotent matrix are always zero. Consequently, a nilpotent matrix cannot be invertible.
The only nilpotent diagonalizable matrix is the zero matrix.

Classification
Consider the (upper) shift matrix:
This matrix has 1s along the superdiagonal and 0s everywhere else. As a linear transformation, the shift matrix "shifts" the components of a vector one position to the left, with a zero appearing in the last position:
This matrix is nilpotent with degree , and is the canonical nilpotent matrix.
Specifically, if is any nilpotent matrix, then is similar to a block diagonal matrix of the form
where each of the blocks is a shift matrix (possibly of different sizes). This form is a special case of the Jordan canonical form for matrices.
For example, any nonzero 2 × 2 nilpotent matrix is similar to the matrix
That is, if is any nonzero 2 × 2 nilpotent matrix, then there exists a basis b1, b2 such that Nb1 = 0 and Nb2 = b1.
This classification theorem holds for matrices over any field. (It is not necessary for the field to be algebraically closed.)
Flag of subspaces
A nilpotent transformation on naturally determines a flag of subspaces
and a signature
The signature characterizes up to an invertible linear transformation. Furthermore, it satisfies the inequalities
Conversely, any sequence of natural numbers satisfying these inequalities is the signature of a nilpotent transformation.
Additional properties
Generalizations
A linear operator is locally nilpotent if for every vector , there exists a such that
For operators on a finite-dimensional vector space, local nilpotence is equivalent to nilpotence.

Badge 373 is a 1973 American neo noir crime thriller film inspired, as was The French Connection, by the life and career of Eddie Egan, here called "Eddie Ryan". The film, which has a screenplay by journalist Pete Hamill, was produced and directed by Howard W. Koch, and stars Robert Duvall as Ryan, with Verna Bloom, Henry Darrow and Eddie Egan himself as a police lieutenant.
The film was not successful, either at the box office or with the critics.
Plot
Eddie Ryan (Robert Duvall), a tough, no-nonsense, abrasive and racist Irish NYPD cop, has to turn in his badge after scuffling with a Puerto Rican suspect who then falls to his death from a rooftop, but that doesn't stop him from heading out on a one-man crusade to find out who killed his partner of three years, Gigi Caputo (Louis Cosentino), all the while neglecting his new live-in girlfriend, Maureen (Verna Bloom). Ryan's search leads him to Puerto Rican drug kingpin Sweet Willie (Henry Darrow), and a shipment of guns for Puerto Rican independentistas.

Dominican salsa bandleader and cofounder/musical director of Fania Records Johnny Pacheco & his Orchestra makes a cameo appearance in the opening nightclub sequence.
Production
Badge 373 was shot on location on the streets of New York City. At one point, in what film writer Jeff Stafford calls a deliberate attempt to recall the car-chase scene from The French Connection, which was also based on the exploits of Eddie Egan, Robert Duvall as police detective Eddie Ryan attempts to chase down suspects in their car by hijacking a city bus, the 14th Street crosstown. The chase does not follow actual Manhattan geography, and passes locations including the West 125th viaduct and a meatpacking plant, and a branch of the record store King Karol at 460 West 42nd Street. Locations for other scenes include the Manhattan Bridge, with the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in the background, and the FDR Drive, with the United Nations headquarters visible.
On August 10, 1973, Paramount Pictures rejected a demand by the Puerto Rican Action Coalition to withdraw the film for what the coalition called the movie's racism.

Controversy
Puerto Ricans picketed the film claiming it was discriminatory against that group.
Critical response
The critical reaction to Badge 373 was generally negative. In The New York Times, Roger Greenspun pointed out the biases of the film: "All of the evil is perpetrated by Puerto Ricans, either innocent but violent revolutionaries who run around shouting 'Puerto Rico Libre!' or the uninnocent but equally violent nonrevolutionaries who manipulate them. Against such forces, Eddie the hard-nosed cop has only the instincts of his personal bigotry to guide him. And invariably the instincts of his personal bigotry turn out to be right. ... [U]nless you care to hate Puerto Ricans (or Irish cops) I don't see how the movie can have anything for you". Variety called it "a ploddingly paced police meller with racist and fascist undertones ... Producer Howard W. Koch,doubling as director, demonstrates no visual style or energy and even allows the several obligatory chase sequences to dribble into tedium." Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was positive, giving the film three stars out of four and calling it "a tough movie with some interesting things to say about cops-and-robbers morality." Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film half of one star out of four, writing that it played "like a Mad magazine parody" of The French Connection, "only the filmmakers aren't kidding." Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, "In short, Hamill has turned out a hack script. The result is a potboiler movie that, if anything, patronizes rather than illuminates its working-class hero despite the authenticity with which Duvall, always a fine actor, invests him." Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it "a dull, shoddy spinoff" of The French Connection, adding that "Duvall's cop is a little cruder than Hackman's, and he also seems less capable. The lack of any originality in the characterization is a little embarrassing: 'Badge 373' seems to think it's different because Duvall insults Puerto Ricans, whereas Hackman insulted Negroes." John Gillett of The Monthly Film Bulletin compared Badge 373 unfavorably to Dirty Harry in that "unlike Siegel, Koch fails to put his hero's activities in any kind of perspective; and even though the violence is kept in check, its ambiguities leave a somewhat repellent taste. All in all, another deeply divided and scarcely reassuring addition to the movies' composite portrait of the American police force."

Hassell v. Bird was a case heard within the California court system related to a court-ordered removal of a defamatory user review of a law firm from the Yelp website. The case, first heard in the California Court of Appeals, First District, Division Four, unanimously ruled in favor of the law firm, ordering Yelp to remove the review in 2016. Yelp refused to remove the review and appealed the decision. In July 2018, the California Supreme Court reversed the order in a closely divided 4-3 decision, stating that Yelp's position fell within Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as a publisher of user material, and was not required to comply with the trial court's removal order. However, the part of the trial court's decision that ordered the reviewer to remove the defamatory review and pay a monetary judgement were left intact. The Supreme Court of the United States denied hearing the appeal, leaving the California Supreme Court's decision.
Background
In the summer of 2012, San Francisco attorney Dawn Hassell began to represent client Ava Bird in a personal injury claim. Hassell represented Bird for only 25 days after Bird signed an attorney-client fee agreement on August 20, over which Hassell had initiated 15 communications, 12 of those in writing, to Bird, and spoken to Bird's insurance provider at least twice, but Bird did not respond to those requests. Hassell withdrew from Bird's case on September 23, 2012 due to Bird's lack of communications.
Bird then published a maliciously false review of Hassell's firm on Yelp in January 2013 (Bird's first review), under the name "Birdzeye B. Los Angeles, CA." She rated her experience with Hassell as one out of five stars, and untruthfully claimed that Hassell's firm neglected to contact the involved insurance company and failed to communicate with Bird herself or the insurance agency. Upon seeing these reviews, Hassell reached out to Bird, requesting that she remove the defamation from the website. Bird responded by email refusing to remove her review, and threatened to post more reviews. Hassell did not respond to this email.
Soon after, another negative one-star review of Hassell's firm appeared on Yelp in February 2013. This review was written under a different name: "J.D. Alameda, C.A." Hassell had never represented a client with the initials J.D., and given Bird's threats, she suspected Bird wrote this review because of its similarities in writing style with the January 2013 review. Hassell reached to Yelp but they refused to resolve the matter or remove any of the content posted by Bird.
Hassell then filed a lawsuit against Bird on April 17, 2013, claiming that Bird's reviews were defamatory and injurious to Hassell's business reputation. Bird acknowledged the lawsuit in an update to her first review and then ignored the lawsuit and failed to appear in court. Hassell then filed a default judgment against Bird and requested the Court order Bird and Yelp to delete her reviews. The court, after reviewing extensive briefing showing the content was malicious and false, and hearing testimony at the hearing where Bird again failed to appear, issued such an order. But neither Bird nor Yelp complied.
During the lawsuit, on April 29, 2013, Bird—under the "Birdzeye" username—posted another Yelp review in response to her first review in January and addressing Hassell's lawsuit. She claimed that Hassell's legal action aimed to "threaten, bully, intimidate, [and] harass me into removing the review."
Lower court ruling
On January 14, 2014, a default prove-up hearing was held before the Honorable Donald Sullivan. Bird, who failed to file an answer to the lawsuit, refused to appear. After a hearing and receipt of evidence and testimony, Hassell was awarded $557,918.75 in general and special damages against Bird, but was denied punitive damages.
The court also issued an order ordering Ava Bird to remove all defamatory Yelp reviews published about Hassell Law Group, and urging her to refrain from posting online any "written reviews, commentary, or descriptions" of Hassell or Hassell Law Group. Additionally, Yelp.com was ordered to remove Bird's reviews within 7 days of the court's order.
The courts cited Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C § 230 (Section 230 of the CDA) which offers protection for the blocking and screening of offensive material. Though it states that websites cannot be held accountable as the publisher or speaker of third party user-posted content, the Court of Appeal ruled that the removal order ordering Yelp to remove the defamatory content did not violate section 230 because it did not impose any liability on Yelp as a publisher of third party content, it only ordered Yelp to remove those specific reviews the lower court declared to be defamatory.
This judgment was finalized on March 16, 2014. Yelp then appealed to the Supreme Court of California on May 23, 2014, to set aside the judgment. Yelp claimed it was an "aggrieved party," arguing that its right to due process was violated because Hassell had not sued/identified Yelp as a party defendant, that the CDA barred the lower court's order against Yelp, and that Bird's First Amendment rights were violated because Hassell had not adequately proved that Bird's comments were defamatory.
The Supreme Court of California agreed to consider the lawsuit on September 21, 2016.
Issues before the California Supreme Court
The application of the Communications Decency Act by the Appeals court raised concerns throughout the Internet community due to its potential impact on republishers, sites that host user-content but otherwise do not regulate it. A petition for review to the Supreme Court of California was filed on July 18, 2016, arguing that while Section 230 of the CDA defines the user of a computer service or website as the "publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider," the lower court's ruling was wrongly holding Yelp.com accountable for Bird's speech based on Yelp's online publication of her content.
The Appeals court decision had effects on other online communities after its issuing. Glassdoor.com, a website similar to Yelp that allows users to anonymously rate and review their employers, claimed in an amicus brief that since Hassell was published, they began receiving more demand letters from users to remove unfavorable reviews. Airbnb, another Internet-based business that depends on third party user-posted reviews, also petitioned the California Supreme Court for review, arguing that the opinion in Hassell would effectively weaken the legal protections granted to websites in Section 230 of the CDA, by holding websites accountable for third party user-posted content.
The case was argued before the California Supreme Court on April 3. The California Supreme Court issued its decision on July 2, 2018, partially reversing the lower court's decision to vacate the order on Yelp to remove the review. The court found that the lower court had employed too narrow a ruling on the Communication Decency Act in judging Yelp's participating in the case. The court wrote that if it had upheld the lower court's order on Yelp, it would have created a means to legally bind republishers for content they did not create. They wrote that this would "interfere with and undermine the viability of an online platform" and "the unique position of internet intermediaries convinced Congress to spare republishers of online content ... from this sort of ongoing entanglement with the courts." The California Supreme Court left intact the order that Bird must remove the review themselves from Yelp and pay a fine.
United States Supreme Court
The law firm of Charles Harder, representing Hassell following the California Supreme Court decision, filed a petition of writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States in October 2018 challenging the decision related to the application of Section 230 of the CDA. Harder's firm had been involved in a number of defamation cases, including both President Donald Trump and Melania Trump. The Supreme Court denied hearing the case, without comment, in orders issued January 22, 2019, leaving the California Supreme Court's decision in place.

Than Htay (; born 12 November 1954) is a Burmese politician and incumbent chairperson of the Union Solidarity and Development Party. He previously served as the Minister for Rail Transportation, and Minister for Energy. He is a retired brigadier general in the Myanmar Army.
Early life
Than Htay was born on 12 November 1954 in Ayeyarwady Region. When he was 17, he was accepted into the Defence Services Academy and earned a bachelor of arts and a master's degree in defense.
Military and political career
Serving in the military until 2010, he peaked as a brigadier general. He left the army at the rank of brigadier general in 2003 to become deputy minister of energy, before being promoted to minister in 2011.
He joined the Union Solidarity and Development Party at its founding in the lead-up to the 2010 election. He won election to the Pyithu Hluttaw, representing Myanaung township, in the 2012 by-election. In 2013, he became minister for energy and for railways. In January 2013, his ministry awarded two new deep-water oil and gas blocks to Thai energy firm PTT Exploration and Production without using a bidding process. The ministry also approved MPRL E&P to extend its contract without a bidding process to operate the Mann oil field in central Myanmar. Due to his controversial decisions over the awarding of exploration licenses and production concessions as a minister, Than Htay was transferred to the Ministry of Rail Transportation on 25 July 2013. He resigned from the post after Thein Sein picked him as a USDP candidate for the 2015 general election.
He publicly supported the controversial Protection of Race and Religion Laws — a set of four laws to regulate religious conversion and population-control measures that passed under sustained lobbying from ultra-nationalist groups.
In November 2015, he ran for re-election but was defeated. In the 2020 Myanmar general election, he won a House of Representatives seat representing Naypyitaw's Zeyathiri Township.

Journey to the Center of the Circle is an adventure in which a party is sent to a legendary shrine of Good in response to a request for help.
Reception
Lewis Pulsipher reviewed Journey to the Center of the Circle in The Space Gamer No. 49. Pulsipher commented that "With some tough editing, this module might have been worth publication in a magazine as an example of an unusual approach to FRP. But as a separate module it is as overpriced as Burgundy Pit, and is otherwise not equal to the Pit'''s modest standard. Unless you're really sold on the idea of halls of testing, save your money."

Varieties of the color blue may differ in hue, chroma (also called saturation, intensity, or colorfulness), or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness), or in two or three of these qualities. Variations in value are also called tints and shades, a tint being a blue or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black. A large selection of these colors is shown below.
Definitions of blue
Blue (RGB) (X11 blue)
The color defined as blue in the RGB color model, X11 blue, is shown at right. This color is the brightest possible blue that can be reproduced on a computer screen, and is the color named blue in X11. It is one of the three primary colors used in the RGB color space, along with red and green. The three additive primaries in the RGB color system are the three colors of light chosen such as to provide the maximum gamut of colors that are capable of being represented on a computer or television set.
This color is also called color wheel blue. It is at 240 degrees on the HSV color wheel, also known as the RGB color wheel. It is a spectral color which lies at, or near, the short-wave (violet) end of the traditional "blue" and possibly was classified as "indigo" by Newton. Its complementary color is yellow.
Blue (CMYK) (pigment blue)
The color defined as blue in the CMYK color system used in printing, also known as pigment blue, is the tone of blue that is achieved by mixing process (printer's) cyan and process (printer's) magenta in equal proportions.
The purpose of the CMYK color system is to provide the maximum possible gamut of color reproducible in printing by the use of only three primaries.
The color indicated is only approximate as the colors of printing inks may vary.
Blue (Pantone)
Blue (Pantone) is the color that is called blue in Pantone.
The source of this color is the "Pantone Textile Paper eXtended (TPX)" color list, color # Blue C, EC, HC, M, PC, U, or UP—Blue.
Blue (NCS) (psychological primary blue)
The color defined as blue in the NCS or Natural Color System is an azure-like color shown at right (NCS 2060-B). The Natural Color System is a color system based on the four unique hues or psychological primary colors red, yellow, green, and blue. The NCS is based on the opponent process theory of vision.
The “Natural Color System” is widely used in Scandinavia.
NCS Blue can only be displayed approximately on a computer screen, as these spectral colors have been adjusted to fit into the sRGB gamut. In the 21st century, this hue is classified as an variation of azure that is on the border of cyan.
Blue (Munsell)
The color defined as blue in the Munsell color system (Munsell 5B) is shown at right. The Munsell color system is a color space that specifies colors based on three color dimensions: hue, value (lightness), and chroma (color purity), spaced uniformly (according to the logarithmic scale which governs human perception) in three dimensions in the Munsell color solid, which is shaped like an elongated oval at an angle. In order for all the colors to be spaced uniformly, it was found necessary to use a color wheel with five primary colors: red, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
Munsell can only be displayed approximately on a computer screen, as these spectral colors have been adjusted to fit into the sRGB gamut. In the 21st century, this hue is classified as an intermediate between azure and cyan.
Blue (Crayola)
Blue (Crayola) is the color called blue in Crayola crayons.
"Blue" was one of the original Crayola crayons formulated in 1903.
Crayola can only be displayed approximately on a computer screen. In the 21st century, this hue is classified as an variation of azure that is on the border of blue.
Tints, shades, and variations of blue
The term tint and shade is used in its technical sense as used in color theory.
In this section, the term 'tint' usually refers to a blueish color mixed with white or light gray. The term shade is used in its technical sense as used in color theory, meaning a blueish color mixed with black or dark gray.
The colors arranged in order of their value (brightness) (V in the HSV code), the brighter colors toward the top and the darker colors toward the bottom.
Periwinkle
Periwinkle (also periwinkle blue or lavender blue) is a mixture of white, blue, and red. It is named after the Periwinkle flower and is also commonly referred to as a tone of light blue.
Ultramarine
Ultramarine is a blue pigment in use since medieval times. It was originally derived from lapis lazuli, a bright blue mineral.
Medium blue
The web color medium blue is a shade of the standard (h = 240°) blue.
Savoy blue
Savoy blue, or savoy azure, is a shade of saturation blue between peacock blue and periwinkle, lighter than peacock blue. It owes its name to its being the color of the House of Savoy, a ruling dynasty in Italy from 1861 to 1946.
Having become a national color with the unification of Italy (1861), its use continued even after the birth of the Italian Republic (1946) with the name "Italian blue". An Italian-blue border was inserted on the edge of the Presidential Standard of Italy and the use of the blue scarf for the Italian Armed Forces' officers, for the presidents of the Italian provinces during the official ceremonies and of the blue jersey for Italian national sports teams it was also maintained in the Republican era.
Liberty
Liberty is a strong blue color.
The first recorded use of liberty as a color name in English was in 1918.
Egyptian blue
Egyptian blue is a pigment that was used in Ancient Egypt.
Neon blue
Neon blue is a vivid purplish blue.
Dark blue
Dark blue is a shade of the standard (h = 240°) blue.
Picotee blue
Picotee blue represents the color of the picotee flower. It is a deep shade of indigo, almost resembling St. Patrick's Blue.
Bluebonnet
Bluebonnet is a bright shade of blue with a slight violet tinge. It represents the color of bluebonnet flowers, which are part of the lupin family. The bluebonnet is the state flower of Texas.
Navy blue
Navy blue is a shade of the standard (h = 240°) blue. Navy blue got its name from the dark blue (contrasted with white) worn by sailors in the Royal Navy since 1748 (originally called marine blue before 1840) and subsequently adopted by other navies around the world.
The first recorded use of navy blue as a color name in English was in 1840.
Midnight blue
Midnight blue is an X11 web color. This color was originally called midnight. The first recorded use of midnight as a color name in English was in 1915.
Independence
Independence is a dark blue color.
The first recorded use of independence as a color name in English was in 1927.
Space cadet
Space cadet is one of the colors on the Resene Color List, a color list popular in Australia and New Zealand. The color "space cadet" was formulated in 2007.
International Klein Blue
International Klein Blue (IKB) is a deep blue hue first mixed by the French artist Yves Klein. IKB's visual impact comes from its heavy reliance on ultramarine, as well as Klein's often thick and textured application of paint to canvas. There is a legend that Klein patented the color, but in reality he simply submitted a Soleau envelope and never progressed to the patent stage.
Blurple (2015-2021)
Original Blurple is a brilliant purplish blue hue. It is the older version of Blurple, described above. It was used in the old Discord logo. Before 13 May 2021, it was simply called Blurple.

Celtic blue is a shade of blue, also known as glas celtig in Welsh, or gorm ceilteach in both the Irish language and in Scottish Gaelic. Julius Caesar reported (in Commentarii de Bello Gallico) that the Britanni used to colour their bodies blue with vitrum, a word that means primarily "glass", but also the domestic name for the "woad" (Isatis tinctoria), besides the Gaulish loanword glastum (from Proto-Celtic *glastos "green"). The connection seems to be that both glass and the woad are "water-like" (lat. vitrum is from Proto-Indo-European *wed-ro- "water-like").

Nanango Butter Factory Building is a heritage-listed factory at George Street, Nanango, South Burnett Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1927. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 June 2005.
History
The Nanango Butter Factory, bounded by George Street and Sandy Creek, Nanango, is closely linked to the development of the Nanango district, as well as the rise and fall of the dairy industry in Queensland. The original factory, made of timber, was built in 1905. The current factory, of concrete and brick construction, was erected in 1927, extended to the north in 1953, and retains a number of its outbuildings and structures. These include loading bays, concrete tanks, sheds, and an office building.
The South Burnett district was first settled by Europeans in the early 1840s, as pastoralists worked their way north from the Darling Downs. By 1842 the sheep station Taromeo had been established by Simon Scott. Two other sheep stations were established shortly thereafter: Nanango, by William Elliot Oliver, and Tarong, by John Borthwick. Taromeo, Nanango and Tarong had all switched to beef cattle by the 1880s. Oliver's Head Station was at a creek two miles west of the site of the town of Nanango. The latter grew around an inn established by Jacob Goode in 1848, after he was allowed to camp near a waterhole on Nanango Station. The tracks from the Darling Downs and Brisbane converged at Goode's Inn on their way to Gayndah.
Nanango is one of Queensland's oldest towns. A post office was established at Goode's Inn in 1850, and in 1857 Nanango was gazetted for Courts of Petty Session, with a Courthouse being built in 1859. In 1861 the town of Nanango was surveyed, and the first sale of town blocks occurred in 1862, between today's Henry, Appin, George and Alfred Streets. James Nash found gold seven miles southeast of Inn in 1866, and the "Seven Mile Diggings" helped to increase the population of the area. Closer settlement began after an 1875 petition, and in 1876 regulations were for drawn up for monthly land courts, the first of which occurred in Nanango in 1877. In 1879 the Barambah Divisional Board was formed, and its office was built in Nanango in 1883. The 1884 Agricultural Lands Purchase Act aided in the resumption of part of Nanango Station for selection by farmers, who produced wheat and butter for the local market. Timber getting was also an industry in the area.
Initially, local farmers kept a few cows for domestic purposes, and town dwellers paid a fee to have a house cow that could be grazed on the town common. The first commercial dairy farm was started near Nanango in 1865, but this was a small operation that had to cart its cream overland to Gympie. By the 1890s events were occurring that would lead to the rapid growth of commercial dairy farming around Nanango, such as the advent of mechanical cream separators in Australia in the 1880s; the Babcock butterfat test; government grading of butter; and the advent of refrigerated shipping from Brisbane in 1884. In the late 1880s and early 1890s the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock used a Travelling Dairy to demonstrate techniques and equipment to potential dairy farmers. The 1893 Meat and Dairy Produce Act, which established subsidies for dairy farmers, and the 1894 Agricultural Lands Purchase Act also aided commercial dairying. Between 1894 and 1919 a large amount of land was repurchased by the Queensland Government from pastoralists, was and offered as agricultural selections. Closer settlement legislation between 1906 and 1917 also played its part in creating small agricultural service towns, as did the spread of Queensland's railway network. In 1890 there were of rail-line in Queensland. By 1910 there was and by 1920, . Between 1910 and 1920, most of the lines built were branch lines for agriculture.
The Co-operative movement, where producers held shares in the enterprises that processed and sold their product, had been developed in Switzerland during the 1880s, and was transferred from Victoria to Queensland by dairy immigrants during the 1890s and the first decade of the twentieth century. In 1900 the South Burnett carried of crops, 7000 sheep, and 84,000 cattle. Dairying became a mainstay of the Nanango district between 1900 and 1914, the period of the industry's most rapid development.
In 1903, the year that the Shire of Nanango was formed, the railway line reached Wondai. In December of that year a thrice-weekly cream van run from Kunioon to the railhead was organised by Mr William Selby. Four farmers from Booie had begun carting their cream to Wondai earlier that year. From Wondai, the cream travelled by train to Gympie. In 1904 meetings were called at Nanango to consider a Co-operative butter factory, and in July 1904 the Nanango Co-operative Dairy Company was formed. The company was floated in February 1905, and in October a tender to build the factory was allocated to Waugh and Josephson. A single story timber factory was built in late 1905 for (a second story was later added in September 1907). Machinery and plant cost a further . The first Annual General Meeting of the Co-operative was held in February 1906, and 1565 shares were allotted to 152 shareholders, 115 of those being fully paid up.
Butter manufacture commenced in April 1906, and by November the factory was also supplying ice. By 1906 the railway was moving closer to Nanango, and the first consignment of three tonnes of butter was dispatched from the Kingaroy railhead (1904). Nanango butter soon developed a reputation for excellence; in June 1906 the factory's product won first prize at the Maryborough show. Catalysts for dairying occurring around this time included the 1904 and 1905 Dairy Produce Acts; a cream testing certificate for officers in butter factories, introduced in 1906; and the 1906 Closer settlement Act. By 1910 there were 100 suppliers for the Nanango factory, which produced of butter. In 1911 the railway reached Nanango from the north, and in 1913 it reached Yarraman from the south.
On 25 October 1918, a fire started by lightning destroyed the factory, which was re-opened on 15 December 1919. By 1920, there were 5,000 sheep in the South Burnett compared to 230,000 beef and dairy cattle, with 10,000 pigs and of crops. The Cactoblastis cactorum insect was introduced in 1923, and its defeat of the prickly pear enabled the Queensland dairy industry to rebuild and expand during the late 1920s, leading to the 1930s dairy boom. Also during the 1920s Butter and Cheese Boards were formed to equalise market prices, and the Nanango Co-operative Dairy Company became the Nanango Co-operative Dairy Association in 1924. By 1925 there were 320 suppliers to the factory.
On 13 October 1926 the factory burned once more, shortly after an equipment upgrade, and it was re-built in concrete at a cost of about . The Minister for Works, Michael J. Kirwan, officially opened the factory on 21 October 1927. In October 1929 a Mr W.G. Counsel of the Electric Supply Works, Warwick, recommended that the butter factory supply electricity to the town, using its engine to power a generator. Electricity was supplied from the factory to the Nanango Shire Council between March 1933 and March 1948.
By the 1930s, dairying was the most widely spread agricultural industry in Queensland, and it was the state's second most profitable export industry from 1936 to 1941. In 1938 there were five co-operative butter factories in the South Burnett: Nanango (since 1906), Kingaroy Butter Factory (1907), South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Factory (Murgon, 1911), Wondai (1931), and Proston (1935). In 1940 the factory at Nanango peaked at 483 suppliers. A cheese factory was established during World War II to feed the troops, but it only operated between January 1942 and November 1943. The building still stands to the north of the butter factory. In the 1947-48 financial year of butter was produced at the Nanango factory, and in 1948 the Nanango Dairy Co-operative Trading Society as created as a subsidiary of the Nanango Co-operative Dairy Association.
By 1950 the South Burnett was carrying 650 sheep, 130,000 dairy cows (ten percent of the Queensland total), 110,000 beef cattle, 70,000 pigs, and of crops. However, as demand and prices for butter dropped in the 1950s, the decline of dairying accelerated. In 1953 the Nanango butter factory started producing butter milk powder, and a brick annex was added to the northern end of the factory to house the roller-drying plant. Butter consumption per capita in Australia dropped from to between 1957 and 1972, and Britain joining the European Economic Community provided another blow to prices. Irregular seasonal conditions and a lack of profits led many dairy farmers to drop out of the industry, and by 1975 the factory had 66 suppliers left. 1977 witnessed the end of the butter and cheese price equalisation scheme, and in May of that year butter production ended at Nanango. The factory continued to act as a depot for bulk milk tanker collections, which had begun in 1972. When the Nanango Dairy Co-operative Association closed the factory in 1986 only 37 milk suppliers remained.
The railway line that used to run alongside the western side of the factory has disappeared, as has a large water cooler that stood to the northeast of the factory. A 1929 Ruston Hornsby Model 9XHC 132 horsepower diesel engine, with a seven-foot flywheel, and a 1935 Ruston Hornsby Model VER 220 horsepower diesel of , remained on site until June 2004. These engines would have been used to run the factory's machinery, as well as to generate electricity for Nanango. A gas fitting business currently occupies the northern extension of the main factory building, and a plumber uses the southern end. To the south of the factory the old office building, of late 1920s construction, is now a residence/home business.
Description
The main factory building is two stories high, rectangular, and runs parallel to George Street, on a north–south axis. It is constructed of concrete, with a brick extension to the north, and has fibrous cement sheeting and battens on the upper levels to the north and south. It has a gabled roof of galvanised iron with skylights, and a clerestory runs along the apex of the southern part of the roof. The western side of the building facing George Street has been stuccoed. There are four doors, a high-set roller door, and two hatches on the western side of the factory, five roller doors on the south side, and a roller door on the north side. There is a high-set loading bay with roller door on the southern end of the east side, and a concrete loading dock juts out between this and the engine room to the north. Windows are generally steel-framed with wire-covered panes, or consist of panelled glass louvres.
Internally the factory is divided into two main sections with concrete floors, and the smaller northern end currently contains an office facing George Street, with a larger open section behind. The southern end has a small office on a raised section facing George Street, and a large open area behind this, with a coldroom and storeroom on the George Street side, north of the office. A door on the east side of the southern section leads from the main space through to the engine room.
On the east side of the factory is an attached single-story engine room, with gabled roof of galvanised iron, constructed of rendered brick, with metal strapping set into the render. Steel loops are welded to the strapping at intervals. The engine room has a smaller northern section, with a roller door exiting the north side, and a double steel door exits the southern section to the east. The engine room has a concrete floor, and contains the concrete mounting pads of removed equipment, and one small engine. A hole has recently been cut into the floor of the engine room, near the largest concrete mounting.
South of the factory, across a large concrete pad, is the old office building of the Nanango Dairy Co-operative Association. It faces George Street, and is constructed of brick with a concrete and stucco frontage. To the east of the concrete pad are two open sheds of steel and timber construction, and an enclosed timber shed. To the east of the factory and engine room are a number of other structures. Running south to north these include: a small overgrown shed, related to the factory's cooling system; a rectangular semi-underground covered concrete tank; a brick toilet block; two underground concrete tanks next to the engine room; a small open-topped semi-underground concrete water tank; and an open two-storied twin-gabled loading bay, constructed of steel and timber and clad in galvanised iron. It has raised vents at each apex, clad in curved galvanised iron sheeting.
Heritage listing
Nanango Butter Factory Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 June 2005 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
The 1927 Nanango butter factory, built on a site that was used for butter production from 1906 to 1977, is evidence of the growth and decline of the dairy industry within the Nanango Shire, and within Queensland.
The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.
The decline in the Queensland dairy industry in the 1960s and 1970s, and the resulting closure of small town butter factories, means that ex-butter factories that are relatively intact are now becoming uncommon.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
The layout of the factory, with its large internal space, loading bays, cold room, engine room, exterior water tanks, office building and other secondary structures demonstrates the principle characteristics of an early twentieth century butter factory.

Aikanã (sometimes called Tubarão, Corumbiara/Kolumbiara, or Huari/Uari/Wari) is an endangered language isolate spoken by about 200 Aikanã people in Rondônia, Brazil. It is morphologically complex and has SOV word order. Aikanã uses the Latin script. The people live with speakers of Koaia (Kwaza).
Classification
Van der Voort (2005) observes similarities among Aikanã, Kanoê, and Kwaza, but believes the evidence is not strong enough to definitively link the three languages together as part of a single language family. Hence, Aikanã is best considered to be a language isolate. An automated computational analysis (ASJP 4) by Müller et al. (2013) also found lexical similarities between Aikanã and Kwaza. However, since the analysis was automatically generated, the grouping could be either due to mutual lexical borrowing or genetic inheritance.
Jolkesky (2016) also notes that there are lexical similarities with Kanoe, Kwaza, and Nambikwara due to contact.
Varieties
Varieties listed by Loukotka (1968):
Huari (Corumbiara) - spoken between the Corumbiara River and Guarajú River, Rondônia

Community Action Services and Food Bank (CASFB), located in Provo, Utah, is a non-profit organization that serves the low-income population of Utah, Summit, and Wasatch counties and focuses on the operation of programs that help alleviate poverty. It was founded in 1967 following the signing of the Economic Opportunity Act in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson and is one of more than 1,000 independent Community Action Agencies across the country. It is sponsored by United Way of Utah County.
The agency's purpose is to assist the disadvantaged in meeting critical basic needs such as food and housing while working with families on a long-term basis to help them increase their potential for financial and social self-sufficiency. It is dedicated to fostering self-reliance in individuals, families and communities. This is accomplished by providing a variety of programs and solutions designed to address local needs and issues. CASFB has been a pioneer in the development of publicly and privately sponsored programs designed to address the needs of the disadvantaged. The organization has a trained staff with many community contacts to help low-income persons evaluate their problems and lead them to resources that can help in solving those problems.
Programs
Food Bank
The Community Action Food Bank is the second largest food bank in Utah and is the only food bank serving Utah, Wasatch and Summit counties. It is often confused with the Utah Food Bank, which is a separate organization that primarily serves Salt Lake and Tooele counties but also assists food pantries in other counties in the state of Utah. Community Action Food Bank annually distributes more than 2.3 million pounds of food to thousands of families and many local service organizations. Community Action employees and volunteers work to alleviate hunger by providing eligible families with food boxes, counseling, budgeting and referrals. They collect and distribute donated food and hygiene items on a regular basis to more than thirty other agencies, including local pantries, community agencies, churches and senior centers. The Community Action Food Bank also operates five food pantries located in Utah communities Payson, American Fork, Heber, Kamas, and Coalville. An additional satellite office in Park City relies on Community Action for food and other donated items.
Family Development Program
The Family Development Program helps families become self-reliant by providing short-term assistance to resolve immediate crises, such as help paying for rent or bus tokens, followed by continued support to assist them in attaining financial stability and self-reliance. Support includes haircuts for job applicants, help with resumes and references.
The program works with families to increase their potential for social and financial self-sufficiency through goal setting, case management, self-empowerment/self-esteem training, and advocacy assistance.
Home Buyer and Mortgage Counseling Program
The Home Buyer and Mortgage Counseling Program helps families obtain long-term home ownership through education and counseling. It works toward strengthening communities by identifying resources, advocating ethical practices and assisting with dispute resolutions.
Community Action Services and Food Bank is approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as a housing counseling agency. The program provides the following services free of charge: pre-home ownership counseling, home buyer education classes, mortgage default counseling, reverse mortgage counseling, refinance counseling, and predatory lending counseling.
HEAT Program
Community Action Services and Food Bank administers the Utah State Home Energy Assistance Target (HEAT) Program for Utah, Wasatch and Summit counties. The HEAT Program provides approximately 4,200 eligible low-income households with a once-per-year utility payment to help ease the burden of electricity and heating costs while promoting energy conservation. An energy conservation class is required for first time applicants.
Community Services Program
Community Action Services and Food Bank helps improve the quality of life for elderly and disabled individuals by connecting them to programs and resources through home and community visits. Community service specialists are available to assist local senior citizens and disabled residents by assessing individual situations and determining eligibility for specific programs. Referrals are also given for other resources that may be beneficial to each individual. Help is provided in completing the forms to apply for the HEAT Program, the Circuit Breaker Program, a property tax abatement, veteran's abatement, blind abatement, mobile home abatement, or renter refund. Outreach workers are available in local senior citizen centers several times each month. In addition, home visits are arranged for those who are homebound.
Youth Program
Community Action Services and Food Bank directs the Utah Valley chapter of Trips for Kids, a national program that provides mountain bike experiences and training to local, underprivileged youth. The program helps youth from low-income families resist negative peer pressure and become contributing members of the community by providing mentor support and skills training. Trips for Kids Utah Valley currently holds three six-week sessions each year. Youth ages 12 to 17 who are accepted into a session attend weekly workshops and go on two to three rides in the nearby mountains. Scholarships for registration fees and equipment are available for those who qualify.
Community Garden
Starting in April of each year, Community Action Services and Food Bank leases small garden plots in its community garden in located behind the Boulders Apartments in Provo. The CASFB Community Garden allows families with limited yard space to grow their own fresh produce alongside their neighbors and other community members. Garden plots are measured in 4-foot by 20-foot rectangles with 4-foot walkways between plots. Watering is provided as a service of the garden, but gardeners are responsible for providing their own tools and seeds.
Advocacy and Building Community Solutions
Community Action Services and Food Bank works with other community organizations to develop solutions to the problems faced by low and moderate-income Utah residents. It also works to bring about change in local, state, and national policies.
Organization
The Community Action Services and Food Bank board of trustees provides direction and guidance to staff regarding community needs, future planning, and fiscal oversight. It is a tri-partite board consisting of 1/3 public, 1/3 private, and 1/3 low-income representatives, thereby giving low-income residents an opportunity to provide input to agency programs and operations. The agency's annual budget exceeds $1.5 million, and independent external audits are conducted for each fiscal year. Approximately 75 percent of the agency's funds come from grants such as the Community Services Block Grant. Remaining funds come from local sources including the United Way of Utah County and corporate and private donations.
Several local autonomous organizations in Utah had their start at Community Action Services and Food Bank, including Information and Referral, the Volunteer Center, Crisis Line, and others. The agency has also served as a catalyst to coordinate efforts and encourage other organizations to deliver needed services. CASFB is recognized locally for its leadership capabilities, expertise in regard to poverty issues, and ability to provide quality services.

1981-1991

New perspectives for the development of the institute came after proclamation of independence of Ukraine in 1991.

To address these challenging tasks it needed not only proper material resources, financing, but also nationally conscious professionals. This was possible under favorable political, economic and spiritual situation in the country. Certainly, the leadership of the Lviv State Institute of Physical Culture had to overcome the difficulties which experienced the young state.
With appointment to the post of rector, the famous sports specialist, master of sports, champion of Ukraine and the USSR Honored Coach of Ukraine Miroslav S. Hertsyka, in the development of the institute entered a new period.
To expand the areas and improve the quality of training in the sports department in 1996 was established the department of rehabilitation and recreation, and the Department of Economics of Sports, Recreation and Physical culture theory and methodology of Olympic and professional sports.
With Ukraine's accession to the Bologna Convention LDIFK purposefully moves to credit modular system, are introduced new forms and methods of training.

Jorge López Pérez, also known as El Chuta, is a Mexican suspected drug lord and high-ranking member of Los Zetas, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas, Mexico. López Pérez joined the Mexican Army in 1979. He specialized in martial arts, parachuting, explosives and guerrilla warfare tactics. In 1981, he deserted from the military and joined a cell of the Juárez Cartel, where he coordinated drug trafficking operations in Cancún. In the early 2000s, López Pérez left and worked as an independent trafficker before joining the Gulf Cartel. He became one of the first members of the cartel's newly formed paramilitary wing, Los Zetas. Like López Pérez, most of the first members of Los Zetas were ex-military. Wanted on drug trafficking charges, he is one of the last remaining fugitives from the early Zetas generation.
Early life and career
López Pérez joined the Mexican Army on 1 October 1979. He was enrolled as a paratrooper in the Parachute Rifle Brigade (Spanish: Brigada de Fusileros Paracaidistas) and was stationed at the Santa Lucía military base in the State of Mexico. During his tenure in the military, he became a specialist in martial arts, parachuting, explosives and guerrilla warfare tactics. He deserted from the military on 17 September 1981. López Pérez then joined the Juárez Cartel and was assigned to head drug trafficking operations in Cancún. He was part of a Quintana Roo-based cell headed by kingpin Alcides Ramón Magaña ("El Metro"). The local gang was known as the Cancún Cartel and/or the Southeast Cartel. When Ramón Magaña was arrested in June 2001, his colleague Jesús Albino Quintero Meraz ("El Beto") contacted López Pérez with a new job offer. Quintero Meraz suggested that he join the Gulf Cartel under kingpin Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. However, López Pérez moved to Veracruz and became successful as an independent drug trafficker instead. After Quintero Meraz was arrested in 2002, López Pérez moved to Yucatán to manage Colombian narcotics with several local smugglers. He fled to Tamaulipas in 2003 after the Mexican Army's efforts to apprehend him intensified.
Once in Tamaulipas, he was hired by Rogelio González Pizaña ("Z-2") and formally joined Los Zetas, the Gulf Cartel's newly formed paramilitary group that was originally composed of ex-commandos. López Pérez knew a number of members of Los Zetas from his days in the military. His alias "El Chuta" derived from the word "parachuting". López Pérez is often cited as one of the founding members of Los Zetas. When the group was formed in the late 1990s, it was originally responsible for proving security services to Cárdenas Guillén and carrying out executions on the cartel's behalf. However, it underwent organizational changes over the years and began to involve itself in other criminal activities, like drug trafficking alongside the Gulf Cartel. Due to his previous experience in the Juárez Cartel and his knowledge of drug operations in the area, López Pérez was assigned to coordinate drug trafficking activities for Los Zetas in Cancún. He was responsible for coordinating smuggling activities at the Cancún International Airport. According to security forces, López Pérez and other members of Los Zetas based in the Mexican states of Quintana Roo, Yucatán, Chiapas and Campeche receive protection from corrupt municipal authorities and former members of the Juárez Cartel.
In Los Zetas, he reported directly to Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano ("Z-3"), who co-headed the criminal group with Miguel Treviño Morales ("Z-40"). In 2002, López Pérez and his colleague Jesús Enrique Rejón Aguilar ("El Mamito") were responsible for training new Zetas' hires. In 2004, he was responsible for coordinating international drug trafficking shipments in the Riviera Maya, an area that extended from Cancún to Tulum. This region was a strategic reception area for Los Zetas because it allowed them to receive South American narcotics arriving by boat. The drugs were stored in Playa del Carmen and Cancún for further distribution. In 2009, he was cited as a regional leader of Los Zetas in the state of Coahuila, a region he reportedly shared with Galindo Mellado Cruz ("Z-9"). That year Mexican federal authorities listed him, along with Lazcano, Rejón Aguilar, Gustavo González Castro ("El Erótico") and Flavio Méndez Santiago, as one of the leading fugitives in Los Zetas.
In early 2012, López Pérez headed operations for Los Zetas in northeastern Mexico and was paid directly by Lazcano. Among his colleagues in this region were González Castro, José Alberto González Xalate ("El Paisa") and Salvador Alfonso Martínez Escobedo ("La Ardilla"). Intelligence reports state that López Pérez was especially loyal to Lazcano, just like Zetas lieutenants González Castro, González Xalate, Juan Carlos Morales González ("El Peluchin"), Iván Velázquez Caballero ("El Talibán"), Prisciliano Ibarra Yepis and Raúl Lucio Hernández Lechuga ("El Lucky"). Several of them were once part of the Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), the army's special forces.
Charges and status
On 18 June 2003, Mexico's Attorney General's Office (PGR) placed an unspecified bounty on 31 members of Los Zetas, including López Pérez. Authorities stated that López Pérez was "highly dangerous", given his military background and his suspected role in homicides, drug trafficking, kidnappings, and carjackings. This announcement was made after the Specialized Unit Against Organized Crime (UEDO) identified him as a high-ranking member of Los Zetas following the 14 March arrest of Cárdenas Guillén. Unlike other Zetas members who voluntarily requested their release from the military, López Pérez had deserted and joined organized crime, which is considered high treason in a military court; López Pérez was wanted by the PGR, the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA) and the Secretariat of Public Security (SSP) for his outstanding charges.
Few details of his criminal activities are known; unlike the rest of the early members of Los Zetas, who were arrested and/or killed over the years, López Pérez reportedly disappeared from public view. Mexican authorities believe that he is trying to live a low-profile existence to avoid detection since there is an outstanding arrest warrant for him. He is one of the last remaining fugitives from the early Zetas generation.

Rooster Teeth Games is an American video game developer, publisher and distributor based in Austin, Texas, serving as Rooster Teeth's video game division. It is focused on "bridging the gap between independent game developers and the worldwide community of gamers."
History
Rooster Teeth Games was officially launched January 25, 2017. The aim is to help indie-developers gain exposure through Rooster Teeth's large fan-base by developing games on all platforms for their community. The announcement was received positively, with The Mary Sue calling it, "a perfect fit" given the company's "upstart background" starting with Red vs. Blue.
RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is a traditional hack and slash single and multiplayer game that uses chain combos and is based on the popular anime RWBY. It was originally developed in 2014 by a fan, Jordan Scott, in celebration of Rooster Teeth's anniversary. At RTX 2014, Rooster Teeth announced that they had hired Scott, and officially picked up the game. Rooster Teeth CEO Matt Hullum stated, "RWBY is a natural choice for us to focus on for our first in-house produced video game. Fans can expect that we will bring the same level of originality in action, comedy and design to the video game that has made the RWBY animated series such a hit." RWBY: Grimm Eclipse was a bestseller when it was released on Steam in the summer of 2016 and is a top-10 seller on PS4 and Xbox One. They were awarded Best Video Game Studio/Developer 2014 by The Austin Chronicle for RWBY: Grimm Eclipse.
In early 2017, Rooster Teeth Games had become a game publisher for independent games in addition to its video game development. In June 2017, it was announced David Eddings had joined as its head of game publishing. On September 27, 2017, Rooster Teeth Games announced a Kickstarter campaign for its first official board game, also based on RWBY, titled RWBY: Combat Ready in collaboration with Arcane Wonders. The campaign successfully reached its goal within days.
Its next game, Vicious Circle, described as a "uncooperative shooter" was released in August 2019. The game transitioned to a free to play model in November 2019 and refunds were offered to those who had purchased the game for full price.

Matemwe is a village on the north-eastern coast of Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago, between Mwangaseni and Kigomani. Its economy is mostly based on seaweed farming and fishing. The village is the seat of an education project aimed at providing computer literacy to the population of the area, as well as the Dada (in swahili: "sister") cooperative that is intended to create job opportunities for Zanzibari women involving them in the processing and preparation of handmade cosmetics and food products such as jam, mustard and sweets that are sold in Stone Town.
There is a charity school in Matemwe, Tamani Foundation, which provides the local students with great education. The facilities include a nursery school, the only one in Matemwe, and an adult education, where English, Math and Computer skills are being taught.
The main purpose of coming to Matemwe is the beach, which is the longest beach in Zanzibar. The beach is affected by the tide, so check tide schedules before visiting the beach. If you are staying there, however, that is not a problem as the tide is high two times every 24 hours. The beach is very quiet and you will not be harassed by many papasis (beach boys).
Internationally, Matemwe is especially known for its relatively unspoiled white sand beaches with few and expensive touristic structures, which makes for an exclusive vacation destination. The village is fronted by a lagoon and coral reef, as well as the small atoll of Mnemba, which is a particularly appreciated place for snorkeling and scuba diving. Fish species that can be easily spotted in the area include giant trevallies, trumpetfishes, anthiases, groupers and snappers.

Richard William Price (16 April 1869 – 22 June 1937) was an Australian journalist, politician, and army officer. He was a Labor Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1909 to 1917, representing the seat of Albany.
Early life
Price was born in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales, to Jane (née Croatt) and Henry George Price. He emigrated to Australia in 1885, initially living in Brisbane and then finding work in outback Queensland. By 1889, Price was working as an organiser for the General Labourers Union of West Queensland. He moved to Forbes, New South Wales, a few years later, and filled a similar role for the Amalgamated Shearers' Union of Australasia. Price came to Western Australia in 1896, during the gold rush, and subsequently founded branches of the Australian Workers' Union at Leonora and Mount Morgans.
Journalism and politics
Price was working as a journalist by 1903, and the following year began working for the Kalgoorlie Sun. He moved to Perth in 1905, and began writing for Truth, a local newspaper. Price entered parliament at the 1909 Albany by-election, caused by the resignation of Edward Barnett. He had initially been preselected as the Labor candidate for the Division of Swan at the 1910 federal election, but withdrew in order to run at the by-election. Price was re-elected at the 1911 and 1914 state elections, but did not recontest his seat in 1917 due to being on active duty overseas.
Military career and later life
In July 1915, while still a member of parliament, Price enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. He was initially posted to the 28th Battalion, but later transferred to the 47th Battalion. Price was gassed at the Battle of Pozières in 1916, and invalided to England. He spent the rest of the war as a training officer and camp commandant, and was then involved in demobilisation, not being formally discharged until September 1920. Price began working as a journalist after leaving the military, initially working out of London for the Empire Parliamentary Association and later living in Aberavon, Wales. He returned to Western Australia in 1930, and died in Perth in 1937, aged 68.

Abbe Jean-Joseph-Léandre Bargès, (born in Auriol, Bouches-du-Rhône, February 27, 1810 - December 31, 1896) was a French orientalist.
In 1834 Barges was officially appointed as a priest and became an Arabic teacher at Marseille in 1837. From 1842 to 1885 Barges was professor of Arabic at the Theological Academy in Paris.
Barges focused on the study of the Qarawiyyin medieval scholars, publishing commentaries in Arabic from Yaft bin Ali, interpreted various psalms (1861) and later reviewed Nasyid al-Anasyid (1884). Barges also published a treatise of Judah ibn Kuraish, on the study of the emergence of Hebrew.

The Five Wounds is the debut novel by Kirstin Valdez Quade, published by W. W. Norton & Company on March 30, 2021. It is an expansion of Quade's short story of the same name, which was first published in The New Yorker and later collected in her debut short story collection, Night at the Fiestas (2015). The Five Holy Wounds suffered by Jesus Christ during the crucifixion is used as a metaphor in the novel.
Premise
Amadeo Padilla, a struggling alcoholic, lives with his pregnant daughter, Angel, and ailing mother, Yolanda, in Las Penas, New Mexico. He is selected to portray Jesus Christ in the town's annual play which reenacts the Passion of Jesus, and is organized by the Roman Catholic lay group Los Hermanos Penitentes.
Reception
In a starred review, Publishers Weekly wrote that the "well-developed characters convey palpable emotion" and concluded, "Quade's rendering of a singular community is pitch perfect."
In The New York Times, Alexandra Chang wrote, "Quade has created a world bristling with compassion and humanity. The characters and the challenges they face are wholly realized and moving; their journeys span a wide spectrum of emotion and it is impossible not to root for all three."
The novel was awarded the 2021 Center for Fiction First Novel Prize. It was also shortlisted for the 2022 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction. It was named one of the best books of the year by NPR and Publishers Weekly.

It Could Be You is an Australian daytime television series which aired from 1961 to 1966, with later revivals. The best known version was the first version, which was hosted by Tommy Hanlon Jr., assisted by Jack Little. Hanlon was among several Americans who had shows on 1960s Australian television, the others included Delo and Daly, Larry K. Nixon, and Don Lane.
Broadcast originally on Melbourne station GTV-9, it eventually becomes a Nine Network show.
While considered a game show, it was not a strict quiz format. The unusual format (often involving reunions with long-lost relatives) was popular with female viewers.
The running time of the episodes is not known (Australian prime-time series typically ran 23–25 minutes during the 1960s, but daytime series could sometimes run shorter)
The series was still popular when it ended, with Hanlon hosting a new show called The Tommy Hanlon Show.
It was revived in 1969 with Tim Evans as host, with an additional revival in the 1980s.
Episode status
During the 1960s game shows were often wiped, not just in Australia but also in several other countries. Despite this, several episodes of the series (both the original and the Evans-hosted revival) are held by the National Film and Sound Archive.

Lorenzo Mercadante or Lorenzo Mercadante de Bretaña was a Breton sculptor active in the second half of the 15th century. Between 1454 and 1467 he worked in the Cathedral of Seville, where he executed the sepulchre of Cardinal Juan de Cervantes (1458) and the decoration of the portals of Christ's Birth and Baptism (Nacimiento and Bautismo, 1464–67). By using fired clay and alabaster he achieved a great naturalness and softness in his figures. His style influenced Sevillian sculpture in the last part of the Late Gothic era, and represented the transition to the Renaissance. Other outstanding works of his, all in Spain, are a Saint Michael now in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona, another Saint Michael discovered in 1999 in Sanlúcar la Mayor, and a Virgin and Child, originally in Fregenal de la Sierra, now in the Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla.

Eileen Elizabeth Sheridan (1936–2018) was a British beauty pageant contestant who was also known for her association with the London underworld 'firm' headed by the Kray twins; notably attending the funeral of their elder brother, Charlie, in 2000. And also attended the funerals of Ron and Reg Kray.
Eileen was a character witness at Charlie Krays' drug trail, and provided the famous "Legend" wreath at Reg Krays funeral.
Miss Sheridan became friends with the Krays after becoming the first winner of the Miss United Kingdom title in 1958. Her future husband persuaded her to enter the new Miss UK competition in Blackpool. And she was placed in final six of 1958 Miss World Contest, held at the Lyceum.
Early career
Born in 1936 in Surrey, as Eileen Elizabeth Wheeler, the teenage Eileen was interested in athletics and horse riding. Upon leaving school, she was spotted working in a department store by a photographer who persuaded her to sign up with the Cherry Marshall model agency in Mayfair. Miss Sheridan married a former bookmaker two years after winning her Miss UK title, becoming Eileen Sheridan-Price, after completing the double by winning Miss Great Britain, in 1960 at Morecambe. Eileen enjoyed running and was a regular at many athletic events in the south east.
Life after the pageant
Sheridan spent ten years performing in old-time musicals as a male impersonator. She met her husband when she was 14 and was married to Ken Price until his death in 2005.
Eileen died on 31 August 2018 and is buried with her husband Ken in Molesey Cemetery, Surrey

The Swagap tribe belong to the indigenous tribes of Papua New Guinea. They are also known as the Insect Tribe. They speak Nggala language (also called Swagap or Sogap), which is one of the Sepik languages belonging to the Ndu branch.
Homelife
The tribe lives in a village that sits above the waters of the Sepik River, named Sawagap. The tribe live off fish and other animals that they hunt in the jungle, but their chief source of income comes from crocodile skin.
Religious beliefs
They worship the praying mantis.
Discovery and outside contact
They were unknown to the outside world until the 1950s.
More recently, they were the subject of a documentary by Donal MacIntyre in 2007, in which six members of the tribe, including their chief, Joseph, were flown to London as part of the special Return of the Tribe.

Weekend World is a British television political series, made by London Weekend Television (LWT) and broadcast from 1972 to 1988.
Created by John Birt, not long after he had joined LWT, the series was broadcast on the ITV network at midday on Sundays. Produced by Nick Elliott and David Elstein, it was originally modelled on CBS's 60 Minutes featuring several stories each week but gradually developed into a Sunday politics programme that featured a forensic interview with a major political figure. A news bulletin from ITN would also be broadcast as part of the program.
The original main presenter was Peter Jay from 1972, at the time an Economics Editor for The Times. The original reporter/presenter staff included Mary Holland, Anne Lapping, John Torode, and Julian Mounter, with researchers Yvonne Roberts, Monica Foot, Christopher Hitchens, Paul Flattery, Mike Englehard, Jane Hewland and Julian Norridge. The team were later joined by Peter Martin and David Cox.
Birt (now Lord Birt), later Director-General of the BBC, had the idea of combining directors who had no real current affairs background, but were known for their creative and innovative film/video skills, with strong reporters and presenters recruited from national newspapers. Weekend World was one of the first UK programmes to recognise the importance of the Watergate break-in, which ultimately led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon.
Peter Jay was followed as the series anchor by former Labour MP Brian Walden between 1977 and 1986, after Jay became Ambassador to the United States. Conservative MP Matthew Parris took over in 1986, resigning his seat, and presented the programme until the series ended in 1988.
The theme music used throughout the series run was the closing bars of "Nantucket Sleighride (To Owen Coffin)", originally written and recorded by the hard rock group Mountain.

Italians Do It Better is an independent record label based in Portland and West Hollywood. The label was started by Johnny Jewel and Mike Simonetti in July 20, 2006 to focus on Jewel's projects Glass Candy and Chromatics and later Desire, Symmetry and Mirage, in addition to other artists from prior releases. Genres from the label have been described as contributing to the synth-pop, post-punk and Italo-disco revivals. They have released three label compilations, 'After Dark' (2007), 'After Dark 2' (2013), and 'After Dark 3' (2020), all of which feature music from their roster.
Italians Do It Better is owned by Johnny Jewel, who produces, writes, and contributes to all of the acts on the label.
History
Beginnings
Italians Do It Better was founded on July 20, 2006 by Johnny Jewel and Mike Simonetti. Jewel's group Glass Candy initially released music through Simonetti's label Troubleman Unlimited Records, but they wanted to create a more electronic-focused label and began Italians Do It Better. The label was named after a phrase on a T-shirt worn by Madonna in her 1986 music video for "Papa Don't Preach".
In an interview with Vice's music website Noisey, Jewel commented on the label's origins:
One of the reasons why I started Italians Do It Better is because I didn't want someone telling me when a record was due, or when something needed to be written or recorded. Or when I needed to go on tour. I believe in doing things when it's ready. It's a dangerous game because the world is moving so fast. But ultimately the only reason we're having this conversation is because I love music. And that's the path that it's led me on in my life. I never set out to be a successful musician, but musical decisions have always guided my life. For that reason, I will stay true to what I really feel…
2007-present
Italians Do It Better began gaining significant international recognition in 2007 with three consecutive releases of the label compilation After Dark, Chromatics' Night Drive, and Glass Candy's B/E/A/T/B/O/X.
Other major releases on the label include the 2011 album Themes for an Imaginary Film from Symmetry (a collaboration between Johnny Jewel and Chromatics' Nat Walker), Chromatics' 2012 album Kill for Love, and After Dark 2 in 2013.
The songs "Tick of the Clock" by Chromatics and "Under Your Spell" by Desire were both used in the soundtrack to the 2011 film Drive.
Pitchfork stated "Whether you treat it as background music, incidental listening, or a two-hour magnum opus, Themes for an Imaginary Film is a well-rounded portrait of a key figure in the American electronic music landscape." BBC Music called Kill for Love “one of the finest records to surface” in 2012. When asked to comment on his own production sound for SPIN's 8-out-of-10 review of Kill for Love, Jewel describes it as that specific "point in the night, you've passed out or you're done making love or whatever. That mindset opens the CD up for room ambience and conversation, and we step into the background — we slip away."
A number of the label's releases have been awarded the coveted "Best New Music" tag from Pitchfork including After Dark, After Dark 2 and Chromatics' Kill for Love.
After Dark 2 was released on May 17, 2013. It featured new tracks from Chromatics, Glass Candy, and Desire.
Glass Candy is currently working on a new album entitled Body Work.
In December 2014, Chromatics announced that a new, 17-track-album entitled Dear Tommy will be available via the label "in time for Valentine's Day." As of 2022, the album has not been released.
Italians Do It Better released the original motion picture soundtrack to Ryan Gosling's directorial debut, Lost River, on March 30. The soundtrack features music from the score, as well as songs from the film by Glass Candy, Chromatics, and Desire, plus songs sung by Saoirse Ronan and Ben Mendelsohn, who star in the film. The soundtrack is released on CD, digitally, and as a limited 2xLP on purple vinyl.

A clock-face schedule or cyclic schedule is a timetable system under which public transport services run at consistent intervals, as opposed to a timetable that is purely driven by demand and has irregular headways. The name derives from the fact that departures take place at the same time or times during the day. For example, services with a half-hourly frequency might leave at 5:15, 5:45, 6:15, 6:45, 7:15, 7:45 etc.
The goal is to enhance the attractiveness and versatility of public transport. Clock-face schedules are easy for passengers to memorise because departure and arrival times occur at consistent intervals, repeating during the day. A regular repeating schedule over the whole day can also improve services during off-peak hours. Clock-face timetables can be attractive for transport operators because the repeating pattern can allow the more efficient use of personnel, infrastructure and vehicles, and also make resource-planning easier.
Repeating timetables were first developed at the end of the 19th century, for local public transport, such as trams, rapid transit, and trains in the vicinity of large cities like New York City. A clock-face schedule is used currently for railways in many countries such as the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany. It is also used for urban transport systems like the New York City Subway system and London Underground.
Line-based
Individual lines can have a regular schedule, even without connections to other lines. Nevertheless, it could be necessary to co-ordinate the schedules of different modes of transport if links are made between them, such as at the terminal stop of a tram network if a journey can be continued by bus, so that passengers do not have to wait long at transfer point until the next service arrives.
Clock-face timetables can be attractive even if services provide no connections to other public transport because they allow a continuous use of vehicles and personnel.
Line-bound regular timetables are especially useful for lines with high service frequencies. If vehicles with the same destination follow each other in short intervals, transfer times are short even if there are delays. However, if the service intervals are 20 minutes or longer, it is important for schedules on each line to be officially co-ordinated. One simple way of doing that is to shift the departure times of one of the lines to match the other.
Network-based
An integrated schedule is a clock-face schedule that covers not individual lines but all public transport services in a given area. A characteristic of integrated clock-face timetables is that there is more than one central hub. A hub-and-spoke approach is then applied to the whole transport network.
Having several services meet at hubs where all of them arrive and leave at the same time is the most effective way of connecting multiple routes and modes. The goal is to reduce transfer times to a few minutes, with a default time of no more than five minutes. In actual operation, the time span can be longer because of services running early or late, high passenger volume (such as rush hour), or the need to assist passengers with disabilities. Efficient operation is even more essential than normal with integrated clock-face timetabling. If the policy is to hold connecting services to ensure a connection with a late-running service, waiting times at interchange stops can become unattractive, and other services will run late as a consequence.
Examples of such networks are often night and city bus networks. The connections might be optimized only within the network but not for transfers to rail or intercity bus lines. Such concepts need purpose-built stations, which can handle high passenger volumes. The space constraints within cities can be a reason to use other concepts.
An integrated regular timetable with half-hourly or hourly headways requires routes on which a service takes 28 or 58 minutes to make it from one hub to another. A service that takes 40 minutes would be bad because passengers and vehicles have to wait uselessly for their connections (unless the timetables at the different hubs are offset from each other to compensate, which is only practical for networks with very few hubs), and it generates nearly the same cost as a route that takes 58 minutes because vehicles and personnel cannot be used during the remaining 20 minutes. Therefore, when an integrated timetable is introduced running times might be cut or extended to meet the ideal duration.
Emergence of integrated timetables
The first integrated regular timetables were developed for railways. After the successful introduction of a line-bound regular timetable on one line in Switzerland in 1968, the development continued in the Netherlands. In 1970 and 1971, the Dutch Railways introduced a regular timetable with multiple hubs. In Germany, the first large-scale use of regular timetables was the InterCity network of 1979, which provided hourly long-distance services between cities. In 1982, a nationwide integrated regular timetable was introduced in Switzerland, which covered all but a few railway and bus lines. The base frequency was once an hour. The system was improved every two years and resulted in the Rail 2000 project of Swiss Federal Railways.
Switzerland
Services on the Swiss railway network are integrated with one another and with other forms of public transport. Unlike its larger European neighbors, compact Switzerland has not developed a comprehensive high-speed rail network, with the running speed on its few stretches of relatively high-speed line being . Instead, the priority is not so much the speeding up of trains between cities but the reduction of connection times throughout the nodal system. Swiss Federal Railways have adapted their infrastructure in such a way that journey times on main lines between hubs are multiples of 30 minutes so that on the hour or half-hour, all trains stand in the main stations at the same time, thus minimising connection times. Indeed, the above-mentioned Mattstetten–Rothrist line reduces journey times from Bern to Zurich from 72 minutes to 56 minutes in keeping with the clock-face scheduling. The Swiss approach is sometimes called "as fast as necessary" with a schedule being written mandating specific travel times and infrastructure later upgraded in line with the proposed schedule. This was the main idea behind the Bahn 2000 project and has also been used for the passenger travel through the NRLA tunnels.
However, on some single tracked lines the timetables may be 30/30 or 60/60 minutes, with the actual timetables being asymmetrical (such as 20/40 minutes), because passing loops are not positioned ideally, or alternate connections at all ends have to be reached.
Germany
Since 1990, most of the states of Germany have introduced integrated timetables, running hourly or every two hours, for short-distance public transport such as Allgäu-Schwaben-Takt (commencing in 1993), Rheinland-Pfalz-Takt (1994) and NRW-Takt (1998). Transport associations have introduced regular timetables with base frequencies of 20 or 30 minutes, which are partially changed to 10 or 5 or even 15 or 7.5 minutes when locations are served by overlapping multiple lines. In some areas, local buses are also integrated, such as RegioTakt in Northrhine-Westphalia and in parts of Lower Saxony.
These developments have led to "integrated timetable islands", which all adhere to the Germany-wide symmetry minute (58½), which is used also in Switzerland and in other European countries. Major problems exist in regions where transport associations of different states interact (like in Osnabrück). In order to introduce a Germany-wide integrated regular timetable, the alliance "Deutschland-Takt" was founded in 2008. Its goal is to start a discussion about a better system for public transport in Germany and to highlight aspects needing improvement.
In 2015, the Federal Ministry of Transport had a feasibility study conducted for a Germany-wide integrated timetable The :de:Deutschlandtakt is a proposal for a Germany-wide integrated clockface schedule. Similar to the Swiss example, where a timetable was written and the infrastructure demands derived from that timetable, the Deutschlandtakt calls for several new and upgraded lines.

Scientific contributions
Professor Ferrari's scientific contributions are recognized in both the field of basic and translational medicine, as well as clinical research. Ferrari's extensive research contributions have led to significant changes in cardiology practice guidelines and resulted in the successful registration of related pharmaceutical products.
Translational medicine
Ferrari's contributions in basic and Medicina traslazionale encompass 4 distinct areas:
Illustrating the dangers pertaining to the neuroendocrine activation in untreated patients suffering from severe heart failure and providing an evidenced scientific basis for anti-neuroendocrine therapy using ACEi, beta blockers, and mineral corticoid antagonists. Studies conducted in India, at the PGI Institute, Chandigarh, Punjab in collaboration with Prof I. Anand, Prof P. Harris, P. Poole Wilson.
Understanding the mechanisms and clinical relevance of the hibernating myocardium, provided the suggestion of using echocardiography with dobutamine as a test for cardiac surgery in patients with severe reduction of ejection fraction. Studies conducted in collaboration with Prof S. Rahimtoola.
Elucidating the role of coronary arteries as well as endothelial apoptosis and regeneration clarified the superiority of ACEi vs angiotensin antagonists to protect the heart against progression of atherosclerosis.
Comprehending the functional roles of the life and death cycle, and that failing myocytes lead to the pathophysiological understanding of remodeling. Presented future investigative opportunities related to the Herceptin drug mechanism of action of, marking the start of the Cardio-oncology era.
Clinical Medicine
Ferrari's contributions in clinical medicine have led to changes in cardiology practice guidelines and facilitated the registration of pharmaceutical products in 5 distinct areas:
EUROPA (The EURopean trial On reduction of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease) trial has demonstrated the usefulness of perindopril in reducing the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. The use thereof has been endorsed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and by extension the therapeutic use of perindopril in the treatment of hypertension to ischaemic heart disease is both recognized and recommended in American and European guidelines alike.
BEAUTIFUL (morBidity-mortality EvAlUaTion of the If inhibitor ivabradine in patients with coronary disease and left-ventricULar dysfunction) trial demonstrates the effects of ivabradine in patients with ischaemic heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction. The outcomes of this trial facilitated the successful registration of ivabradine through EMA for treatment of ischaemic heart disease in patients intolerant to beta blocker therapy with a heart rate of >70 b/min.
SHIFT (Systolic Heart failure treatment with the IF inhibitor ivabradine Trial) showed the benefits of ivabradine in heart failure patients and allowed the registration at EMA and FDA of perindopril in heart failure patients with heart rate>70 b/min and its indication in the American and European guidelines.
SIGNIFY (Study assessInG the morbidity-mortality beNefits of the If inhibitor ivabradine in patients with coronarY artery disease) contributed to the understanding of ivabradine according to the left ventricular function. This has led in increased indication precision for treatment of ischaemic heart diseases.
ATPCI (efficAcy and safety of Trimetazidine in patients with angina pectoris having been treated by percutaneous coronary intervention) trial demonstrated that trimetazidine does not improve either the symptoms or outcomes of post-angioplasty patients with ischaemic heart disease. Trimetazidine indications observed in this pathology are currently under EMA directed revision.
Steering committees
Professor Ferrari has been on the steering committees of several multicenter trials as Chairman of the following trials: PREAMI, EUROPA, STRATEGY, MULTI-STRATEGY, 3T2R, BEAUTifUL, SHifT, SIGNifY, MODifY, START-IF, ATPCI.
And as the Executive Committee Member of the following trials: SENIORS, PACMAN, CLARifY, COMPOSE, RELAX-AHF 2.

Unfortunately, We're Not Robots is the first album by the hardcore band Curl Up and Die, released in 2002.
Critical reception
CMJ New Music Monthly called the album "loaded with sandpaper riffs, razorblade-gargling vocals and dementia-inducing rhythms." Exclaim! called it "a seamless perfection of abrasive metallic hardcore, the occasional droning otherworldly-influenced noisescape, electronic expulsion or melodic segue, bizarre guitar noise and unorthodox noisecore hostility mixed with simply terrifying vocals and intensely personal and poetic lyrics."

Larimichthys polyactis, called the redlip croaker, small yellow croaker, little yellow croaker or yellow corvina, is a species of croaker native to the western Pacific, generally in temperate waters such as the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea.
Evolution
Phylogenomic studies indicate this species emerged from the same common ancestor of L. crocea around 25.4 million years ago.
Diet
They are benthopelagic feeders that usually eat shrimp, zooplankton, or sometimes small fishes.
Habitat
They remain in shallow waters above 120 m, but avoid brackish conditions. They are typically found where the sea floor is sand or mud.
Morphology
Males can reach 42 cm while the common length is about 30 cm. Their body shape is almost rectangular. They have red lips, grey gold body, gold belly and light yellow fins. The inside of its mouth is white and the gill slit is black. In its head are two hard, pale, white bones that keep balance when they swim, which is also used as a material for medicine. They can make noise by moving their air bladder in order not to scatter.
Behavior
They have a habit of leaping above the sea. In winter, they move to warm water. The breeding season is from March to June. Usually they spawn 30,000 ~ 70,000 eggs.
Relation to humans
Once an abundant commercial fish off the coasts of China, Korea and Japan, its population collapsed in the 1970s due to overfishing. Global catch later rebounded, with 388,018 t landed in 2008. Salted and dried, they are a food product known as gulbi (굴비) in Korean. Yeonggwang gulbi is a prized delicacy, selling for over $100 a bunch.

Ross B. Levinsohn (born 1962/1963) is an American media executive who has worked in media and technology. He is the CEO of The Arena Group and Sports Illustrated, and has held senior roles at Yahoo, Fox Interactive and Tribune Publishing, including a brief tenure as publisher of the Los Angeles Times. He became the CEO of Sports Illustrated in October 2019, and CEO of The Arena Group in August 2020.
Early life
Levinsohn was raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, the son of Joyce (née Salton) and Jay Douglas Levinsohn. He graduated from American University with a bachelor's degree in broadcast communications.
Work
Early career
Levinsohn's career began with three advertising and marketing jobs at Saatchi and Saatchi, Lapin and Rose and sports marketing firm ProsServ from 1985 to 1989. He joined HBO in 1989, working in marketing and promotions for Time Warner Sports.
In early 1996 Levinsohn joined SportsLine USA in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. He produced a syndicated television show starring NFL coaches Marv Levy and Sam Wyche, and host Scott Kaplan, entitled "Football Playbook," and syndicated radio programming on Westwood One.
Levinsohn was hired by Alta Vista to help launch the portal division in 1999.
From 2001 to 2005, Levinsohn was senior vice president and general manager at Fox Sports Interactive Media, a division of News Corporation. In late 2004, he was named president of Fox Interactive Media and oversaw the acquisition of MySpace for $580 million.
Levinsohn resigned from News Corp. in November 2006 and was replaced by his cousin.
In 2007, he joined the venture capital firm Velocity Interactive Group, later rebranded as Fuse Capital.
Yahoo
In October 2010, Levinsohn was hired as executive vice president of the Americas for Yahoo. Under his purview, Yahoo acquired 5to1, a digital advertising network run by longtime business partner James Heckman.
During Levinsohn's tenure, Yahoo expanded its efforts in media, including streaming short films and animated content in partnership with Robert Redford and Tom Hanks.
Levinsohn led Yahoo for two months as interim CEO in 2012. After the board of directors passed him over for the permanent CEO position, hiring Google executive Marissa Mayer, Levinsohn left the company.
The next year, he became CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media, an offshoot of Guggenheim Partners, the investment firm that then was the controlling owner of the Hollywood Reporter and Billboard.
In 2014, Levinsohn became executive chairman of Scout Media, a sports digital media network. The firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2016, seeking approval to sell what remained of the business at auction. Levinsohn and Heckman were named as defendants in a shareholder lawsuit filed in 2017 in federal court.
Los Angeles Times
On 21 August 2017, Levinsohn was named the publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times by tronc, replacing Davan Maharaj.
The Los Angeles Times newsroom filed for a union election in December 2017, four months after Levinsohn was hired, and held a union election on 4 January 2018. The staff cited concerns with the company's "nascent plans to establish a network of non-staff contributors to produce stories outside the main newsroom."
Levinsohn was placed on unpaid leave in January 2018 after reports of two sexual harassment lawsuits, 'frat house' behavior and questionable decisions on the job from interviews with 26 former colleagues and associates. A law firm hired by Tronc to investigate the sexual harassment claims found no wrongdoing after a three-week investigation.
Levinsohn stepped down as publisher and CEO of The Times and shifted into a new role as the CEO of Tribune Interactive.
The Los Angeles Times was sold to billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong in June 2018. Levinsohn left Tribune Publishing in 2018 when his job was eliminated.
The Arena Group
In June 2019, Levinsohn was named chief executive of Sports Illustrated after his firm, then known as Maven Inc., entered into a $45-million licensing arrangement with the magazine's new owner, Authentic Brands Group. In October, Maven laid off 40 journalists, implemented an independent contractor model and removed longtime editor-in-chief Chris Stone.
In August 2020, Levinsohn took over for Heckman as Maven's chief executive. Levinsohn prioritized expanding premium content and settling many of the issues created by previous management including issues with previous owner Meredith and journalist Grant Wahl.
In September 2021, the company announced that it rebranded itself as The Arena Group, reflecting the company's shift in business strategy towards building "scalable media verticals." He is the chairman and CEO.
Personal life
In 2013, Levinsohn was married to Nicole Purcell, a CLIO executive. He lives in Brentwood, Los Angeles.

Cape Laurens () is a cape which marks the northwestern extremity of Laurens Peninsula and Heard Island. The name was probably applied by Captain Franklin F. Smith, of the American bark Laurens, who visited Heard Island in 1855–56 and who, with Captain Erasmus Darwin Rogers, initiated sealing operations and longtime American sealer occupation of Heard Island. The name appears on a chart by the British expedition under George Nares, which visited the island in HMS Challenger in 1874 and utilized the names then in use by the sealers.

Scott Cardle (born 28 September 1989) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 2012 to 2018. He held the British lightweight title from 2015 to 2016. As an amateur, he won a bronze medal in the welterweight division at the 2009 EU Championships. His elder brother, Joe, is a professional footballer.
Amateur career
Born in Blackpool, Lancashire, to Glasgow-born parents, Cardle had a successful amateur career fighting out of Kirkham ABC, As well as 7 national gold medals from the age of 14, Scott became an England and Team GB International, winning many international honours including Gold medal in multi nation tournament in Dublin, Ireland in three consecutive years (2007, 2008 & 2009), Gold at 'Golden Gong Cup' tournament in Macedonia (2008), a bronze medal at a multi nation tournament in Germany (2008) beating Jeff Horn, a bronze medal at the 2009 European Union Amateur Boxing Championships at welterweight, he then dropped down a weight to light-welterweight for the AIBA World Boxing Championships in Milan in 2009 After beating Olympic Bronze Medalist, Frenchman, Alexis Vastine, he then lost to another Olympic Bronze Medallist, Cuban, Roniel Iglesias Sotolongo missing the chance to secure a world championship medal.
Professional boxing career
Trained by Joe Gallagher in Bolton, Cardle made his professional debut in March 2012 with a points win over journeyman Sid Razak. He had seven more fights that year, winning them all. In April 2013, he beat Maxi Hughes unanimously to win the Central Area lightweight title. Wins over Gary Fox, Krzysztof Szot, and Paul Appleby preceded a challenge for the English title in September 2014 against defending champion Kirk Goodings, the fight also an eliminator for the British title. Cardle stopped Goodings in 35 seconds in the first round to take the title.
In May 2015 Cardle met Craig Evans at The O2 Arena for the vacant British title. The fight went the distance, with both fighters suffering cuts, Cardle took a unanimous decision to become British champion. He was due to make his first defence of the title in September 2015 against Gary Buckland but a quadriceps tear sustained in sparring ruled him out of the fight, and he went on to make his first defence in November at the Echo Arena, Liverpool, against Sean Dodd. Despite sustaining cuts above both eyes after a tough eleven rounds, Cardle stopped Dodd in the twelfth and final round to retain the title."Scott Cardle vows to improve" The stoppage was controversial, and Cardle agreed to a rematch with Dodd in 2016 which ended in a draw. Cardle then defended his Lonsdale belt in Glasgow against Mandatory challenger, Grimsbys Kevin Hooper. Cardle stopped Hooper in the 6th round to retain the belt and after defending the title three times, Cardle thought he had won the Lonsdale belt outright not knowing his draw against Dodd didn't count.
Scott Cardle then lost his British lightweight title to Yorkshireman Robbie Barrett on 15 April 2017. Barrett won by majority decision, the judges scorecards reading 114–114, 112–114 and 113–115. Not securing a rematch clause and with Barrett not interested in a rematch, Cardle eventually got another crack at the title, losing to Newcastles Lewis Ritson by stoppage in the third round.
in 2019, after losing to three time, three weight world champion, Ricky Burns in November 2018, Cardle decided to retire from the sport
Outside of boxing
A fan of Celtic F.C., Cardle got to play for the club in September 2015 in a charity match in honour of Jock Stein against Dunfermline Athletic F.C.

Esther Howland (1828–1904) was an artist and entrepreneur who was responsible for popularizing Valentine's Day greeting cards in America.
Early life
Esther Allen Howland, born in Worcester, Massachusetts, was the daughter of Southworth Allen Howland (1800–1882) and Esther Allen Howland (1801–1860). Her brothers were Charles, Edward, and William Howland. Her mother wrote the cookbook The New England Economical Housekeeper and Family Receipt Book, which was published in 1844 (and for the next ten years) by her father S. A. Howland. Her father operated S.A. Howland & Sons. the largest book and stationery store in Worcester, Massachusetts.
Howland graduated from Mount Holyoke College (then Mount Holyoke Women's Seminary) in 1847.
Career
Shortly after graduating from Mount Holyoke College at the age of 19, Howland received a valentine card from a business associate of her father's. The valentine was decorated with an elaborate fine lace border, ornate flowers cut-outs and a small pale green envelope in the center that contained a verse appropriate for Valentine's Day. At this time, elaborate Valentine greeting cards were imported from Europe and not affordable to many Americans.
Determined she could make a better card, Howland convinced her father to order supplies from New York City and England. She made a dozen samples that her salesman brother added to his inventory for his next sales trip for their father's business. Hoping for $200.00 worth of orders, Howland was elated when her brother returned with over $5,000 worth of business for her.
Howland built a thriving business in Worcester, Massachusetts using an assembly line of friends to copy designs and help construct the cards. In the Howland's Residence on Summer Street, a guest bedroom on the third floor was set up for Howland's newly founded business. [citation needed Howland was in charge of cutting the basic design for the individual valentine while the assembly group was responsible for carefully copying each card. Howland also hired women who had to work from home by preparing a box with all the materials required. A week later they would be picked up by a driver and turned to Howland for their inspection. Howland reported that her girls were paid "liberally" and that work was "light and pleasant." She would inspect every card that was produced by her assistants. Her early cards contained short four-line verses pasted inside of them much like earlier English valentines. This model would eventually become standard for the American valentine market. Although Valentine's Day cards had been available in America for more than half a century before Esther started her business, she was the first person to commercialize them in America.
In 1850, her first advertisement appeared in the Worcester Spy. Soon enough she found herself in the position of a businesswoman. She began to import materials from Germany. She also came up with the idea of using silk and embossing lithograph ornaments. In order to distinguish her valentines, Howland began stamping the letter "H" on the back of her cards in red ink along with the price and the letters ‘N.E.V.Co.', which stood for the name of her company New England Valentine Company. Cards that included ribbons, artistic illustrations, hidden doors, gilded lace and interior envelopes that could hold more secret messages, locks of hair or even engagement rings , sold up to one dollar to fifty dollars. Howland also created cards for Christmas, new year, and birthdays, as well as cards, booklets, and May baskets.
Howland suffered a knee injury in 1866 that forced her to be in a wheelchair. In 1870, Howland incorporated her business as the New England Valentine Company. She continued to work from her home until 1879 when she moved to a factory. During that same year, Howland published The New England Valentine Co.'s Valentine Verse Book that consisted of 31 pages. The book was intended for customers who found a beautiful card but didn't like the verse that was inside. With the book they could choose from a total of 131 verses all printed in red, green, blue, and gold ink and came in three different sizes. With their chosen verse, customer could then paste it over the original verse in their card. In 1870, Howland merged her business with one of her competitors, Edward Taft.
Howland's cards were shipped nation-wide and her business eventually grossed over $100,000 per year. Howland eventually sold the business to a competitor, George Whitney, in 1880 in order to take care of her sick father. In 1904, Howland fractured a femur and was bedridden for eight months. She died in her home at 9 Adams St in Quincy.
Howland's valentine cards became renowned throughout the United States and after her death, she was called "The Mother of the American Valentine." She is credited for the introduction of the "lift-up" valentine, which created layers of texture and color using lace, ribbon, and other materials. Howland introduced the layering of lace, use of thin paper, three-dimensional accordion effects, and a bouquet in which flowers would move to reveal a verse when pulled by a string.

This article details the canoeing at the 2020 Summer Olympics qualifying phase. Similar to 2012 and 2016 format, a qualification system has been set up for both slalom and sprint canoeing at these games. The quotas have already been set for each event by the International Canoe Federation in October 2018.
Qualification summary
Slalom
For the slalom events, the men and women competed for each in C-1 and K-1. Qualifications were allocated to NOCs, not to specific competitors. NOCs were limited to one boat per event. Qualification spots were earned as follows:
World Championships: The top placed boats (considering only one boat per NOC) earned their NOCs a qualification. 18 qualification spots were available in the K-1 events, and 11 in the C-1.
Continental Qualification Events: Only NOCs that did not earn qualification in a given event through the World Championships were eligible. For the K-1 and C-1 events, 1 qualification spot was available for each continent.
Host country: Japan, as the host country, is guaranteed one entry in each event if not already qualified.
Tripartite Commission: Canoeing (both slalom and sprint) has a total of 2 qualification spots that would be awarded through Tripartite Commission invitations.
Reallocation: Unused quota spots were reallocated.
Timeline
Qualification table
Italic: National federation has qualified a boat but the athlete that did this was already counted in another boat
* No continental qualifying race held as less than three nations are eligible.
** National federation is limited to two athlete quota places at a continental qualifying event.
Sprint
NOCs are limited to one boat per event, and in kayaking to six men and six women positions. In Canoeing, the maximum is three men and three women. Meaning a country can enter up to 18 athletes overall. Qualification enables an NOC to participate, not necessarily in the person of the paddler who gained the place. Quotas given are for boats. Qualification spots were earned as follows:
World Championships: The top placed boats (considering only one boat per NOC) earned their NOCs a qualification. 5 boat qualification spots were available in the K-1 events with an additional place reserved for the host country each in the men's 1000 m and women's 500 m, 6 in the K-2 events, 10 in the K-4 events, 6 in the C-1 events (1 of which was reserved for the host country in the 1000 metre event), and 8 in the C-2 event.
World Cup 2: The top placed boat (considering only one boat per NOC) in each individual event earned their NOCs a qualification.
Continental Qualification Events: Only NOCs that did not earn qualification in a given event through the World Championships were eligible. For the K-1 and C-1 events, 1 boat qualification spot was available for each continent (except that Europe received 2 spots). For the K-2 and C-2 events, Europe was guaranteed two boat qualification spots but only 6 total qualification spots were available for the remaining 4 continents; these were assigned to continents based on World Championship results: the best ranked non-qualifying NOCs from four different continents at the World Championships earned their continent one boat qualification place.
Host country: Japan, as the host country, was guaranteed entries in certain events as listed in the World Championship section.
Tripartite Commission: Canoeing (both slalom and sprint) had a total of 2 qualification spots that would be awarded through Tripartite Commission invitations.
Reallocation: Unused quota spots were reallocated. In practice, this was used where some of an NOC's competitors in a larger boat category also competed in a smaller category, freeing up the athlete quota spot that NOC had earned in the smaller category.
Timeline
Qualification table
The following boats and athletes qualified.
In the men's kayak category, Spain had qualifying boats in the K-4 500m, K-2 1000m, and K-1 200m; because each NOC could earn a maximum of 6 athlete spots, the K-1 200m athlete quota spot was reallocated to Sweden. Hungary qualified boats in the K-4, K-2, and K-1 1000m, requiring reallocation of the K-1 1000m place. Josef Dostál of the Czech Republic qualified in the K-1 1000m and was also a part of a qualifying K-2 1000m boat. The athlete quota spot from the K-1 was reallocated. The two spots went to the next best in K-1 1000m, but could not be allocated to France (Étienne Hubert was France's K-1 1000m athlete, but had already earned a spot in K-2) or to Spain (which already had 6 athlete quotas), so went to Belarus and Argentina as the first two possible recipients. Japan earned a team spot in the K-4, so its host spot in the K-1 1000m also head to be reallocated; it could not go to Australia (which had 6 places already), so 11th-placed Serbia qualified.
In the men's canoe category, Isaquias Queiroz of Brazil qualified in both the C-1 and C-2 events; his C-1 athlete quota spot was reallocated. This spot went to the next-best NOC in C-2, the Czech Republic, as it could fill the C-2 boat because one the two athletes (Martin Fuksa) had already earned an athlete quota spot in C-1 and only 1 spot was needed to fill the boat.
In the women's kayak category, numerous quota spots were reallocated, in a two-step process. The first step was that athletes who qualified in both K-1 events were assigned the 500m place and the 200m place was reallocated to the next boat in the 200m. Lisa Carrington of New Zealand and Emma Jørgensen fit that criterion; they were treated as qualifying in the 500m and their 200m spots reallocated to Hungary and Serbia. Because the Serbia spot would have gone to Milica Starović, who (like Carrington and Jørgensen) had qualified in the 500m, that spot was further reallocated to Portugal.
The second step in women's kayak was for athletes qualifying in multiple boat sizes. Volha Khudzenka of Belarus was part of the K-4, K-2, and K-1 500m boats that qualified, requiring reallocation of her K-2 and K-1 quota places. Maryna Litvinchuk was also in both the K-4 and K-2 boats for Belarus, so her K-2 quota place had to reallocate. Karolina Naja and Anna Puławska were in Poland's K-4 and K-2 boats; both of their quota places from the K-2 were reallocated. The same was true of Sarah Guyot and Manon Hostens of France and Mariya Povkh of Ukraine. Mariia Kichasova-Skoryk, also of Ukraine, qualified in both the K-4 boat and the K-1 200m; her K-1 spot was reallocated. Finally, Carrington was part of New Zealand's K-4 boat, so her K-1 500m spot was reallocated. These 10 spots were allocated to fill K-4 boats (ROC received 4 and Denmark netted 3, adding to Jørgensen's K-1 500m spot). The remaining 3 places were not enough to qualify Great Britain in the K-4, so the next step was allocating them to the K-2. The 3 remaining spots then went first to China in the K-2. This left 1 spot; Austria was next in the K-2 but neither athlete was qualified yet, so the spot would not fill the boat and therefore went to the K-1 500m. Sweden got the quota as next NOC in the K-1 500m.
In the women's canoe, Maria Mailliard of Chile qualified in both the C-2 and the C-1; her quota place was reallocated. The 1 reallocated spot was not enough to fill a C-2 boat (Japan did not have a qualifier in C-1), so went to the next C-1 competitor: Poland.

Tunku Naquiyuddin ibni Almarhum Tuanku Ja'afar is the eldest son of Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan, who was also a former Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) of Malaysia. He served as regent of Negeri Sembilan from 1994-1999 when his father was elected as the King of Malaysia.
Suave, charming and debonair, Tunku Naquiyuddin had been for years one of Malaysia's most well-known member of royalty, and was widely expected to succeed his father as the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan. However he was bypassed as Ruler in favour of his cousin, Tunku Muhriz, upon the death of his father.
Early life
The eldest son of Tuanku Ja'afar, of Negeri Sembilan, Tunku Naquiyuddin is a former diplomat and an active businessman with interests spanning a broad spectrum. Besides serving as Executive Chairman of Antah HealthCare Group, he sits on the Board of four public companies – Orix Leasing (M) Bhd., Kian Joo Can Factory Berhad, Sino Hua-An International Berhad, Ann Joo Resources Bhd and more recently, Noble Mineral Resources Limited, a gold exploration company listed in the Australian Securities Exchange. He was born on March 8, 1947, at the royal capital of Seri Menanti to the future Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negri Sembilan, Tuanku Ja'afar and the future Tuanku Ampuan of Negri Sembilan, Tunku Najiha binti Tunku Besar Burhanuddin.
Tunku Naquiyuddin studied at the Anderson School, Ipoh; Tuanku Besar School, Tampin; Junior King's School, Sturry, Kent; King's School, Canterbury; and read International Politics at the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth (later known as the University of Wales, Aberystwyth) and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours in Economics from the same college.
He served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was posted as the 2nd Secretary with the Malaysian Embassy in Paris. Tunku Naquiyuddin later headed Antah Holdings Berhad as its Chairman, a position held till 2007, which was vacated for a 5-year period during his tenure as the Regent of Negeri Sembilan from 1994 to 1999. He also holds important position in Carlsberg Malaysia.
Tunku Naquiyuddin was also a Council Member of the Business Council for Sustainable Development, a Geneva-based organization, Founder and Head of the Federation of Public Listed Companies, Council Member of the Canada-ASEAN Center and Committee Member of the Bursa Malaysia. He is also the Pro-Chancellor of the Univ.

(MAFRETA), WWF for Nature (Malaysia), Seremban Half Marathon, Singer World Squash Championships, Antah Holdings Bhd. 1999, and Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd. Dir. Malayawata Steel Bhd., etc. Hon. Member Royal Selangor Golf Club. Rcvd: DK, SPTJ, PJK, DKYR, SPNS, SPMS, PPT, SPMP of Perlis (2001), Grand Collar of the Order of Bernardo O'Higgins of Chile (2004).
A keen philanthropist, Tunku Naquiyuddin founded Yayasan Tunku Naquiyuddin, a charitable foundation that provides assistance to young students from poor families. He is also the founder and patron of the annual Seremban Half Marathon, whereby proceeds from the event are used to supplement financial needs of prospective junior athletes from the state.
He is a Pro-Chancellor of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM).
Family
Tunku Naquiyuddin is married to the Perlis-born Tunku Puan Muda Tunku Dato' Seri Nur ul-Hayati binti Tunku Dato' Bahadur. They have two sons and two daughters:
Tunku Mohamed Alauddin bin Tunku Naquiyuddin (born 9 February 1978).
Tunku Alia Nadira binti Tunku Naquiyuddin (born in 1980).
Tunku Nadia Sahiya binti Tunku Naquiyuddin (born in 1982).
Tunku Khair ul-Zaim bin Tunku Naquiyuddin (born in 1985).
Bypassed for the throne
On 29 December 2008, the Council of Undang proclaimed Tunku Muhriz as the 11th Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan succeeding Almarhum Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman who had died on 27 December 2008.
This decision was made following intense discussions among the four Undangs. At least two, if not all four of the Undangs strongly championed Tunku Muhriz's candidacy. They refused to budge when it was suggested that they consider Tunku Naquiyuddin, Tuanku Jaafar's eldest son, instead as the next Ruler of Negeri Sembilan. Naquiyuddin also had two younger brothers. Together with Tunku Muhriz, these four princes were the main heirs to the throne when Tuanku Jaafar died. However, Tuanku Jaafar had replaced his elder brother whose son, Tunku Muhriz, at the time was barely out of his teens. Tunku Muhriz was considered too young to replace his father and the throne was given to his uncle Tuanku Jaafar.
Due to a lifelong habit of keeping a low profile, Tuanku Muhriz was largely unknown outside royal circles in Negeri Sembilan compared to Tunku Naquiyuddin, who was very media friendly. However, Tuanku Muhriz established and maintained strong ties with the Undangs, the general nobility, the lesser royalty and people of Negeri Sembilan, and more so since moving back to the state a few years ago. He also has powerful backers within the political establishment in the state, with the then serving former Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohd Isa Abdul Samad among his supporters.
Known for his charitable activities, Tunku Naquiyuddin was also a keen sportsman and a top corporate figure popular with the public, making him an ideal candidate to be the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negri Sembilan. However, he was ultimately bypassed when the four Undangs, or territorial chiefs, of the state chose his cousin Tuanku Muhriz to ascend to the throne.

Joannes Baptista Forceville (1655–1739), sometimes called "father of the Flemish Rococo organ" was born in Saint-Omer, where he was apprenticed to his fellow townsman Francois van Isacker (Veurne, 1633 – Saint-Omer, 1682), he then worked as a travelling organ builder before settling in Antwerp, where he later entered the Guild of Saint Luke. In about 1705 he moved to Brussels where he was appointed organ master at the Court and was charged with the construction of a monumental organ in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula.
Jean-Baptiste Forceville formed renowned organ builders such as ,, and his own son Jean Thomas. After his death in 1739, they continued to follow in his footsteps. Jean-Baptiste Forceville is also considered the organ builder who best synthesizes the French and Flemish styles. He imbued the Brussels style with French influence. The Franco-Flemish style introduced into organ building in Belgium by Forceville persisted there until the end of the 19th century. The Nivelles organ builders such as and would also build with a sound ideal that is related to this Forceville school.
Johannes Thomas Forceville (1696–1750) was born in Antwerp, where his father had moved from Saint-Omer. He was the son of Jean-Baptiste Forceville and his first wife Magdalena Cannaert. He was trained by his father and, after working with him, by 1734 was working autonomously. In 1734 he restored the organ of the Church of Our Lady of Laeken in association with Egide Le Blas.
He delivered a new organ with eight registers in (, 1744). He died in 1750 while working on a larger commission in the in Grimbergen. This organ was finished by .

The Dead End Kids were a group of young actors from New York City who appeared in Sidney Kingsley's Broadway play Dead End in 1935. In 1937, producer Samuel Goldwyn brought all of them to Hollywood and turned the play into a film. They proved to be so popular that they continued to make movies under various monikers, including the Little Tough Guys, the East Side Kids, and the Bowery Boys, until 1958.
History (1934–1939)
In 1934, Sidney Kingsley wrote a play about a group of children growing up on the streets of New York City. Fourteen children were hired to play various roles in the play, including Billy Halop (Tommy), Bobby Jordan (Angel), Huntz Hall (Dippy), Charles Duncan (Spit), Bernard Punsly (Milty), Gabriel Dell (T.B.), and Leo and David Gorcey (Second Avenue Boys). Duncan left for a role in another play before opening night, and was replaced by Leo, his understudy. Leo had been a plumber's assistant and was originally recruited by his brother David to audition for the play.
The play opened at the Belasco Theatre on October 28, 1935, and ran for two years, totaling 684 performances. Samuel Goldwyn and director William Wyler saw the play and decided to turn it into a film. They paid $165,000 for the rights to the film and began auditioning actors in Los Angeles. Failing to find actors who could convey the emotions they saw in the play, Goldwyn and Wyler had six of the original Kids (Halop, Jordan, Hall, Punsly, Dell, and Leo Gorcey) brought from New York City to Hollywood for the film. The Kids were all signed to two-year contracts, allowing for possible future films, and began working on the 1937 United Artists' film, Dead End.
The actual name of the gang of boys in Dead End is written in chalk on the wall shown throughout the movie. It reads: "East 53rd Place Gang Members Only".
During production, the boys ran wild around the studio, destroying property, including a truck that they crashed into a sound stage. Goldwyn chose not to use them again and sold their contract to Warner Bros.
Warner Bros. had initially attempted to rename them the "Crime School Kids" through advertisements for their first two films produced there, starting with Crime School (1937), to disassociate them from their previous studio's film, and promote their own. In 1938, they made their only color appearance in a short film, Swingtime in the Movies, and were referred to as that name. This was all in vain, though, as the name never caught on, and they remained the Dead End Kids.
At Warner Bros., the Dead End Kids made six films, including Angels with Dirty Faces, with some of the top actors in Hollywood, including James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, John Garfield, Pat O'Brien, and Ronald Reagan. The last one was in 1939, when they were released from their contracts owing to more antics on the studio lot.
Filmography
Little Tough Guys (1938–1943)
In 1938 Universal Pictures made an imitation Dead End Kids drama, Little Tough Guy. Leo Gorcey and Bobby Jordan remained under contract to Warners, so Universal hired the remaining four Dead End Kids. The film proved successful enough for Universal to launch a "Little Tough Guys" series in 1939, but by this time the original gang members were not available, so Universal filled the roles with other Hollywood juveniles (including future series perennials David Gorcey and Billy Benedict). Eventually all of the original Dead End Kids except Leo Gorcey joined the Universal series, which became known as "The Dead End Kids and the Little Tough Guys." The final Universal film was Keep 'Em Slugging (1943) with Bobby Jordan in the leading role.
The East Side Kids (1940–1945)
Producer Sam Katzman, releasing through Monogram Pictures, began his own tough-kid series, beginning with the 1940 film East Side Kids. As was the case at Universal, none of the original Dead End Kids was available, so Katzman hired six juveniles to fill the roles. For the second film, Katzman engaged Bobby Jordan and Leo Gorcey, along with David Gorcey and Our Gang alumni "Sunshine" Sammy Morrison and Donald Haines. In 1941 Huntz Hall and Gabriel Dell joined the series, now known as "The East Side Kids", followed in 1943 by Billy Benedict.
A total of 22 East Side Kids films were made, ending with Come Out Fighting in 1945.
The Bowery Boys (1946–1958)
In 1946, Bobby Jordan, Huntz Hall, and Leo Gorcey, working with Jordan's agent Jan Grippo, revamped The East Side Kids, renaming them "The Bowery Boys". These films followed a more established formula, with each member playing the same character steadily. During the series's freshman year, the gang was Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan, Gabriel Dell, Billy Benedict, and David Gorcey. Jordan left the series in 1947, followed by Dell in 1950, Benedict in 1951, and Leo Gorcey in 1956. Only Huntz Hall and David Gorcey remained from the original gang, with Stanley Clements stepping into the role of Hall's sidekick. In all, 48 Bowery Boys films were made, ending with 1958's In the Money. During the series Hall and Dell did a nightclub act together. Gorcey and Hall reteamed on the film Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar then finally, in The Phynx.
Epilogue
The various teams that began life as "The Dead End Kids" made 89 films and three serials for four different studios during their 21-year-long film career. The team was awarded a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame that can be found at the corner of La Brea and Hollywood.
One notable aspect of the group's history is their transition from stark drama to comedy. When they began, in Dead End and their other early films, their characters were serious, gritty, genuinely menacing young hoodlums. But, by the height of their career, their movies were comedies, with the Kids depicted as low-class but basically harmless, likable teens – comic caricatures of their former selves.
The original play has had two revivals. A 1978 adaptation played at the Quigh Theatre in New York, N.Y. and another in 2005 at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. In 2022, a musical adaptation of the play was produced as a concept album available for digital download. The adaptation was written by Neil Fishman (music), Harvey Edelman (lyrics), and Peter C. Palame (book) and published by Sammy Smile Music LLC.
Members
Billy Halop served as the original leader of the "Dead End Kids". He later appeared on All in the Family in a recurring role.
Leo Gorcey was known for his diminutive stature, wiseguy attitude, and frequent malapropisms, which he delivered in a Brooklyn accent. While he played various characters in the "Dead End Kids", "East Side Kids", and "Bowery Boys" films, these roles tended to be similar street tough characters. For the "Bowery Boys" series, he was the leader of the group.
Huntz Hall became known for his goofy, bumbling character Horace DeBussy "Sach" Jones in the "Bowery Boys" films. Following Gorcey's departure, he became the focal point of the series. Later, Hall acted in war films and staged a successful nightclub act with fellow actor Gabriel Dell.
Bobby Jordan was the youngest member of the group. Over time, with the rising popularity of Gorcey and Hall, Jordan's role was reduced to little more than a background character.
Gabriel Dell was often cast in character roles apart from the gang members. Dell continued to act in both film and television roles for the rest of his life.
Bernard Punsley (also spelled Punsly) was known for his well-meaning, likable personality. He tended to play new kid on the block roles and act as the voice of reason among the gang. After serving in the military, Punsley later became a doctor and retired from show business altogether.

Yao Xiang (331-357), courtesy name Jingguo, posthumously honored Prince Wu of Wei, was an ethnic Qiang warlord during the Sixteen Kingdoms and Jin dynasty in Chinese history. He was the fifth son and heir of the Later Zhao general Yao Yizhong as well as the brother of Later Qin's first emperor, Yao Chang. After the destruction of Later Zhao and the death of Yizhong in 352, Yao Xiang went south to serve under the Jin dynasty. However, due to animosity between him and the Jin commander, Yin Hao, Yao Xiang proclaimed independence and roved the Central Plains to establish his base, fighting against Jin and Former Qin. Although Xiang suffered major losses from time to time, his charismatic personality allowed him to win and keep the support of the people wherever he went. In the end, however, Yao Xiang was killed in an ambush in 357 while fighting Qin forces at Sanyuan.
Service under Later Zhao
Early life and career
The year of Yao Xiang's birth is a matter of controversy. It is said that he was born in 331 as the fifth child of Yao Yizhong's 42 children. However, Yizhong's 24th son, Yao Chang, was born the same year as Yao Xiang, leading some to believe that either Xiang or Chang's recorded birth year was an error. His father Yao Yizhong was a trusted general of Later Zhao. Yao Xiang was eight chi five cun tall (6 ft 8 In) and even in his youth, he was very popular among the gentry and common people for his talents and hospitality. His first recorded military action was in 350 amidst the aftermath of Ran Min's usurpation of the Later Zhao government. He fought against Yizhong's colleague, the Di leader Pu Hong, over the strategic location of Guanyou (關右, west of present-day Tongguan county, Shaanxi) but was badly routed.
Wei-Jie War
Later that year, Yao Yizhong was appointed the Prime Minister of the Right. As he looked for an heir, many of his subordinates and followers pushed for Yao Xiang. Yizhong declined, as Xiang was not the eldest son. However, support for Yao Xiang continued to grew, so Yizhong eventually chose Xiang as his heir. Xiang was later appointed by the Zhao ruler, Shi Zhi, as Commissioner Bearing Credentials.
In 351, Shi Zhi was besieged by Ran Min. Yao Yizhong sent Yao Xiang to lift the siege, but not before telling his son to swear that he would capture Ran Min for massacring the Shi clan. Yao Xiang arrived in Yecheng with assistance from Shi Kun (石琨) and Former Yan's general Yue Wan. Yao Xiang defeated Ran Min's general Hu Mu (胡睦) at Zhanglu (長蘆, in present-day Cangzhou, Hebei). As the three forces approached, Ran Min went out to give Yao Xiang battle. Yao Xiang, Shi Kun and Yue Wan attacked Ran Min from three sides while Shi Zhi came out to attack from behind. Ran Min suffered a terrible defeat but managed to escape. Though Xiang was victorious, he did not fulfill his promise. Yizhong was angered and punished Yao Xiang with a hundred floggings.
Flight to the south
Shi Zhi died later that same year after his subordinate, Liu Xian (劉顯), assassinated him and defect to Ran Min. Yao Yizhong submitted to the Jin dynasty and received a number of titles. Yao Xiang himself received General Who Pacifies the North and a few other positions. In 352, Yao Yizhong died. Before his death, he advised his son to join Jin now that the Shi clan had been destroyed. Yao Xiang succeeded his father but kept his death a secret. He attacked the counties of Fagan (發乾; present-day Guan County, Shandong), Yangping (陽平; present-day Shen County, Shandong) and Yuancheng (元城; present-day Daming county, Hebei) before stopping at Que'ao Crossing (碻磝, in present-day Chiping District, Shandong) to hand out appointments. He then continued his way south, encountering Former Qin forces and suffering a defeat at Matian (麻田, east of present-day Luoyang, Henan) along the way. In the battle, Yao Xiang's horse was shot, so Yao Chang gave his horse to Xiang to allow him to escape. Fortunately for the two, reinforcements arrived in time to save them. Yao Xiang's group finally arrived in Jin at Xingyang, where only then he started mourning ritual for his father.
As general of Jin
Yin Hao's northern expedition
Yao Xiang sent five of his younger brothers to the Jiankang as hostages. The court accepted them and stationed Yao Xiang at Qiao (譙; present-day Bozhou, Anhui). The southlands were almost immediately charmed by Yao Xiang's personality and respected him greatly. Around this time, Yao Xiang visited the Jin official Xie Shang at Shouchun. Despite Xiang wearing a headscarf, Xie Shang easily recognised who he was, and the two quickly became close friends.
At the time of Yao Xiang's entry into the Jin dynasty, the Jin commander, Yin Hao, was carrying out his northern campaign. Yin Hao's target at the time was to capture the city of Xuchang from the warlord, Zhang Yu. In July 352, Yao Xiang and Xie Shang attacked the city. In response, Former Qin's Heavenly King, Fu Jiàn, sent Fu Xiong and Fu Jing (苻靚) to repel them and receive Zhang Yu. Xie Shang was defeated at Chengqiao (誠橋; near Xuchang) at the Ying River, causing him to retreat to Huainan. After hearing of Shang's defeat, Yao Xiang abandoned his baggages to escort Xie to safety at Que Slope (芍陂; south of present-day Shou County, Anhui), where Shang left matters to Xiang. The defeat forced Yin Hao's return to Shouchun and led to Xie Shang's demotion.
Escaping assassination
In 353, Yao Xiang believed that Former Qin and Former Yan had both grown strong, and to attack them would only result in defeat. Instead, he decided to set up military agricultural farms along the Huai River to train troops and strengthen Jin's frontier for the future. Yin Hao grew wary of Yao Xiang's growing power and wanted to kill him. Yin Hao had Xiang's younger brothers imprisoned before sending assassins against Yao Xiang. However, the assassins all thought highly of Xiang and instead revealed the plot to him. Soon, Yin Hao sent a general named Wei Jing (魏憬) to attack Yao Xiang by surprise instead, but Wei was defeated and killed by Xiang.
With both of his assassination plots having failed, Yin Hao decided to instead move Yao Xiang somewhere far from him. He had his general, Liu Qi (劉啟) stationed at Qiao and ordered Xiang to move from Qiao to Litai (蠡台, in present-day Shangqiu, Henan). Meanwhile, Yao Xiang became increasingly worried as he noticed that Wei Jing's sons and brothers were constantly visiting Yin Hao's base in Shouchun. Yao Xiang sent his advisor Quan Yi to discuss the issue with Yin Hao. The two men's meeting only confirmed their side's suspicion for one another and sowed further distrust.
Ambushing Yin Hao
Yin Hao marched north again in winter of 353, with Yao Xiang served as his vanguard. However, Yao Xiang now had the intention to break away from Jin. When Yin Hao's army were close by, Xiang pretended to flee north during the night while setting up ambushes for pursuing Jin forces. When Yin Hao heard about Yao Xiang's betrayal, he chased after Xiang all the way to Shansang (山桑; in present-day Mengcheng County, Anhui). Xiang's ambushes devastated Yin Hao's army as they killed and captured thousands of their forces. Yin Hao was forced to abandon his supplies and weapon before retreating to Qiao, allowing Xiang to claim them for himself. Xiang then left his brother Yao Yi (姚益) to guard Shansang while he returned south to Huainan.
As an independent warlord
Campaigns against Jin
Yin Hao sent Liu Qi and Wang Binzhi (王彬之) to attack Shansang, but Yao Xiang turned back from Huainan to attack them. After killing Liu and Wang, Yao Xiang marched to Que Slope and captured it. Soon, Yao Xiang crossed the Huai River and camped at Xuyi, where he gathered thousands of refugees and officials under his wing. He instructed his followers to farm and start silkworm cultivation while he sent envoys to Jiankang denouncing Yin Hao and apologising for actions. In response, the Jin court positioned Xie Shang at Liyang, in hopes that his friendship with Xiang would be enough to win him back.
The following year, Yao Xiang submitted to Former Yan and was appointed Inspector of Yuzhou and Duke of Danyang by Murong Jun. Later, a refugee leader named Guo Chang (郭敞) rebelled against Jin and captured Tangyi Commandery (堂邑, north of modern day Luhe District, Nanjing) along with its Interior Minister, Liu Shi (劉仕). Guo surrendered the commandery to Yao Xiang, which caused the Jin court to panic as this left Jiankang exposed to Xiang. The capital's defenses were tightened, and Xie Shang was moved from Liyang to the capital region to defend the Yangtze.
In 355, Yao Xiang declared himself Grand Chanyu and Grand General. Many of Xiang's followers were northerners, and because of this, they urged him to march north so that they could return home. Yao Xiang agreed, and along the way, he fought with the Jin general Gao Ji (高季) at Waihuang (外黃, east of modern day Qi County, Henan). He was defeated at first, but managed to regather his scattered troops and continued the assault. Gao eventually died of natural causes, allowing Xiang to overcome his leaderless army. Xiang then advanced to Xuchang and occupied the city.
Siege of Luoyang and Battle of Yi River
The next year in 356, Huan Wen was appointed by Jin as Grand Commander of the Expeditionary Force to campaign against Yao Xiang. At the same time, Yao Xiang led his army to capture Luoyang from the warlord Zhou Cheng (周成). He planned to establish the Hedong region (河東; around present-day Shanxi) as his base before pressing on to conquer Guandong. However, he was unable to capture Luoyang even after a month of siege. His Chief Clerk Wang Liang (王亮) advised him to retreat, but he refused, refuting his argument by claiming that Luoyang would make a valuable stronghold. Not long after, Wang Liang died, and Yao Xiang became remorseful of his death.
Soon enough, Huan Wen arrived at the Yi River, and Yao Xiang was forced to break off his siege in order to face him. Yao Xiang sent Huan Wen a letter that read, "I see you have brought the royal troops. I am now obliged to return to the rightful authority. If you pleased order your army to draw back somewhat, we will gladly bow and pay our obeisance at the side of the road." Huan Wen, however, rejected him, replying, "I have come to recover the Central Plains and pay respect to the imperial tombs, so for that, I have no business with you. Those who wish to present themselves will do so in person, not send another in his place." The two fought at the river, and in the end, Huan Wen emerged victorious. Yao Xiang lost several thousands of his men, so he retreated with his army to the north of Luoyang.
Despite this, Xiang's defeat did not encourage many to surrender to Huan Wen. Yao Xiang was reputed to be brave and kind to the people, and wherever he was present, families would often rush to join him. While Yao Xiang fled, more than 5,000 men in Luoyang abandoned their families to join him during the night, and when rumours of Yao Xiang's death circulated, the men and women of Xuchang and Luoyang mourned him. Huan Wen gave chase but was unable to capture Yao Xiang. However, one of Yao Xiang's officer, Yang Liang (楊亮), turned back and surrendered to Huan. Huan Wen asked him what kind of man Yao Xiang was, to which he said, "Yao Xiang has divine wisdom and a broad mind, just like Sun Ce, but in valor and martial prowess he surpasses even the latter".
Campaign against Former Qin
Yao Xiang reached Pingyang, where he received the surrender of the Inspector of Bingzhou, Yin Chi (尹赤), who also happened to be one of his former subordinate. He then captured Xiangling (襄陵: in present-day Sui County, Henan) but was repelled by Former Qin's general Zhang Ping. Yao Xiang negotiated peace with Zhang Ping by swearing an oath of brotherhood, and the two forces withdrew from each other.
Death and posthumous honours
In the summer of 357, Yao Xiang intended to conquer the Guanzhong region from Former Qin. Yao Xiang camped at Xingcheng (杏城, in present-day Yan'an, Shaanxi), where he sent Yao Lan (姚蘭) to attack Fucheng as well as Yao Yisheng (姚益生) and Wang Qinlu (王欽盧) to get the surrender of the Qiang people. However, they were defeated by Fu Fei (苻飛), and Yao Lan was taken prisoner. Former Qin's emperor, Fu Sheng sent his generals Deng Qiang and Fu Huangmei (苻黃眉) to defeat Yao Xiang. Xiang initially refused to come out of Xingcheng and stuck to his defenses, but he soon became tempted to march out. A Buddhist monk named Zhitong (智通) warned him against this, but Xiang said, "Two roosters cannot perch on the same branch. I must believe that Heaven will not abandon the virtuous, and that it will save the people. My plan is decided."
Meanwhile, Deng Qiang knew that Xiang was flustered by his recent defeats with Huan Wen and Zhang Ping. Deng proposed a plan to Fu Huangmei in which Deng would lead his troops straight into Xingcheng, making loud noises with their drums and wildly waving their flags to lure Yao Xiang out. Deng did so and Xiang was immediately provoked. Xiang quickly brought his army out to fight, and Deng feigned retreat. Xiang pursued him until they reached Sanyuan, where they were met with Qin forces under Fu Huangmei and Fu Jiān. Yao Xiang was heavily defeated, and he attempted to flee on his horse, Limeigua (黧眉騧). However, his horse fell, and this time he was killed.
Yao Chang took over Yao Xiang's army and surrendered to Former Qin. Yao Xiang was given a ducal funeral by Fu Sheng, while his father Yao Yizhong, whose coffin he carried around, was given one for a prince. Yao Chang would become an important general in Former Qin but following Qin's disastrous defeat at the Battle of Feishui and his fall out with Fu Jiān, he would establish his state of Later Qin in 384, posthumously naming his brother 'Prince Wu of Wei'.
Cao Cao's Mausoleum
In 2008, the mausoleum of Cao Cao, a famous warlord during the fall of the Han dynasty, had been discovered. However, some historians cast their doubts that the mausoleum is that of Cao Cao's. One in particularly is Hu Juezhao (胡觉照), a history professor at the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee School, who claimed in an interview in 2010 that the mausoleum actually belongs to Yao Xiang.

The Queensland Country Rugby Union, or QCRU, is the governing body for the sport of rugby union within most of the state of Queensland in Australia. It is affiliated with the Queensland Rugby Union.
The Queensland Country Rugby Union administers the game in regions of Queensland outside of metropolitan Brisbane. The union is split into eleven country sub-unions. Queensland Country is represented by the Queensland Country Heelers team.
The Queensland Country Rugby Union has eleven country sub-unions, each running their own club competitions during the year. The sub-unions are grouped into three regional divisions in Northern, Central, and Southern Queensland:
North Queensland
Far North Queensland Rugby Union
Townsville and Districts Rugby Union
Mount Isa
Mackay
Central Queensland
Rockhampton
Central Highlands
Western Queensland
Wide Bay – selected from Bundaberg and District Rugby Union, plus teams from Fraser Coast, Gympie, and South Burnett.
South Queensland
Sunshine Coast Rugby Union
Darling Downs Rugby Union
Gold Coast District Rugby Union
Sub-union teams compete in Regional Championships against other teams in their regional division. Representative sides from the three regions are then selected to play at the Queensland Country Championships.
Following the Country Championships, a representative Queensland Country Heelers team is selected by the Queensland Country Rugby Union to play regular fixtures including City-Country matches against Brisbane selections, and the "Battle of the Borders" Cup against the New South Wales Country Cockatoos.

Erigeron sanctarum is an uncommon species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae known by the common names saints fleabane and saints daisy. It is endemic to California, where it is known from San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties including two of the Channel Islands (Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, both in Santa Barbara County).
Erigeron sanctarum grows in coastal and inland chaparral and oak woodland, and sandy coastal scrub habitat. It is a perennial herb producing an upright stem up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) long surrounded at the base by spoon-shaped or oblong leaves a few centimeters long. There are smaller, narrower leaves along the lower part of the stem. The inflorescence is 1-3 flower heads lined on the lower outside with hairy phyllaries. The head has 45–90 blue or purple ray florets surrounding many yellow disc florets. The fruit is an achene with a pappus of bristles.

Tyseley Locomotive Works, formerly the Birmingham Railway Museum, is the engineering arm of steam railtour promoter Vintage Trains based in Birmingham, England. It occupies part of the former Great Western Railway's Tyseley depot, built in 1908 to accommodate expanding operations in the West Midlands, particularly the opening of the North Warwickshire Line as a new main line from Birmingham to Bristol.
As well as supporting the trust's operating wing Vintage Trains, it is home to an extensive collection of steam engines, from small industrial builds to Great Western Railway 'Castles' and 'Halls', and large ex-mainline diesel engines.
Background
Following the purchase of GWR Castle Class No.7029 Clun Castle in January 1966 by Patrick Whitehouse, the locomotive needed a base close to its central West Midlands supporters' base. Whitehouse found space available at Tyseley, on the site of the former GWR depot, and formed 7029 Clun Castle Ltd to own both the locomotive and the rights to stable it at the depot.
In October 1968, 7029 Clun Castle Ltd purchased LMS Jubilee Class No.5593 "Kolhapur". With further locomotives and railway artefacts available as a result of the Beeching Axe, the supporters established the Standard Gauge Steam Trust as a registered educational charity, to preserve and demonstrate the steam locomotives. Following negotiations the trust acquired a long-term lease on a large part of the Tyseley site, and established the Tyseley Collection which still owns the locomotives and artefacts via the limited company; the depot site became the "Birmingham Railway Museum".
The trust cleared buildings and repaired the dilapidated tracks, and two water columns were repaired to allow steam locomotives to stay at the site. In 1968 the old coaling stage was converted into a two-road shed with an inspection pit to hold both acquired locomotives. In November 1966 Clun Castle was stripped and restored.
In 1999 the trust achieved its long-held objective of running a regular steam train service on the national main line railway network: the Shakespeare Express between Birmingham Snow Hill and Stratford-upon-Avon. At this point the trust felt that the term museum was inappropriate for its new status, and hence separated its assets and operations into two new organisations, Tyseley Locomotive Works and the operating arm Vintage Trains, with the third arm remaining the Tyseley Collection.
Present operations
There is an emphasis on running a professional locomotive overhaul and maintenance site, with significant numbers of other preserved railways and other private operators contracting work to Tyseley. To this extent the site was for a time used as a base of operations for Fragonset Railways.
Location and access
Located close to Tyseley railway station, the No.4 or 4A bus routes operated by National Express West Midlands passes the site. Located on the A41 Warwick Road, the site is approximately 3 miles from Birmingham city centre, or 4 miles from Solihull.
The site is no longer open to the public, except on open days.
Shakespeare Express
As part of its educational programme the trust's operational arm Vintage Trains runs the Shakespeare Express between Birmingham Snow Hill and Stratford-upon-Avon. Aimed at recreating the feeling of the 1950s holiday trains, it has strong appeal to families. It is increasingly being used by coach and tour operators as a new feature within their programme.
In October 2004 the trust announced the acquisition of a site adjacent to Stratford-upon-Avon railway station for future use as the Stratford Railway Tourist Centre and Steam Locomotive Centre. This will provide a steam loco servicing centre at the southern end of the Shakespeare Line. A small museum is also being considered.

Milkweed Editions is an independent nonprofit literary publisher that originated from the Milkweed Chronicle literary and arts journal established in Minneapolis in 1979. The journal ceased and the business transitioned to publishing. It releases eighteen to twenty new books each year in the genres of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. Milkweed Editions annually awards three prizes for poetry: the Lindquist & Vennum Prize for Poetry, the Jake Adam York Prize (in collaboration with Copper Nickel), and they are a partner publisher for the National Poetry Series. In 2016, Milkweed Editions opened an independent bookstore.
History
Milkweed Chronicle was co-founded in 1979 as a literature and art journal by Emilie Buchwald and R.W. Scholes in Minneapolis. Milkweed Chronicles first issue was published in 1980. Buchwald served as editor and Scholes as art director. The journal ran for 21 issues until 1987. It featured local and national writers and artists.
In the mid-1980s, the publication ceased and the business transitioned to publishing. Milkweed Editions published its first book and ceased publication of the journal. Since this first publication, the press has published more than three hundred and fifty titles.
In 1999, Milkweed combined forces with Minnesota Center for Book Arts and the Loft Literary Center to purchase an old warehouse in downtown Minneapolis to house each organization. They named the warehouse, the Open Book.
In 2007, Daniel Slager was named Publisher & CEO of Milkweed Editions. Since his arrival, Slager has focused the press on the publication of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, and has focused on publishing more work in translation. In 2016, the press opened a bookstore, Milkweed Books.
Milkweed Prizes
The Lindquist & Vennum Prize for Poetry''' was established in 2011 by Milkweed Editions and the Lindquist & Vennum Foundation. Submissions for this regional prize are accepted only from poets residing in the states of the Upper Midwest. The winner receives a $10,000 cash prize and a publishing contract. Previous winners have included Patricia Kirkpatrick, Rebecca Dunham, Michael Bazzett, Jennifer Willoughby, and Chris Santiago.
In 2017, Milkweed Editions announced the Max Ritvo Poetry Prize, a US$10,000 award supported by the Alan B. Slifka Foundation. Grady Chambers is the Inaugural winner award of this prize, announced December 2017.
Awards and media recognition
Milkweed Editions was the 2021 winner of the AWP Small Press Publisher Award given by the Association of Writers & Writing Programs which "acknowledges the hard work, creativity, and innovation of these presses and journals, and honors their contributions to the literary landscape through their publication of consistently excellent work." The press has been further recognized by media attention in interviews and features, including Literary Hub and Publishers Weekly. Their 2013 title, Robin Wall Kimmerer's Braiding Sweetgrass,'' landed on The New York Times Bestseller List.

In house lending is a type of seller financing in which a company or broker will help a customer obtain a loan at their place of business to purchase any product or services. When using in-house lending one does not have to rely on 3rd party company or business to complete the transaction.
In the real estate industry most home builders will use an in-house lender and often offer buyer incentives by processing the loan through their own mortgage company. In-house mortgage companies are sometimes scrutinized by other mortgage companies because outside or 3rd party mortgage companies cannot compete with their internal market rates or discount lending incentives that the builder offers.
Consumers can typically apply for in-house loans by visiting the business which is typically a brick and mortar. One can ask for special financing with the sales representative and they will usually direct him to see their lending specialist. There are some in-house lenders that are able to originate the transaction on-line for on-line buy here pay dealerships and websites. At times it can be a challenge to discover who is actually using in-house lending or if they are using a bank, credit union on the back end to finance the transaction.
In the new car auto industry you will often find a finance manager or lending team that is willing to help find a funding bank to extend credit. For some used car dealerships they will often resort to funding the transaction by using their own business capital and payment coupon booklet to help a buyer who may not qualify through a traditional bank or finance company.
Caribbean Context - Trinidad and Tobago
In the English speaking Caribbean there are variations on this. In Trinidad and Tobago for instance there may be advertisements for in-house lending but what it amounts to is a sales agency for an established lender such as a commercial bank or credit union. Because of strict debt service requirements the ability of most to qualify for mortgage or vehicle loans are restricted.
This has given rise to buyers of property asking for rent to own type arrangements. This approach does not afford the buyer with all the legal benefits and protections of a mortgage. As a result, it is recommended that property buyers seek a seller that will issue a mortgage whilst still offering financing without the need for a financial intermediary.

John Kelsay (October 23, 1819 – January 19, 1899) was an American politician and judge in Oregon. He was the 18th Associate Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, and fought in the Rogue River Wars. A Kentucky native, he was a member of the 1857 Oregon Constitutional Convention and served in the Missouri General Assembly.
Early life
Kelsay was born to Alexander Kelsay and his wife Jane Kelley in the state of Kentucky in Wayne County on October 23, 1819. At the age of ten the family and John relocated to Missouri. There his mother educated John and then later he would begin the study of law in 1842. In July 1845 he passed the bar and was allowed to practice law. In 1846 he married for the first time to Matha C. Monroe.
Oregon
In 1853, John Kelsay and his wife moved to Oregon Territory over the Oregon Trail. There the family settled in Corvallis, Oregon where Kelsay set up a law practice. Shortly after arriving, he organized one regiment of troops to serve battling the Rogue River tribe in southwestern Oregon and earned the title of colonel.
Political career
Kelsay was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives and served in 1844 as a delegate from Morgan County. Then in Oregon in 1857 he represented Benton County at the Oregon Constitutional Convention as Oregon prepared for statehood. At the convention John was selected as chairman of the military committee. In 1868 Kelsay won the election for a seat on the Oregon Supreme Court. His two-year term ended in 1870 and he left the bench. However, in both 1870 and 1872 he was nominated as a Republican for the court. In Oregon he was one of the early leaders of the Republican Party.
Later life
Before his time on the high court Kelsay married a second time in 1864. With his second wife Cornelia Corintner he fathered two children. Later served as mayor of Corvallis. John Kelsay died on January 19, 1899, in Oregon.

The Sultan of Mocha is a three act comic opera of 1874 with a libretto by Albert Jarrett and a score by Alfred Cellier. It was first produced at the Prince's Theatre, Manchester in 1874 and revived in London in 1876 and 1887 (with a new libretto by William Lestocq) and in New York in 1880, among others.
Productions
The musical theatre writer Kurt Gänzl describes The Sultan of Mocha as "one of the earliest British musicals of the modern era both to have a significant career at home and to win overseas productions". It was first produced in 1874 at the Prince's Theatre, Manchester by the actor-manager Charles Alexander Calvert, who "accepted a text supplied by a local gentleman of some literary attainment", Albert Jarrett (1834–1916), which was then set to music by Alfred Cellier, the musical director at Alexander's theatre. The production borrowed a camel from the local zoo for Middle-Eastern authenticity; it ran initially for 30 performances from 16 November to 9 December 1874, with Furneaux Cook in the title role and Bessie Emmett as Dolly. The Sultan of Mocha was taken off for the annual pantomime but returned in March 1875 (for two weeks) and April 1875 (for three weeks) with largely the same cast but with tenor John Chatterson as Peter, Catherine Lewis and Emily Muir as Dolly and Furneaux Cook reprising his role as the Sultan.
Of the score, Gänzl wrote:
Cellier's music took little or no notice of the French opéra-bouffe style which had been dominant in Britain's musical theatres for the past years and which had featured in such French-composed British musicals as Aladdin II (Hervé), Cinderella the Younger (Jonas) and Whittington (Offenbach) and the spectacular The Black Crook and Babil and Bijou. Following instead the tones of Sullivan's Contrabandista and Clay's The Gentleman in Black and Cattarina, Cellier's music for The Sultan of Mocha helped establish the kind of English comic-opera score which would find its apogée in the Savoy operas and his own Dorothy.
Its first revival was at the St James' Theatre in London from 17 April to 2 June 1876, a run of 47 performances, with Constance Loseby as Dolly, George W. Anson as Admiral Sneak, Alfred Brennir as Peter and Henri Corri as the Sultan and a chorus of 70. Cellier conducted his own piece as the musical director at the theatre.
It received its American premiere in December 1878 at the Bush Street Theater in San Francisco, California, where it had a short run under the management of Alice Oates. Blanche Roosevelt produced it at the Union Square Theatre in New York with her Blanche Roosevelt English Opera Company from 14 to 25 September 1880 for a run of 13 performances with Leonora Braham as Dolly and with Cellier conducting. The work returned to Manchester in 1880, where it played at the Theatre Royal with Alice May as Dolly, Fred. J. Stimson as Flint, George Fox as the Sultan, Allen Thomas as Sneak and Frederic Wood as Peter.
The piece received various revivals thereafter including at the Strand Theatre in 1887 with a new libretto by William Lestocq and included an additional song by Paolo Tosti, with Violet Cameron, Charles Danby and Henry Bracy in the cast. Opening on 21 September 1887, this production ran for 114 performances. Cellier dedicated the score to his friend, colleague and sometime employer, Arthur Sullivan.
Following his success as Peter at the Strand Theatre Bracy took up the Australian rights to The Sultan of Mocha, producing the show with his Henry Bracy's Comic Opera Company at the Alexandra Theatre in Melbourne in November 1889 and at the Criterion Theatre in Sydney in March 1890. Bracy was Peter, Lilian Tree was Dolly, John Forde was Sneak, Knight Aston was the Sultan, Flora Granpner was Lucy and William Stevens was Flint.

Child psychotherapy, or mental health interventions for children have developed varied approaches over the last century. Two distinct historic pathways can be identified for present-day provision in Western Europe and in the United States: one through the Child Guidance Movement, the other stemming from adult psychiatry or psychological medicine, which evolved a separate child psychiatry specialism.
Terms describing child-focused treatments may vary from one part of the world to another, with particular differences in the use of such terms, as "therapy", "child psychotherapy" or "child analysis".
Psychoanalytic child psychotherapy
Psychoanalytic psychotherapy with infants, children and adolescents is mainly delivered by people qualified specifically in psychoanalytic child psychotherapy, or by trainees under supervision from a specialist in child-focused treatment. Recent evidence, covering 34 research papers (nine of which were randomized controlled trials) showed psychoanalytic psychotherapy to be particularly effective for children with the following conditions:
depression
anxiety and behavior disorders
personality disorders
learning difficulties
eating disorders
developmental issues
Furthermore, follow-up research shows that in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, therapeutic improvements continue well beyond the termination of the therapy itself. This has been termed a, "sleeper effect."
In the UK, psychoanalytic psychotherapy is recommended by NICE as an evidence-based treatment for trauma from sexual abuse and severe depression in adolescents following the IMPACT study
Evidence-based child and adolescent psychiatry
There are various therapeutic assessments to address mental health concerns among children and adolescents. Some approaches are backed by strong scientific evidence, while some are not. Some research suggests that it is the quality of the relationship with the therapist, rather than the particular form of therapeutic intervention, that is the strongest factor in helping change develop.
Parent–infant psychotherapy
If the normal course of secure attachment between parent and infant is disrupted, parent–infant psychotherapy is a catch-all term to describe psychotherapies that either aim to restore this bond or to work with vulnerable parents to overcome disruption and prevent further occurrence. Examples of this kind of therapy include, "Watch, Wait, Wonder," and psychoanalytic parent-infant psychotherapy. Many of these techniques require a three-way relationship between the parent, child, and therapist. During therapy sessions, the parent may express his or her thoughts and feelings which are based on a combination of factors including:
The parent's experiences as a child
The parent's expectations and hopes for the child's future
The relationships the parent has with other people
The therapist's role is as an observer and an interpreter of the interaction between the infant and the parent. He might share some of his thoughts about the behavior of the child with the parent and by doing so offering the parent an alternative way of experiencing the child. This technique helps the parent to resolve issues with his or her own infancy-experiences in order to restore secure attachment with the infant. And it helps lower the risk for psychopathological developments of the child in the future.
Group art therapy
Group art therapy gives the child a safe environment to access their emotions through a creative medium in the presence of a therapist. This nonverbal therapeutic practice alleviates the stress that a child may feel when trying to find the words to express themselves; thus it helps rebuild social skills and gain trust in others. Studies have also found that this practice can alleviate self-harm engagement. This method of psychotherapy has been found particularly helpful for children who exhibit any of the following:
Autism
Asperger's
Anxiety and behavior disorders
Group art therapy has eight subcategories of specific mechanisms of change. Among them are:
As a form of expression to reveal what's inside
As a way of becoming aware of oneself
a way to form a narrative of life
integrative activation of the brain through experience
a form of exploration and/or reflection
the specifics of the art materials/techniques offered in art therapy
as a form to practice and/or learn skills
art therapy as an easily accessible, positive and safe intervention by the use of art materials
By bundling together these specific groups, the general groups are as follows:
art therapy as a form of group process
the therapeutic alliance in art therapy
Within this approach, three types of behaviors can be exhibited by the therapist; non-directive, directive, and eclectic. Non-directive refers to a following behavior in which the therapist takes on an attitude of observing self-exploration of emotions rather than facilitation or interpretation. Directive attitudes however follow a facilitative pattern by asking specific questions to guide the clients artwork. With these two processes in mind, eclectic combines them to create a facilitative and lenient approach simultaneously and often utilizes emotion check-in's at the start of sessions, and emotion check-outs at the end of sessions.
This approach adopts various psychological elements such as psycho-educational, mindfulness, psychoanalysis, and cognitive analytic theories. This article sought to analyze this methods effectiveness on a broad spectrum, including the following:
traumatic events (PTSD)
who have educational needs or disabilities
children with medical conditions
children with none of the former
juvenile offenders
Art therapy can be implemented as a holistic therapeutic practice for child cancer patients as well (effecting 1 in 285 children in the US; 15,980 children each year). Given the alleviating effects that are addressed by this method, children were better able to discuss their needs and emotions to their family members and healthcare team. The results of this study conveyed that art therapy lead to improved emotional and mental well-being and improved communication skills.
Parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT)
This approach is meant to assist parents whom have children ages 2–7 years old who are prone to disruptive behaviors and emotional difficulties. Parent–child therapy utilizing two stages, each possessing their own goals and characteristics to create this approach. Beginning with child-directed interaction (CDI), parents learn skills such as praise, verbal reflection, imitation, behavioral description, and enjoyment, to achieve the goal of warm and secure parenting styles. Parent-Directed interaction (PDI), the second phase, seeks to decrease the original disruptive behaviors exhibited by the child. Both phases are designed to be coached by the therapist via another room while the parent interacts with their child. This review found that certain cultural values may impede or contribute to the progress of this approach.
