Gahoi is a merchant Vaishya-Baniya community in central India.
Gahois are divided into 12 gotras, each gotra is divided into six alls. They have traditionally interdined with the Parwar Jain community of Bundelkhand.
The "Grahapati" family mentioned in the Grahapati Kokkala inscription is believed to be from the same community that is now known as Gahoi. This inscription at Khajuraho, dated Vikram Samvat 1056, Kartika (1000–1001 AD), is the earliest known reference to the Grahapati family. Unlike all other Chandella-era Grahapati inscriptions which are Jain, this refers to a Shiva temple, although Verse 3 suggests that the builder also worshipped Jinas. An inscription is of Vikram samvat 1011 mentioning Pahilla, regarded to have been a Grahapati, who built a Jain temple during the reign of Dhanga at Khajuraho. This temple is among those that still exists at Khajuraho.
A bronze Jain Altarpiece with Parshvanatha, Shantinatha, and Vasupujiya is preserved in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It was installed by Sadhu Sandhan, son of Kuntha, of Grahapati family in Vikram 1121 (1178 AD). Gahoi Vaishy Mahasabha was established by late Shri Jwala Prasad Bilaeya in the year 1930.

Malta sent a delegation to compete at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from 9 to 25 February 2018, with one competitor, alpine skier Élise Pellegrin. It was the country's second Winter Olympic appearance, after the 2014 Winter Olympics. Pellegrin was designated as the flag bearer for both the parade of nations during the opening ceremony, and the closing ceremony. They were disqualified from the giant slalom, and finished 50th in the slalom.
Background
Malta first sent a delegation to compete in the Summer Olympics in the 1928 Amsterdam Games. They have competed in most Summer Olympics since, missing the Olympics only in five occasions between 1928 and 2016. These were in 1932, 1952, 1956, 1964, and 1976. In spite of this, they did not send a delegation to the Winter Olympics until the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Élise Pellegrin was the only competitor sent to the Sochi games, and they were also the only competitor in the designation sent to Peyongchang in 2018. Pellegrin went to Peyongchang with their coach Marvin Hocquax. The Chef de Mission of the delegation was Lucienne Attard. As the only athlete, Pellegrin was chosen as the flag bearer for both the parade of nations during the opening ceremony, and the closing ceremony.
Alpine skiing
Malta qualified one female athlete, Élise Pellegrin, they were 26 years old at the time of the Peyongchang Games. In the giant slalom held on 15 February 2018, Pellegrin was disqualified for going outside their lane during the first run. The next day the slalom was much better for her, recording a time of one minute and five seconds in the first run, which was good for 56th place. That afternoon, they improved their time to 58.90 seconds, good enough for 50th place overall in the competition.

"Fearless" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift for their second studio album, Fearless (2008). It was released to US country radio as the album's fifth single on January 4, 2010, by Big Machine Records. Swift wrote "Fearless" with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey while traveling on tour to promote their self-titled debut studio album (2006). With lyrics about a perfect first date, the song was chosen by Swift as the album's title track because it explores the courage to embrace the challenges of love, the overarching theme of all other songs. Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, it is a country pop and pop rock song with dynamic guitars.
Music critics praised "Fearless" for its production and lyrics. In the United States, the single peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); it additionally peaked at number 10 on the Hot Country Songs chart. "Fearless" also entered charts in Canada and Spain. Swift performed the song on the Fearless Tour (2009–10); footage and behind the scenes of the tour were used to comprise a music video for "Fearless", directed by Todd Cassetty and released on February 17, 2010. After a dispute with Big Machine Records over the rights to the masters of their first six studio albums, Swift released Fearless (Taylor's Version), a re-recording of Fearless, on April 9, 2021, which includes the re-recording of "Fearless".
Background and release
"Fearless" was written by Swift in collaboration with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act to promote their eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). Despite the song describing the perfect date, Swift was not dating anyone or even "in the beginning states of dating anybody" while writing the song. Swift was inspired to write the song based on the perfect first date they wished they had experienced. While developing "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process: "I think sometimes when you're writing love songs, you don't write them about what you're going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." Swift described the song's greater concept to be about "the fearlessness of falling in love", writing that "no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again." After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated their personal definition of the word "fearless". To her, "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that you have a lot of fears, but you jump anyway", an idea that convinced them to title the album Fearless. The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from Fearless on January 4, 2010.
Composition and lyrics
"Fearless" is a country pop and pop rock song written about the fearlessness of falling in love. Lyrically, the song narrates Swift's ideal first date. The song is four minutes and one second in length. Musically, "Fearless" is set in common time and the key of F major with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. Swift's vocals span from F3 to C5 and the song follows the chord progression of F–C–Gm–B♭-C. Some critics, such as Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, noticed that the song features various of Swift's most commonly used tropes, such as rain, cars, fancy dresses, and overcoming timidity. Writing for Blender magazine, Sheffield opined the lyrics "And I don't know why but with you / I'd dance in a storm in my best dress, fearless" demonstrated how Swift enjoyed making a scene, adding that they would not wear "anything else to go ride around in a storm".
Critical reception
"Fearless" has received critical acclaim. Alice Fisher of The Guardian praised "Fearless" for its "perceptive lyrics about universal truths that can be enjoyed at any age." Jim Harrington of The San Jose Mercury News expressed a similar sentiment in a review of Swift's Fearless Tour: "Moms and daughters, as well as groups of teens and couples out for a date night, [can sing] along with equal gusto." Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone chose the song as a highlight from Fearless, applauding its "loud, lean guitars and rousing choruses." Retrospectively, critics have remained favorable towards the imagery and passion of the lyrics. Nate Jones of Vulture ranked the song as their 25th best song (out of 173 ranked in total), highlighting that the emotion Swift invested into the lyrics "is matched in the way they tumble from line to line into the chorus." Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield ranked it 29th, opining that Swift makes even some of their most common tropes feel fresh. Jules Lefevre of Junkee ranked it as the third best song on Fearless, similarly praising the presence of Swift's most common imagery and describing the song as captivating. In a review of Fearless (Taylor's Version), a reviewer for Clash Magazine retrospectively described "Fearless" as a "first kiss soundtrack".
Commercial performance
After its digital release, on the issue dated November 1, 2008, "Fearless" debuted and peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 with sales of 162,000 digital downloads. Following its single release, the song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 99 on the week ending February 20, 2010. Its highest position on the chart while being released as a single was number 76 on the week ending April 10, 2010; it ultimately spent 15 weeks on the Hot 100. The song is one of 13 songs from Fearless charted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, breaking the record for the most top 40 entries from a single album. "Fearless" also peaked at number ten on the Hot Country Songs chart and spent 19 weeks on the chart, making it Swift's tenth consecutive top ten hit but also their lowest-charting single, and 27 on the Country Digital Song Sales chart, where it spent 15 weeks. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for the sale of over 500,000 units on October 12, 2009, before its official release as a single on January 4, 2010, therefore becoming the first single to be certified gold before being released as an official single. "Fearless" was certified platinum by the RIAA on October 23, 2012, and had sold a million copies in the United States by November 2017.
On the week ending November 29, 2008, "Fearless" debuted and peaked at number sixty-nine in Canada, spending a total of five weeks on the chart. It eventually reached number 7 on the Canadian Country Airplay chart. The song peaked at number thirty-two in Spain.
Accolades
Live performances
Swift's first televised performance of "Fearless" was on November 10, 2008, on the Late Show with David Letterman. They went on to perform the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Clear Channel Communications's Stripped. Swift performed the song on all venues of their first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which ran from April 23, 2009, to July 10, 2010. During each performance, Swift escorted a silver sparkly dress and black boots and played an acoustic guitar as floral patterns with a moving butterfly were projected on the stage. Alice Fisher of The Observer attended the May 7, 2009 concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London and said that while Swift drifted off during the performance, it "clearly made perfect sense to the girls in the audience."
The song was also performed on to Speak Now World Tour, in a mashup with Jason Mraz's "I'm Yours" and Train's "Hey Soul Sister". Swift performed the song, acoustically, on selected dates during both The Red Tour and The 1989 World Tour. In 2018, they performed it, in place of "All Too Well", during the second East Rutherford show at Metlife Stadium on their Reputation Stadium Tour.
Music video
Various performances from the Fearless Tour were used to comprise a music video for "Fearless", directed by Todd Cassetty. The video premiered on February 17, 2010, on CMT. It begins when Swift tells their band before they step onstage, "You guys, this tour has been the best experience of my entire life." The video intermingles footage from the tour itself with fans excitedly showing off signs to Swift with behind-the-scenes footage of Swift and their band as they travel on the Fearless Tour. The video ends with Swift waving goodbye as they exit the stage. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News interpreted it to be "Swift's love letter to their fans", as it showed an "inside view of what it's like to go on tour". As of July 2021, the video has accumulated over 58.4 million views on YouTube.

The Schloss Tegel or Humboldt-Schloss is a country house in Tegel, part of the Reinickendorf district of the German capital Berlin. The brothers Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt spent much of their childhood in a former schloss on the site and on the estate, which extends almost as far as Lake Tegel.
The present building was built between 1820 and 1824 by Wilhelm von Humboldt to designs by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. It still belongs to the Heinz family, descendants of Wilhelm. It houses the private Humboldt-Museum, open to guided tours during the summer.
History
Originally built as a Renaissance mansion in 1558, it was converted to a hunting lodge by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. As part of the Tegel estate, it passed to the Humboldt family by marriage in 1766 and became their family seat - Alexander and Wilhelm lived there several years. After their mother Marie-Elisabeth von Humboldt's death, Wilhelm took over the estate in 1797 and had the schloss rebuilt in the classical style between 1820 and 1824 by the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Wilhelm's daughter Gabriele later inherited it - they married the Prussian foreign minister Heinrich von Bülow and after their death it passed to their daughter Constanze von Heinz, whose descendants still own it.
The park was originally designed between 1777 and 1789 by Gottlob Johann Christian Kunth, the Humboldts' tutor. From 1802 it was further developed by Wilhelm to designs by Peter Joseph Lenné. The park was listed as a 'Denkmalschutz' (monument treasure) in 1983. On its western side, near Lake Tegel, is the 'Dicke Marie', an oak named after their cook by the Humboldts - it is sometimes dated at 800 years old. There are also 7.8 m deep lakes near the house itself. The park also contains Wilhelm's wife's tomb monument in the park in 1829, on a site chosen by them - it consists of a high granite column topped by a statue of the Roman goddess Spes by Bertel Thorvaldsen, favoured by Caroline and bought by Wilhelm after their death. Wilhelm and Alexander were also buried nearby, as were Caroline and Wilhelm's children and descendants up to the present day, beneath uniformly designed unornamented tombstones and rows of flat grave mounds. The column is framed from behind by a stone bench or exedra, simpler than Schinkel's usual style.

The Church of Scientology of France is organized as a group of secular nonprofit organizations. France is a secular state, which protects the rights of citizens to practice their religion. Although citizens can form religious associations based on the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which grants certain benefits, the Church of Scientology of France is instead organized into secular associations based on a 1901 law regarding nonprofit groups.
A 1995 parliamentary report lists Scientology as a cult, which has since been under the watch of MIVILUDES and its predecessors (Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes and interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes). In its 2006 report MIVILUDES classified Scientology as a dangerous cult.
Seven officials from the Church of Scientology in France have been convicted of crimes such as embezzlement, and contribution to suicide.
History
Scientology was founded in 1952 by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the United States. It subsequently spread to other countries.
Legal status
In 1978, L. Ron Hubbard was convicted in absentia by French authorities of engaging in fraud, fined 35,000 French Francs and sentenced to four years in prison. The head of the French Church of Scientology was convicted at the same trial and given a suspended one-year prison sentence.
Since 1995, some French authorities have classified the Church of Scientology as a "secte" (cult) as seen in the report of the National Assembly of France. On this basis, a hostile stance is generally taken against the organization. A 1999 government inquiry committee reporting on the financial aspect of cults recommended dissolving the Church of Scientology because of swindling, complicity of swindling, abuse of trust, and other nefarious activities. A government report in 2000 categorized the church as an "absolute cult" and recommended that all its activities be prohibited. The keeping of files containing personal information on all its members (and other practices), are seen to qualify the Church as a totalitarian cult, moreover "extremely dangerous". The report rejected U.S. criticism of the French government's hostility towards Scientology, saying that Washington's protection of cults was "exorbitant".
In 2005 the municipal government of Paris passed an official resolution so that unlike in Marseille, celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise would never be made an honorary citizen, specifically because of their affiliation with Scientology.
The 2006 riots in France came in the midst of a parliamentary commission in charge of examining the influence of cults, particularly on youth, which started its hearings on July 12, 2006, and was scheduled to be completed in December that year. The government "cultic watchdog" agency MIVILUDES subsequently warned that cults were infiltrating the suburbs, increasingly offering aid as a cover for their activities, notably so in a Church of Scientology's communique that "appeared to be taking the credit for calming the situation in one of the riot-hit suburbs."
While they were Finance Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy received Tom Cruise in Paris in 2004. The anti-cult Roger Ikor centre's website wrote that President Sarkozy was preparing to change the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and State (that had been forbidding the state to finance any cult or religion), to allow cults to receive money from the state. That modification did not take place.
Suicide of Patrice Vic
On November 22, 1996, the leader of the Lyon Church of Scientology, Jean-Jacques Mazier, was convicted of fraud and involuntary homicide and sentenced to eighteen months in prison for their role in the death of a member who committed suicide after going deeply into debt to pay for Scientology auditing sessions. Fourteen others were convicted of fraud as well.
Suicide of Kaja Ballo
Kaja Bordevich Ballo, a Norwegian student in Nice, committed suicide hours after hearing the results of a negative Scientology personality test. In April 2008, Aftenposten noted that the French police were investigating connections between Scientology and Ballo's death. The investigation was being headed by a judge in France. Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they could not determine a direct link between the Scientology personality test and Ballo's death. The family decided not to file a civil lawsuit, but the case received attention both in France, and in Norway where several family members were politicians, and where suicides are generally not discussed in mass media.
2008–09 cases
Early
On September 8, 2008, Judge Jean-Christophe Hullin ruled that Scientologists' Celebrity Center, bookstore, and seven Church leaders should be tried for fraud and "illegally practicing as pharmacists". The ruling is in regards to a complaint made in 1998 by a woman who said they were enrolled into the Church of Scientology by a group they met outside a metro station. The woman said they paid 140,000 francs for illegally prescribed drugs, an e-meter, and books. The trial was due to begin on 25 May 2009. It was believed that if the French Scientology organization lost the case, it could end up being dissolved. On 16 June 2009 current.com incorrectly reported that several of the church's leading members, including its leader Xavier Delamare, had been arrested and that the church had been banned from practicing in France. As it turned out, the website had actually been referencing an outdated BBC news article from November 1999. In September 2009 it was reported that the French Scientology organization was no longer at risk of dissolution as a result of the fraud trial, due to a very opportune and unexplained change in French legislation. That legislation change has since been reversed.
Conviction for fraud
Case
On 27 October 2009, the Church of Scientology was convicted of defrauding recruits out of their savings. One woman claimed they lost more than €20,000 in the 1990s. Judges ordered the Scientology Celebrity Center and bookshop to pay a €600,000 (US$888,000) fine; earlier plans by the prosecution to force the Church to disband completely could not proceed. The law supporting complete dissolution was temporarily inadmissible, due to a rework of the penal code. The dissolution law was not reinstated until after the case had begun, and therefore could not be used. Judges also stated that disbanding the church would push it underground, where it could not be monitored. In their indictment, investigating Judge Jean-Christophe Hullin criticized what they called the Scientologists' "obsession" with financial gain and practices they said were aimed at plunging members into a "state of subjection".
Seven leading Scientologists were fined, including the head of Scientology in France, Alain Rosenberg. Rosenberg received a two-year suspended jail sentence combined with a €30,000 fine. Four of the leaders received suspended sentences ranging from ten months to two years, while the other two were fined minor amounts. Agnès Bron, a church spokesperson, likened the fines to, "an Inquisition for modern times". According to Catherine Picard, head of the French Association of Victims of Cults, the fining might encourage more "unhappy Scientologist recruits" to bring out their concerns. They also stated that, "Scientology can no longer hide behind freedom of conscience."
Church public comments
The Scientology Celebrity Center spokesperson, Éric Roux, stated that, "There is an attitude toward religious minorities in general ... that is pretty catastrophic". In relation to the government's official cult monitoring mission (agency) MIVILUDES, Roux claimed that "we have a government that pushes for hate against religious minorities". However, what they and others contested was "the fraud that is committed against families and individuals".
The Church of Scientology stated that they would appeal, with U.S. Church spokesperson Tommy Davis claim the proceedings as being a "heresy trial" and claims that "the fines will get thrown out on appeal. We've had similar cases before and in other countries. If it has to go to the court of human rights we're confident we will win there". Davis claims that the proceedings were "in total violation of the European Convention on Human Rights and French constitutional guarantees on freedom". According to their view, "France is pretty much in the Dark Ages on the subject of religious tolerance ... We'll prevail as we have repeatedly in situations approximating this one".
Agnes Bron, a French official for the organisation, stated that "For each person who complains we have 100,000 ready to say nothing but good things about scientology." A Rolling Stone article from 2009 reported that Scientology has about 100,000 to 200,000 adherents worldwide.
Future repercussions
Judges also said that they would ensure a paid posting would be placed in multiple publications outside France (including Time magazine and the International Herald Tribune) to ensure the news would spread beyond France; according to Olivier Morice, a lawyer for the civil plaintiffs, "The court told the Scientologists, in essence, to be very, very careful, because if you continue to use the same methods of harassment, you won't escape next time". Morice added that, "It's the first time in France that the entity of the Church of Scientology is condemned for fraud as an organized gang". Georges Fenech, the head of MIVILUDES, said that the court "condemned [the French branch of Scientology] as an entity ... due to its fraudulent way of operating ... [If] they begin swindling again, they can be subject to dissolution in the future". Fenech added that, "[this] is a historical turning point for the fight against cult abuses", and that, while members are "allowed to continue their activity ... a seed has been planted".
In an interview on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation current affairs radio program The Current with Hana Gartner, former high-ranking Scientology official Mark Rathbun commented that the decision to convict the Church of Scientology of fraud in France would not have a significant impact on the organization. "On the France thing I don't think that's going to have any lasting impact, simply because they got a nine hundred thousand dollar fine I think - which is like chump change to them. They've got literally nearly a billion dollars set aside in a war chest," said Rathbun.
As of 2009, members of the church are also being sued for fraud and practicing pharmacology without a license.
Adherents
The French government does not keep statistics on religion but in 1999 the Church itself claimed that it had 40,000 adherents in France. The French newspaper Le Figaro reckons around 5000 adherents in France in 2008.
In popular culture
The relationship between the Church of Scientology and the law in France is the subject of Is Scientology Above the Law? The documentary investigates the suspicious circumstances surrounding a fraud probe into sixteen members of the church of Scientology. The role of the church is questioned in connection with the disappearance of files critical to the case; lawyers for the prosecution argue that the missing evidence was deliberately taken by members of Scientology working within and effectively undermining the legal system to protect the reputation of the church.

Theodosius of Alexandria was an Ancient Greek grammarian, purported to have lived about the time of Constantine the Great. A terminus ante quem is yielded by a letter of Synesius (floruit ca. 400 CE) to the "wonderful grammarian Theodosuis". Theodosius themselves cited Apollonius Dyscolus and Herodian in their works.
Theodosius' main work were the Κανόνες εἰσαγωγικοί περὶ κλίσεως ὀνομάτων καὶ ῤημάτων (Introduction to The Rules of Noun and Verb Declension), essentially an epitome of Dionysius Thrax's Art of Grammar, from where they mechanically copied the verb and noun inflectional paradigms. This work, and most importantly the scholia on it by Georgius Choeroboscus, constituted the main primary source for the grammarians later onwards down to the Renaissance. Theodosius was also known as the author of Περὶ ὅρου and other grammatical works.
The Κανόνες, amplified by the additions of later Byzantine grammarians, were published by Karl Wilhelm Göttling under the title of Theodosii Alexandrini Grammatica (Leipzig, 1822), the Preface having been published before in Osann's Philemonis grammatici quae supersunt (Berlin, 1821), and a portion of this work, entitled Theodosii Grammatici Alex. Canones de Declinatione Nominum et Conjugatione Verborum, was included by August Immanuel Bekker in the third volume of their Anecdota Graeca (Vol. 3, Berlin, 1821).

Major John Roland Abbey (23 November 1894 – 24 December 1969) was an English book collector and high sheriff.
Early life
They were the eldest of three sons of William Henry Abbey, a brewer, and was named John Rowland before dropping the 'w'. They attended Windlesham House School, Brighton from 1907 to 1909 but was subsequently educated in nearby Rottingdean by a private tutor, Mr Möens, after an accident caused permanent damage to one of their elbows.
Military career
In November 1914, at the start of World War I, they were commissioned as a regimental officer in the Rifle Brigade, serving for two years on the Western Front in the 13th and 8th Battalions. They experienced a lucky escape as part of the 8th Battalion; while they were serving in reserve, the battalion took part in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, losing all officers but one. They were gassed in November 1916 and spent five months recovering in hospital before being invalided out in October 1917 and demobilised in 1919. Their younger brother Lieutenant Noel Roland Abbey was killed on the Western Front in April 1918 while serving with the Grenadier Guards. Abbey later rejoined the Rifle Brigade in November 1939, and served from 1941 to October 1943 as staff officer to the Admiral-Superintendent at Great Yarmouth. They left the army in 1943 and was awarded the honorary rank of Major in 1946.
Personal life
After the war they became manager of the Kemp Town brewery, succeeding their father as chairperson in 1943 and merging the company with Charringtons in 1954. On 7 June 1921, they married Lady Ursula Cairns, daughter of Wilfred Cairns, 4th Earl Cairns, with whom they had two daughters. In 1945, they were appointed High Sheriff of Sussex, a position they held for a year.
Book collecting
Abbey would become the largest English book collector of their time. Their book collecting started in 1929 buying books from various private presses, eventually gaining complete collections of books from the Kelmscott, Ashendene and Gwasg Gregynog presses. They also became interested in modern bindings, and in 1931 commissioned examples from Sybil Pye and, from R. de Coverley & Sons, a copy of Siegfried Sassoon's Memoirs of an Infantry Officer decorated with Abbey's coat of arms. They also collected antiquarian books, starting from the sale of Primrose's collection and building it up from 1936 to 1938 thanks to sales from the Mensing, Moss, Aldenham, Schiff, and Cortlandt F. Bishop collections, eventually holding over 1,300 books. They died on 24 December 1969 in London, and, with the exception of manuscripts given to their family and a group of books donated to the Eton College Collections, their remaining texts were sold for £993,509 between 1970 and 1975.
Author
Abbey wrote several books, including Scenery of Great Britain and Ireland in Aquatint and Lithography, 1770-1860, from the Library of J. R. Abbey ; a Bibliographical Catalogue and Life In England In Aquatint And Lithography, 1770 - 1860 Architecture. Drawing Books. Art Collections. Magazines. Navy And Army. Panoramas. Etc From The Library Of J R Abbey. A Bibliographical Catalogue.

South Yemen (), officially the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (), also referred to as Democratic Yemen () or Yemen (Aden) (), was a socialist state that existed from 1967 to 1990 as a state in the Middle East in the southern and eastern provinces of the present-day Republic of Yemen, including the island of Socotra.
South Yemen's origins can be traced to 1874 with the creation of the British Colony of Aden and the Aden Protectorate, which consisted of two-thirds of the present-day Yemen. Prior to 1937 what was to become the Colony of Aden had been governed as a part of British India, originally as the Aden Settlement subordinate to the Bombay Presidency and then as a Chief Commissioner's province. After the collapse of Aden Protectorate, a state of emergency was declared in 1963, when the National Liberation Front (NLF) and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) rebelled against the British rule.
The Federation of South Arabia and the Protectorate of South Arabia merged to become the People's Republic of Yemen on 30 November 1967, which later changed its name to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. It became a Marxist–Leninist one-party state in 1969 and was supported by Cuba, East Germany and the Soviet Union. It was the only communist state to be established in the Arab world. Despite its efforts to bring stability into the region, it was involved in a brief civil war in 1986. Following the collapse of the USSR, South Yemen was unified with the Yemen Arab Republic, commonly known as "North Yemen", on 22 May 1990 to form the present-day Republic of Yemen. After three years, however, a political crisis arose between the South's YSP and the North's GPC and Islah parties after the parliamentary elections in 1993. South Yemen declared its secession from the North Yemen in 1994 as the Democratic Republic of Yemen. This effort ended after North Yemen occupied the area as a result of the 1994 civil war. Another attempt to restore South Yemen as a nation, with the Southern Transitional Council as its new government, began in 2017 as part of the 2014 Yemeni Civil War.
History
British rule
In 1838, Sultan Muhsin Bin Fadl of the state of Lahej ceded 194 km2 (75 sq. miles) including Aden to the British. On 19 January 1839, the British East India Company landed Royal Marines at Aden to occupy the territory and stop attacks by pirates against British shipping to India. It then became an important trading hub between British India and the Red Sea, and following the opening of the Suez canal in 1869, it became a coaling station for ships en route to India. Aden was ruled as part of British India until 1937, when the city of Aden became the Colony of Aden. The Aden hinterland and Hadhramaut to the east formed the remainder of what would become South Yemen and was not administered directly by Aden but were tied to Britain by treaties of protection with local rulers of traditional polities that, together, became known as the Aden Protectorate. Economic development was largely centered in Aden, and while the city flourished, the states of the Aden Protectorate stagnated.
Decolonization
In 1963, Aden and much of the Protectorate were joined to form the Federation of South Arabia with the remaining states that declined to join, mainly in Hadhramaut, forming the separate Protectorate of South Arabia. Both of these polities were still tied to Britain with promises of total independence in 1968.
Two nationalist groups, the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) and the National Liberation Front (NLF), began an armed struggle known as the Aden Emergency on 14 October 1963 against British control and, with the temporary closure of the Suez Canal in 1967, the British began to withdraw. One faction, NLF, was invited to the Geneva Talks to sign the independence agreement with the British. During its occupation of Aden, the British had signed several treaties of protection with the local sheikhdoms and emirates of the Federation of South Arabia; however, these parties were excluded from the talks, and thus the agreement stated "...the handover of the territory of South Arabia to the (Yemeni) NLF...". Southern Yemen became independent as the People's Republic of Yemen on 30 November 1967, and the National Liberation Front consolidated its control in the country. On 14 December 1967, the PDRY was admitted into the United Nations as a member state.
In June 1969 a radical Marxist wing of the NLF gained power in an event known as the Corrective Move. This radical wing reorganised the country into the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) on 30 November 1970. Subsequently, all political parties were amalgamated into the National Liberation Front, renamed the Yemeni Socialist Party, which became the only legal party. The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen established close ties with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Cuba, and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. East Germany's constitution of 1968 even served as a kind of blueprint for the PDRY's first constitution.
The new government embarked on a programme of nationalisation, introduced central planning, put limits on housing ownership and rent, and implemented land reforms. By 1973, the GDP of South Yemen increased by 25 per cent. And despite the conservative environment and resistance, women became legally equal to men, polygamy, child marriage and arranged marriage were all banned by law. Equal rights in divorce were also sanctioned. The Republic also secularised education and sharia law was replaced by a state legal code.
The major communist powers assisted in the building of the PDRY's armed forces. Strong support from Moscow resulted in Soviet naval forces gaining access to naval facilities in South Yemen.

Unlike the early decades of East Germany and West Germany, North Korea and South Korea, or North Vietnam and South Vietnam, or China and Taiwan, the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) and South Yemen (PDRY) remained relatively friendly, though relations were often strained. Fighting broke out in 1972, and the short-lived conflict was resolved with negotiations, where it was declared unification would eventually occur.
However, these plans were put on hold in 1979, as the PDRY funded Red rebels in the YAR, and war was only prevented by an Arab League intervention. The goal of unity was reaffirmed by the northern and southern heads of state during a summit meeting in Kuwait in March 1979.
In 1980, PDRY president Abdul Fattah Ismail resigned and went into exile in Moscow, having lost the confidence of their sponsors in the USSR. Their successor, Ali Nasir Muhammad, took a less interventionist stance toward both North Yemen and neighbouring Oman.
Civil War
On 13 January 1986, a violent struggle began in Aden between Ali Nasir's supporters and supporters of the returned Ismail, who wanted power back. Fighting, known as the South Yemen Civil War, lasted for more than a month and resulted in thousands of casualties, Ali Nasir's ouster, and Ismail's death. Some 60,000 people, including the deposed Ali Nasir, fled to the YAR. Ali Salim al-Beidh, an ally of Ismail who had succeeded in escaping the attack on pro-Ismail members of the Politburo, then became General Secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party.
Reforms and attempts for unification
Against the background of the perestroika in the USSR, the main backer of the PDRY, political reforms were started in the late 1980s. Political prisoners were released, political parties were formed and the system of justice was reckoned to be more equitable than in the North. In May 1988, the YAR and PDRY governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions including agreement to renew discussions concerning unification, to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border, to demilitarise the border, and to allow Yemenis unrestricted border passage on the basis of only a national identification card. In November 1989, after returning from the Soviet–Afghan War, Osama bin Laden offered to send the newly formed al-Qaeda to overthrow the South Yemeni government on behalf of Saudi Arabia, but Prince Turki bin Faisal found the plan reckless and declined. In 1990, the parties reached a full agreement on joint governing of Yemen, and the countries were effectively merged as Yemen.
Reviving South Yemen
Since 2007, some Southerners have been actively protesting for independence, in a movement known as 'Al Hirak' or the Southern Movement. During the Yemen Civil War 2015, in response to incursions by the Houthis and military forces loyal to deposed Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh, members of the Southern Movement formed 'Popular Resistance' militias. Since the Battle of Aden, these armed groups have sought to defend the South against Houthi/Saleh attempts to take over the country and have taken the current state of civil war as an opportunity to further their struggle for independence.
In late January 2018, separatists loyal to the Southern Transitional Council successfully seized control of the Saudi-backed Yemeni government headquarters in Aden in an apparent coup d'état against the Hadi government.
Politics and social life
South Yemen's ethnic groups were, as of 2000, ethnic Yemeni Arabs (92.8%), Somalis (3.7%), Afro-Arab (1.1%), Indians and Pakistanis (1%), and other (1.4%). The only recognised political party in South Yemen was the Yemeni Socialist Party, which ran the country and the economy along self-described Marxist lines, modelled on the Soviet Union.
Women's rights under the socialist government were considered the best in the region. Women became legally equal to men and were encouraged to work in public; polygamy, child marriage, and arranged marriage were all banned; and equal rights in divorce received legal sanction.
The Supreme People's Council was appointed by the General Command of the National Liberation Front in 1971.
In Aden, there was a structured judicial system with a Supreme Court.
Education was paid for through general taxation.
Income equality improved, corruption was reduced, and health and educational services expanded.
There was no housing crisis in South Yemen. Surplus housing built by the British meant that there were few homeless people in Aden, and people built their own houses out of adobe and mud in the rural areas.
South Yemen developed as a Marxist-Leninist, mostly secular society ruled first by the National Liberation Front, which later morphed into the ruling Yemeni Socialist Party. The only avowedly Marxist-Leninist nation in the Middle East, South Yemen received significant foreign aid and other assistance from the USSR and East Germany, which stationed several hundred officers of the Stasi in the country to train the nation's secret police and establish another arms trafficking route to Palestine. The East Germans did not leave until 1990, when the Yemeni government declined to pay their salaries which had been terminated with the dissolution of the Stasi during German reunification.
Sports
In 1976, the South Yemen national football team participated in the Asian Cup, where the team lost to Iraq 1-0 and to Iran 8–0. They entered their only World Cup qualification campaign in 1986 and were knocked out in the first round by Bahrain. On 2 September 1965, South Yemen played their first international match against the United Arab Republic, to whom they lost 14–0. On 5 November 1989, South Yemen played its last international match against Guinea, to whom they lost 1–0. The team stopped playing when the North and South united in 1990 to form the modern state of Yemen.
In 1988, the South Yemen Olympic team made its debut in the Summer Olympics in Seoul. Sending only eight athletes, the country won no medals. This was the only time the country went to the Olympics until unification in 1990.
Governorates
Following independence, South Yemen was divided into six governorates (Arabic sg. muhafazah), with roughly natural boundaries, each given a name by numeral. From 1967 to 1978, they were named officially by numerals only; from 1979 to 1990, they were given new official names. The islands: Kamaran (until 1972, when it was seized by North Yemen), Perim (Meyun), Socotra, Abd-el-Kuri, Samha (inhabited), Darsah and others uninhabited from the Socotra archipelago were districts (mudiriyah) of the First/Aden Governorate being under Prime-Minister of the state supervision.
Economy
There was little industrial output, or mineral wealth exploitation, in South Yemen, until the mid-1980s, following the discovery of significant petroleum reserves in the central regions near Shibam and Mukalla. The main sources of income were agriculture, mostly fruit, cereal crops, cattle and sheep, fishing and later, oil exports.
The national budget was 13.43 million dinars in 1976, and the gross national product was US$150 million. The total national debt was $52.4 million.
Airlines
The following airlines had operated from the PDRY:
Aden Airways (1949–1967). Ceased operations on 30 June 1967 at the time of British withdrawal from the Federation and the Protectorate of South Arabia.
Alyemda – Democratic Yemen Airlines (1961–1996). Joined Yemenia, the airline of the former YAR
Yemen Airways (1989–1990)

Garry David Middleton (born 19 July 1948 Corowa, New South Wales - 23 November 1994) was an Australian motorcycle speedway rider.
Career
They first came to Britain in 1967 a rode for a short time with the Belle Vue Aces and the King's Lynn Stars before getting a permanent ride with the Wimbledon Dons. They stayed with the Dons for the 1968 season but in 1969 they moved to the Hackney Hawks. They rode for the Hawks from 1969 until 1971. In 1972 they moved to the Oxford Rebels following a contract dispute with promoter Len Silver. Middleton also raced as an International rider for Australia.
Middleton incidents
They were nicknamed 'Cass the Gas' as they were a real showman and made their feelings known about a variety of subjects.
In 1969 they were involved in an incident with Roy Trigg at Cradley Heath. Garry tried to forcefully dive under Roy but Roy saw them and slowed down, leaving Middleton to shoot straight past them into the safety fence. Middleton then went into the pits into their toolbox and pulled out a handgun. They had to be dragged from the pits to avoid further trouble.
In 1971, in a meeting against then World Champion Ole Olsen, Olsen was riding so well that they were unbeaten, passing people almost for fun. In the second half of the meeting, Middleton, to entertain the crowd, jokingly strapped two broom handles to their handlebar to stop Olsen passing him. The match referee did not share their sense of humour and fined him.

A common school was a public school in the United States during the 19th century. Horace Mann (1796–1859) was a strong advocate for public education and the common school. In 1837, the state of Massachusetts appointed Mann as the first secretary of the State Board of Education where they began a revival of common school education, the effects of which extended throughout America during the 19th century.
Early development
Common schools originated in New England as community-funded instruments of education for all children of the region or neighborhood. These secondary schools furthered the Puritan conformity of the region by institutionalizing religion into the curriculum for the purpose of instilling good morals and obedience in the populace. The 17th-century Puritan relied upon Christian organizations, such as the Anglican Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, for catechisms as the first grammar books. In most cases, local church clergy took responsibility for education in their communities. With support from the community and wealthy philanthropists, clergy determined the curriculum, material, and teachers for common schools throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.
The religious sensibility of New England education was further augmented by the First Great Awakening. Rev. Cotton Mather (1663-1728) stated that the schools had been instruments for maintaining the pre-eminence of the godly. Reflecting this sentiment, in 1742, neighboring Connecticut enacted a law restricting New Light schools during the First Great Awakening. The law declared "the erecting of any other schools, which are not under the establishment and inspection aforesaid, may tend to train up youth in ill principles, and practices, and introduce such disorders as may be of fatal consequence to the public peace and weal of this Colony."
19th-century reform
Horace Mann
From 1837 until 1848, Horace Mann led the reform on education in Massachusetts as a lawyer, Massachusetts State senator, and the first secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Education. Mann struggled to create a universal standard for state education because schools were characterized by their regional and communal differences. State member of congress James G. Carter (1795–1849) explained that the state shifted responsibility for the preservation classroom standards of the schools to the towns; the towns shifted responsibility to districts; and the districts had shifted it to individuals. In order to influence and educate the public, they published annual reports and founded the Common School Journal to report on Massachusetts' schools. In 1839, the first normal school for teachers was established in Lexington, Massachusetts in an effort to produce standardized, methodological teaching.
Henry Barnard
Henry Barnard (1811-1900) was a fellow educational reformer in Rhode Island. In the 1840s, Barnard worked closely with Governor James Fenner to evaluate and reform the common schools of the state. In 1845, Barnard established Rhode Island's first teaching institute. In 1866, St. John's College offered Barnard the presidency which they filled until the following year. From 1867-1870, Barnard served as the nation's first United States Commissioner of Education. The practical service of education was a promotion of industrialism. Barnard repeatedly proposed moral instruction instilled the virtuous habits of "industry, frugality, and respect for property rights." This utilitarian outlook reflected a changing world in the wake of the Industrial Revolution and emphasized a need to adapt education to meet the changing need of an industrial world.
Curriculum
Common schools typically taught "the three Rs" (reading, [w]riting, and [a]rithmetic), history, geography, and math. The McGuffey Reader was the favorite schoolroom text in the 19th century, surpassing influence of Noah Webster's blue-backed speller. A strong emphasis on spiritual and moral lessons mixed into the text's lessons. There was wide variation in regard to grading (from 0-100 grading to no grades at all), but end-of-the-year recitations were a common way that parents were informed about what their children were learning.
Moral instruction
The intention of common schools was to equip every child with moral instruction and "equalize the conditions of men." The emphasis on morality in the classroom remained a strong element of education. As the fervor of the Second Great Awakening declined, the instruments of teaching morality changed from overtly Biblical to an attempt at a neutral approach. Implementing the philosophy of phrenology, moral instruction began to use a scientific approach and rejected the old dogmatic method of imparting moral instruction.
Controversy
Although common schools were designed by Horace Mann to be nonsectarian, there were several fierce battles, most notably in New York City and Philadelphia, where Roman Catholic immigrants and Native Americans objected to the use of the King James Version of the Bible. Tensions were especially high in cities with large immigrant populations. In 1844, The Philadelphia Nativist riots (Bible Riots) began as a result of tensions between nativists and immigrants, due in part to a rumor that Catholic immigrants would remove Protestant Bibles from classroom curriculums. Even without Bible readings, most common schools taught children the general Protestant values (e.g., work ethic) of 19th-century America.
Common school era
The common school era is viewed by many education scholars to have ended around 1900. In the early twentieth century, schools generally became more regional (as opposed to local), and control of schools moved away from elected school boards, and towards professional control. Because common schools were not special-purpose districts, voters often decided in called elections to join independent or unified school districts.
States and territories began to emulate and adopt Massachusetts' common school system. Educators saw it as their responsibility to civilize the American frontier. In 1862 and 1890, the United States Congress passed the Morrill Land-Grant Acts, which erected a statute to sell public lands to build and fund state universities for the purpose of propagating instruction in agriculture and mechanical arts. This was the federal government's first move to fund public education.

The Witte Museum was established in 1926 and is located in Brackenridge Park in San Antonio, Texas. It is dedicated to telling the stories of Texas, from prehistory to the present. The permanent collection features historic artifacts and photographs, Texas art, textiles, dinosaur bones, cave drawings, and Texas wildlife dioramas, in addition to nationally acclaimed traveling exhibits. Artwork in the collection includes sculpture by San Antonio-born Bonnie MacLeary.
The Witte Museum is named after San Antonio business person Alfred G. Witte, who bequeathed $65,000 to the city for construction of a museum of art, science, and natural history to be built in memory of their parents. The first Director of the Witte Museum was Ellen Schulz Quillin.
History
The catalyst for the Museum was an extensive collection of natural history specimens owned by Henry Philemon Attwater, which San Antonio public schoolteacher Ellen Schulz purchased for the city of San Antonio for $5,000. When the growing collection grew too large for the high school where it was housed, Schulz and their supporters appealed to the city council for funds to build a new museum. With those funds and a $65,000 bequest from Alfred G. Witte, a new building was constructed. Established under the auspices of The San Antonio Museum Association, it was known as the Witte Memorial Museum until 1984, when the name was simplified to the Witte Museum.
In addition to natural and historic artifacts, the Witte collection included paintings, sculptures, drawings and other works of art. In 1970, museum director Jack McGregor proposed establishing a separate art museum. In 1972, with the support of several key museum trustees, the San Antonio Museum Association acquired the former Anheuser-Busch brewery, which would be renovated and remodeled. The San Antonio Museum of Art opened to the public on March 1, 1981. The Witte Museum Texas Art Collection focuses on works created by artists living and working in Texas as well as work by artists representing its history and culture.
Renovations and additions
1930s: The Witte Museum's support of archeological research in the canyons of Big Bend and the Lower Pecos area resulted in important research findings and a growing collection of artifacts and led to the building of new galleries to house them, as well as a Reptile Garden, which was the vision of founder Ellen Schultz Quillin. The Reptile Garden not only provided a source of revenue for the Museum but provided income to South Texas ranchers and laborers who sold their rattlesnakes and rat snakes to the museums for $0.10-$0.15 per pound. The two log cabins on the property were constructed by participants in President Roosevelt's National Youth Administration program and are frequently used to teach students about pioneer life.
1940s: Two historic San Antonio houses were moved from their original locations to the Witte Museum campus; the limestone home of banker John Twohig, an Irish born pioneer San Antonio merchant, and the plastered stone home of José Francisco Ruiz, who was the city's first schoolmaster and one of two native Texans to sign the Texas Declaration of Independence.
1960s: Several new historic exhibits and improved art galleries were added, including the McFarlin Jewel Room and the Piper Memorial Wing, which houses temporary exhibits.
1970s: Thanks to the dedicated efforts of William A. Burns, museum Director from 1962 to 1970, The Lone Star Hall of Wildlife and Ecology opened to the public in March 1971 with dioramas of Texas wildlife.
1980s: Several major exhibits were added, including the Texas Wild and Ancient Texans.
1990s: The H-E-B Science Treehouse opened overlooking the San Antonio River, offering interactive science and physics exhibits to a growing number of students visiting the Witte.
2000s: In 2003, The Hertzberg Circus Collection was transferred from the San Antonio Public Library to the Witte Museum, fulfilling the wishes of owner Harry Hertzberg as expressed in their will. The oldest and one of the largest public circus collections, it includes artifacts, programs, prints and photographs, as well as sheet music, videotapes, professional journals and published manuscripts. Current President and CEO Marise McDermott has overseen a number of expansion projects since assuming the leadership role in 2004:
The H-E-B Science Treehouse was transformed into the H-E-B Body Adventure, providing youth with the first interactive health experience in the US;
The B. Naylor Morton Research and Collections Center opened, displaying more than 300,000 artifacts and providing space for scholars, archivists and students to view the growing collection;
The 19,000 square-foot Mays Family Center opened as a multi-purpose exhibition and special events center.
In 2012, the Robert J. and Helen C. Kleberg South Texas Heritage Center opened to the public as a permanent home for the museum's South Texas collections, exhibitions and public programs, combined with the latest museum technology. The collections are links to the area's heritage and include saddles, spurs, basketry, branding irons, historical clothing, land grants, art and firearms.
In 2014, the museum began a $100 million renovation of more than 174,000 square feet of space to include the Naylor Family Dinosaur Gallery and Dinosaur Lab; Valero Great Hall; McLean Family Texas Wild Gallery; and Kittie West Nelson Ferguson People of the Pecos Gallery, as well as a new 350-car parking garage.
Led by Founder and President Patrick Gallagher, the design team of Gallagher & Associates created exhibit graphics, video animations, updated dioramas, touch screens and interactive displays, and numerous sound installations. This project had a goal of LEED certification, which it attained through designs which are environmentally friendly and sustainable.
Valero Energy contributed $4 million toward the expansion, which funded the glass-enclosed Valero Great Hall, an entry and lobby space featuring replicas of an Acrocanthosaurus atokensis, a Tyrannosaurus rex, and a suspended Quetzalcoatlus with a forty-foot wingspan.
The ribbon cutting and grand opening took place on March 4, 2017, and was attended by Witte President and CEO Marise McDermott, Texas First Lady Cecilia Abbott, US Congressman Lamar Smith, Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff, Mayor Ivy Taylor and Councilman Alan Warrick, among others. "The New Witte" welcomed more than 90,000 visitors in the month following the opening.

In their 16th season under head coach Frosty Westering, the Lutes compiled an 11–1–1 record and tied for the NAIA Division II national championship. The team participated in the NAIA Division II playoffs where they defeated (40–21) in the first round, (36–26) in the quarterfinal, and (17–14) in the semifinal.
In the national championship game, the Lutes played a 16–16 tie with Wisconsin–Stevens Point. Wisconsin–Stevens Point later forfeited its share of the national championship because of its use of ineligible players.

Gene Sarazen (; born Eugenio Saraceni, February 27, 1902 – May 13, 1999) was an American professional golfer, one of the world's top players in the 1920s and 1930s, and the winner of seven major championships.  They are one of five players (along with Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods) to win each of the four majors at least once, now known as the Career Grand Slam:
U.S. Open (1922, 1932),
PGA Championship (1922, 1923, 1933),
The Open Championship (1932), and
Masters Tournament (1935).
Early life
Eugenio Saraceni was born on February 27, 1902, in Harrison, New York, their parents were poor Sicilian immigrants. They began caddying at age ten at local golf clubs, took up golf himself, and gradually developed their skills; Sarazen was essentially self-taught. Somewhat novel at the time, they used the interlocking grip to hold the club.
Career
Sarazen took a series of club professional jobs in the New York area from their mid-teens. In 1921, they became a professional at Titusville (Pa.) Country Club, and they contracted to be the professional at Highland Country Club near Pittsburgh, Pa. in 1922. Sarazen arrived in April, stocked the golf shop and gave a few lessons, but spent most of their time at Oakmont Country Club practicing with Emil Loeffler. At some point, the pair visited Skokie Country Club to practice on the course that would hold the U.S. Open; in July, they came from four shots behind to win the tournament. They returned to Pittsburgh and was feted at the William Penn Hotel, where they burst from a paper mâché golf ball. They did not return to Highland CC, broke their contract and became a 'touring' golf professional. Later that summer, they won the PGA Championship at Oakmont.
Sarazen was a contemporary and rival of amateur Bobby Jones, who was born in the same year; they also had many battles with Walter Hagen, who was nine years older. Sarazen, Jones, and Hagen were the world's dominant players during the 1920s. Rivalries among the three great champions significantly expanded interest in golf around the world during this period, and made the United States the world's dominant golf power for the first time, taking over this position from Great Britain. Sarazen has a plaque in their honor placed 195 yards out from the 15th green at Hororata Golf Club where they famously made a double eagle in the final round of sectional qualifiers. They earned their spot in their first United States Open in 1920 at age 18. Some say it was their greatest achievement as an amateur.
The winner of 38 PGA tour events, Sarazen was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974. They were the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in 1932, and won the PGA Tour's first Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. They played on six U.S. Ryder Cup teams: 1927, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1935, and 1937.
Invents modern sand wedge
Sarazen claimed to have invented the modern sand wedge, and debuted the club (while keeping it secret during preliminary practice rounds) at The Open Championship at Prince's Golf Club in 1932 (which they won). They called it the sand iron, and their original club is no longer on display at Prince's as it is worth too much for the insurers to cover. However, a similar club was patented in 1928 by Edwin Kerr McClain, and it is possible Sarazen saw this club.
Sarazen had previously struggled with their sand play and there had been earlier sand-specific clubs. But Bobby Jones's sand club, for example, had a concave face, which actually contacted the ball twice during a swing; this design was later banned. Sarazen's innovation was to weld solder onto the lower back of the club, building up the flange so that it sat lower than the leading edge when soled. The flange, not the leading edge, would contact the sand first, and explode sand as the shot was played. The additional weight provided punch to power through the thick sand. Sarazen's newly developed technique with the new club was to contact the sand a couple of inches behind the ball, not actually contacting the ball at all on most sand shots.
Every top-class golfer since has utilized this wedge design and technique, and the same club design and method are also used by amateur players around the world. The sand wedge also began to be used by top players for shots from grass, shortly after Sarazen introduced it, and this led to a revolution in short-game techniques, along with lower scoring by players who mastered the skills.
Masters Tournament win
Sarazen hit "the shot heard 'round the world" at Augusta National Golf Club on the fifteenth hole in the final round of the Masters Tournament in 1935. They struck a spoon (the loft of the modern four wood) into the hole, scoring a double eagle. At the time they were trailing Craig Wood by three shots, and was then tied with him. They parred the 16th, 17th and 18th holes to preserve the tie. The following day, the pair played a 36-hole playoff, with Sarazen winning by five shots.
The Sarazen Bridge, approaching the left side of the 15th green, was named in 1955 to commemorate the double eagle's twentieth anniversary, which included a contest to duplicate, with the closest just over away. It remains one of the most famous golf shots in golf history.
Later years, legacy
In spite of their height of , Sarazen was one of the longest hitters of their era. They played several lengthy exhibition tours around the world, promoting their skills and the sport of golf, and earned a very good living from golf. One of their American tours in 1940 was sponsored by Golf Magazine and they played a match every day for 60 days. As a multiple past champion, they were eligible to continue competing after their best years were past, and occasionally did so in the top events, well into the 1960s, and occasionally into the 1970s. Throughout their life, Sarazen competed wearing knickers or plus-fours, which were the fashion when they broke into the top level.
For many years after their retirement, Sarazen was a familiar figure as an honorary starter at the Masters. From 1981 to 1999, they joined Byron Nelson and Sam Snead in hitting a ceremonial tee shot before each Masters tournament. They also popularized the sport with their role as a commentator on the Wonderful World of Golf television show, and was an early TV broadcaster at important events.
At age 71, Sarazen made a hole-in-one at The Open Championship in 1973, at the "Postage Stamp" at Troon in Scotland. In 1992, they were voted the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf. Sarazen had what is still the longest-running endorsement contract in professional sports – with Wilson Sporting Goods from 1923 until their death, a total of 75 years.
Sarazen received an honorary degree in 1978 from Siena College, in Loudonville, New York. In 1998, shortly before their death, the Sarazen Student Union was named in their honor. They also established an endowed scholarship fund at the college, The Gene and Mary Sarazen Scholarship, which is awarded annually to students reflecting the high personal, athletic, and intellectual ideals of Dr. Sarazen. For many years, kitted in their signature plus-fours, they hit the first ball in an annual golf tournament, held to raise funds for the scholarship.
Sarazen died at age 97 in 1999 from complications of pneumonia in Naples, Florida. Their wife Mary died thirteen years earlier in 1986, and they are interred at Marco Island Cemetery in Marco.
In 2000, Sarazen was ranked as the 11th greatest golfer of all time by Golf Digest magazine. In 2018, T.J. Auclair ranked Sarazen as the ninth greatest golfer of all time.

Film Weekly was one of the leading popular film magazines published in the United Kingdom during the late 1920s and 1930s.
Background
Launched in 1928, the magazine became known for its gossipy interest in contemporary film stars. Columnist Nerina Shute became known for their "sweetly poisonous copy".
Film Weekly attracted a number of lawsuits from film professionals displeased at their portrayal by the magazine. The director Dinah Shurey sued for libel after their film The Last Post (1929) was not only panned in review but followed by an article by Shute questioning whether women were capable of directing films at all. Shurey won the action. The actor Alma Taylor also sued and won when Film Weekly claimed in 1932 that their career as an actor was over.
In 1930 the magazine sponsored a pair of film acting scholarships. The two winners (Cyril Butcher and Aileen Despard) went on to appear in the now lost Alfred Hitchcock short An Elastic Affair but did not subsequently enjoy lengthy careers, despite being placed under contract by British International Pictures.
Film Weekly merged with fan magazine Picturegoer in 1939. For much of its life it was edited by Herbert Thompson.
Awards
The magazine held an annual reader ballot to determine the best film of the year and the best performance by an actor or actor in a British film. For 1936 these were won by The Ghost Goes West and Nova Pilbeam (for Tudor Rose) respectively.
In fiction
Film Weekly features in the establishing shots of the film Rome Express (1932).

The Cleburne Intermodal Transportation Depot is an Amtrak train station in Cleburne, Texas, United States.
History
For many years, Cleburne was the site of a major locomotive backshop of the Santa Fe Railroad, and many shop buildings can be seen on the east side of the track. The 1898 two-story brick depot was scaled down to one floor and ultimately demolished during the 1990s to make way for a road expansion project.
Cleburne became the northern end of the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway in 1904, with the portion from Teague now abandoned.
Cleburne's current intermodal station, built in 1999, serves Amtrak trains and is the office for Cletran, the local bus transit. In recent history, the station has become less prestigious and the surrounding buildings have become mostly abandoned. The station is unstaffed, and all tickets must be purchased in advance.

They later served as administrative deputy minister of national defense under Chen Li-an, then was elected to the third convocation of the National Assembly in 1996. They chaired the Chinese Huangpu Four Seas Alliance Association, and was affiliated with the of the Kuomintang.
Controversy
In July 2016, the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office charged Luo with embezzlement, and a violation of the Political Donations Act, by accepting money from , a member of the national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, during Luo's tenure as head of the Chinese Huangpu Four Seas Alliance Association. A total of NT$10 million was paid in four transactions, in 2008, 2010, and 2012, and three of the payments were traced to Xu. The prosecutors' investigation into Luo found that they deposited all of the payments into direct deposit accounts belonging to them and their wife, then moved three remittances into an account owned by Chinese Huangpu Four Seas Alliance Association. The fourth remittance was moved to the association's bank account in 2013. The Taipei District Court ruled on the case in December 2019, sentencing Luo to five concurrent terms of imprisonment, one term each for the four political donations, and the fifth for embezzlement.

Levison Brothers / California Jewelry Co. was active from 1859 to 1935. Founded in 1859, they occupied 629 Washington Street, San Francisco, California by 1863, and by 1871 moved into two floors of their own building at 134 Sutter Street, San Francisco, furnished with machinery, tools, and appliances powered by a 25-horsepower engine.
Their advertising for the year 1871 states that they were the sole agent for American Watch Co., Elgin National Watch Company, Howard Watch Co., Chas. E. Jacot Watches, Carter Sloan & Co. Fine Jewelry, Meriden Britannia Co., and Rogers Brothers silver-plated ware, New Haven Clock Co., and Laders Frary & Clark's cutlery. The firm also imported watches, diamonds, jewelry, solid silverware, cutlery, clocks, and opera glasses, and manufactured fine jewelry. Major lapidary work such as diamond cutting was done on site per promotional pamphlets that survive today. Several initialed gold and silver signed watch cases are known as of the date of writing. These cases are either signed "Levison Bros." or initialed "LB" or similar.
One of their specialties was production of locally sourced fine quality gold quartz, moss agate, and gold jewelry and utility items popular in the 19th century, including chains, sleeve buttons, breast pins, lockets, rings, thimbles, and solid gold belt buckles with inlay. The woman's belt buckle by Levison Brothers shown as an image courtesy of New York Metropolitan Museum contains a description that indicates that California Jewelry Company's employee Mr. William Cummings was the August 1868 patentee of a special belt buckle prong and ring design utilized in the specimen owned by the museum. Few of these pieces survive today, and most appear to be unsigned and otherwise difficult to verify as having been made by Levison Brothers / California Jewelry Co.
Fractional gold coinage was produced as legal tender for a single year in 1871, sporting an "L" stamp for Levison Brothers, making use of locally available California gold. The company bought out R.B. Gray Co. of San Francisco, and was then able to continue making fractional gold using those facilities until authorities attempted to discontinue its production. An ex-Levison Brothers employee continued to use the dies for coin production for several more years. Fractional gold coinage of this period appears to have been produced mainly as souvenirs
Herman Levison was a man of great wealth upon their death in San Francisco in 1896. Per this newspaper article, they were apparently very well known in mercantile circles in both the United States and Europe, and was very liberal in extending credit to smaller dealers, and they had great success in their business. For many years they maintained a home in Hamburg, Germany, and in San Francisco, California, where they hosted lavish parties. Their wife and three children resided in Germany, and their son Louis Oscar Levison thus grew up in Europe. Louis Oscar eventually ended up partner in the firm once their father died.
The building that housed Levison Brothers / California Jewelry Co. San Francisco was for many years located at 132, 134, and 136 Sutter Street, San Francisco California, and was designed and built by the firm partners. Per an article in the Daily Alta California, the building was a 3-story plus basement structure built at a cost of $130,000 (1871 U.S. dollars), and included full lapidary machinery for gem cutting, with Mr. Cullen the in-house head of jewelry design. Importations that year were $500,000 per annum, and manufactures $300,000 per annum. First floor tenants of the Sutter Street building included W.K. Vanderslice & Co. silversmiths who were well-known San Francisco producers of fine quality sterling silver flatware and hollowware out of this facility starting approximately 1873.
There is one surviving historical photograph of this building as viewed from Sutter Street, archived on the internet, albeit with the "Levison Brothers" street signage blotted out from the image.
Levison family members who were employees of Levison Bros. or California Jewelry Co. included the following:
Louis Levison 1827-1901 (One of the two brothers who immigrated from Germany and ran the company as a partner)
Herman Levison 1831-1895 (One of the two brothers, and head of the business. Immigrated from Germany and ran the company as a partner)
Louis Oscar Levison 1870-1953 (Son of Herman Levison. Became firm partner after their father past away in 1895. Worked for the firm through incorporation in 1907, and until dissolution of the company in 1935)
Walter Herman Levison 1904-1997 (Son of Louis Oscar Levison. Company secretary from 1927-1929. Worked for the company until its dissolution in 1935)
Note that persons with the last name "Levison" who sold retail goods under the name "Levison Brothers" or "Levison Bros." during the gold rush and/or silver rush era in the Sacramento, California area were not related to the Levisons who ran the California Jewelry Co. operations out of San Francisco. The similarities between the names of those persons and operations are purely coincidental.
Effects of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire on Levison Brothers operations
The business was prospering when in 1906 the San Francisco earthquake and fire made a total loss of the original Levison-built and owned building at 132, 134, and 136 Sutter Street (see artist's rendition at right). The only remains were the diamonds and jewelry stored in a very large safe, which fell three floors through the burning building and buried itself in the basement floor, wedged between some steel girders it had pulled down with it. It was badly burned in the fire, and was allowed to cool off for two weeks before anyone could touch it. After an intense digging effort, a pit was opened up around the safe so that the safe door could be opened. The excitement was high. The inner doors of the safe had held tight, and they found the main contents unharmed. The Levisons quickly stashed away the contents for temporary hiding, transporting the contents across San Francisco Bay via boat (this is the pre-bridge era) to a family residence on Beach Road, Belvedere Island, California and another location in Mill Valley, California. That 19th century Victorian residence on Belvedere Island still exists to this day as a historic property.

Overwatch is a digital comic series published online by Blizzard Entertainment and republished by Dark Horse Comics, featuring events surrounding the characters of the Overwatch universe. It was published between April 2016 and April 2018.
Blizzard uses the comic series, along with animated media, fictional news reports, and online character biographies, to develop the narrative of Overwatch, as the video game includes no traditional story or campaign mode.
Development
Blizzard did not include a traditional campaign or story mode in the Overwatch video game. Instead, Blizzard opted to develop the story and lore of the Overwatch universe through a transmedia storytelling method, including animated shorts and comic titles.
On the approach to the storytelling, senior game designer Michael Chu, stated, "it was a solution that was born out of the kind of game we were making, because multiplayer shooter, obviously usually doesn't have a linear story. We had to think about other things, and we knew from day one that we wanted to make a significant Overwatch universe." Chu has also elaborated on how Blizzard decides which stories to tell through a comic format, stating, "every time we approach a story, very much like the skins, we have this backlog of story ideas, and hooks that we'd like to explore. We decide which ones we feel are the most exciting or make sense for the present. Like if we do a comic, comics are better for telling certain types of stories," adding, "we really decide what kind of story we want to tell, what's the story that we're going to tell, and then it's all about, lets figure out the best way to do this."
Publication history
Blizzard announced they would release six digital comics prior to the game's May 24, 2016 release, in addition to a graphic novel titled Overwatch: First Strike, set for a release later in 2016. First Strike was later revealed to have a November 2016 digital release, in addition to an April 2017 hardcover release. On April 21, 2016, Train Hopper, headlining the cowboy character McCree, became the first Overwatch comic title released by Blizzard. This issue, as well as all subsequent issues of the comic title, were published for free.
The comic series is published in cooperation with Dark Horse Comics, who republish the series on their own digital comic service. Animated versions, or animatics, of the comic's issues are also produced and released by Madefire Studios, an interactive comics publishing platform, shortly after they are released on Blizzard's own service. Madefire's animated versions are viewable on Battle.net, as well.
Although Blizzard initially announced six comic issues to be released, they published Legacy, featuring Ana in July 2016. Ana was also the first character to be added into the game post-release. Later in the month, Blizzard and Dark Horse announced a deal that would have Dark Horse publish future comic works centered around the Overwatch universe, as well as the First Strike graphic novel and an art book. Blizzard later released holiday themed issues, Junkenstein and Reflections, in October and December 2016, respectively. In Reflections, the character Tracer is portrayed in a lesbian relationship, making them the first Overwatch character to be confirmed canonically LGBT. As a result, access to this issue was made unavailable in Russia, to avoid legal conflict with the country's ban against gay propaganda.
On November 18, 2016, Blizzard announced it had canceled the release of the First Strike graphic novel. In the cancellation announcement, Michael Chu detailed that "the original idea for the graphic novel dates back to the early days of the game's development and came from our desire to tell the story of the founding of Overwatch during the Omnic Crisis." Chu added that, "in the years since First Strike conception, we have done a lot of development on the universe and its stories. While the core of this story remains, we have changed and expanded upon how we see the events that took place during the first days of Overwatch." Micky Neilson and Ludo Lullabi were slated to be the writer and artist for the graphic novel, respectively.
A hardcover collection of the first twelve issues of the Overwatch digital comics titled Overwatch: Anthology, Volume 1 was released on October 10, 2017. Dark Horse published an expanded edition of the anthology in November 2021, with a hardcover version released on December 1. The Russian edition of Anthology, Volume 1 originally did not include the Reflections issue to meet the original game's 12+ age restriction, although the issue was included in the 18+ rated 2021 re-issue of the anthology.
In April 2018, Blizzard released Retribution, the 16th issue of the comic series to tie-in with the game's Archive: Retribution event. No further issues of the series were released after this; however, in September 2020, Blizzard began releasing Tracer—London Calling, a five-issue mini-series.

Biophysical chemistry is a physical science that uses the concepts of physics and physical chemistry for the study of biological systems. The most common feature of the research in this subject is to seek explanation of the various phenomena in biological systems in terms of either the molecules that make up the system or the supra-molecular structure of these systems.
Techniques
Biophysical chemists employ various techniques used in physical chemistry to probe the structure of biological systems. These techniques include spectroscopic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and other techniques like X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy. An example of research in biophysical chemistry includes the work for which the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded. The prize was based on X-ray crystallographic studies of the ribosome that helped to unravel the physical basis of its biological function as a molecular machine that translates mRNA into polypeptides. Other areas in which biophysical chemists engage themselves are protein structure and the functional structure of cell membranes. For example, enzyme action can be explained in terms of the shape of a pocket in the protein molecule that matches the shape of the substrate molecule or its modification due to binding of a metal ion. The structures of many large protein assemblies, such as ATP synthase, also exhibit machine-like dynamics as they act on their substrates. Similarly the structure and function of the biomembranes may be understood through the study of model supramolecular structures as liposomes or phospholipid vesicles of different compositions and sizes.
Institutes
The oldest reputed institute for biophysical chemistry is the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen.
Journals
Biophysical chemistry journals include Biophysical Journal, Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics (published by Academic Press), Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications (Academic Press), Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (Elsevier Science), Biophysical Chemistry, An International Journal devoted to the Physics and Chemistry of Biological Phenomena (Elsevier), Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods (Elsevier), Journal of Biochemistry, Biology and Biophysics (Taylor & Francis), and Journal de Chimie Physique, Physico-Chimie Biologique (EDP Sciences and the Société Française de Chimie).

Randy Chartier (born March 31, 1957, St. Clair County, Michigan) is a cutting horse trainer, clinician, judge and competitor in the equestrian sport of cutting. They spent their early years riding and showing cutting horses with their late father M.L. Chartier at the family's Fairhaven Farm in Fairhaven, Michigan, where Dry Doc once stood at stud.
At age 21, they earned the title of 1978 NCHA Non Pro Futurity Champion riding Miss Dry, and in 1979 earned multiple championship titles that led to their induction into the NCHA Non-Pro Rider Hall of Fame. Chartier eventually decided to not renew their Non-Pro status, and started training cutting horses, and judging NCHA events. They relocated to North Texas, and built a cutting horse training operation near Millsap in Parker County where they and their wife, Kelle, reside. In 2015, they were inducted into the Open Division of the NCHA Rider Hall of Fame. They ended 2021 as the NCHA Reserve World Champion Rider riding "Classic Is Cool". At the beginning of the National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA) 2022 point year, Chartier had earned over $1.5 million in lifetime earnings. Chartier is the father of champion R.L. Chartier.
Early years
Chartier began competing in cutting events as a youth under the guidance of their late father, M.L. Chartier. After graduating from youth competition, they competed in the Non-Pro Division riding cutting horses sired by the family's stallion, Dry Doc. They became well known as a Non-Pro competitor when, at age 21, they won the 1978 NCHA Non-Pro Futurity riding Miss Dry. The following year they rode De Doc and Bo Doc to win the 1979 NCHA Non-Pro National Championship, and the 1979 NCHA Non-Pro World Championship. Also in 1979, they were inducted into the NCHA Non-Pro Rider Hall of Fame.
Professional trainer
Chartier eventually relinquished their Non-Pro card, and started teaching cutting horse clinics, and training cutting horses. They were competing in NCHA aged events in the Open Division, as well as in weekend NCHA sanctioned events where they also offered novice classes, and AQHA events that offered Senior and Junior cutting classes, such as the American Quarter Horse Congress. In 2015, Chartier was inducted into the Open Division of the NCHA Rider Hall of Fame.

The Octavians were a financial commission of eight in the government of Scotland first appointed by James VI on 9 January 1596.
James VI's minister John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane had died on 3 October 1595, and their financial situation was troubled. The Octavians were a reforming body, eager to bring order to the royal finances and bear down on patronage. They imposed a 5% import tax and promoted an expedition into the Highlands to recover tax revenue.
The Octavians were in part drawn from a committee appointed in 1593 by the Parliament of Scotland to look after the estates of Anne of Denmark. An English courtier in Scotland Roger Aston described events at the end of December 1595 in a letter to James Hudson: "The queen's council joins with the prior (Alexander Seton) and other of the king's council for the reformation of the king's particular affairs". The committee for the queen's estates continued after the Union of Crowns, and new appointments were made in April 1617.
It was said that at the end of December 1595, the Queen's council, newly appointed as the Octavians, gave Anne of Denmark a purse of gold which they then presented to the king as a New Year's Day gift. The details of this incident are obscure. The Octavians made particular efforts to reduce the cost of the royal households of James VI and Anne of Denmark. The chamberlain, the Duke of Lennox, and the Master Households, were encouraged to reduce the number of courtiers who received fees and meals at court, and as many as 70 posts were trimmed.
The Octavians appointed Henry Wardlaw of Pitreavie as Receiver General, responsible for the income from the Comptrollery, the New Augmentations (duties paid from former church lands), and the mint.
The initial commission for the Octavians lasted only one year, and was much disliked; Presbyterians attempted a coup on 17 December 1596, and one demand was that the Octavians should be disbanded.</ref> James VI was in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh with most of the Privy Council and the Octavians. After a sermon given by Walter Balcanquhall in St Giles, the congregation came out crying "the sword of Gideon" and some rioters called for arms. The royal guard escorted James VI back to Holyroodhouse.
When their commission was renewed in 1597, they faced disabling opposition from vested interests, and some of the Octavians were suspect as sympathetic to Catholics. But the concept of the commission as an extension of the exchequer into government persisted, and under the name of New Octavians it played a part in Scottish administration into the reign of Charles I.

Preston however, had reserved the money for the costs of an embassy to France.

Holy Trinity Church is a Church of England church in Swyre, Dorset, England. The oldest part of the church has been dated to the early 15th century, with a partial rebuild and additions later made in the 19th century. The church is a Grade I listed building.
History
A church serving Swyre is known to have existed since the 13th century, with the earliest record of a rector there dating to 1297. The oldest parts of the existing church date to c. 1400, which includes the chancel arch and west tower. The clergyman and county historian John Hutchins was rector at Swyre from 1729 to 1733, and they had the chancel repaired at their own expense during that time.
In 1843–44, the rebuilding of the nave was carried out at the sole expense of the Duke of Bedford and the chancel at the cost of the rector, Rev. John Wickens. The church reopened on 25 August 1844. A vestry and organ chamber was added to the church in 1885 at the sole expense of the rector, Rev. Orlando Spencer Smith.
Architecture
Holy Trinity is built of local stone, with slate-covered roofs. It is made up of a nave, chancel, north porch, west tower and vestry/organ chamber. In the north wall of the nave is a reset doorway which partially dates to the late 14th century. The tower has a plain parapet and contains two bells believed to be of 15th century origin.
Internal features include the Royal Arms of Charles II above the chancel arch. The arch is flanked by two painted panels of late 18th century origin which list the Ten Commandments. On the north wall of the nave is a brass memorial, with shield-of-arms, to John Russell and their wife Elizabeth (Frocksmer), dated 1505, and another to James Russell and their wife Alys (Wise), dated 1509. The west wall has an undated memorial to George Gollope and seven of their children, two sons-in-law and a grandchild, spanning from 1745 to 1787. On the north wall of the chancel is a monument erected to James Napier and family by Sir Robert Napier, dated 1692.
The octagonal font is of 15th century date. The church's organ was installed in 1890. It was built by Alfred Kirkland of London and restored in 1976 by George Osmond & Co of Taunton.

Lorenzo Harris (born January 28, 1964) is a dancer, choreographer, artistic director and professor of hip-hop dance. Harris formed the first and longest running hip-hop dance touring company, Rennie Harris Puremovement in 1992. In 2007, they conceived another touring company, RHAW or Rennie Harris Awe-Inspiring Works.
Harris has received numerous awards for their theatrical hip-hop dance performances or what they refer to as, "Hip-Hop concert dance".  They are known for such works as Rome and Jewels, Facing Mekka, 100 NAKED LOCKS, Heaven, and a host of innovative repertory works, which have broken many stereotypes and expectations of hip-hop dance. After receiving an honorary doctorate from Bates College and an honorary doctorate from Columbia College, Harris' company was chosen as 1 of 4 US companies to serve as cultural ambassadors for President Obama's "Dance Motion USA." In 2012, it toured the Middle East, performing and giving hip hop workshops to Egyptians, Israelis and Palestinians.
Early years
Growing up in North Philadelphia, Rennie was first inspired by Don Campbell's group, The Campbell Lockers, after seeing them on the TV show Soul Train. They started dancing socially as a kid but when they were around 12 years old, they started a dance group called Cobra III with their brother and childhood friend, nicknamed “Brainy.” Cobra III entered and won a local church talent show, marking the beginning of Harris' life commitment to dance.
Career
Harris started their career by forming dance groups during their teens, such as the GQ group called, The Step Masters and a popping crew called, The Scanner Boys. These groups opened and performed with such acts as: Afrika Bambaataa, West Street Mob, Kool Moe Dee and the Treacherous Three, Super Nature, currently known as Salt-n-Pepa, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, and Doug E Fresh, Double Trouble, Roxanne Shante, UTFO, Whodini, Newcleus, Run-DMC, Kurtis Blow, Madonna, Brandy, Aliah, Sugar Hill Gang, Sister Sledge, Gloria Gaynor, The Tramps, and Debarge, among others.
Harris worked for the TV dance shows, "Dancin' On Air", "Dance Party USA", and then was given their own show to host called, "One House Street." Harris finished their commercial career with a prolonged tour with Cathy Sledge of Sister Sledge, as a choreographer and dancer. Harris then returned to Philadelphia and The Scanner Boys to continue to innovate hip-hop dance. The Scanner Boys disbanded in 1992 with their last performance at the “Dancing in the Streets" festival held at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia.
Puremovement
Harris founded Rennie Harris Puremovement in 1991-92, the company was created to further their efforts to preserve and disseminate hip-hop culture. The company's mission is to re-educate about hip-hop and its culture through its artistic work, lecture demonstrations, and discussions. The company currently performs newer repertory works such as: "Something to Do with Love", "Get It," and "Love American Style," among a host of other works. The company has performed such evening length productions as: "Rome and Jewels", "Facing Mekka", and "Heaven", of which they have won numerous awards for. 2012 marks the 20th Anniversary of Rennie Harris Puremovement of which the company toured excerpts of past works as well as newer works in commemoration.
Illadelph Legends of Hip-Hop Festival
Harris started Illadelph Legends of Hip-Hop Festival in 1998 to bring together the pioneers of the various forms of Street Dance. Focusing primarily on teaching technique, philosophy, history and aesthetic of street dance. Illadelph dance was the first of its kind and was the catalyst for many of the Street Dance intensives to date. Devoid of competition the festival is believed to be the first to only offer dance classes, panel discussions, and performances. Some of the seminal and legendary pioneers that taught at Illadelph were pioneers such as Don Campbell of The Campbell Lockers, Mr. Wiggles, Ken Swift, Crazy Legs, and international artists like Meech from France, Hiro from Japan, and Eva Shou from Denmark. The festival passes on the knowledge, tradition, and dance vocabulary of the various forms, such as Popping, Breaking, Locking, House dance, Waacking, and vogue. Illadelph Legends is the first Street Dance festival to specifically feature and promote technical classes and workshops on the history and theory with the pioneers and historians of street dance young and old..
Scholarship
Rennie started teaching hip-hop at the age of 15 with the Smithsonian Institution and continues to teach at various universities across the world. While is company is touring Rennie teaches at the University of Colorado at Boulder from August 26-December 18th and at the University of Texas Austin from January 15-May 15th. In addition when traveling with their company they teach workshops and lectures on the history of hip-hop and the various techniques of street dance that sprang from the culture. In 2010, Harris received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Bates College and a Doctorate in the Arts and Humanities from Columbia College for their work and commitment to Street and hip-hop dance. They have taught at Universities such as the University of Colorado-Boulder, Stanford University, New York University, University of California, Los Angeles, Temple University, Villanova University, University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Ohio State University, Michigan University, University of Hawaii, Harvard University, among many others. As a part of their efforts to educate the world about hip-hop, they pass on their historical knowledge of the dance through performances all over the world, including but not limited to: London, Italy, Japan, China, Switzerland, Germany, Scotland, West Africa, Finland, the Netherlands, France, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, New Zealand, Perth, Auckland, Brazil, Jamaica, Trinidad, and the Bahamas. In addition, they have performed in theaters such as the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Lincoln Center, Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, Kennedy Center, Jacob's Pillow, Joyce Theater, Symphony Space, New Victory Theater, The Apollo Theatre in New York, Sadler's Wells Theatre (London), The Southbank Centre (London) and many other theaters and universities in the US and internationally.

Countess Eleonore Batthyány-Strattmann (29 May 1673 – 24 November 1741) was a Viennese Court lady. The daughter of Imperial Court Chancellor Count Theodor Heinrich von Strattmann, they were married to Hungarian nobleman and Ban of Croatia Ádám II Batthyány until their early death in 1703. For more than twenty years after becoming a widow they were Prince Eugene of Savoy confidante, companion and some have suggested Éminence grise. One of the most respected women in 18th century Viennese society, they were known as 'Beautiful Lori'.
Early life and family
Countess Eleonore Magdalena Ursula von Strattmann was born in 1673 in the Palatinate, the daughter of Imperial Minister Theodor von Strattman and their first wife Marie Mechtilde Freiin von Mollard. The Strattmann were a German noble family from the Duchy of Cleve where Eleonore's father was in the service of the Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1683 the family had moved to Vienna, where Theodor had arranged Emperor Leopold I's third marriage to Eleonore Magdalene of Neuburg. In 1685 Theodor von Strattman was raised to the rank of count by Emperor Leopold I and appointed Austrian court chancellor, the functional Habsburg foreign minister. Eleonore had five brothers and two sisters.
Eleonore married Count Adam II. Batthyány (1662-1703) on the 25th November 1692, the Batthyány Family were like many Hungarian aristocrats loyal to the Habsburg dynasty and served in the Habsburg military conflicts against the Ottoman Empire. Count Ádám II Batthyány came from Németújvár in the frontier region of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary, after they had rendered outstanding and valuable military service to Emperor Leopold I, most notably during the Siege of Stuhlweissenberg and the Siege of Buda in 1686 where they fought alongside a young Prince Eugene; in 1693 Adam became Ban of Croatia and was rewarded with the Bóly Estate in the year 1700.
After Adam died at a young age on 26 August 1703, Eleonore, who survived their husband for almost 40 years, look after the extensive Batthyány property and took over the guardianship of their two sons Ludwig Ernst (b.1696) and Karl Josef (b.1697). The Stranmann Palace was built by the famous Baroque master builder Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlau, their father's estates, after their death, were merged with those of the Batthyány family. Them residence was Rechnitz Castle, at the time in Hungary, after they sold another Batthyány building in Vienna, the palace at Renngasse 4, to the Bishop of Bamberg. In 1718 they acquired the former Palais Orsini Rosenberg at 2 , known today as the Batthyány-Strattmann Palace, close to the Winter Palace of Prince Eugene on in Vienna.
Very active and respected in Imperial Viennese society, Eleonore Batthyány-Stratmann became one of the most esteemed women at court where they were known as: (The Beautiful Lori) as they were often described as an extremely attractive beauty. Them correspondence characterises Eleonore as a self-confident woman who knew very well what they wanted and who seeks to enhance their knowledge with strength and determination. Eleonore had a brother called Heinrich Stratmann (1662-1707), after their early death they left a widow with the same first name as hers, Eleonore (1677-1738), daughter of the Imperial Field Marshal and Commander Schellart von Obbendorf. This “” organised elegant soirees and assemblies, as the evening parties were called at the time, in their palace on , today's in Vienna.
Eugene's Egeria
Eleonore Batthyány-Strattmann never remarried but was Prince Eugene of Savoy the closest companion and some have said mistress. Eugene was, for the last twenty years of their life, a guest at Rechnitz Castle as well as Eleonore's Vienna palace which was very close to their Winter Palace. Eugene and Eleonore met almost every day till their death in 1736. Prince Eugene had known the Strattmann family for years, as they and Eleonore's father, the court chancellor, had, incidentally, arrived in Vienna at the same time in 1683. It is not known precisely when their relationship began, but their acquisition of a property in Hungary after the Battle of Zenta, near Eleonore's Rechnitz Castle, made them neighbours.
Maria Theresa called Eleonore's children "Eugene's codicils". Some Viennese gossips suggested that they were the father of the Countess two sons. In the years immediately following the War of the Spanish Succession Eleonore began to be mentioned regularly in diplomatic correspondence as “Eugene's Egeria”, the soulmate of Prince Eugene, and the lady of their heart. When asked if they and the Prince would marry, Countess Batthyány replied: "I love them too well for that, I would rather have a bad reputation that deprive them of his". It has been said that it is through their influence on Eugene that, after the Peace of Passarowitz, Hungary was spared another "coup d'etat", their great influence on Prince Eugene is mentioned by the Duke of Richelieu in their memoirs. Prince Eugene spent their last evening playing cards with the Countess, they died on 21 April 1736. Countess Batthyány-Strattmann lived the rest of their life quietly in Vienna, they died on 24 November 1741.
Issue
Ádám II and Eleonore had two children: Ludwig (Lajos) and Karl Josef (Károly József)

The 1949 Washington Senators, the 49th season of the Major League Baseball franchise, won 50 games, lost 104, and finished in eighth and last place in the American League. It was the worst showing by the Washington club in 40 years, since the 1909 Senators lost 110 games. The team was managed by Joe Kuhel; it played its home games at Griffith Stadium, where it drew 770,745 fans, seventh in the circuit.
The Senators actually won 25 of their first 45 games and stood in third place after Sunday, June 5, 1949. But they would win only 25 games more all season, playing at an abysmal .229 rate over their last 109 contests. In today's 162-game schedule, that would have resulted in a 37–125 mark, surpassing the 1962 Mets' record for futility. At year's end, manager Kuhel would be replaced by Bucky Harris, the Senators' 1924 "boy wonder" manager, now 53, returning for a third term as skipper of the Senators.
Offseason
October 4, 1948: John Sullivan, Tom Ferrick and $25,000 were traded by the Senators to the St. Louis Browns for Sam Dente.
Prior to 1949 season: Jim Pearce was signed as a free agent by the Senators.
Regular season
On September 28, Senators pitcher Ray Scarborough ended Ted Williams' streak of most consecutive games reaching base safely at 84 games. Scarborough gave up just four hits in a 4–1 complete game win over the Boston Red Sox. Johnny Pesky made the final out with Williams on deck.

Marguerite Aimee Rosine Coppin (2 February 1867 – 1947) born in Brussels, was a Belgian novelist and poet. They became a feminist and pioneer in female emancipation and equal rights for women. They were compared with women's rights activists Amelia Bloomer and Emmeline Pankhurst.
Early life
Coppin was a daughter of Charles-Henri Coppin, merchant in lace, born in Wijtschate (West-Flanders) and of Marie Lehaut, born near Lille.
Coppin studied under Isabelle Gatti de Gamond and followed their teacher into activism
They became a teacher and in 1891 offered their services to a rich family in Austria. Afterward, they came to live in Bruges with their mother where they stayed until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. They taught French to the English residents.
Them first novels were published anonymously. The first, Initiation, was published as a feuilleton in La Revue de Belgique, a liberal paper, influenced by Freemasonry and freethinking.
Them novel Hors sexe occasioned a scandal. The work was seized by the public prosecutor and Coppin was accused of gross indecency. No further effect was given, but Coppin was more cautious in their expressions.
They were actively involved with French cultural life in Bruges and Brussels. They contributed to local papers such as Journal de Bruges and Le Carillon in Ostend. They lectured cultural associations such as Cercle Littéraire Excelsior as Chat Noir. They served as secretary of the Press Syndicate in Bruges, specially designated to entertain British visitors, e.g., in 1902 when a group of English journalists visited the exhibition of Flemish Primitives in Bruges.
Some citizens in Bruges were scandalized when Coppin rode a bicycle down the streets of the city with their skirts clipped to each ankle to function like trousers. The bicycle was recognized by 19th-century feminists and suffragists as a "freedom machine" for women contributing to female emancipation. "A woman on a bicycle? Brazen!" said some shocked people in Bruges according to an Australian news article published as late as 1937. Like Amelia Bloomer, Coppin devised a convenient and comfortable trouser-like garment for women to use for bicycle riding.
In 1914, with the outbreak of war Coppin fled to England where they taught French until their death in 1931.
Coppin was an adept of anthroposophy and theosophy, which is apparent in their novels. They received the award of the Orient Star, an order founded in 1914 by Rudolf Steiner and Helena Blavatsky.
After nearly a century in oblivion, Marguerite Coppin enjoyed a renewed interest and of reissue of some of their works.

Potassium voltage-gated channel, Shal-related subfamily, member 1 (KCND1), also known as Kv4.1, is a human gene.
Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shal-related subfamily, members of which form voltage-activated A-type potassium ion channels and are prominent in the repolarization phase of the action potential. This gene is expressed at moderate levels in all tissues analyzed, with lower levels in skeletal muscle.

CT Connect is a software product that allows computer applications to monitor and control telephone calls. This monitoring and control is called computer-telephone integration, or CTI. CT Connect implements CTI by providing server software that supports the CTI link protocols used by a range of telephone systems, and client software that provides an application programming interface (API) for telephony functions.
CT Connect is used most frequently in call center applications. Large call centers must handle huge volumes of calls, and the coordination of calls with business applications is essential.
Software Function and Structure
CT Connect software is not a CTI application in itself; rather, it is a software component that communicates with telephone systems, converts telephone call status and control information to a standardized form, and presents that information to third-party applications. This component approach contrasts with that of integrated offerings such as those from Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories that combine the low-level telephone interface function with higher-level application logic such as retrieving and displaying information from a data base.
Software developers seeking to include telephone-related functions in their applications incorporate CT Connect software modules into their projects. The CT Connect server module must be installed on a computer that has a special CTI communication link to the telephone system. The CT Connect client module is installed on the same computer as the developer's application software. The client module presents an API for application telephone functions such as dialing a new call or generating an alert for an incoming call. The client module executes these requests by signaling them to the server module, which in turn requests the function from the telephone system. The client-server structure allows multiple applications running on multiple computers to share access to a single telephone system.
CTI Standards
The principal standards specification for CTI is ECMA Computer-supported Telecommunications Applications or CSTA. The CSTA standard specifies a call model (that is, how parties participate in a call and the steps a call goes through as it proceeds) and a set of messages that can be exchanged between a telephone system and a computer system. When both telephone systems and computer systems implement the CSTA standard, a customer can choose freely among competing products with confidence that they will interoperate.
As described more fully below, the CT Connect development team participated in the definition of CSTA. CT Connect and its predecessor, Digital Equipment's Computer Integrated Telephony product line, implement the CSTA call model and support the relevant CSTA protocol standards. Several telecommunications equipment vendors have used CT Connect as a laboratory CSTA reference to test their own products' compliance with the standard.
Environment Independence
CTI servers like CT Connect must operate in a heterogeneous computing environment and must interoperate with other system components chosen by application developers and users. CT Connect takes an "open" stance towards other system components, interoperating with a wider range of components than other CTI servers. This open stance is undoubtedly one reason that CT Connect has survived for 20 years while other competitors such as IBM CallPath and Novell Telephony Services have been discontinued.
For CTI servers, important dimensions of interoperation are:
Telephone System Independence
Many telephone switch manufacturers have implemented CTI links for their products. Some of these are proprietary protocols and some are implementations of the ECMA CSTA standard. Some of these manufacturers also offer their own CTI servers (such as Nortel's Contact Center Manager Server), but those servers generally operate only with that single manufacturer's telephone system. By contrast, the companies that have owned and marketed CT Connect over the years (see the CT Connect history below) have made arrangements with most major PBX manufacturers to get access to their protocol specifications and implement their CTI link protocols.
API Independence
Computer-telephone APIs have proliferated. Microsoft introduced TAPI, Novell introduced TSAPI, Sun Microsystems introduced JTAPI, and a group of vendors formed the Versit Consortium to better integrate the existing protocol standards and APIs. Some manufacturers have attempted to use CTI API specifications to restrict users to their other products. For example, the Microsoft TAPI specification can be implemented only on the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems, and the Novel Telephony Services CTI server (now discontinued) could be used only on Novell networks. By contrast, CT Connect's client-server architecture permits client modules that offer various CTI APIs, and all client modules can interoperate with a common CTI server module.
Operating System Independence
Like CTI APIs (see above), most CTI servers operate under only one operating system. By contrast, CT Connect has historically included client and server modules that operate under a range of popular operating systems including the Unix and Microsoft Windows families.
History
CT Connect has had a significant role in the conception and evolution of the CTI concept and its implementation. The product has been owned and marketed by three companies over its 20-year lifetime.
Digital Equipment Corporation
The software that eventually became CT Connect was originally developed in the late 1980s at Digital Equipment Corporation. During the 1980s, telephony was evolving from analog to digital technology. The international telecommunications standards body CCITT (now the ITU) published specifications for the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). The ISDN specifications define digital interfaces between a subscriber and the network that can simultaneously support multiple telephone calls and packet data transmission.
In the 1980s Digital Equipment was a leader in computer networking with its DECnet software. Digital Equipment studied the ISDN specifications and concluded that the ISDN interface lacked the ability to coordinate a voice call with related data. The Digital Equipment team named this capability computer integrated telephony (or CIT) and evangelized the concept among vendors and customers. (The acronym for the original Digital Equipment product line, CIT, is frequently confused with the industry acronym for any form of computer-telephone integration, CTI. The latter term was adopted by members of the MultiMedia Telecommunications Association (MMTA), a prominent US industry association. The MMTA was incorporated into a larger trade association, TIA, in 2000.)
(See and for early expositions of the CTI concept by Digital Equipment.)
Digital Equipment needed the commercial cooperation of telecommunications equipment manufacturers because their telephone switching systems had to be modified to report telephone call information via new CTI data links. Two Canadian private branch exchange (PBX) manufacturers that were interested in the idea: Northern Telecom (now Nortel) and Mitel, which at that time was controlled by British Telecom. Digital Equipment worked with both of these companies – one in Canada and one in the United Kingdom – to design and implement CTI data links between their respective products. Both efforts were successful, and systems using PBXs from both companies were shown at the quadrennial CCITT exhibition in Geneva in the fall of 1987. Digital Equipment released its first CTI software products, operating with the Mitel SX-20 and Northern Telecom SL-1 PBXs, the following year.
Between 1988 and 1992, the Digital Equipment team approached more telecommunications equipment manufacturers (including Siemens ROLM and the former AT&T, whose Definity PBX product line is now owned by Avaya) and implemented the additional protocols needed to interoperate with their telephone systems. However, it quickly became clear that the number of proprietary protocols was becoming unmanageable. Call models differed between telephone systems, making it difficult to write CTI-enabled application software. The need for a standardized cross-vendor CTI call model and supporting protocol was becoming apparent.
A group of computer and telecommunications equipment vendors interested in this problem approached the European Computer Manufacturers' Association (now simply known as ECMA) with a proposal to undertake this standardization. The proposal was accepted and Robert Roden, an architect from the Digital Equipment technical team, was chosen as convenor (chairperson) for the standards work. Phase I (the first edition) of CSTA was released in 1992. The CSTA standard has since progressed through several editions, incorporating technologies such as voice response and XML. Each Phase of the CSTA standard includes both a call model and a recommended set of communication protocols.
See for more information about the early work on CTI standards.
The initial CTI software from Digital Equipment supported only VAX computers running the VMS operating system both as the server providing the telephone system interconnection and as application clients. Support for Digital's ULTRIX operating system was later added. But during the early 1990s, personal desktop computers became more pervasive in corporate computing environments. Digital Equipment responded to this trend by releasing Pathworks, a networking suite that allowed IBM-compatible PCs and Apple Macintosh computers to participate in a DECnet network. The Digital Equipment CIT team built on this platform and released a PC-based version of the CIT client that supported applications written for the Microsoft Windows operating system. The Windows desktop environment offered easier integration between business applications and telephone functions via the Microsoft Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) mechanism, since many off-the-shelf PC applications and development platforms supported the DDE interface.
Dialogic Acquires Digital's Technology and Team
In 1995, Digital Equipment sold the CIT product line to Dialogic Corporation, which was then the leader in server-scale telephone interfaces for the PC form factor. Digital's CIT management staff and most of the development team moved to Dialogic with the sale, forming a new 'CT Division' within Dialogic and maintaining the product's momentum. Dialogic converted the product from its original proprietary Digital Equipment hardware and software platform to an industry standard platform based on personal computer hardware and the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems. The resulting product, rechristened CT-Connect, was released by Dialogic in August, 1995. (The hyphen was dropped from the name in later releases.)
Dialogic Acquired by Intel
In 1999, Intel acquired Dialogic and all of its hardware and software product lines including CT Connect. As with the transition from Digital Equipment to Dialogic, most of the CT Connect business and technical team remained after the acquisition and product development and sales continued. CT Connect was renamed Intel NetMerge Call Processing Software to conform to Intel product naming conventions but remained the same product under the skin.
The late 1990s saw the rising popularity of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony. Realizing that CTI would be as important with VoIP as it had with traditional telephony, the CT Connect team enhanced CT Connect to support application control of VoIP voice calls. Intel was issued 11 US patents related to this work.
CT Connect Acquired By Envox Worldwide
Intel sold the product line to Envox Worldwide in 2005. As before, much of the technical team continued with the product during the transition. Envox restored the product name to CT Connect and continues to market it.
Syntellect, Inc. acquires Envox
On October 20, 2008, Envox was acquired by Syntellect, Inc. Syntellect is a call center focused software company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona.

The English Mail-Coach is an essay by the English author Thomas De Quincey. A "three-part masterpiece" and "one of their most magnificent works," it first appeared in 1849 in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, in the October (Part I) and December (Parts II and III) issues.
The essay is divided into three sections:
Part I, "The Glory of Motion," is devoted to a lavish description of the mail coach system then in use in England, and the sensations of riding on the outside upper seats of the coaches (in the author's often opium-tinged perceptions). With many digressions (on subjects ranging from Chaucer's poetry to a comparison of the River Thames with the Mississippi), De Quincey discusses the "grandeur and power" of the mail-coach ride; prior to the invention of the railroad, the mail coach represented the ultimate in transportation, in speed and force and controlled energy. Perhaps the most memorable and frequently-cited portion of Part I is De Quincey's comparison of one veteran mail-coachman to a crocodile. The crocodile-coachman's pretty granddaughter is memorialized as "Fanny of the Bath Road."
The concluding portion of Part I is set apart under the subtitle "Going Down with Victory," and relates the author's sensations as the mail coaches spread news of English victories in the Napoleonic Wars across England — though simultaneously spreading grief, as women learn the fates of men lost in battle.
Part II, "The Vision of Sudden Death," deals in great detail with a near-accident that occurred one night while De Quincey, intoxicated with opium, was riding on an outside seat of a mail coach. The driver fell asleep and the massive coach nearly collided with a gig bearing a young couple.
Part III, "Dream Fugue, Founded on the Preceding Theme of Sudden Death," is devoted to De Quincey's opium dreams and reveries that elaborated on the elements of Parts I and II, the mail coaches, the near accident, national victory and grief. Beginning with a quotation from Paradise Lost and a clarion "Tumultuosissimamente", the author introduces their theme of sudden death, and relates five dreams or visions of intense and exalted emotion and radiant language.
I — At sea, a great English man-of-war encounters a graceful pinnace filled with young women, including one mysterious, recurring, archetypal figure from the narrator's visionary experience.
II — In a storm at sea, the man-of-war nearly collides with a frigate, the mysterious woman clinging among its shrouds.
III — At dawn, the narrator follows the woman along a beach, only to see them overwhelmed by shifting sands.
IV — The narrator finds themselves borne with others in a "triumphal car," racing miles through the night as "restless anthems, and Te Deums reverberated from the choirs and orchestras of earth." The "secret word" — "Waterloo and Recovered Christendom!" — passes before them. The car enters an enormous cosmic cathedral; with three blasts from a Dying Trumpeter, the mysterious female reappears with a spectre of death and their "better angel," their face hidden in their wings.
V — With "heart-shattering music" from the "golden tubes of the organ," the cathedral is filled with re-awakened "Pomps of life." The living and the dead sing to God, and the woman enters "the gates of the golden dawn...."
A "Postscript" concludes the whole and provides a conceptual frame for "This little paper," the unique literary artifact that precedes it.
The English Mail-Coach is one of De Quincey's endeavors at writing what they called "impassioned prose," like their Confessions of an English Opium-Eater and Suspiria de Profundis. De Quincey had originally intended The English Mail-Coach to be one part of the Suspiria.
Its literary quality and its unique nature have made The English Mail-Coach a central focus of De Quincey scholarship and criticism.

A Ngulu is an execution sword used by the Bantu peoples (including the Ngombe, Doko, Ngala, etc.) of the Congo Basin.
Uses
It resembles the Khopesh, the sickle-sword of ancient Egypt, except that it has a much more massive blade, made of iron, with a non-cutting back and a semi-circular concavity. The handle, often surrounded by metal wire, ended with two large wooden buttons and a smaller one. It could be one or two blades and was used for capital executions by beheading (the condemned was kept seated, head extended and attached to a branch).
History
The Ngulu beheading was forbidden by the Belgians during the Free State of Congo period (1885-1908). The weapon, deprived of its function, took an even stronger symbolic and ceremonial value. From the 20th century, the Ngulu was worn during the ritual dance known as Likbeti, at the end of which the weapon was used to decapitate a goat whose flesh was then consumed by the whole tribe.

Rugby union in Cornwall (before 1900) is a timeline of rugby union in Cornwall in the 19th century.
History
Richard Carew in their Survey of Cornwall (1602) gives some laws of a game which has similarities to rugby.
"Two bushes are pitched in the ground eight or twelve feet asunder, directly against which at a distance of ten or twelve yards apart two more bushes in like manner, which are called goals.
″The hurlers to goal are bound to observe these orders or Laws:″
″In contending for the ball, if a man's body touches the ground, and they cry Hold and delivers the ball, they are not to be further pressed.″ (the mark)
″That the hurler must deal no foreball, or throw it to any partner standing nearer the goal than himself.″ (the forward pass)
″In dealing the ball, if any of the adverse party can catch it flying .... the property of it is thereby transferred to the catching party; and so the assailants become defendants, and the defendants assailants.″ (the interception)
″A breach made in any of these Articles is motive sufficient for the hurlers going together by the ears; nor do any seek to take revenge but in the same matter.″ (the scrum).
Before 1900, rugby union in Cornwall was referred to as football and what is known today as football was then called ″association″ or soccer. Before the formation of the Cornwall RFU in 1883, the press did not consistently record rugby matches so it is uncertain when it was first played in Cornwall. The first recorded rugby match in Penzance is from 1870, played in the grounds of Poltair House, Heamoor and organised by W Borlase of Marlborough School. The Penzance team was mostly public schoolboys, home on holiday, and their opponents, the Eastern Telegraph Company was based in Porthcurno. In Penryn, before 1872 a team made up of workers from Freeman's granite yard played a team from Sara's Foundry in a field near the Cross Keys hotel. In the main, rugby was mainly confined to the western half of Cornwall, from Penzance in the west to Truro in the east.

County Championship
The County Championship was reorganised with the fifteen teams divided into three groups. The first-placed teams of the South-eastern and South-western Divisions met in a play-off match, with the winners playing the first-placed team of the Northern Division in the final. Yorkshire won the competition for the seventh time defeating Surrey in the final. This was the third system of the County Championship.
Cornwall lost all three matches, and since their first match in 1892 have lost all eleven matches.
Cornish Rugby League
Throughout the season The Cornishman published a league table of the first two matches between six clubs. Only Penzance and Camborne completed all their fixtures and Truro only played five matches. Penzance was in first place and Redruth in second place.
At the end of the season a second table was published, of matches between the top four clubs with Redruth in first place and Penzance in second place. 'Impartial' the rugby reporter declared Redruth ″may fairly again claim the honour of being champions″.

Robert Bobroczkyi, alternatively anglicized as Robert Bobroczky and originally Róbert Bobróczky in Hungarian (born 17 July 2000), is a Romanian college basketball player of Hungarian descent. Standing , they have drawn attention for their exceptional height. After moving to the United States in 2016 and attending high school in Geneva, Ohio, they currently attend and plays for Rochester University in Rochester Hills, Michigan.
Early life
Bobróczky was born in Arad, Romania, the son of tall Hungarian-born Romanian international basketball player Zsigmond Bobróczky, who competed alongside Gheorghe Mureșan, and Brunhilde, a former volleyball and handball player, . At age eight they were taller than their mother, at tall, and by the age of 12 they reached a height of , surpassing their father. As such, they were taller than Robert Wadlow was from the ages 8 to 13 years. They have been the subject of medical studies nearly their entire life, leading to the prevailing opinion that their height is a result of healthy genetics (i.e. familial or constitutional tall stature), not a hormonal disease or overgrowth syndrome. Bobróczky weighed just during their high school basketball debut in January 2017, and with a height of , they were considered underweight, with a Body mass index (BMI) of 16.1.
Career
Youth
In 2014, Bobróczky was recruited by A.S. Stella Azzurra, an amateur-level basketball club based in Italy that produced NBA power forward Andrea Bargnani. A scouting report on them noted that Bobróczky possessed an improved midrange jumper and passing ability, and their physical attributes made them an obvious mismatch against any of their opponents. Like most players of their stature however, Bobróczky was limited by their lack of muscle mass, endurance, and mobility on the court. Their tremendously awkward gait and threat of exhaustion forced Bobróczky to play limited minutes after helping the team win its under-15 championship title. Despite their limitations, Bobróczky became an internet sensation in early 2016, as videos surfaced of them dominating much shorter competition during a game with Stella Azzurra.
High school
In 2016, Bobróczky moved to Geneva, Ohio, in the United States to attend the prep school SPIRE Institute and Academy. Entering their first-year student season, Bobróczky was put on a minutes restriction as they attempted to bulk up their physique for a transition into faster, more physical American basketball. On 14 January 2017, Bobróczky made their debut for SPIRE Institute. they were attending the nearby Grand River Academy.
In July 2020, Bobróczky committed to Rochester University, which spelled their surname as "Bobroczkyi" on their roster.
College
They returned to Romania shortly after classes began due to the COVID-19 pandemic in fall 2020 but returned in fall 2021, again with the spelling "Bobroczkyi" on the Warrior roster.
Personal life
As a high school senior, Bobróczky wore US size 17 shoes and had a inseam.
Bobróczky speaks Romanian, Hungarian, English, Serbian, and Italian.

Jakaranda was a pop group consisting of Kenny Wong, Allison DiNonno, and Jacqueline "Jackie" Siebert which performed from 1997 to 1998. In the summer of 1998 Kenny Wong was replaced by Ronnie Davidson. The group was a part of Crave Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment (Japan), which ceased operations in 1998. The group had moderate attention upon the release of the Disney remake The Parent Trap, where their single "Never Let You Go" was featured. A similar version of "Never Let You Go" was made by Dario G, an English dance music group in 1997 titled "Sunchyme". It reached No. 2 in the UK singles chart in 1997. The original theme for both these songs was taken from the 1985 song "Life in a Northern Town" by The Dream Academy.
One album was produced before Crave was shut down and the group split thereafter.

James C. Mitchell (1810-1860) was an early settler of Bellevue, Iowa and went on to the found the town of Florence in the Nebraska Territory in 1854.
Biography
Born in Pangborn, Pennsylvania, in the year 1810, Mitchell left home at the age of fifteen to become a seaman. By age eighteen, they were captain of the Lyden and the Lady Washington, ships which sailed between New York City and Liverpool, England. In 1836, Mitchell married Eliza Krosnick-Vandenberg (b. 1809), the South African widow of a Royal Navy chaplain who was lost at sea. Until 1838, Mitchell lived in England with their wife and their step-daughter Hannah Vandenberg.
In 1840 James C. Mitchell moved with their family to Bellevue, Iowa, where they worked as an Indian Commissioner. They and their wife adopted J. Ann Floyd to be their daughter. While in Bellevue, Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell ran a store that sold dry, wet, and grocery goods. Mitchell saw some hard times in Bellevue, including being indicted for running an illegal gambling house and being sued several times on account of debt. Toward the end of their time in Iowa, J. C. Mitchell signed the temperance pledge, a copy of which was published in the Jackson County Democrat on Friday, September 21, 1849.
As the '49 Gold Rush hit and folks started moving west, James C. Mitchell and hs family moved west, as well, to Council Bluffs, where they owned and operated two very successful stores. Mitchell was enchanted with the ida of the transcontinental railroad as a way to help their fellow midwesterners receive some of the bounty they had observed during a brief sojourn to the gold country in California. Following the advice of Peter A. Sarpy, Mitchell bought the land where the abandoned Mormon settlement of Cutler's Park stood, platting and settling in the new village of Florence, work that he, their team, and their family accomplished between 1853 and 1855. As they sighted the town, they had in mind its being a perfect location for a bridge crossing the river. The name of the town is said to been in honor of Florence Kilbourn, a niece of Mrs. Mitchell's.
Mitchell thought the town would be the Nebraska Territory's Capitol and in 1854 co-founded the Nebraska Winter Quarters Company, which became the Florence Land Company in 1855. Mitchell themselves owned 277 lots in Florence and was very active in real estate in both Florence and Columbus, Nebraska. Mitchell joined the first board of the Bank of Florence in 1856.
Mitchell died in Florence in 1860.
Role in the Bellevue War
James C. Mitchell was a prominent citizen in the early days of Bellevue, Iowa. They are, in fact, instrumental in the factional tensions that led up to the final confrontation of what is commonly known as the Bellevue War in 1840. For many, a man named James Thompson was the visible leader of a band of criminals and the rough citizens who supported them, while Mitchell was the local leader of the law-and-order faction. The two had more than one angry altercation, filled with threats. At on occasion, Thompson went so far as to call Mitchell a, "Marked Man," and to threaten their safety, should they ever encounter one another alone.
The rivalry between Thompson's faction and Mitchell's came to ahead on January 8, 1840, the evening of a Jackson Day ball in Bellevue. Accounts are conflicting as to the details, but the essential facts are this: while Mitchell and most of their group were busy at the ball, Thompson and one or two other men raided Mitchell's house. While there, Thompson attempted to assault a young woman who had stayed back from the celebrations. When news reached Mitchell of this outrage, they armed themselves and went looking for Thompson. Thompson knew that they were now the marked man, and they went looking for Mitchell. When they found one another, both men fired, but Thompson's gun failed. Mitchell's shot struck home and killed Thompson almost instantly.
Mitchell holed up in the hotel where the ball was being held and their wife, their family, and their friends fought off would-be attacks from vengeful friends of Thompson. W. W. Brown took charge of the groups and negotiated a tense peace with Sheriff W. A. Warren. Mitchell was locked up in their own house under guard on Warren's guarantee. Thompson's friends did not trust the justice system to avenge the killing and so they made an attempt to blow up Mitchell's house and kill them and their family, but the plot was foiled by a turncoat member of their gang.
For better or worse, Mitchell remained under house confinement for some time after that. On April 1, 1840, Sheriff Warren helped to lead a citizens' charge on W. W. Brown's hotel, the culmination of Mitchell's law-and-order work. Mitchell asked to participate and Warren did not permit it, but they did give the prisoner arms in case they were attacked during the violence, since they had yet to face trial for the killing of Thompson and Brown's men were none too happy about that.
Mitchell was finally indicted for manslaughter on April 17, 1840 and released on bail with the security assurances of several of their companions. They were tried and found not guilty on June 19, 1840.
Claims
Mitchell owned several claims and ran numerous enterprises throughout the Territory. They included Elk Horn and Loup Fork Ferry and Bridge Company, the Winter Quarter Ferry, land once owned by the Council Buffs and Nebraska Ferry Company along the Missouri River, the Columbus Company, the steam ferry boat Nebraska No. 2, and the Florence Bridge Company.
Politics
James C. Mitchell served on a credentialing committee in the early territorial legislature of Nebraska. Mitchell served in the First Territorial Council and cast the vote that gave the early capital to Omaha, despite their own town of Florence's being under consideration. In order to secure their vote, Mitchell was appointed the sole commissioner for the new capitol building and granted an enlargement for their Douglas County land interests. They ultimately selected a site on High School Hill, where Central High School now stands.

Kaladesh is a Magic: The Gathering expansion block consisting of the sets Kaladesh and Aether Revolt. The block debuted with the release of Kaladesh on September 30, 2016. The block is set on the plane of Kaladesh, the original home of planeswalker Chandra Nalaar, and features an emphasis on artifacts, their creators and the magical aether which powers them.
Plot
The block focuses on a Steampunk aesthetic, with the steam replaced by the powerful material aether. The Gatewatch go to Chandra Nalaar's home world, the titular plane of Kaladesh, where they find their mother (presumed dead) and almost kills Tezzeret. Tezzeret later kidnaps Rashmi, winner of the famous Inventor's Fair, and begins a dastardly plot to control the ruling Consulate. With the Consulate imprisoning inventors and confiscating their devices following the Fair, tensions between the populace and the government reach a boiling point, as depicted in Aether Revolt.
Mechanics
On August 25, 2016, Mark Rosewater stated on their blog that Kaladesh's non-evergreen mechanics will be all-new. The block has three new mechanics present in both sets, revealed at PAX West 2016.
Energy: A new type of persistent counter that players can obtain and spend to pay certain costs on cards, such as . According to head designer Mark Rosewater, this mechanic was attempted before in Mirrodin and Alara as Esper's mechanic before being refined for Kaladesh.
Vehicles: A new artifact subtype with the "Crew" ability. To pay for a cost of Crew X, a player may tap any number of untapped creatures with total power X or greater to turn that Vehicle into an artifact creature until end of turn. One example of this is in the card .
Fabricate: A keyword appearing on creature cards. When a creature with Fabricate X enters the battlefield, its controller may either put X +1/+1 counters on it or create X 1/1 Servo artifact creature tokens, as seen on .

Art book
The Art of Magic: The Gathering – Kaladesh (2017) by James Wyatt was published by VIZ Media in January 2017. Jay Annelli, for CoolStuffInc, wrote that Kaladesh "was the first new plane to get an art book, and the first to forego a Planeswalker's Guide because of the art books. Because the Kaladesh block focused on Ghirapur, the city where the Inventors' Fair was happening, the book likewise focuses on the central city. [...] Where I would describe the Zendikar and Innistrad books as horizontal, encompassing a wide breadth of information about their respective planes, Kaladesh's art book has a much more vertical approach, with a lot of depth on the singular city of Ghirapur". Lauren Orsini, for Forbes, highlighted that the 240 paged book features the artwork of 95 artists. Orsini wrote, "the Kaladesh artbook fills us in on the rich history of the plane, and why today's political struggles are directly tied to events a hundred years ago. Though they differ in strategies, each faction in Aether Revolt wants the same thing—a steady supply of aether for the people's use. [...] I read the Kaladesh art book before I even played with the new set of Magic cards. It's the first time I've done this, and I think it improved my game. By understanding the connections between the elements of the Kaladesh world, I drew connections between various cards that I'd never considered before. For example, the art book showed me that in the lore, dwarves who inhabit Kaladesh are known for their skill with flying vehicles. So I created a deck heavy on both with creatures like Depala, Pilot Exemplar and vehicles like Aethersphere Harvester".
Cameron Kunzelman, for Paste, highlighted that "from a practical perspective, the work that the Magic Creative team does is pretty spectacular. They begin with a set of material preconceptions about the world, like Kaladesh's natural resource of aether, and then build out from there in order to understand what kinds of historical conditions might exist within those confines. [...] There's something wonderful about the inventors of Kaladesh living in the Venn diagram space of where Silicon Valley libertarians and hardcore Marxists both want us to be: people interacting with the world on their own terms and finding their own fulfillment while helping out others implicitly. There's a bit of solarpunk optimism in there that I find refreshing after coming off of two Magic stories where entire worlds were wrecked by Lovecraftian horrors".
Kaladesh Remastered
Kaladesh Remastered is a reprint of the Kaladesh block exclusively for MTG Arena; it was released in November 2020. Eric Hillery, for Bleeding Cool, wrote that "featuring selected reprints from Kaladesh and Aether Revolt — with each card being new to Arena — this set brings back three planeswalkers who've been on hiatus since War of the Spark, three other active members of the Gatewatch, and, of course, a litany of new mechanics and interactions. [...] The bottom line: if you haven't played through Kaladesh before, or if you're ready for a fresh re-imagining in Arena, enjoy! Especially to players looking for formats outside of Standard, Kaladesh Remastered is certainly worth a few gems and wildcards". Jamie Lovett, for ComicBook.com, reported that similar to the Amonkhet Remastered set, "Kaladesh Remastered is designed with limited play in mind. [...] Like the Amonkhet block sets, Kaladesh and Aether Revolt debuted in Magic: The Gathering Arena during the game's closed beta testing phase but were removed before the game went into open beta. The Magic: The Gathering Arena team has long stated that it hoped to eventually return those lost beta sets to the game, and this year they're making good on that idea".
Reception
The Kaladesh Booster won the Origins Award for "Fan Favorite Collectible Game of 2016".
Kyle Chapman, reviewing the Kaladesh set for Ars Technica, wrote "Even without looking at any of the cards from this new set, the packaging and promotional material makes a tone shift very clear; colour, celebration, and creation jump out at you immediately. [...] The designers have blended classic steampunk elements (protruding, brutal machinery) with fantasy tropes (elves, gremlins, and the first Magic dwarves in just under a decade). [...] Compared to last year's weird Eldrazi cards, the mechanics may seem straightforward, but there are enough puzzles in both deckbuilding and play to keep experienced players engaged, whilst being less intimidating to newer players. This is pushed further by the synergies in the block that go unnamed (mainly around artifacts), adding yet another layer to consider". Chapman also highlighted that the set must balance story development for both the plane of Kaladesh and for the Gatewatch members; so given the random nature of booster packs and the limited flavor text on cards, "one of the problems that has always plagued Magic is the difficulty of communicating the full narrative of the set. To help address this, a new 'Story Spotlight' marker appears on five cards in Kaladesh that depict some of the major events, each with a link to a website with short stories that Wizards of the Coast have been publishing in the lead-up to the set's release".
Cameron Kunzelman, reviewing the Kaladesh block for Paste, commented that it is an "artifact block" with a focus on artifact cards and themes of machinery. As a result, Kunzelman highlighted that "deck builders flocked" to specific artifact cards during the Kaladesh set "in order to generate very fast, very efficient and very splashy win conditions for their decks" with the various strategies boiling down to: "Get your artifact on the battlefield and execute your plan quickly. These strategies were dominant in casual and competitive play, and many of them won so quickly that a slight misplay on the part of an opponent would mean that they had no chance of recovering. It was not, as they say, 'fun.' Aether Revolt, the newly-released second half of the Kaladesh block, is an answer to Kaladesh in many ways. [...] However, due to various problems, each of these ways of playing the game are impacted in a negative way with Aether Revolt. Playing constructed Magic leaves you playing against powerful artifacts in some games, hyper-synergistic giant creatures, or a literal infinite combo in others. Playing any kind of limited game, which encompasses Sealed and Draft play, means that you are always at the mercy of a player who opens a more powerful artifact than you". Kunzelman would not recommend this block to new or returning players given the swingy nature of play and "lack of clear synergies".
Kyle Chapman, reviewing the Aether Revolt set for Ars Technica, commented that while there are swingy cards in this set, they're also "very risky" to use. Chapman wrote that "AER takes Kaladesh's strengths and pushes them even further, with deep strategy available in both deck construction and in-game decisions, and an especially promising Limited environment. The complexity is at breaking point, but it's so well-managed it still works—the mechanics are easy to explain and grasp, the basics have already been taught in Kaladesh, and there are seed cards for teaching newer players how to use cards together for potent combos. [...] Kaladesh has been one of the most fun drafting formats in recent years, and we expect AER Limited to be similar, whilst putting a new spin on how to approach the Kaladesh cards". Chapman also highlighted that Story Spotlights have continued for this set and "after a 2016 for Magic that was generally darker and edgier in tone, it's good to see that this world hasn't gone grimdark. AER manages to focus on conflict whilst still hitting the bright themes of Kaladesh: colour, ornateness, and most uniquely, the passion of invention and creation. [...] The split between Magic's player base is something to be embraced—long-form fluff for those that are interested, thematic reinforcement of mood for the less interested—but over the course of the Kaladesh block, it's fallen a little short of the right balance".

They are known for documenting the war in Syria, the military coup in Egypt, the war in Yemen, and for being the first to bring international audiences proof in pictures of human trafficking and slavery in Libya.
Narciso's work has been exhibited in galleries, museums and photo festivals in Europe, Asia, the USA and Mexico. At the Saatchi Gallery in London their exhibition “Libya: a human marketplace" ranked the most visited exhibition in photojournalism in the world in 2017, and 3rd in Photography category with more than 520,000 visitors.
Biography
Narciso Contreras was born on July 1, 1975 in Mexico City. Their father, a professor in philosophy, started teaching them from childhood at the age of eight, driving them to study philosophy at a later time at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM –Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico). Their interest in documentary cinema lead them to apply to study cinematography, but they were rejected from entering the two most prestigious schools in Mexico after failing the photography test during the selection process of applicants. They went on to study photography at the Active School of Photography (EAF – Escuela Activa de Fotografia) and simultaneously visual anthropology at the National School of Anthropology and History (ENAH –Escuela Nacional de Antropologia e Historia) in Mexico City. After graduating from photography they began doing non-paid assignments for local newspapers and started publishing their first reports.
While studying Hinduism at university, they came into contact with Gaudiya Vaishnava monks. This encounter brought about change in their life with them moving to live in a monastery in Vrindavan, India to continue their studies. While there they photographed spiritual communities in the north and the influence of Maoism on the religious society of Nepal combining both of their most profound interests: photography and philosophy.
In 2010, after closing this period and motivated by unfolding events in the region they decided to move to Thailand to the border with Myanmar where they started working on documenting the ethnic war along the tribal areas in the country's Karen and Kachin States. This was the beginning of their career as professional photographer. The ethnic war in Myanmar and the separatist strife in the Kashmir region controlled by India were the first stories of conflict they documented. They first joined Zuma Press agency, and then moved to the New York based agency, Polaris Images.
In July 2012, Contreras makes their first incursion into the Middle East, covering the war in Syria. Their pictures depicting the horrors of the war and the carnage over the civilian population were significant, and in some cases, unforgettable. When covering the war in Syria they started collaborating as stringer with the AP agency, a partnership that ended a year later after a controversy over a doctored photograph was made public.
In July 2013, they were assigned to cover the military coup in Egypt for The New York Times among other assignments for different media outlets in the term of the next two years, counting in their records the political upheavals in Istanbul in 2013, the war in Gaza in 2014, and the tribal conflict in Libya in the same year.
Aside from photographing some of the major events in the Middle East they also aimed to document underreported yet crucial affairs in the region lifting their camera to photograph in July 2015 one of the most controversial unfolding wars in the region's recent history, the entangled war in Yemen. They succeeded to contribute to the documentation of the humanitarian catastrophe in the Arab country being one among a few foreign correspondents to enter since the war started.
With support from the Fondation Carmignac, after winning the Carmignac Photojournalism Award in November 2015, Contreras brought to light “Libya: a human marketplace”, A report that narrates their thoughts and observations as they travelled through the complex tribal society of post-Gaddafi Libya from February to June 2016, photographing the brutal reality of human trafficking. It was the dawn of a long-term project documenting a modern-day slavery issue framed on the trafficking of human beings along the network that stretches from the Niger border with Libya, to the main rescue zone in the Mediterranean Sea, off the Libyan shoreline.
It became a cornerstone of their current work focused on migration as part of a life project of photographic documentation based on the world conceived phenomenon of “massive human displacement”.
Contreras works on self-assigned projects as freelance photographer as from the beginning of their career, initially more focused on news stories but more recently veering towards in-depth feature story and documentary-type projects.
They received the recognition title of HIPGiver in 2017 from Hispanics in Philanthropy for their contribution in photography.
Incident with Associated Press
Contreas was sacked by the Associated Press in 2014 for digitally manipulating an image in violation of the AP's rules. They had shared a Pulitzer prize the previous year for their work for the AP in the Syrian conflict. They had digitally altered an image to remove a video camera from the corner of the frame. Contreas said "I made a horrible mistake and I accept full responsibility for it." They insisted that they had not altered any other images, and a review by the AP of the nearly 500 photographs they had submitted to them did not reveal any other examples.
Contreras brought back in 2016, with the help of the Carmignac Photojournalism Award, a photojournalism grant which supports each year the production of an investigative photographic report on a region of the world where fundamental rights are threatened, the first proofs of slavery in Libya.

Bongani Michael Baloyi (born 28 February 1987) is a South African politician. In 2013, they were elected Executive Mayor of the Midvaal Local Municipality. They were only 26 years old at the time, and they consequently became the youngest mayor in South Africa. From 2011 to 2013, they were the MMC for Development and Planning in the municipality. Baloyi is a member of ActionSA since January 2022.
Early life and education
Baloyi was born on 28 February 1987 in the Thokoza township outside Alberton in the East Rand. They took an interest in politics at a young age. Their grandmother is an active member of the African National congresswomen's League. In 1999, they and their newly-divorced mother Patricia, an entrepreneur, and two siblings moved to Daleside, Meyerton. Baloyi has two uncompleted degrees: one in accounting and another one in Business Administration, which they plan to complete in 2022.
Political career
Baloyi became a member of the Democratic Alliance in 2005. They were a member of the Vaal Region Executive Committee, the Provincial Executive Committee and the Federal Council. They were a participant of the DA's Young Leaders Programme.
In 2011, they were elected as a proportional representation councillor of the Midvaal municipality and became the MMC for Development and Planning. Incumbent mayor Timothy Nast resigned in July 2013 following their appointment to the Gauteng Planning Commission. Baloyi was chosen as their successor and took office on 29 August 2013. They won a full term as mayor in August 2016.
Under Baloyi's leadership, Midvaal achieved seven consecutive unqualified audits. The municipality went from being the 16th best-performing municipality in 2013 to the 5th best in the national rankings. In March 2020, they announced that they would not seek another term as mayor in 2021. Baloyi had been mentioned as a possible DA leadership candidate. Their term as Executive Mayor came to an end on 1 November 2021.
On 20 December 2021, Baloyi announced on their Twitter account that they had resigned from the DA to pursue other opportunities. They said that they had left out of their "own agency" and denied that they were being purged.
Joining ActionSA
On January 24, 2022 Baloyi joined ActionSA. They did not join out of anger or hatred, instead they joined for the hope of ActionSA. Baloyi said that they have applied to be the party's premier candidate in the 2024 provincial election. In an interview with the Sunday Times in late-January 2022, Baloyi said that they had left the DA because the DA became "extremely toxic" after former party leader Helen Zille was elected chairperson of the party's Federal Council in October 2019.
Incidents
Baloyi and an ANC member were arrested on 29 September 2018 after laying assault charges against one another, following an incident at an Arbor Day event in Savannah City. They were released on bail and their assault case was later withdrawn.

Leo Faller "Deed" Harris (June 6, 1876 – May 28, 1961) was an American sportsman who coached, scouted, and refereed football, baseball, and basketball. In 1917, they were the last coach of the Carlisle Indians football team. J.S. Steckbeck states that the team was forced to travel far off the Carlisle Barracks campus for practice because of a measles epidemic, lost practice time, and the result was that the team closed the season with 2 wins and 7 loses. In reality, the poor season was likely the inexperienced and young players. Pop Warner visited Carlisle in September of 1917 to help prepare the squad and commented "not to expect great things from the team" and a "great football team cannot be developed in one season."
It is unknown how the nickname "Deed" originated but it was used by J.S. Steckbeck in their book Fabulous Redmen. Harris is incorrectly referred to as "D.D. Harris" in Anderson's book Carlisle vs. Army. Harris was called a local “football authority” due to their involvement in coaching, refereeing, and scouting.
Harris married into sports when they wed Irene Smith on June 5, 1909. Irene Smith was from a prominent Harrisburg, Pennsylvania family. Irene's brother was Harvey Smith, a noted surgeon in Harrisburg. Harvey Smith played infield on the Bucknell University baseball team for three seasons and for the Washington Senators during the 1896 season. Smith is credited with discovering future hall of fame pitcher Christy Mathewson, another Bucknell alumnus. Harris' other brother-in-law was Paul G. Smith, who coached football and baseball for Bucknell University in 1908. In 1909, Smith coached football at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. While Smith worked as an attorney and judge, they coached football part-time at Central High School in Harrisburg and refereed. Harris was Smith's assistant coach at Central High School.
Pop Warner used Harris as an assistant coach and scout for the Carlisle Indian Industrial School's football program between 1907 and 1914, and according to Steckbeck, Harris accompanied the team on its trips. Harris and Warner maintained a close friendship until Warner's death in 1954. Harris also scouted for football programs at the University of Pittsburgh, Temple, Navy, and Penn State.

The Second Battle of Katwa occurred between the Bengal and Maratha Empire in December 1745. After the defeats of the Marathas in the first four invasions of Bengal (see Maratha invasions of Bengal), the Maratha General and ruler of Nagpur, Raghuji Bhonsle again invaded the territory of Bengal. Bhonsle, with 20,000 horsemen attacked the civilians of Murshidabad and moved onwards to Katwa. However they were repeatedly ambushed by peasant guerillas and militias in Birbhum and near Durgapur, and thus their column was thinned considerably. The Marathas met Alivardi Khan's army in Katwa where the battle started. During the battle, most of the Marathas were slaughtered and the remaining Maratha soldiers under Raghuji Bhonsle retreated from Katwa. The Marathas then retreated towards Medinipur. The battle was a victory for Alivardi Khan who had once again ousted the Marathas from East Bengal. After this battle, Alivardi Khan was known in Bengal as "Maratha-khuni" which translates to "Maratha-killer" in Bengali.

Reading Borough Libraries are responsible for public library provision in the English town of Reading, Berkshire.
History
Despite the Public Libraries Act 1850 it was not until the 1870s that serious thought was given to the creation of a free public library in Reading. Reading Borough Council could not agree to raise the rate necessary to fund a library and as a result in 1875 William Isaac Palmer, of the Huntley & Palmers biscuit firm decided to personally fund the setting up and running of a Free Library in West Street. This proved very popular and won over opponents of free libraries, leading to the adoption of the Public Libraries Act in Reading in 1877 and the beginning of the library service.
While the contents of Reading Free Library were donated by Palmer to the borough, it was decided that a new building was needed. A new library was included in the plans drawn up in 1879 for an extension to the Reading Town Hall which would also include a new museum (later to become the Museum of Reading). This new Library opened in October 1882 and soon proved very popular.
In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, responsibility for library services was transferred to Berkshire County Council, which was itself abolished in 1996 as part of a local government reform, and the functions returned to the borough council.
Gradually library provision extended throughout Reading with the building of more libraries in other parts of the town. Today the library service has seven branches and also runs the library service in Reading Remand Centre.

Joyson Safety Systems (JSS), formerly known as Key Safety Systems (KSS) is an American company owned by Chinese Investors, that develops and manufactures automotive safety systems. The company is a result of KSS purchasing troubled Japanese airbag company Takata Corporation. It is owned jointly by Joyson group (China) and PAG capital (Hong Kong). The company headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States. Globally, the company has 50,000 employees who work in 32 plants and technical centers worldwide. The current JSS Executive Director and President is Tao Liu.
JSS is owned by Ningbo Joyson Electronic, described as a "Chinese automotive conglomerate" that acquired Key Safety Systems in 2016 for $920 million. The combined sales of both companies are more than $3 billion. Ningbo Joyson Electronic competed against other large companies in the industry including Autoliv and Daicel to acquire Takata.
History
Origins as Breed Automotive Corporation
JSS was initially founded as Breed Corporation in 1961 by Allen K. Breed as a defense-oriented producer of ammunition components, including mortar fuses. In 1968 Breed Corporation, using their fuse technology developed an electromechanical airbag sensor. The sensor was not widely used until mid-1980s when the United States government had a federal mandate for passive restraint systems. Following Breed Corporation's success in developing the first automotive crash sensor in 1984, the airbag sensor part of the corporation was spun off as its own corporation in 1986 as Breed Automotive Corporation (BAC).
In 1991, the United States Congress decreed that all new cars must be equipped with airbags by 1997. In the same year, BAC changed its name to Breed Technologies, Inc (BTI) and went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November 1992. In 1997, Allen Breed retired as CEO, but continued to serve the company as Chairman Emeritus until their death in December 1999. Breed's wife, Johnnie Breed, would take over as CEO.
Between the years of 1994 and 1998, BTI had spent $1.1 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) to acquire 11 different companies attempting to expand BTI's influence in the automotive component market. Once such acquisition in 1997, was the company called AlliedSignal. AlliedSignal established a major presence in the automotive safety restraint market through its Safety Restraints (SRS) operations. The firm was the only supplier of automotive seatbelts and airbags at the time that had complete vertical operations, from fiber extrusion through finished product. SRS Plant in Knoxville performing all fabric weaving and finishing operations for airbag and seatbelt fabrics while SRS plants in Maryville and Greenville performed the cutting, sewing and final assembly of components. Which were then delivered to customers such as General Motors, Suzuki and Chrysler Corp. among others.
In September 1999, BTI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a result of the massive debt it took on to acquire those companies, and the fiscal losses it faced in 1998.
Renamed to Key Safety Systems
In April 2003, BTI was bought by Carlyle Management Group (CMG) for between $300 and $315 million. CMG moved BTI's headquarters from Lakeland, Florida to Sterling Heights, Michigan. In September 2003, CMG announced that BTI would be renamed to Key Safety Systems (KSS). The name change was to show KSS's unification with CMG's other affiliates under the Key Automotive Group brand.
KSS continued to operate under Key Automotive Group until it was acquired by the Chinese-based company, Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corporation (“Joyson Electronics”) in early 2016, for $920 million. The companies' combined sales worldwide were equal to $3 billion at the time of the purchase.
Takata acquisition
In June 2017 Takata Corporation, an airbag manufacturer, filed for bankruptcy in the United States and Japan due to lawsuits and large product recalls for unsafe airbags (with faulty airbag inflators) which the company sold to major automotive manufacturers. KSS acquired the remaining Takata assets for about $1.6 billion.
Renamed to Joyson Safety Systems
Following the antitrust clearance and bankruptcy court approvals in various countries, on April 11, 2018, KSS announced the completion of its acquisition of Takata, and changed its name to Joyson Safety Systems.

Meltdown is an isometric action-adventure game for the Amstrad CPC published by Alligata in 1986. There are two versions: a 64k version with basic speech synthesis and a 128k version featuring much more speech synthesis. A version was also released in French called Le Syndrome.
Gameplay
The player has to navigate three mazes from the 1st floor down to the 3rd floor of a nuclear reactor to prevent a nuclear meltdown. There are eight computer terminals on each floor, the first allowing access to previous floors. Six of the terminals provide access to a different game within a game which the player must win in order to get a password. Once all six passwords have been retrieved the eighth computer allows the player access to an end-of-level game which the player must complete before being allowed access to the next floor. Altogether there are 24 games (three isometric mazes, 18 sub-games and three end-of-level games) which must be completed to win the whole game. The final game is a text-input only robot system for adjusting the control rods of the reactor so it won't explode.

In 1899 there were only 13 Chinese men in Edmonton, one restaurant and two laundries, about half lived in Strathcona. By the early 1900s a small Chinatown began to emerge after several Chinese merchants arrived to establish their businesses at the intersection of Namayo Street (contemporary 97 Street) and Rice Street (contemporary 101A Avenue). By 1911 the original 13 Chinese people residing in Edmonton had swelled to 154 (150 males, 4 females) and by 1921 it increased further to 518 (501 males, 17 females). From covering an area of 3 city blocks in 1911 (bounded by Jasper and Elizabeth Avenue as well as Fraser and Namayo Street, to expanding eastward as far as Kinistino Street (Modern 95 Street). Despite this substantial increase in size of the Chinese community, the Chinese people still only accounted for 1% of Edmonton's population.
In 1911, some 150 Chinese happily greeted the Xinhai Revolution by cutting off their queues and celebrating, though Sun Yat Sen did not visit Edmonton, they did visit Calgary in February 1911. In 1913, when Sun left the government of Yuan Shikai, Chinese Edmontonians formed a "Dare to Die Brigade" to go to China and support him. Trained by Morris Cohen (also known as General Two-Gun Cohen) they never got the chance to go to China, as Sun fled to Japan. In 1914, at the start of the First World War the Dare to Die Brigade offered to go to Europe to fight, however their request was turned down and they were disbanded. When Dr. Sun Yat Sen died in 1925, a large memorial service was held in Edmonton.
Edmonton's Current Chinatown consists of two parts, Chinatown South is the older part, easily recognized by the presence of the Harbin Gate and other Chinese-themed street furniture. Chinatown North lies just to the north of its older counterpart. Chinatown North also includes a large Vietnamese presence and blends into the multicultural "Avenue of Nations" (107 Ave) which runs east-to-west along the northern edge of both Chinatown and Little Italy. The Edmonton Remand Centre located at 9660 - 104 Avenue is in the process of being closed and relocated to a new facility at 127 Street & 186 Avenue in early 2013. The facility will be turned over to Alberta Infrastructure to determine its future once it is vacated and decommissioned by corrections.
Chinatown & Little Italy Business Association
The smaller enclave of Little Italy lies just few blocks to the east of Chinatown. By the early 21st century, it had ceased to be an area of major Italian settlement but continues as a shopping district.

Eckhart Nickel (born 1966) is a German author and journalist.
Nickel was born in Frankfurt am Main. After studying art history and literature in Heidelberg and New York City, they worked at various media outlets including the German lifestyle magazine Tempo, Arte television in Strasbourg, and Architectural Digest. Their writings were published in the weekend editions of the Süddeutsche Zeitung and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. They were also editor-in-chief of the acclaimed literary magazine Der Freund, a collaboration with Swiss writer Christian Kracht (the magazine's publisher), which was created in Kathmandu and published from September 2004 to June 2006. From January to October 2007 they were in charge of lifestyle writing for the Saturday supplement of the Süddeutsche Zeitung.  They are a resident of Sonoma County, California.
At the start of their career Nickel was classified in the so-called "pop literature" genre of contemporary German writing; their works are chiefly concerned with the fate of modern man in a state of rebellion. Initially highly self-referential, one reviewer has noted a "more serious undertone" to their more recent works.

Mark Bailey (born 1962) is an American conductor and baroque violist.  They are the founder and artistic director of the American Baroque Orchestra. Bailey specializes in Slavic music of the 17th and 18th centuries, in addition to baroque, classical, and romantic repertoire, and is the current director of the Yale Russian Chorus. Bailey frequently guest conducts ensembles such as the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, Cappella Romana, The Portland Baroque Orchestra, and Pro Coro Canada. They often give presentations on Slavic baroque music and historical performance practice, and has been a principal guest speaker for the Great Performers series, the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center in New York City, the 2016 Musicking Conference at the University of Oregon, and the Indiana University International Performance Practice Conference.
Born and raised outside Rochester, New York, Bailey began their musical studies in viola and piano at an early age, and started singing through their involvement in the Eastman Children's Chorus. While concentrating in vocal performance and piano as an undergraduate, they began to study conducting with David Effron. As a graduate student they changed their focus to this field, studying conducting (and Liturgy and Russian) at Yale. Later they continued their conducting studies with Harold Farberman. Upon graduation Bailey worked as an assistant conductor while leaning toward Russian romantic and 20th century repertoire, opera, and Orthodox sacred music. In the 1990s they met baroque violinist Jaap Schröder, and began to study period performance practice.
In 2011, Bailey founded the American Baroque Orchestra (ABO), an authentic period instrument orchestra that performs throughout New England. The Summer of 2016 marks the inaugural Choral Festival of ABO, featuring works of Antonio Vivaldi and Jewish Baroque composer Salamone de Rossi, the latter reflecting the specialization of associate artistic director Kevin Sherwin. Bailey's former conducting positions have included artistic and music director of the New Haven Oratorio Choir and Orchestra, the Westchester Concert Singers, The New England Benefit Orchestra, and The Festival Chamber Orchestra at Yale. They were the assistant conductor of the Eastman Philharmonia, the opera department at the Eastman School of Music, and for the Heidelberg Castle Opera Festival in Heidelberg, Germany.
As a baroque violist, Bailey most recently founded the Musica Vera Duo in 2015, with guitarist and conductor Kevin Sherwin. Bailey has also appeared as a violist with the American Baroque Orchestra, the Arcadia Players, Schola Cantorum at Yale University, and The Sebastians. Their compositions and arrangements have been performed by Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra, which commissioned several works from Mr. Bailey for their 2011-2012 season opener, and other works of theirs have premiered at Lincoln Center, Yale University, Emmanuel Episcopal Church, Boston, and throughout the United States, as well as at St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, Russia. Approximately forty of their compositions have been published.
Bailey has won praise for their leadership of the Yale Russian chorus. Their first recording with the YRC in 1996 was placed on The New York Times critics' choice list and described as a must-have recording by National Public Radio's Performance Today. Mark Bailey's most recent recording, "Heart of Kyiv," is a compilation of Slavic works from the 17th and 18th centuries with Mr. Bailey leading Pro Coro Canada. Among the many outstanding reviews of Mr. Bailey's concerts, City Arts of Seattle wrote of the Rachmaninoff All-Night Vigil, "Bailey elicited expressive phrasing that enhanced every detail of the text's meaning" (September 2015). Another performance with Cappella Romana: "the choir followed Bailey's detailed, expressive direction with rapt focus…they sounded like one solitary living creature, the expansion and contraction of the music coming as naturally as breath" (Northwest Reverb).
From 1992 to 2008, Bailey served on the faculty of St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, New York, where they taught composition, analysis, choral leadership, and Church Slavonic. They also served on the conducting staff for the chapel choirs, and they founded the Composers Seminar at St. Vladimir's in 2007 and 2008. Bailey continues to teach and conduct Orthodox sacred music at various conferences and seminars throughout North America. They teach conducting and performance practice to a select number of students, and is a Fellow at Davenport College, Yale University.
Bailey is currently the Head of Historical Sound Recordings at Yale University. Outside of music, Mr. Bailey is extensively involved in animal welfare and, in 2013, was appointed as a Connecticut state commissioner for the Animal Welfare Task Force.

Politics
Throughout the 20th century, Bath County was overwhelmingly Democratic, only voting the other way in the Republican landslides of 1928, 1972, and 1984. However, in 2000, George W. Bush flipped the county into the Republican column. Bath County was one of the few counties in Kentucky to flip from Bush to Kerry in 2004. Despite Barack Obama's indomitable midwestern strength in 2008, Bath County was one of the small number of counties to flip from Kerry to McCain that year, although Obama lost it very narrowly. Now, like the rest of the counties in coal country, Bath county votes Republican in presidential elections; Donald Trump won over two-thirds of the vote here in 2016.
Despite the Republican devotion in presidential elections, Bath County still retains loyalty to local Democrats, as they voted for Andy Beshear over Matt Bevin in the 2019 gubernatorial election.

Wellington Street is a Lower City arterial road in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It starts off at Charlton Avenue East as a two-way street for only one block where it's then blocked off by the Corktown Park and a couple of Canadian National Railway lines that cut through it. It then starts up again north of the park on Young Street and is a one-way street the rest of the way (Southbound). It ends in the North End of the City on Burlington Street East, in front of the Lakeport Brewing Company and the Administration offices of the Hamilton Port Authority.
History
Originally Wellington Street was called Lovers' Lane.
The Hamilton General Hospital is major teaching hospital on the corners of Barton Street East and Wellington Street North in downtown Hamilton, Ontario that is affiliated with McMaster University. It is sometimes referred to as "HGH" and was founded in 1848.
The David Braley Cardiac, Vascular and Stroke Research Institute is a $90-million Research Centre that will be home to 500+ scientists and will be built right behind the Hamilton General Hospital. The new building with is expected to open in 2010. At least 250 new jobs will be added to the local economy. David Braley contributed $10-million towards the project. Braley's donation marks an important transition in Hamilton's economy, as they take money they made in the industrial economy and uses it to help the community develop a more diverse economic base. David Braley is the president of auto-parts manufacturer Orlick Industries Ltd., former owner of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and current owner of the B.C. Lions.
In 1856, the Daniel C. Gunn Engine Shop on Wellington Street North, produced the first Canadian-built locomotives. In 1976, First Place apartments, a seniors high rise at King and Wellington opened on the site of First United Church, which burned down in 1969.

John Angus Erskine (28 January 1873, Invercargill – 27 April 1960, Melbourne) was a New Zealand educated physicist, electrical engineer, benefactor and chess master.
Born in Invercargill, they were a son of Robert Erskine, who migrated from Scotland to Southland, New Zealand, at the age of 16. Jack was educated at South School, and became the first Southland youth to win a Junior Scholarship to the University of New Zealand in 1890. The next year, they chose to enrol at Canterbury College. They passed their final B.A. exams in 1893. With the start of the new term in April 1894, Ernest Rutherford and J.A. Erskine applied to use a basement room in which to carry out electrical experiments. It was here that Erskine investigated the magnetic screening of high-frequency oscillations by various metals, an offshoot of Rutherford's pioneering work. Results of their research appeared in the Transactions of the New Zealand Institute in 1895.
In 1896 Erskine won an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship and opted to study in Berlin at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat. In 1897, they and Rutherford holidayed together in Germany and year 1897 and part of 1898 Erskine was at the University of Leipzig. They then moved to London and spent 1899 and 1900 there, attending classes at University College and translating German works into English.
They took 11th place in the London 1899 chess tournament (second section won by Frank James Marshall).
Erskine returned to New Zealand, to shortly work as a boiler stoker, and then began working in industry, in the United States (1903–1904), and Australia (1905–1920). After 1920 they worked as a private consultant in Melbourne. They twice won New Zealand Chess Championship at Wellington 1928/29 (with a 100% score: 8/8) and Christchurch 1934/35.
Erskine Fellowship
Erskine bequeathed their estate to the University of Canterbury to be held in trust to fund international exchanges of academic staff. Each year, approximately 70 Erskine fellows travel to Christchurch for periods of up to three months (with travel and per diem allowance funded) and between 18 and 25 Canterbury academics are funded to travel to overseas institutions.

In landline telephony, a plant test number or exchange is a number or group of numbers reserved for use by telephone installers or other workers to perform routine tests on an individual telephone line. Most are unlisted numbers.
These include, but are not limited to:
Automatic number announcement circuit, a machine which announces the caller's own number
Loop around, a primitive conference call bridge
Milliwatt test, a standardised 1004 Hz, zero dBm sinusoidal test tone used to measure line quality and transmission loss between stations.
Ringback number, which causes the calling telephone to ring to verify an installation is working and the phone number routing properly.
Each country uses different codes. BT Linetest Facilities (for example) are available by ringing 17070 and a self-service test facility for subscribers is no longer available.
In the North American Numbering Plan, 958-xxxx and +1-NPA-959-xxxx are commonly reserved for local and long-distance test numbers (respectively). A few localities (including Winnipeg) reserve 959 only.

Luke Tilley FRES FRSA (born 8 January 1983) is a British entomologist and science communicator.  They are Director of Communications and Engagement at the Royal Entomological Society and Insect Week Coordinator in the UK.
Education and Career
Tilley is from Cheshire and studied their biology undergraduate degree at the University of Sheffield graduating in 2005. They received their Ph.D from the University of York in 2010, studying the parasitoid wasps of shore flies in lettuce and celery crop glasshouses. They then worked as a research manager at Stockbridge Technology Centre (formerly Horticulture Research International) while coordinating Insect Week. In 2012 they joined the Royal Entomological Society to work as Director of Outreach and Development, moving to chief executive officer in 2018, and Director of Communications and Engagemenent in 2021.
Research
Tilley's research looked at the parasitoid wasp Aphaereta debilitata as a biological control agent of the shore fly Scatella tenuicosta, a pest in glasshouse crop soil. They found that the wasps reduced numbers of flies emerging from soil and subsequently there was a decrease in lettuce damage levels. They also found that levels of algae growing on the soil were negatively correlated with A debilitata and concluded that growers should encourage algal growth, as part of a conservation biological control programme.
They have also been involved in research on the interactions between beneficial insects such as hoverflies and parasitoid wasps and in finding gaps in knowledge about the conservation of beneficial insects
Science Communication
As well as National Insect Week, Tilley coordinates other outreach activities such as Insect Festival, the Great Bug Hunt which runs in collaboration with The Association for Science Education and is editor of INSTAR with Adam Hart.
They have organised international symposia on insects and the public, is an expert contributor to the Guinness Book of World Records and has written about insects for a range of different publications including the National Association of Environmental Education.
In 2013 they contributed to a panel on literature and science at the British Society of Literature and Science's annual meeting.
Honours and Awards
In 2011 Tilley was awarded Fellowship of the Royal Entomological Society and in 2020 they were awarded Fellowship of the Royal Society of Arts.

The cabinet of Antti Rinne was the 75th government of Finland. It was formed following the parliamentary election of 2019 and was formally appointed by President Sauli Niinistö on 6 June 2019. The cabinet consisted of a coalition formed by the Social Democratic Party, the Centre Party, the Green League, the Left Alliance, and the Swedish People's Party. The cabinet's Prime Minister was Antti Rinne.
This government was the first centre-left coalition to lead Finland since the Lipponen II Cabinet in 2003. The Rinne coalition had a total of 117 seats (58.5%) in the 200-seat parliament.
Rinne announced the resignation of their government on 3 December 2019. It continued its term as a caretaker government until a new government, the Marin Cabinet, was formed.
Ministers
The Rinne cabinet comprised 19 ministers: seven ministers from the Social Democratic Party, five ministers from the Centre Party, three from the Green League, and two each from the Left Alliance and the Swedish People's Party.
The constitution requires ministers to be "honest and competent". The nomination of Centre's Antti Kaikkonen as the Minister of Defence drew considerable controversy due to their previous conviction from political corruption. Historically, the interpretation of the "honest and competent" clause has been permissive: the most salient example would be Aarre Simonen, who was also successfully appointed in 1966 despite their conviction in 1961, also from corruption. Rinne had the question checked with the Chancellor of Justice and Kaikkonen was cleared to proceed. The motivation was that there had already been two elections in between where Kaikkonen had been re-elected, and Kaikkonen had been law-abiding since.

Broadus Miller (c. 1904–1927) was an African American man who in 1927 was accused of killing a young Morganton, North Carolina mill worker named Gladys Kincaid. For nearly two weeks after the killing, hundreds of police, posse members, and private bounty hunters pursued Miller in what was the largest manhunt that had ever taken place in western North Carolina up to that time. After a posse member shot and killed Miller, their body was brought back to Morganton and displayed on the courthouse square, attracting several thousand spectators.
Background
A native of Greenwood County, South Carolina, Broadus Miller had served three years in the South Carolina state penitentiary for the 1921 murder of an African American woman, who had been clubbed to death with a baseball bat. At their trial for the murder, a court-appointed psychiatrist testified that Miller suffered from severe mental illness.
The murder of Gladys Kincaid
After Miller's release from the South Carolina penitentiary, they moved to North Carolina, where in the spring of 1927 they were hired as a construction laborer in building the Frank Tate House in the town of Morganton. On the evening of June 21, 1927, fifteen-year-old Gladys Kincaid was bludgeoned to death while walking home from their job in a local hosiery mill. Police immediately suspected Miller, who had been seen in the vicinity of where the victim's body was found, and during a search of Miller's boardinghouse room discovered a raincoat spattered with fresh blood stains. However, Miller had disappeared.
The murder of young Kincaid outraged many local residents, causing potential lynch mobs to conduct a frenzied search for the accused killer. In their role as county attorney, Morganton resident Sam Ervin, Jr. (who would later gain national fame as a U. S. Senator) served as legal adviser for local officials, who promptly used a provision of North Carolina state law to declare Broadus Miller an outlaw, meaning that they could legally be shot and killed by any pursuer, whether a police officer or a private citizen. Local newspaper publisher Beatrice Cobb, one of the most prominent women journalists in the state and secretary of the North Carolina Press Association, penned a series of racially inflammatory editorials denouncing Miller as a “beast.” County officials and local business people posted large rewards for Miller, dead or alive, and North Carolina governor Angus W. McLean authorized a state-sponsored reward as well; the public and private rewards offered for Miller would eventually total nearly $2,000.00, prompting hundreds of private citizens to join in the manhunt. Because of the inflamed racial tensions within Morganton, and in order to prevent a potential lynching, Governor McLean deployed National Guard troops to patrol the streets of the town.
Using bloodhounds, law enforcement officials eventually tracked Broadus Miller to the mountain woods of neighboring Caldwell County, where for over a week hunters pursued the outlaw. On Sunday, July 3, 1927, a posse member shot and killed Miller in the woods near the community of Linville Falls. That afternoon Miller's dead body was brought back to Morganton and displayed on the courthouse square, an exhibition that attracted several thousand spectators from both Morganton and adjacent towns. In the evening, fearing that local residents would attempt to desecrate the corpse, local officials shipped the body by train to Statesville, where the following morning Broadus Miller was quietly buried in an unmarked grave.
Ballads
The Broadus Miller case inspired a number of folk ballads. Penned by anonymous composers and set to traditional folk melodies, these ballads were widely sung throughout western North Carolina. One of these ballads, entitled “The Tragedy of Gladys Kincaid” or simply “Gladys Kincaid,” was collected by Professor Frank C. Brown of the North Carolina Folklore Society sometime before 1943. Another ballad, also known as “Gladys Kincaid,” was included by folklorist Mellinger Henry in their 1934 work Songs Sung in the Southern Appalachians.

Saving Hope: The Long Way to the Arab Spring () is a 2013 non-fiction book by Bahraini cultural critic Nader Kadhim. Written in Arabic, it is the ninth book by Kadhim, who works as a Professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Bahrain. Written in two stages, before and during the Arab Spring, the book discusses this wave of protests from two sides; the past and the future. The past is divided into three waves, each of them corresponding to an era of hope and aspiration. First is the enlightenment wave, followed by the revolutionary wave and finally the democratic wave. The author then tackles the Arab Spring and argues that it is not the time for celebration, but an important station in the long way towards democracy.
The book was positively received by reviewers in several Bahraini media outlets such as Al-Wasat, Al Ayam and al-Bilad. In addition, the pan-Arab Al-Hayat and Kuwaiti Al Rai newspapers gave it favorable reviews. There were mild criticisms for the book, mainly concerned with its scope. Every critic thought it should have expanded more on a certain aspect.
Background
The Arab Spring was a wave of protests, uprisings and revolutions that erupted at the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011. Starting from the Tunisian city of Sidi Bouzid and spreading throughout the country, the Tunisian Revolution began in mid-December 2010 and was soon faced with government repression. On 14 January 2011, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. Inspired by the events, the Egyptians organized similar protests on 25 January, which also swelled and spread all over the country. After several failed attempts to stop the movement, President Hosni Mubarak announced their resignation and transferred power to the army on 11 February. These events "jolted the rest of the region" and several other Arab countries were quick to follow suit.
In Yemen, small-scale protests started shortly after the Tunisian Revolution. Protesters were emboldened by the fall of Mubarak and their numbers grew. The president, Ali Abdullah Saleh was able to remain in power for months before signing an agreement in November by which they handed over power, but remained a political player. In Bahrain, protests erupted on 14 February and were met by repression. A month later, the government called in troops from neighboring Persian Gulf countries to put down protests and announced a state of emergency. In Libya, protests started on 17 February in the eastern city of Benghazi. They developed into a civil war that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands. In September, six months after the UN Security Council–sanctioned NATO military intervention, the de facto ruler Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed.
In Syria, protests erupted in mid-March and were met by government repression. The brutal repression radicalized the opposition and the country slid into full scale civil war that has left more than 100,000 killed by July 2013. Less significant protests also occurred in Algeria, Jordan, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia. The initial hopes of democratic change have faced several setbacks in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia. A report by Freedom House in 2012 suggested that while Tunisia was showing significant improvements, Egypt's improvements were limited and there were declines in some areas. Bahrain on the other hand was scoring record declines and was ranked lowest. The situation in Yemen was not much better than Bahrain.
Inspiration and writing
Kadhim began writing the book in December 2010, a time they described as gloomy with no hope of change in the Arab World. Then, when the Arab Spring began, they were deeply shaken by the rapid developments and the early victories achieved in Tunisia and Egypt, and described them as "a rain that fell suddenly on a barren desert". Therefore, they decided to stop writing and rethink the book's thesis, which until then had been influenced by the previous gloomy atmosphere. The stop was only expected to last for few months or a year at most until the events unfolded. But Kadhim only resumed writing in September 2012, a time when some countries were still in upheaval, while others were in transition. They were determined and motivated to re-examine the original thesis, to defend the Arab Spring, and most importantly to defend "the hope that this Spring had revived".
Content
The book discusses the Arab Spring from two sides: the past and the future. The author argues that the Arab Spring was a result of a past which extends to the nineteenth century, which they name the "memory of hope". They then divides this long period into three eras: enlightenment wave of hope, revolutionary wave of hope and democratic wave of hope. Each of these waves is then discussed in detail.
The enlightenment wave of hope
This wave started at the beginning of the nineteenth century. It was characterized by the hope that al-Nahda (Arab Renaissance) and enlightenment would allow the region catch up with more developed nations. Although they differed in ideology and worldview, the common theme among the enlightenment intellectuals was their belief in gradual progress without sudden leaps even if it takes decades. They did not support violence or revolution, but preferred peaceful methods such as education and science to bring about change. Most of them saw the Western world as a model to follow and imitate; some even called for full Europeanization. Another shared theme was their attempt to explain the backwardness of the Arab world and the progress of the Western world by one grand cause, each of them claiming to have found this cause. Despite the long time-frame and successive generations of this wave, the author concludes that it failed to achieve its goals.
The revolutionary wave of hope
This wave started in the middle of the twentieth century and was characterized by the hope to achieve al-Nahda via rapid radical changes. Its theorists criticized the previous gradual approach as futile. They thought that the Arab world was held back from progress by two major forces: foreign colonialism and local tyranny. Thus, they supported national liberation movements and revolutions. To them, revolution was the only way to overcome the backwardness of the Arab world. The Western world was no more a model to follow, instead Third World counties that resisted imperialism such as Vietnam and Cuba became the models.
Following the defeat of Arab armies in the 1948 Palestine war, the Arab world went into an era of political assassinations and military coups that culminated in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which brought Gamal Abdel Nasser into the leadership of Egypt. Nasser's ascend to power was a turning point in the history of the region and the revolutionary wave had spread to Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Yemen and Libya. This wave however faced a historic defeat in the 1967 Arab–Israeli War. The author states that this defeat was worse than that of 1948 and had signaled the end of the Nasserite revolutionary wave, which was replaced by the Islamist wave. This wave reached its climax in early 1980s after the Islamic Revolution in Iran and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which turned Afghanistan into a hub for Mujahideen. The Arab revolutions that succeeded did not bring al-Nadha nor freedom, instead they had turned into authoritarian regimes. These developments and the 8-year Iran–Iraq War have struck a fatal blow to the Arab revolutionary wave of hope.
The democratic wave of hope
This wave began at the end of the 1980s after the Revolutions of 1989. Its main theme was the hope that civil society, not enlightenment or revolution would pave the way for democracy in the Arab world. Civil society was seen as essential for emergence of democracy and that once a strong civil society developed, democracy was sure to follow. It was hoped that democracy would be achieved by the end of 1990s or early twenty-first century at most. The Saddam Hussein-ordered Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf War have formed a strong reaction against tyranny, which was seen as the main cause of the crisis. It also weakened authoritarian regimes and gave civil society more space to maneuver. The number of non-governmental organizations in the Arab world jumped from less than 20,000 in the mid-1960s to over 70,000 in the late 1980s to 300,000 in 2008. Despite all of these developments, there was no significant democratic change in any Arab state throughout this period.
The beginning of Arab Spring
In this chapter, the author argues that the grand narrative of democratic change was being weakened and replaced by small narratives of quality of life and personal consumption of commodities and services. Arab states used these narratives to polish their tarnished legitimacy. However, these small narratives were not sustainable. Dissatisfaction and despair were very high. This situation was ready to explode at any moment and was ignited by Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation. Although the Arab Spring began with great hopes for change, these hopes were replaced by fear and then by frustration. Setbacks such as the struggle between Islamists and seculars, 2012 Benghazi attack and Reactions to Innocence of Muslims have diminished much of the initial hope.
The author concludes by arguing that change is hard and that one should not rush to think that the Arab Spring is the "time of festival". Instead the author blames this rush and exaggerated expectations for the diminishing of hope. They add that although the way forward is long and hard (the events of early 2011 being an important station in it), we should hold on to the hope rescued by the Arab Spring and believe that a better future can be built by our own hands.

Release and reception
Saving Hope was published by Masaa Publishing & Distribution in Bahrain and Kuwait in 2013, with the subtitle, The Long Way to the Arab Spring. Unlike Kadhim's three previous books, which were published gradually as articles in the media, no parts of Saving Hope were published before the official release. The cover of the 314 pages book showed a Tunisian woman waving the V sign. The book has received favorable reviews in various media outlets.
Writing for Al-Wasat, Mohammed Jalal praised the book's title and subtitle saying they reflected positiveness and reality. They also stated that Saving Hope was Kadhim's most important book so far. Writing for the same newspaper, Habib Haidar expressed their admire to the large amount of sources Kadhim used and was able to plot in a homogeneous way that is easy to read. They also noted that two thirds of the book were dedicated to the "memory of hope" and only 100 pages discussed the Arab Spring.
Hassan Madan reviewed the book in 5 articles published in Al Ayam. They considered it the first Bahraini attempt to analyze the roots of the Arab Spring. They noted that throughout the book, the author had argued against Lyotard's proposal by stating that local narratives had reached an impasse. While praising their division of the "memory of hope", Madan thought that Kadhim should have expanded more about the divisions between the first and the second wave and should have explored more about Marxist parties in the Arab world. Writing for the same newspaper, Mahir Abdulqadir praised the thesis of the book, stating that unlike many of the superficial analysis of the Arab Spring, Kadhim succeeded in tackling and examining the Arabic subconscious while keeping the reader in suspense until the last pages. They however criticized the book for not covering the "West aggressive attitude to the [Arab] Renaissance".
One attendant of a cultural seminar about the book criticized it for lacking Islamic theorizing, while another described it as too optimistic. Overall comments were however positive. Writing for Al-Bilad newspaper, Mohammed al-Mahfodh stated that the book was well worth reading and stopping by. A review by Al-Hayat warned against judging the book from its optimistic cover image or title. It praised the book and described it as a "thoughtful and interesting study". Fahad al-Hindal praised the author's critical reading of the three waves of hope in a review published in Al Rai newspaper.

Dysdercus suturellus is a species of true bug in the family Pyrrhocoridae, commonly known as a cotton stainer. The adult insect is slender, about long, with a red thorax and dark brown wings marked with a yellow cross. It is native to the southeast of the United States, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. It is a pest of cotton crops and other plants, the adults and older nymphs feeding on the emerging bolls and the ripening seeds.
Description
The adult Dysdercus suturellus is about long. It has a red head with black antennae, the first segment of which are longer than the second. The thorax has a white pronotal collar and is otherwise mostly red. The sternites of the abdomen are red, bordered with white posteriorly. The corium, the leathery base of the wings, is dark brown margined with cream, giving the insect a large cross-shaped pattern.
Distribution and hosts
Dysdercus suturellus is native to the southeasternmost part of the United States, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. It is a pest of cotton crops and its distribution has been linked to the area of cotton under cultivation. Other host plants include tangerines, okra, papaya, oleander, roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa), rose of Sharon (Hibiscus syriacus), Turk's cap mallow, teaweed (Sida sp.), Caesarweed (Urena lobata), Spanish needles (Bidens pilosa), Portia tree (Thespesia populnea), rose, eggplant, black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) and guava. The host plants are all in the families Malvaceae, Sterculiaceae, Bombacaceae and Tiliaceae.
Life cycle
Dysdercus suturellus is a true bug and does not undergo metamorphosis. The eggs are pale yellow and are laid singly or in small groups in sand, leaf or plant debris, and hatch in about a week. The nymphs pass through five instars (developmental stages) over the course of three to five weeks. The first instar lives underground after which the nymph climbs the host plant. The nymphs are largely red but in the fourth and fifth instars, the dark wingpads are apparent as they enlarge, and the abdominal segments develop pale margins and become more obvious. There are several generations each year.
Biology
The adults and late stage nymphs feed on the protein-rich seeds of their host plants. As these become available at different times of year, the winged adults migrate between different plant species. The adults have also been observed predating the larvae of the cotton leafworm (Alabama argillacea) and the larvae and pupae of the yellow scallop moth (Anomis erosa). They also feed on the nectar of many species of flowers and on various fruits, including citrus. When these insects feed on cotton bolls, the young bolls fail to mature, and the lint becomes stained which reduces the value of the crop. When they feed on citrus, they plunge their rostrum (beak-like mouthparts) deep into the fruit which may then fall a few hours later, or decay internally over the next few days.

Longoni SRL is one of the most prominent European manufacturers of high-end cue sticks. The company, founded by Alessandro Longoni in 1945, is based in Mariano Comense, Italy. Longoni makes cues customized for various carom billiards disciplines, including three-cushion, five-pin, and artistic billiards, as well as pool and Russian pyramid cues more recently.
Over the years, several professional players, including Dick Jaspers and Niels Feijen, have helped design and develop new lines of Longoni carom and pool cues, respectively. As of 2014, Niels Feijen is still under contract with Longoni.
A hallmark of Longoni cues is their often unusual designs – including octagonal cuts, sewn-in leather strips, and intricate inlay ornaments. Longoni's two top lines of pool cues, the Classica and Silver series, range from approximately US$1,500 to $6,000.
Longoni supports no-ivory cue production by exclusively using made of phenolic resin.

Bat & Ball railway station is on Bat & Ball Road in the suburban town of Sevenoaks in Kent, England. The station is managed by Southeastern although all trains that serve the station are Thameslink. It is from , although all northbound trains run to London Blackfriars.
History
The station opened in 1862 with the name "Sevenoaks". It was then, some years, named "Sevenoaks Bat & Ball" then renamed in 1950 to its current name. The name derives from the Bat & Ball Inn, a pub which no longer exists.
A long lease of the building was granted to Sevenoaks Town Council in 2017 for refurbishment supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Works began March 2018 – for a building re-opening in January 2019. It is a listed building in the initial, mainstream category, Grade II (two).
Facilities
The station is near the hospital, in the ecclesiastical parish of St John's Hill and in the broader town council's civil parish. It is on a south coastbound route from London via and via . The northbound platform has a bench under a shelter and in 2014 new benches and service tannoy have graced the other platform. The staffed office, after fading, ceased on 30 November 1991. Southeastern has fitted an electronic screen showing departures.
The station has a car park. Once free, in 2010 a fee of £3 per day to park began. This resulted in the displacement of parking by commuters into surrounding residential streets, particularly Chatham Hill Road. Per the local press, parking problems for local residents were common, whilst leaving the station's car park almost deserted.
A PERTIS "permit to travel" machine was at the entrance to the southbound platform, later replaced by a card payment-only ticket machine in 2016. Before de-staffing in 1991, it had converted from the previous NCR21 card ticket system to APTIS on 12 April 1988. A rare misprint on some tickets issued just after conversion to APTIS rendered the station BAT BALL.
As part of the refurbishment project undertaken by Sevenoaks Town Council the station building will house a public cafe, public toilets, and community meeting rooms, due to open January 2019.
Services
All services at Bat & Ball are operated by Thameslink using EMUs.
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
2 tph to London Blackfriars via
2 tph to
During the peak hours, the service to London Blackfriars is extended to and from via .

Prusa or Prousa (), or Prusa near Olympus or Prusa under Olympus (Προῦσα ἐπὶ τῷ Ὀλύμπῳ, Προῦσα πρὸς τῷ Ὀλύμπῳ), was a town of ancient Bithynia or of Mysia, situated at the northern foot of Mysian Olympus. Pliny the Elder states that the town was built by Hannibal during their stay with Prusias I, which can only mean that it was built by Prusias, whose name it bears, on the advice of Hannibal. It is acknowledged by Dion Chrysostomus, who was a native of the town in the first and second centuries, that it was neither very ancient nor very large. It was, however, as Strabo remarks well governed, continued to flourish under the Roman emperors, and was celebrated for its warm baths that bore the name of the "royal waters." Under the Byzantine emperors it suffered much during the wars against the Ottoman Turks; when at last it fell into their hands, it was for a time the capital of their empire under the name of Bursa, which it still bears.
Its site is occupied by the modern city of Bursa, Asiatic Turkey.

Kees Brusse (; 26 February 1925 – 9 December 2013) was a Dutch actor, film director and screenwriter. A self-taught actor, they were remarkable for their natural acting style at a time when more theatrical performances were the norm in The Netherlands. One of the first Dutch actors who managed to combine a stage and film career with a career on TV, radio and in commercials, they appeared in 47 films and television shows between 1936 and 2004, including Pension Hommeles (1957-1959), Ciske de Rat (1955), and Dokter Pulder zaait papavers (1975).
Early life
Kees Brusse was born in Rotterdam, the son of author and journalist M.J. Brusse and opera singer Antje Ebes. Their parents divorced when they were young. Brusse started acting at a young age. At the age of 11 they made their film debut in Merijntje Gijzens Jeugd.
Career
At the age of 15 they ran away from home to pursue an acting career. Rejected from drama school they became volunteer at the theater company of Cor van der Lugt Melsert at the Stadsschouwburg. They made their stage debut in 1941 as Pietje Puck in Boefje, a play written by their father.
After the end of World War II Brusse performed at the cabaret of Wim Sonneveld, toured Switzerland, and in 1948, visited Indonesia with their theater group Toneelgroep C 6. In the following years they became a much sought and celebrated actor. As a self-taught actor their acting style was different from their contemporaries: more natural and dosed in a time when Dutch acting was characterized by large gestures and theatrical delivery. They were involved with several theater companies, including Toneelgroep Theater, De Haagse Comedie, Het Amsterdams Toneel and the Nederlandse Comedie. From 1952 to 1954 they were a artistic leader of the Rotterdamse Comedie, where they worked with their later wife Mieke Verstraete.
In 1950, they played the leading part in the film De dijk is dicht, directed by Anton Koolhaas. They had leading roles in four of the only eleven Dutch feature films released in the 1950s, including Ciske de Rat (1955), still considered one of the best visited films of The Netherlands.
Brusse was able to combine their stage and film career with work for radio, TV and commercials, one of the first Dutch actors to do so. They became well known to the Dutch public with the radio play De familie Doorsnee (1952-1958) and Pension Hommeles (1957-1959), the first true Dutch TV series, both written by Annie M.G. Schmidt. In 1964 and 1965 they played the title character in the Dutch TV version of Maigret. In both Pension Hommeles as Maigret, the role of their wife was played by Brusse's then wife Mieke Verstraete.
In 1962, they directed their first film, Kermis in de regen. The same year, they directed the actors in Paul Rotha's film The Silent Raid. Their documentary Mensen van morgen (1964) sketches a portrait of young people in the early sixties and is praised for its candor. Two years later, they made a German version, Menschen von Morgen.
In the 1970s they have the leading parts in several films by Wim Verstappen and Pim de la Parra: Blue Movie (1971), VD (1972) and Dakota (1974). They also starred in Bert Haanstra's 1975 film Dokter Pulder zaait papavers, which was entered into the 26th Berlin International Film Festival. Around the same time, they also are a regular panel member in the game show Wie van de drie, the Dutch version of To Tell the Truth. Furthermore, they performed in commercials for Shell and Zwitserleven, the Dutch branch of insurance company Swiss Life.
Between 1981 and 1985, they performed in Mensen zoals jij en ik (based on the German TV series Leute wie du und ich), a series of short stories written by Herbert Reinecker. In each episode, Brusse played a different character, including a taxi driver, a clown, a seducer and a businessman.
In 2002, they released under their own management Vader is zo stil de laatste tijd, a personal documentary about aging. In 2004, they were one of the leading actors in the TV drama series De Erfenis.
Personal life
Kees Brusse was married five times and had two children. From 1948 to 1953, they were married to Wim Kan's assistant Pam Henning. In 1954, they married actor Mieke Verstraete, with whom they had a daughter. In 1975, they married Marlou Peters. They got a daughter as well.
In 1986, they married Sonja Boerrigter. With their Brusse left The Netherlands in 1988. They went to live in Bonaire, France and Australia. Boerrigter died in 2000. They spent their final years in Perth with their fifth wife, Joan St. Clair. In 2008, they returned briefly to The Netherlands for the release of their autobiography, co-written by Henk van der Horst. They suffered from emphysema and was officially declared blind.
In January 2013, they returned to The Netherlands to live in the Rosa Spier Huis, a retirement home for notable Dutch artists. They died on 9 December 2013 at the age of 88.
Awards and recognition
For Mensen zoals jij en ik, they won the 1982 Gouden Televizier-Ring, the most important Dutch audience award for TV programmes. In 1987, they were invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau.

Hilary Kiyo Finucane is an American computational biologist who is Co-Director of the Program in Medical and Population Genetics at the Broad Institute. Them group combines genetic data with molecular data to understand the origins and mechanisms of disease.
Early life and education
Finucane grew up in Maryland. They have said that their family enjoyed music and science. Finucane became interested in policy as a child, and started an Amnesty International student chapter at their high school. They were an undergraduate student at Harvard College, where eventually majored in mathematics and spent their spare time taking part in chamber music. After graduating from Harvard in 2009 Finucane moved to Israel where they joined the Weizmann Institute of Science. Here they focused on theoretical computer science, completing a dissertation on geometric group theory. They developed an analytical tool (the Maximal information coefficient) that allows users to search complex data sets in an effort to identify meaningful relationships. Finucane became interested in the application of complex theoretical mathematics to the real world. They returned to the United States in 2012, where they worked toward a doctorate in applied mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They eventually started working with Alkes Price, with whom they developed statistical methods for understanding the genetic basis of human disease. In particular, Finucane considered how specific parts of the genome relate to activity in different cell types, making use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to model these relationships.
Research and career
Finucane was appointed a Schmidt Fellow at the Broad Institute. They were awarded an National Institutes of Health Independence Award to combine data from ENCODE, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements, with GWAS and other biological information to better understand the cell types relevant to a particular disease. Soon after joining the Broad Institute, Finucane was made Associate Director of Medical and Population Genetics.
Selected publications
Personal life
Finucane is married to Yakir Reshef, a computer scientist who works on the immune system. They met them during middle school.

Wichita County is overwhelmingly Republican. It was last carried for the Democratic Party by Jimmy Carter in 1976, but since then the only Democrat to win over a quarter of the county's vote has been Michael Dukakis during the 1988 election when the Democratic vote was boosted by reaction against a major Great Plains drought. In the past six elections no Democrat has topped twenty percent of Wichita County's vote – a situation now almost general in the High Plains.
Laws
Although the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 to allow the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with the approval of voters, Wichita County has remained a prohibition, or "dry", county. The latest county alcohol control map indicates the county now allows liquor sales.

The brigade was established to act swiftly against Confederate forces operating near the Mississippi River and its tributaries. The brigade was commanded by Brigadier General Alfred W. Ellet and operated in coordination with the Mississippi River Squadron during the Union brown-water navy battle against the Confederate River Defense Fleet and land based forces. The brigade was independent of the Union Army and Navy and reported directly to the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton. Despite the name, it was never part of the United States Marine Corps.
Organization
Brigadier General Alfred W. Ellet was the commanding officer of the United States Ram Fleet. The ram fleet had proven themselves a useful addition to the Mississippi River Squadron through their actions at the First Battle of Memphis and on the Yazoo River. However, the ram fleet was outside the Union Navy and Army command and reported directly to the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton. Although they coordinated their activities with the Mississippi River Squadron led by Charles H. Davis, the reporting structure was problematic for Union Navy leaders. The brigade was never incorporated into the Union Navy, however, when David Dixon Porter took over command of the Mississippi River Squadron, they demanded and received full authority over the ram fleet. Porter needed an amphibious force to suppress enemy fire from the river shores that threatened their fleet.
On November 1, 1862, Ellet was charged with creating and commanding the Mississippi Marine Brigade. The unit consisted of artillery, cavalry and infantry with the ram fleet used for transportation. The brigade was not able to recruit from existing Army or Navy units and instead recruited convalescing soldiers from hospitals who wished to return to service. Ellet promised recruits bonuses, the opportunity to serve aboard clean vessels with good food and the potential for fame.
On November 5, Ellet's nephew, Charles Rivers Ellet was promoted to the rank of colonel and became the third member of the Ellet family to lead the ram fleet. Ellet was only 19 years old, which made them one of the youngest colonels in the Union Army. Another nephew, John A. Ellet also served as Lieutenant Colonel in the brigade.
The unit consisted of about 350 officers and men, including boat crews which used the nine steam powered rams of the United States Ram Fleet. Other vessels were added to the ram fleet including the tugs Alf Cutting, Bell Darlington and Cleveland; the hospital ship Woodford and the transports Autocrat, Baltic and Diana.
Vicksburg Campaign
On December 12, 1862, the Queen of the West was one of the ships that accompanied the USS Cairo up the Yazoo River. The Cairo was struck by a 'torpedo' or naval mine and began to sink rapidly. The Queen of the West was able to rescue part of the crew from the Cairo before it sank.
In February 1863, the Queen of the West was run past the batteries of Vicksburg, Mississippi to support Admiral David Farragut south of the city. The Queen of the West severely damaged the CSS Vicksburg and captured four transport ships supplying Confederate forces. The Queen of the West also conducted activities on the Atchafalaya River, destroying Confederate supplies and burning three plantations. They were captured by Confederate forces on the Red River near Fort DeRussy and entered into Confederate service as the CSS Queen of the West.
On March 26, the ram ships Switzerland and USS Lancaster were run past the batteries at Vicksburg to support Admiral Farragut. Charles Rivers Ellet commanded the Switzerland and their cousin, John A. Ellet, commanded the Lancaster. Both ships received heavy fire from the batteries and the Lancaster was run aground and sunk to avoid capture by the Confederate forces. The Switzerland was damaged but was repaired and continued duty south of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River.
On June 14, the unit joined Brigadier General Joseph A. Mower in the Battle of Richmond, Louisiana and skirmished with the Confederates, losing 3 wounded.
On June 19, Brigadier General Ellett ordered construction of a casemate on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River opposite Vicksburg. The fortification was completed in four days and was protected with a thickness of railroad iron. A 20-pounder Parrott rifle was placed within and fired on the city the morning of June 23. The Confederates responded firing 17 rounds from 5 different guns. The fort was further strengthened by adding another thickness of railroad iron. Fire from the Parrott gun in the fort was maintained until the end of the siege with a total of 98 rounds being expended. The fort was repeatedly struck but without material damage and without loss of life. The brigade also placed a brass Dahlgren gun in the casemate near the 20-pounder Parrott. Considerable damage to the Confederates was accomplished especially by stopping work at the foundry and machine shop.
On June 25-30, a detachment of the brigade on the steamer John Rains, formed a part of an expedition to Greenville, Mississippi under the command of Lt. Col. Samuel J. Nasmith of the 25th Wisconsin Infantry.
On June 30, the brigade saw action at the Goodrich's Landing. Two African-American Union regiments, the 1st Arkansas and the 10th Louisiana had come under attack from Confederate forces. The brigade arrived and pushed back the Confederate forces, suffering two casualties and one death.
Transfer to Army jurisdiction
A ruling of the Judge-Advocate General, dated 11 June 1863, seems to make the brigade a "special contingent of the army and not the navy," but as late as 23 July 1863, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant wrote: "They (the officers and men of the Marine Brigade) are not subject to my orders." By order of the Secretary of War the army assumed full jurisdiction over the brigade in October 1863. The brigade was disestablished in August 1864, and its surviving ships were transferred to other duties.

Newton Centre is a light rail station on the MBTA Green Line D branch, located in the Newton Centre village of Newton, Massachusetts. A former regional rail station, it was converted for light rail use and reopened on July 4, 1959, along with the rest of the line. The 1891-built station and express office are part of the Newton Railroad Stations Historic District, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
History
The first station at this site opened in 1852 on Langley Road as a part of the Charles River Railroad. The Boston and Albany Railroad commissioned a building which design was started by H. H. Richardson in 1886, the year of their death, and which design was finished by Richardson's successor firm of Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge. The new station, built by the Norcross Brothers firm of Worcester, opened in 1891. The station was heavily modified in 1907 when the line was sunk below grade to eliminate street crossings.
The Highland branch was closed in 1958 and quickly converted for light rail use. The station building was rented out as commercial space; by 1962, it housed a clothing store. Until 2008, it housed a Starbucks coffee shop containing a sign that indicated when a Boston-bound train arrived. However, the shop was closed in October 2008 as part of Starbucks' restructuring campaign due to the Great Recession. The Deluxe Station Diner, a satellite restaurant of the Deluxe Town Diner in Watertown, opened in the newly renovated building in December 2010. Deluxe Station Diner morphed into Jamie's on Union in September 2020 which closed in August 2022. The space currently sits vacant.
In the early 2000s, the MBTA modified key surface stops with raised platforms for accessibility as part of the Light Rail Accessibility Program. The renovation of Newton Centre was completed around 2002. Around 2006, the MBTA added a wooden mini-high platform on the inbound side, allowing level boarding on older Type 7 LRVs. These platforms were installed at eight Green Line stations in 2006–07 as part of the settlement of Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA.
In October 2012, the MBTA changed the station name from Newton Center to Newton Centre to match the village name.

Pakistan–United Kingdom relations refer to the bilateral ties between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Both countries are members of the Commonwealth of Nations, and the United Kingdom is home to a large Pakistani diaspora population. Until 1956, Pakistan was nominally part of the British Empire as a post-independence federal dominion in the aftermath of the partition of British India in 1947.
History
Formerly part of the British Empire, Pakistan became independent from the UK in 1947 under the terms of the Indian Independence Act. At this point the Dominion of Pakistan was still nominally part of the British Empire, until it became a separate Republic in 1956.
Pakistan left the Commonwealth of Nations in 1972 in protest of the organisation's recognition of Bangladeshi independence, before rejoining in 1989.
In 2018, Pakistan and the United Kingdom signed the UK-Pakistan Prisoner Transfer Agreement allowing foreign prisoners in both countries to serve their sentences in home country.
Diplomatic relations
The United Kingdom and Pakistan have High Commissioners, a position which often fulfills the role ambassador within the Commonwealth, in the other country. The current High Commissioner for the UK in Pakistan is Christian Turner, and Pakistan's High Commissioner to the UK is currently Mohammad Nafees Zakaria.
Economic relations
Since 1988 there has been a tax treaty in place between the two countries designed to prevent individuals or businesses being taxed for the same income twice, and to prevent tax avoidance.
In 2012 the Prime Ministers of both countries launched a Trade and Investment Roadmap to increase trade between the countries. Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, Pakistani Interior Minister, recently stated bilateral visits between the countries would be arranged to support trade relations.
A Pakistan–Britain Advisory Council was setup in 2002 to look at how the two governments could facilitate trade and commercial connections between the two countries.
Military relations
Both nations were part of a Cold War alliance called the Central Treaty Organization, which the UK saw as important in containing the expansion of Soviet influence in the region, while Pakistan joined partly in the hope of attracting economic benefits from the West. Pakistan's intelligence agency the ISI was formed by British officers in their departure from India, the ISI maintains extensive links with UK intelligence services and operations inside the UK. The British government regards the Baluchistan Liberation Army as a terrorist organization, it was proscribed in July 2006. Regular meetings and discussions on national security and counter-terrorism regularly take place between the governments of the two countries.

Sir John James Patrick Kirwan (born 16 December 1964) is a New Zealand mental health advocate, former rugby union and rugby league player, and former rugby union coach.
A wing, they played for Auckland in the 1980s and 1990s, when they dominated New Zealand rugby. They played in 63 tests for New Zealand, and scored 35 tries, making them one of the highest try scorers in international rugby union history. They were part of the New Zealand team that won the first Rugby World Cup in 1987. They also played rugby league for the Auckland Warriors in their first two seasons in 1995 and 1996.
After retiring, they moved into coaching, and was the head coach of Japanese club NEC, the Italy and Japan national teams, and the Blues in Super Rugby, until they stepped down in 2015.
They have written two books on the subject of mental health, has spoken openly about their battles with depression and been honoured for their services to mental health.
Early life and family
Kirwan was born in Auckland on 16 December 1964, the son of Patrick and Patricia Madeline Kirwan. They were educated at De La Salle College in Auckland.
Their paternal grandfather, Jack Kirwan, was a wing three-quarter/five-eighths originally from Reefton who played for the New Zealand rugby league team on 28 occasions.
Playing career
Rugby union
Kirwan played for Marist Brothers Old Boys RFC and Auckland domestically, winning 142 caps with the latter during an era when the side dominated the NPC and Ranfurly Shield.
From 1985 to 1989 they also played in Italy, with Benetton Treviso, where they won the Italian championship in 1989. Also in the Treviso team was the Black Craig Green, Kirwan's teammate in the 1987 World Cup won by New Zealand.
After their spell in rugby league, they finished their rugby union playing career with NEC in Japan from 1997–1999.
International
Kirwan played 63 test matches for New Zealand from 1984 until 1994. Kirwan played a major role in the All Blacks' 23-test unbeaten run from 1987 to 1990, including winning the 1987 World Cup. They scored 10 tries in five tests against Wales and Australia during 1988. In all they scored 35 test tries for New Zealand. They also scored 67 tries in all appearances with the All Blacks (including non test matches) which is still the national record. Their total of 199 first class tries remains a New Zealand record.
In 1986 Kirwan and David Kirk were the only All Blacks not to join the 'rebel' New Zealand Cavaliers team that travelled to apartheid-era South Africa after a New Zealand court held that the All Blacks' playing in that country would be inconsistent with their mission of promoting rugby. As a result, they and Kirk were the only ones not barred from playing with the All Blacks after the tour.
Rugby league
At age 30 Kirwan signed for the newly formed rugby league club Auckland Warriors for the 1995 ARL season, with a mutual option for 1996. Playing on the wing, Kirwan was the Warriors' top try scorer in the 1996 season. They were a staunch opponent of the ARL during the Super League war.
Coaching career
Kirwan coached NEC Green Rockets in Japan, and in 2001 became an assistant coach with the Auckland Blues.
In 2002, they moved to Italy to become the coach of the Italy national team, which under their guidance recorded two victories over Wales in 2003 and Scotland in 2004. After a winless 2005 Six Nations campaign, they were dismissed on 8 April 2005. They continued to work as a consultant with NEC.
At the start of 2007 they were appointed the coach of the Japan national rugby union team. Kirwan said: "The level of rugby has improved greatly in Japan in the last ten years and they did well at the last World Cup. But their recent performances at national level have [not been good]. I want to find that 'Samurai Spirit' that all the players can identify with. And then that style of rugby can start to spread downwards throughout the country." At the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Japan drew 12–12 with Canada, breaking a 16-year, 13-match losing streak at World Cups. Kirwan remained head coach of Japan through the 2011 Rugby World Cup, when they again drew with Canada, but lost to New Zealand, France and Tonga.
In July 2012, Kirwan was announced as the new coach of the Blues. In the 2013 and 2014 seasons, the Blues finished in 10th place. After re-applying for the role for 2016 and beyond, they were forced to step down following just three wins - an all-time franchise low - in the 2015 season. In 2018 they stated that they are not likely to coach again.
Mental health
Kirwan has openly spoken of their battle with depression, and is actively involved in mental health and depression awareness campaigns in New Zealand. They have written about their depression in the books All Blacks Don't Cry and Stand by Me. They have established the Sir John Kirwan Foundation to help young people understand mental health. In 2020 they launched a mental wellbeing app called Mentemia.
Personal life
Kirwan is married to Fiorella, Lady Kirwan, with three children: Francesca, a beach volleyball player; Niko, who has played football for the Whites, New Zealand's national team, and Luca, who has represented New Zealand internationally in rowing at under-23 level. Kirwan speaks fluent Italian and good Japanese, having lived in Italy and Japan.
In 2016 Kirwan had their DNA heritage investigated for a television. During the programme Kirwan described a link to the Kennedy family. A distant relationship with Scottish mountaineer Alexander Kellas was also unveiled.
Honours and awards
In the 1989 New Year Honours, Kirwan was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to rugby.
In the 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours, Kirwan was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to mental health. In the 2012 Queen's Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours, they were promoted to Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to mental health and rugby.
Also in 2012, Kirwan was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.

Coolamon Shire is a local government area in the Riverina region of south-western New South Wales, Australia. The Shire comprises and is located adjacent to the Newell Highway and the Burley Griffin Way. The Shire includes the towns of Coolamon, Ganmain, and Ardlethan, and the villages of Matong, Marrar, and Beckom.
The mayor of the Coolamon Shire Council is Cr. David McCann, an independent politician.
History
Coolamon Shire was first incorporated on 6 March 1906 by a Proclamation under the Local Government (Shires) Act 1905. The boundaries of the Shire were defined as:
On 15 May 1906 a Temporary Council of five members was appointed by Proclamation. The temporary councillors were: Henry Doubleday, David Hannah, William Henry Rowston, William Steele and George Webb.
The first meeting of the temporary Shire Council was held on 12 June 1906 in the Coolamon Court House. At this meeting Councillor William Rowston was elected as the chairperson and the council resolved to nominate Mr J.E.A Florance as shire secretary, subject to ministerial approval. The Council was initially divided into three "Ridings" each returning two councillors. The first elections to the council took place on Saturday 24 November 1906. With only the "A Riding" being contested.
The councillors elected in the inaugural election were: Riding A - William Rowston and Thomas Joseph Kelly; Riding B - Henry Doubleday and Thomas E. Lucas; Riding C - John Poiner and Randal King Pike.
The first meeting of the permanent Shire Council was held on 10 December 1906 at which Cr. Henry Doubleday was elected as the first President.
On 01 May 1912 the Coolamon Urban Area was Proclaimed, increasing the Council's powers to that of a municipality in respect of that Urban Area. Ganmain and Ardlethan were likewise proclaimed as Urban Areas on 14 Oct 1914.

Matrix (sometimes stylized as [matrix]) is an open standard and communication protocol for real-time communication. It aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, in the way that standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email currently does for store-and-forward email service, by allowing users with accounts at one communication service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, voice over IP, and videotelephony. It therefore serves a similar purpose to protocols like XMPP, but is not based on any existing communication protocol.
From a technical perspective, it is an application layer communication protocol for federated real-time communication. It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC, facilitating browser-to-browser applications.
History
The initial project was created inside Amdocs, while building a chat tool called "Amdocs Unified Communications", by Matthew Hodgson and . Amdocs then funded most of the development work from 2014 to October 2017. Matrix was the winner of the Innovation award at WebRTC 2014 Conference & Expo, and of the "Best in Show" award at WebRTC World in 2015. The protocol received praise mixed with some cautionary notes after it launched in 2014. Reviewers noted that other attempts at defining an open instant messaging or multimedia signalling protocol of this type had difficulties becoming widely adopted—e.g. XMPP and IRCv3—and have highlighted the challenges involved, both technological and political. Some were unclear if there was enough demand among users for services which interoperate among providers. In 2015, a subsidiary of Amdocs was created, named "Vector Creations Limited", and the Matrix staff was moved there.
In July 2017, the funding by Amdocs was announced to be cut and in the following weeks the core team created their own UK-based company, "New Vector Limited", which was mainly built to support the development of Matrix and Riot, which was later renamed to Element. During this time period, there were multiple calls for support to the community and companies that build on Matrix, to help pay for the wages of at least part of the core team. Patreon and Liberapay crowdfunding accounts were created, and the core team started a video podcast, called Matrix "Live" to keep the contributors up to speed with ongoing developments. This was expanded by a weekly blog format, called "This Week in Matrix", where interested community members could read, or submit their own, Matrix-related news. The company was created with the goal of offering consultancy services for Matrix and paid hosting of Matrix servers (as a platform called modular.im, which was later renamed to Element matrix services) to generate income.
In the early weeks after its creation, the Matrix team and the company Purism published plans to collaborate in the creation of the Librem 5 phone. The Librem 5 was intended to be a Matrix native phone, where the default pre-installed messaging and caller app should use Matrix for audio and video calls and instant messaging.
In 2017, KDE announced it was working on including support for the protocol in its IRC client Konversation.
In late January 2018, the company received an investment of US$5 million from Status, an Ethereum based startup.
In April 2018, the French Government announced plans to create their own instant messaging tool. Work on the application based on Riot and Matrix protocol—called after French scientists Claude Chappe—had started in early 2018 and the program was open-sourced and released on iOS and Android in April 2019.
In October 2018, a Community Interest Company called "The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C." was incorporated, to serve as a neutral legal entity for further development of the standard.
In February 2019, the KDE community announced plans to adopt Matrix for its internal communications needs, as a decentralized alternative to other instant messaging servers like Telegram, Slack, and Discord, and operate its own server instance.
In April 2019, Matrix.org suffered a security breach in which the production servers were compromised.
This breach was not an issue with the Matrix protocol and did not directly affect home servers other than matrix.org.
In June 2019, the Matrix protocol is out of beta with the version 1.0 across all APIs (and Synapse, at the time the reference home server), and the Matrix foundation is officially launched.
In October 2019, New Vector raised an additional US$8.5 million to develop Matrix.
In December 2019 German Ministry of Defense announced a pilot project called BwMessenger for secure instant messaging tool based on Matrix protocol, Synapse server and Riot application. This is modeled after French Tchap project. The long-term goal of the Federal Government is the secure use of messenger services that covers all ministries and subordinate authorities.
In December 2019 Mozilla announced that it would begin to use Matrix as a replacement for IRC. In the announcement, they said that they would be completing the move in late January 2020. The Mozilla IRC server, irc.mozilla.org, is said to be removed "no later than March of next year [2020]". In March 2020 the IRC server was turned off and users were directed to join chat.mozilla.org, Mozilla's Element instance.
In May 2020 Matrix enabled end-to-end encryption by default for private conversations.
In October 2020 Element acquired Gitter from GitLab. This meant that all Gitter users would be transitioned over to Matrix.
In March 2021, matrix.org announced that there are 28 million global visible accounts.
In June 2021, the Fourth Estate announced the development of Ceriph, a pilot project that creates a secure messaging and communications service for news organizations and journalists based on the Matrix protocol.
Protocol
Matrix targets use cases like voice over IP, Internet of Things and instant messaging, including group communication, along with a longer-term goal to be a generic messaging and data synchronization system for the web. The protocol supports security and replication, maintaining full conversation history, with no single points of control or failure. Existing communication services can integrate with the Matrix ecosystem.
Client software is available for open-federated Instant Messaging (IM), voice over IP (VoIP) and Internet of Things (IoT) communication.
The Matrix standard specifies RESTful HTTP APIs for securely transmitting and replicating JSON data between Matrix-capable clients, servers and services. Clients send data by PUTing it to a ‘room' on their server, which then replicates the data over all the Matrix servers participating in this ‘room'. This data is signed using a git-style signature to mitigate tampering, and the federated traffic is encrypted with HTTPS and signed with each server's private key to avoid spoofing. Replication follows eventual consistency semantics, allowing servers to function even if offline or after data-loss by re-synchronizing missing history from other participating servers.
The Olm library provides for optional end-to-end encryption on a room-by-room basis via a Double Ratchet Algorithm implementation. It can ensure that conversation data at rest is only readable by the room participants. With it configured, data transmitted over Matrix is only visible as ciphertext to the Matrix servers, and can be decrypted only by authorized participants in the room. The encryption protocol is called Olm; Megolm is an expansion of Olm to better suit the need for bigger rooms. There are two main implementations:
vodozemac, the current reference implementation, written in Rust. In 2022, it has been audited by Least Authority, whose findings are publicly available and have been addressed by the Matrix team. The review was partially funded by Germany's national agency for the healthcare system digitalisation (Gematik).
libolm, the former reference implementation, has been subject of a cryptographic review by NCC Group, whose findings are publicly available, and have been addressed by the Matrix team. The review was sponsored by the Open Technology Fund.
Bridges
Matrix supports bridging messages from different chat applications into Matrix rooms. These bridges are programs that run on the server and communicate with the non-Matrix servers. Bridges can either be acting as puppets or relays, where in the former the individual user's account is visibly posting the messages, and in the latter a bot posts the messages for non-puppeteered user accounts.
Currently there are official bridges for:
Gitter
IRC
Slack/Mattermost
XMPP
Bridges for the following notable applications are maintained by the community:
Apple iMessage
Discord
Email
Facebook Messenger
Google Hangouts
GroupMe
Mastodon
RSS/Twitter feeds

Adoption
Germany's national healthcare system's internal communication network uses a Matrix-based system (Ti-Messenger) for real-time communication among Germany's healthcare organizations and sharing of sensitive patient data, and is developed by the national agency for the digitalisation of the healthcare system (Gematik GmbH).
Employees of the Bundeswehr (Germany's armed forces) communicate with each other, and share classified documents (German VS-NfD), on a private Matrix network, with a customized version of the Matrix Element app.
The FOSDEM was held on Matrix in 2021 and 2022.

The Wechselapparat (Wex) was a World War I German flamethrower introduced in 1916 to replace the earlier Kleif. Developed by Richard Fiedler, as early as 1901. It had a doughnut-shaped backpack fuel container with a spherical propellant container (nitrogen) in the middle that blasted the gasoline. The containers were made of welded car rims, which made it easier to carry it yourself. A corrugated rubber hose led from the tank at the ends of which there were valves that enable mixture of fuel and propellant dispensing under pressure to the metal fuel pipe which had handles on both sides. Wex used a magnesium ignition system in a nozzle. In order for the fire to burn longer, tar was added to the gasoline or instead of it fuel oil was completely used up. It was used throughout the war, and some survived flamethrowers have been used by the Finns in the 1920s and then converted to Flammenwerfer 40. This design was updated before the Second World War to become flamethrower model 35. However, model 35 was considered too fragile so it was soon replaced by the model 41, a simpler construction with smaller, horizontal, cylindrical backpack containers.
The doughnut-shaped container design was copied by the British during World War II as the Flamethrower, Portable, No 2.
"Wechselapparat" is German for 'exchange apparatus'.

Yates Cider Mill is a cider mill in Rochester, Michigan. The mill traces its roots to 1863, when it was known as Yates Grist Mill. In order for the mill to utilize water power, the Yates Dam was built. The Yates Mill became the Yates Cider Mill in 1876 when a cider press was installed into the existing water powered process and the Mill began producing apple cider. Custom apple pressing was done for local farmers, orchard owners and landowners who brought their apples to the Mill.
Water power
Today visitors to the Yates Cider Mill can watch cider being made, powered by a 26-inch turbine, which was installed in 1894. It is the original turbine from 1894 that is still in use today at the Mill. Recently, the turbine was removed, refurbished and reinstalled in order to preserve history and continue with the original tradition of making cider. A 58-inch culvert carries the water that provides the water power for the turbine underground from the dam across the street to the Mill.
Making Apple Cider
Yates cider is made without preservatives, blending as many as six different varieties of apples. The process of cider making starts with apples arriving in 20-bushel boxes on a flatbed truck from Michigan orchards. A forklift unloads these boxes, as each weighs about 1000 pounds. The apples are then unloaded into a dumper-washer inspection area where cleaning, grinding and pressing begins. The apples not scheduled for direct use are placed in cold storage at the mill. The rest of the apples are cleaned, taken up on an elevator and dropped into a cone-shaped hopper that holds 150 bushels of apples and is located on the second floor of the cider mill. Below, on the first floor, the remainder of the operation takes place.
A handle, located on the first floor, controls a trap door on the bottom of the hopper, which allows the fruit to fall through to the first floor chute. On their way down the chute, the apples are chopped into small pieces, about four bushels at a time, and are then placed in a special nylon blanket. This process continues until up to 12 blankets are stacked on top of one another.
The layers of chopped apples are on a large turntable that rotates under the apple press. The press used at Yates Cider Mill is called a ‘screw press' because large screws turn to make the press go down, putting 50 tons of pressure on the blankets of chopped apples for 15 minutes. As the press goes down on the blankets, the cider comes through the weave in the cloth leaving the seeds, peelings and pulp inside the blanket. All by-products are then discarded down a chute in the floor and into a small railroad car under the mill. Periodically, the car is transferred to the dump area. The cider then flows from the press to chilled mixing tanks. From there, the cider is filtered to remove any and all small apple particles. UV treatment is the last step before bottling. In one autumn weekend, the mill juices over half a million apples and can produce 300 gallons of cider an hour.
Media
In October 2009, Yates Cider Mill was featured on Food Network's Unwrapped. It was a special behind-the-scenes episode entitled, “Fall Favorites".

The Messengers of Peace (MoP) programme is an initiative by the World Organization of the Scout Movement, which along with the Scouts of the World Award and the World Scout Environment Programmes form the Better World Framework programme. Since 2011, Scouts have committed to projects, of various scales, to make the world a more peaceful place and logged their hours on the Messengers of Peace Global Network site. Projects fall into three categories: Personal, Community, Environment.
The initiative is supported by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and King Carl XVI Gustaf, and follows on from the Gifts of Peace initiative to mark the centenary of Scouting in 2007. Funding has been made available to support The Messengers of Peace Support Fund.
Former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo has been appointed as a Messenger of Peace Ambassador by the Africa Scout Region.
Trees For The World
Trees For The World is an international Scouts Messengers of Peace project for Scouts around the world, in which each Scout will plant a tree on the Saturday after Earth Day.
The idea of Trees For The World started during the First Interamerican Leadership Training, with delegates of Argentina, Canada, Curaçao, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the United States brainstorming about the common problems that strike their nations. After a consensus, the creation of a long-term project that involved the Scouts of the world to spread a culture of peace and at the same time give an impact on their community was created. In September 2014, Trees For The World received a Messengers of Peace Hero Award.
The Trees For The World Organizing Committee (TFTWOC) (Spanish: Comité Organizador de Árboles Para El Mundo, COAPEM), founded in February 2014, is the group of Scouts involved in organizing and promoting the project. There are currently 12 TFTWOC members from 10 countries from the Interamerican Scout Region.
Trees For The World 2014 was open from April 26 to September 27, 2014. A total of 14,645 Scouts from 24 countries planted a total number of 57,161 trees.

Duon H. Miller (circa 1894 - 1969) was an American business person, who founded the cosmetics firm Duon, Inc. Miller was most noteworthy for a sustained campaign against the polio vaccine, which Miller felt was a harmful response to a nonexistent disease.
Early life
Donald H. Miller was born circa 1894. They attended the University of Nebraska, working while studying to pay their tuition, but according to their second wife they dropped out after a year to join the armed forces for World War I. At some point they changed their first name to "Duon."
Business dealings
Miller founded Duon, Inc. in their garage in Dayton, Ohio. The company became a prominent cosmetics manufacturer. Its leading product was "Vita-fluff" shampoo, claimed to be the first cream shampoo. Miller claimed they were a "research chemist," and promoted some of their products as medical treatments. These claims about their Vita-fluff, Lovili, and Glamour products led to a 1943 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission requiring them to drop claims that their products cured medical conditions, and to change the name of their subsidiary company, Northern Research Industries, on the grounds that it was not a research institution. In 1945 the FTC seized a shipment of Vita-fluff on the grounds that it continued to misleadingly claim that it could cure dandruff. A further 1952 action by the FTC enforced action against restraint of trade agreements made by Miller. Miller's second wife asserted to the Dayton Daily News that they had represented themselves as a medical doctor, or that they claimed to have attended medical school at Northwestern University and had dropped out there just short of obtaining their MD degree.
Polio and polio vaccine activism
Miller moved to Coral Gables, Florida by the early 1950s and began crusades against soft drinks, sugar and bleached flour. By 1953 Miller was distributing flyers in schools in Key West and claiming that gamma globulin treatments for polio could cause "Negro, Japanese, or other racial characteristics" to appear in descendants of those treated if the treatment had been derived from people of those races. A series of mailings from Miller's organization Polio Prevention, Inc. to Minnesota parents made this statement concerning gamma globulin treatments:
"Just how low can these money-hungry medicos stoop? In their greed for money the plan before a child is born to undermine their health to insure their income permanently. With these damnable cola drinks the 'quacks' have laid a perfect foundation for another child victim of polio (more dollars for the medicos)."
Polio Prevention, Inc. began publishing pamphlets claiming that soft drinks caused polio, Miller claimed that sugar metabolism removed calcium from the body, causing polio. In effect, Miller claimed that polio was sugar-induced calcium deficiency.
Miller was charged in March of 1954 with mail fraud, using the mails to send "libelous, scurrilous and defamatory" material by mail. One mailer was headlined " 'Fake' Polio Vaccine May Kill Your Child! !" Another of Miller's mailers claimed that "thousands of little white coffins will be used to bury victims of Salk's heinous and fraudulent vaccine." Found guilty in 1955, Miller was fined $1000. Attempting to circumvent the mails by using other carriers, Miller was charged with violating probation, and was ordered to completely avoid matters concerning polio prevention.
Miller continued their campaigns against sugar, pasteurization and white flours, writing prolifically to newspapers in support of their causes.
Death
Miller died in 1969 at their home in Coral Gables.

Fürst-Wrede-Kaserne has been a military facility in Munich, Germany, since 1936 when it was built by the Munich Heeresbauamt (army construction bureau) under its original name Verdun-Kaserne. After World War II the U.S. forces renamed it Will Kaserne, and the Bundeswehr renamed it once more in honor of Karl Philipp von Wrede on 17 April 1972.
History
Originally, the fully motorized 7th Anti-Tank Detachment (Panzerabwehrabteilung 7) and an artillery unit used the barracks. After the war the facility was enlarged and renamed by the American troops who occupied it in 1951; the 169th Infantry Regiment, 43rd Division. The 43rd Division only stayed in Germany during the Korean War time. After that, elements of the 24th Division moved into Will Kaserne and stayed there until it was returned to the German government.
In 1969 the Bundeswehr acquired the installation. Until the beginning of the 1990s, the 200th Anti-Aircraft Regiment Flugabwehrregiment 200 (FlaRgt 200), the 200th Drone Battery (Drohnenbatterie 200) and the 4th Company of the 210th Maintenance Battalion Instandsetzungsbataillons 210 (4th InstBtl 210) were stationed there.
In 1993 the 1st and 3rd companies as well as the headquarters of the 760th Feldjäger (Military Police) Battalion moved from Bayern-Kaserne into the barracks. The battalion was renumbered the 451st Feldjäger Bn in 2003. Further users of the barracks have been the 60th Regional Network Control Center (Regionales Netzführungszentrum 60), the 663rd/900th Stationary Signal Center (Festes Fernmeldezentrum der Bundeswehr 663/900), the Kraftfahrausbildungszentrum Munich (motor training center) and Service Team 4 of the Munich Bundeswehr Service Center.
The northern part of the barracks was sold in 2006. Since March 2008, the facility's infrastructure has been redeveloped as part of a public-private partnership project in conjunction with a subsidiary of Hochtief construction company.

From January 1956 until March 1957 Will Kaserne was occupied by the 88th Abn AAA Battalion of the 11th Airborne Division. At that time in 1957 the 88th AAA was deactivated and the members were transferred to other units in the 11th and others.

Bothwell is a conservation village in the South Lanarkshire council area of Scotland. It lies on the north bank of the River Clyde, adjacent to Uddingston and Hamilton, east-south-east of Glasgow city centre.
Description and history
An ancient settlement which was once primarily a mining village, and earlier the site of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679, Bothwell is an affluent commuter town that has attracted a number of local celebrities including several professional footballers. Owing to a steady rise in property prices, Bothwell is one of Glasgow's most prosperous satellites. In 2019, "Earls Gate" which overlooks Bothwell Castle was named Greater Glasgow's most expensive street, with an average price tag of £1,125,000. In 2021 Earls Gate was again named the City's most expensive street; according to the report this extends to the entire West of Scotland.
The houses surrounding the Main Street are of older sandstone Victorian style whereas the newer part of the Bothwell consists of estates built in close proximity to Bothwell Castle and intertwined with Bothwell Castle Golf club. The new houses have significantly increased the population. According to the recent census report 2011, Bothwell has a population of , with the local council ward in combination with Uddingston established a year earlier. The majority of Bothwell's residents own their own property, and household incomes are likely to exceed the national average.
Facilities
Bothwell has two primary schools (the rebuilt Bothwell PS and St Bride's RC PS), a library and a bowling club. There are several small shops and businesses in the town's Main Street, along with a handful of pubs and restaurants. The Bothwell area has many walkways, nature trails, woodlands and greenery. A footbridge links with Blantyre on the opposite bank of the river, and leads directly to the David Livingstone Centre.
The parish church (which was restored at the end of the 19th century) contains the choir of the old Gothic church of 1398. A memorial honours the poet Joanna Baillie (1762–1851) who was born in the manse.
Bothwell Castle
The picturesque ruin of Bothwell Castle occupies a position on a bluff above a bend in the River Clyde on the edge of Bothwell, which here takes the bold sweep famed in Scottish song as the Bothwell bank. This fortress belonged to Sir William Moray, known as 'le Riche', who died in England in 1300. It passed eventually by marriage to the House of Douglas. The lordship was bestowed in 1487 on Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Lord Hailes, 1st Earl of Bothwell. When they resigned in 1491 the title passed to "Bell-the-Cat", Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus. The title ultimately passed to the Earls of Home.
The castle is a fine example of Gothic architecture. It consists of a great quadrangle with circular towers on the south. At the east end stand the remains of the chapel. An unpretentious mansion was built nearby by Archibald Douglas, 1st Earl of Forfar (1653–1712), and was known as New Bothwell Castle, but suffered mining subsidence and was demolished in 1926. The castle can be accessed through scenic Clyde Walkways.
Brighter Bothwell
Brighter Bothwell is a local environmental group, formed in 2000 for the benefit of the whole community of Bothwell. Their objective is to enhance the environment directly through the endeavours of volunteers.
Since the formation of the group, many public areas have been improved and some major projects have been undertaken including the Nature Trail, The Jubilee Garden and The Marion Gilchrist Garden. In the Beautiful Scotland campaign, the group has raised the village to Silver Gilt award standard and, in 2012, Bothwell won the prize as winner of the Small Town category.
Brighter Bothwell has also encouraged the formation of two additional community groups, The Organic Growers of Bothwell and The Bothwell Scarecrow Festival. Working along with Brighter Bothwell, these groups are having a positive impact on the community.
Scarecrow Festival
In the autumn of 2010, inspired by a number of festivals already held in villages across the UK, Brighter Bothwell developed The Bothwell Community Scarecrow Festival to extend and develop the feeling of community in Bothwell and to support the local economy. The first festival took place in September 2011, and subsequently every year after.
The festival has become very popular and the main street is filled with imaginative scarecrows from August onwards. Many local businesses make their own scarecrows, as do the local children whose gardens are also filed with scarecrows at the time of year. Yorkhill Children's foundation is the beneficiary of the event.
During the 2013 festival, a new event was held at Bothwell Primary School called 'The Scarecrow Festival of Transport'. It was intended to be a celebration of transport throughout the ages. Various people from the village donated their automobiles for the event, such as Boyd Tunnock of the local company Tunnock's, and Bentley Glasgow.
Sports
Speedway
Speedway racing was staged in the Bothwell Castle estate area in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The track was constructed on old railway land by club members who used it as a training track. Occasional team matches saw the Bothwell Bulls take on other training venues such as Newtongrange and High Beech.
Tommy Miller, who rose to fame with Glasgow Tigers in 1950, and Ken McKinlay, arguably the best ever Scottish speedway rider, both started out at Bothwell. The venture, safety fence and all, moved to Chapelhall.
Golf Club
Bothwell Castle Golf Club was officially opened on the 16th of June 1923 by the Earl of Home (father of Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home). The course covered a 110-acre site situated between the 13th century castle and the then small village of Bothwell.
In 1960 the club were unable to accept an offer to buy the course, which was purchased by a developer. By 1962, building proposals were in place resulting in the club losing 7 holes for housing, and having to develop new ground to replace these holes. This new section of the course opened in 1973.
The club finally purchased the course in 1976 for £70,000, thereby securing its long-term future.
In 2002, a fire resulted in the complete destruction of the clubhouse. The club decided to build the replacement clubhouse in a new location closer to the centre of the course.
Officially opened in October 2004 by Richard Cole-Hamilton CBE, the Captain of the R&A Golf Club of St Andrews.
In 1997, Lady Member Sheila Beckett produced a book on the history of the Club to commemorate its 75th anniversary.
A flat, 18-hole parkland course, Bothwell is challenging for players at all levels. The building of the new clubhouse has allowed the club to revise the course layout, with several new tee positions and some new greens.

Meridian Mansions, also known as The Envoy, is a historic structure located in the Adams Morgan neighborhood in the Northwest Quadrant of Washington, D.C. A.H. Sonnemann was the architect for what was considered the city's finest apartment hotel when it opened in 1918. The building has been home to members of Congress and diplomats over the years. The lobby contains marble columns and elaborate ornamental molding. At one time the building featured roof pavilions and lamp standards, which were removed around 1963. It was renovated in 1981 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The building is the most notable due to its connection to the establishment of Czechoslovakia as an independent nation. Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the founder and first President of Czechoslovakia, resided here between July and November 1918. The first Czechoslovakian national flag to be created was flown from the building on October 18, 1918.

Mark W. Lee is an American novelist, children's book writer, poet and playwright. They have worked as a war correspondent and some of these real-life experiences have appeared in their fiction.
Early life
Lee was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. They attended Yale University where they became friends with the Pulitzer prize winning poet and novelist Robert Penn Warren. Lee dedicated their first novel to Warren.
After graduating from Yale in 1973, Lee lived in New York City for several years where they worked as a taxi driver, a language teacher and a security guard. In New York, they became friends with artists Frank Moore and Lillian Mulero. Their poetry and nonfiction appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, the Times Literary Supplement and a variety of literary journals.
Lee has always done elaborate research for their literary work. When writing a long poem about Henry Hudson, they walked alone down the eastern shore of Hudson Bay. Their poem, Hudson Bay, 1611, was published in The Sewanee Review.
Journalism
In the early 1980s, Lee traveled to East Africa where they worked as a foreign correspondent for Reuters and The Daily Telegraph. During the civil war that followed the fall of dictator Idi Amin, they were one of the few western journalists living in Uganda. Reporting on the poaching of elephants on the northern Ugandan border, Lee was almost killed by Sudanese soldiers.
After being expelled from Uganda for writing about military atrocities, Lee returned to the United States. They found that they could no longer write poetry and began writing plays and novels.
In 2000, Lee traveled to East Timor and wrote articles about the civil war for the Atlantic Monthly and the Los Angeles Times. .
Plays
Their first play, California Dog Fight, was set at an illegal dog fight the Sacramento delta. It premiered at the Manhattan Theatre Club (1985) and went on to an award-winning production at the Bush Theatre in London.
Lee's next play, Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad, premiered at New Haven's Long Wharf Theatre in 1989. Rebel Armies is about the confrontation between two white journalists and two African prostitutes. It has been performed at many theatres throughout America.

Books
Mark Lee's first novel, The Lost Tribe, was published in 1998 by Picador USA. The book describes an epic journey of Africans and Americans looking for the contemporary descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel. In a review of The Lost Tribe published in the Washington Post Book World, the critic wrote: "Without overwriting, Lee can convey the sprinting pace of a brush fire, the horror of an elephant slaughter, the hair-trigger tenseness of a military checkpoint."
Lee's second novel, The Canal House, was published by Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill in 2003. The critically praised novel is set in Africa, London and East Timor. It describes the dangerous world of war correspondents and aid workers. In the Denver Post, the (reviewer) of The Canal House wrote:"A story presented in prose so fine it nearly sings, peopled with characters who burn themselves into your mind and heart."
Their work appears in Politically Inspired a collection of essays and short stories about the Iraq war published by MacAdam/Cage. In Publishers Weekly, the reviewer wrote:Lee's Memo to Our Journalists is a short, punchy list of editorial precautions to reporters in Iraq. It includes such pithy advice as: "If you and your embedded unit are lost in the countryside and searching for the main road, remember that every adult male in the world lies about most things much of the time. Look for a smart, honest nine-year-old."
Children's Books
On June, 2013, Candlewick Press published Mark Lee's first children's book: Twenty Big Trucks in the Middle of the Street. The book was illustrated by Kurt Cyrus. The Wall Street Journal reviewer wrote: “As mystifying as it may be to their mothers and sisters, small boys tend to be entranced by powerful vehicles. The very fact of trucks—let alone their variety and different purposes—gives a thrill to certain 3- to 6-year-olds. For these children, Mark Lee's Twenty Big Trucks in the Middle of the Street will be handsome entertainment."
Twenty Big Trucks in the Middle of the Street was picked by Amazon.com as one of the Best Children's Books of 2013 for Ages 3–5.
Human rights work
Mark Lee has been deeply involved in freedom of speech and human rights activities for PEN, the international writers' organization.

Data Darbar (also spelt Data Durbar; ), located in the city of Lahore (Punjab, Pakistan), is the largest Sufi shrine in South Asia. It was built to house the remains of Ali Hujwiri, commonly known as Data Ganj Baksh, a Sufi saint from Ghazni in present-day Afghanistan, who is believed to have lived on the site in the 11th century CE.
The site is considered to be the most sacred place in Lahore, and attracts up to one million visitors to its annual urs festival.
Location
Data Darbar is located in the centre of Old City Lahore. Surrounding it are Lower Mall Road, Bhati Gate, Gawalmandi & Karbala Gamay Shah.
History
The shrine was originally established as a simple grave next to the mosque which Ali Hujwiri had built on the outskirts of Lahore in the 11th century. By the 13th century, the belief that the spiritual powers of great Sufi saints were attached to their burial sites was widespread in the Muslim world, and so a larger shrine was built to commemorate the burial site of Hujwiri during the Mughal period. The shrine complex was expanded in the 19th century, and Hujwiri's mosque rebuilt.
The shrine came under Pakistani government control as part of the Auquf Ordinance of 1960, with the official aim of preventing shrine caretakers throughout the country from financially exploiting devotees. The shrine was greatly expanded in the 1980s under the rule of military dictator Zia ul-Haq, during which time the shrine became the largest in South Asia. Offices for NGOs, a library, madrasa, police station, carpark, and offices were all added under their regime. Designated spaces for musical performances, and new free kitchen were also added during that time. New markets have emerged around the site since its massive expansion.
Since 1965, the mehfil-e-sama, a 2-day qawwali music festival, had been held adjacent to the shrine, which in 1992 shifted to a nearby school.
Terror attacks
On 2010, two suicide bombers attacked the shrine. At least 50 people were killed, and 200 others were hurt in the blasts. On 8 May 2019, another blast at the same site killed twelve people included police officials Saddam Hussain, Head Constable Shahid Nazir, Head Constable Muhammad Sohail, Head Constable Gulzar Ahmad, Constable Muhammad Saleem, and security guard Rafaqat Ali near the entrance gate for female visitors.
Architecture
The shrine of Hujwiri is housed in a Mughal era tomb crafted of carved white marble. The tomb is surrounded by a massive marble courtyard, while a new educational institution at the shrine complex utilizes modernist architecture.
Significance
The site is considered to be the most sacred place in Lahore. The shrine has emerged a major economic, political, and social centre in Lahore, and is one of the only places in Lahore where the extremely rich and extremely poor share space together.
It is widely believed among devotees that the saint interred at the shrine is the supreme authority over all Sufi saints in the Indian subcontinent, and that no new Sufi saint could immigrate to the subcontinent without obtaining permission from the spirit of Hujwiri.
Following the establishment of a shrine dedicated to Hujwiri, their tomb was visited by Muslims and non-Muslims in search of their blessings. Illustrious figures such as Baba Farid, Moinuddin Chishti, Nizamuddin Auliya, Dara Shikoh, and Allama Iqbal all paid obeisance to the shrine, and pledged allegiance to Hujwiri. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was a frequent visitor to the shrine.
Hujwiri's teachings were critical of practices associated with South Asian Islam, such as the use of drugs, and dancing. They also taught that Sufi saints were themselves still obliged to the demands of Islam, and so is revered by reformist Muslims who are critical of Sufi practice, as well as traditionalist Muslims who revere Sufi shrines.
Qawwali performances are regularly held at the shrine. On special occasions, the shrine is decorated with lights, dinner is prepared for thousands of visitors, who also partake in dance while musicians play Sufi music for hours. At the boundary of the shrine, Muslim faithfuls recite the Qur'an, and pay tributes to the Prophet Muhammad.
Social services
The shrine provides a wide array of social services which have made it a popular hub for impoverished residents. In a custom that is 1,000 years old, up to 50,000 visitors per day are offered free food at the shrine. Patrons facing personal difficulties frequently donate money or labour to the shrine's free-kitchen fund, in line with Islam's emphasis on feeding the poor. The shrine also provides for students' education in nearby schools, and helps fund local hospitals as part of its social mission.
Access
The shrine remains open at all hours, and welcomes visitors who freely enter the complex. The shrine is visited by approximately 30,000 to 60,000 visitors on a daily basis, though the number can double on religious holidays, and on Thursdays - the traditional night for visiting shrines. Approximately 1,000,000 devotees visit the shrine during its annual urs festival.
The shrine is served by the Bhatti Chowk station of the Lahore Metrobus.
Administration
The shrine is managed as part of an Auqaf foundation as part of the Auqaf Ordinance of 1960. The shrine is managed by approximately 200 full-time workers, excluding security services. The shrine produces the most revenue for the Auqaf board out of all some 400 shrines under its control in Punjab province, and contributes approximately 33% of the board's revenue. The shrine collects 4 times more income than is spent on the shrine's upkeep. Considered to be the centre of all shrines in Punjab, religious practices and sermons are subject to more government regulation than at other shrines in Pakistan.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provides data about OECD countries related to paid parental leave length, average pay rate and full-rate equivalent. Not all countries provide mothers with a pay rate equal to what they would have received if the absence had not occurred.
Rate of basic pay can be defined as fixed pay received through minimum wage law or an administratively-determined wage. Organizations and activists are working to inform, persuade and change pay-rate laws. Women in the workforce are at a disadvantage; regardless of legislation, a global gender pay gap is still visible. The OECD is a primary supplier of research and data pertaining to parental-leave rights.
Background
Parental leave, or family leave, is an employee benefit available in almost all countries. The term "parental leave" may include maternity, paternity, and adoption leave; or may be used distinctively from "maternity leave" and "paternity leave" to describe separate family leave available to either parent to care for small children. In some countries and jurisdictions, "family leave" also includes leave provided to care for ill family members. Often, the minimum benefits and eligibility requirements are stipulated by law.
Unpaid parental or family leave is provided when an employer is required to hold an employee's job while that employee is taking leave. Paid parental or family leave provides paid time off work to care for or make arrangements for the welfare of a child or dependent family member. The three most common models of funding are government-mandated social insurance/social security (where employees, employers, or taxpayers in general contribute to a specific public fund), employer liability (where the employer must pay the employee for the length of leave), and mixed policies that combine both social security and employer liability.
Parental leave has been available as a legal right and/or governmental program for many years, in one form or another. In 2014, the International Labour Organization reviewed parental leave policies in 185 countries and territories, and found that all countries except Papua New Guinea have laws mandating some form of parental leave. A different study showed that of 186 countries examined, 96% offered some pay to mothers during leave, but only 44% of those countries offered the same for fathers. The United States, Suriname, Papua New Guinea, and a few island countries in the Pacific Ocean are the only countries in the United Nations that do not require employers to provide paid time off for new parents. Private employers sometimes provide either or both unpaid and paid parental leave outside of or in addition to any legal mandate.
Research has linked paid parental leave to better health outcomes for children, as well as mothers.
By country
For policies in different countries, see Parental_leave#By_country (note: in many countries there are different types of leave: for example, maternity leave, paternity leave, and parental leave; these terms are often misused or confused). Comparing the length of maternity leave (which is common in international rankings) may say very little about the situation of a family in a specific country. A country for example may have a long maternity leave but a short (or non-existent) parental or family leave, or vice versa. In the European Union, the Pregnant Workers Directive requires at least 14 weeks of maternity leave; while the Work–Life Balance Directive requires at least 10 days of paternity leave, as well as at least 4 months of parental leave, with 2 months being non-transferable.

2004 Cricket World Cup statistics lists all the major statistics and records for the 2003 Cricket World Cup held in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya from 9 February to 24 March 2003.
Talha Jubair became the youngest player to participate in Cricket World Cup. Sri Lanka's clinical demolition of Canada for 36 runs created a new World Cup record for the lowest innings score, a dubious distinction that was, at the time, the lowest score in ODI history. Records tumbled when defending champions Australia took on minnows Namibia, with Glenn McGrath claiming the World Cup's best bowling figures (7/15), a performance that helped Australia defeat Namibia by 256 runs. Team-mate Adam Gilchrist created a new wicket-keeping dismissal record in the same match, with 6. Against Namibia, Indian players Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly recorded the second highest partnership in World Cup cricket (244 runs). India and Australia clashed in a one-sided battle in the final, with Australia creating multiple records (the highest World Cup final score, the highest score by a captain in a World Cup final – Ricky Ponting, most sixes by a batsman – Ponting) in a match; with Australia winning by 125 runs. Tendulkar's 673 runs, the most runs scored in a single World Cup history to date, was the consolation for India as they won the 2003 Cricket World Cup Man of the Series award. The World Cup also saw fielding records in an innings (Mohammad Kaif) and tournament (Ponting). The World Cup broke the record for most sixes in the tournament (with 266), but this was easily surpassed in the 2007 edition (with 373).

On 23 August 2016, Smail Ayad, a 29-year-old French national, carried out a stabbing attack at a backpackers' hostel in Home Hill, Queensland, Australia. The attack caused the death of two people and a dog, and left one person injured.
It was alleged that Ayad used the Arabic phrase "Allahu akbar" both during the attack and their arrest, and while police had ruled out any links to extremism, they were still investigating whether they had a romantic interest in victim Mia Ayliffe-Chung. Police have indicated Ayad had used cannabis on the night of the attack. They also sang the French national anthem during the attack.
On 25 August 2016, Ayad was charged with the crimes of murder, attempted murder, serious animal cruelty and serious assault. On 27 October 2016, Ayad's trial was adjourned to Mental Health Court, as a result of determining a preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia. This diagnosis was confirmed by the Mental Health Court on 5 April 2018, resulting in the criminal charges being dropped and an order was made to detain them in The Park Centre for Mental Health in Brisbane for treatment.
Attack
Ayad attacked Mia Ayliffe-Chung, their roommate, as they lay in their bunk.
A man of Arabic descent armed with a large knife dragged a young woman from their bed at the hostel and out onto a balcony. They held the knife to their throat and told other guests who had now gathered to leave the area. On hearing the commotion, the hostel manager appeared on the balcony and began to approach the armed offender. Another guest arrived and pleaded with the offender to drop the weapon. The offender inflicted a wound to the young woman and, after they fell to the floor, they continued to assault them with the knife. The hostel manager attempted to reach the injured woman but was wounded in the leg by the offender. The young woman got to their feet and ran down a corridor towards the safety of a bathroom. They were followed by another guest who had called 000.
Without thinking of their own safety, Tom Jackson ran upstairs to the bathroom to assist the injured woman. After applying pressure to their substantial wounds, Mr Jackson and the other man began to move them from the cubicle and out of the bathroom. On opening the door to the bathroom, Mr Jackson was confronted by the armed offender. They attempted to close the door, but the offender kicked it open and entered the bathroom.
The offender began to assault Mr Jackson with the knife, inflicting severe wounds. The other guest quickly left the bathroom, yelling for assistance.
Ayad then chased the hostel's pet dog, Atari, around the yard stabbing the dog until it died. British backpacker Tom Jackson died in hospital several days later. Ayad continued to scream "Allahu akbar" as police officers worked to subdue them and threatened to taser him, injuring several officers. Jackson and another guest, Daniel Richards, were subsequently awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for their efforts to aid Ayliffe-Chung. Moreover, on 24 March 2021, Tom Jackson was also honored posthumously with the Star of Courage, one of Australia's highest bravery awards, for displaying extraordinary selflessness during the attack.
Victims
Both Ayliffe-Chung and the dog Atari died at the scene. Jackson suffered critical injuries in the attack, as they had been stabbed in one of their eyes and their brain, and died five days later in hospital. Schultz, an official at the hostel, suffered stab wounds to the leg.
Attacker
Smail Ayad, who was 29 at the time of the murders, is a French national. Ayad went out drinking once a week, like many backpackers, where on Saturday nights they would travel to Ayr for rum or beer with other Frenchmen.
Since their arrest, they have been transferred from Stuart prison to a secure mental health facility in Brisbane.
Ayad was initially charged with Ayliffe-Chung's murder, the attempted murders of Jackson and Schultz, and a charge of animal cruelty. An additional 12 counts of assaulting police were laid a few days later arising from their attack on the police officers who had subdued him. One of the attempted murder charges was upgraded to murder after Jackson died.
On 5 April 2018, the Queensland Mental Health Court determined that Ayad was of unsound mind at the time of the killings. Four psychiatrists found they had paranoid schizophrenia whilst believing they were the target of an international conspiracy to kill him. As a result, the criminal charges were dropped against Ayad as it could not be proven they had an intent to kill. The court directed Ayad to be detained in The Park Centre for Mental Health for treatment.
On 1 July 2020, coroner Nerida Wilson confirmed the preliminary findings, but also told that an inquest would be useless, since it only could come to exactly the same conclusion. Meanwhile, Ayad is still waiting for repatriation to France.
Responses
The Islamic Council of Queensland criticised media reports for quickly linking use of this phrase with Islamic terrorism. On 25 August 2016, the authorities were confident the stabbings were not an act of terrorism. Several backpackers who have stayed at Home Hill before the double murder spoke out against the violence that had broken out previously and the drinking culture among the backpackers. The town was called "Hell Hill" even before the murder incident and one former resident warned others to "avoid it at all costs". Ayliffe-Chung's mother, Rosie Ayliffe, came to Australia for their daughter's cremation and began to investigate working conditions on Australian farms.

Carolina Pascual Gracia (born June 17, 1976, in Orihuela, Alicante, Spain) is a former Spanish Individual Rhythmic Gymnast.  They are the 1992 Olympics silver medalist and the 1993 European all-around bronze medalist.
Career
Pascual was doing ballet when at age seven their ballet teacher told their mother that their daughter had excellent qualities for Rhythmic Gymnastics. There was not a club in their town so, their mother drove for around an hour to get Pascual to and from training sessions at the Escuela de Competición in Murcia. Pascual later went to the Atlético Montemar in Alicante.
Pascual got their breakthrough in 1990 when Spain's head coach, Emilia Boneva, selected Pascual for the National Team. The newcomer was sent to the 1990 European Championships, where they helped the Spanish team win the bronze medal. They also placed 12th in the all-around and qualified for two event finals.
All the sacrifices that were made paid off when in 1990 Emilia Boneva selected them for the National Team. Pascual was one of Spain's most successful Rhythmic Gymnasts, and the first to get an Olympic medal. At the awards ceremony, bronze medalist Oksana Skaldina refused to acknowledge the podium results. Pascual is one of the few non-Eastern European rhythmic gymnasts to have successful career and medal at the Olympics.
An injured Pascual sat out at the 1992 World Championships, but came back for a bronze All-around medal at 1993 European Cup. But they struggled at the 1993 World Championships and finished 7th in All-around. Still, they would take silver with clubs behind teammate Carmen Acedo. They retired from the sport after the Alicante World Championships in 1993.
As a gymnast they stand out because of their difficult and expressive routines with great back flexibility, and inventive skills.  They are now a coach, at Club IMD in Orihuela.

Ganga and Jamuna Shreshta were a pair of Nepali conjoined twins who underwent surgery in Singapore to separate them in 2001.
The Shreshta twins were born in the town of Khalanga in western Nepal, and named for India's sacred rivers. Their surgery took more than 100 hours, triple the previous record and was made possible by advanced computer imaging which had never been used before in Singapore. Although both survived the surgery, believed to be only the second of its kind, they had varying degrees of impairment. Ganga subsequently died in 2008 of pneumonia and meningitis.
In 2016, a book was published in Singapore about their lives.

Khutulun ( – ), also known as Aigiarne, Aiyurug, Khotol Tsagaan or Ay Yaruq () was a Mongol noblewoman and wrestler, the most famous daughter of Kaidu, a cousin of Kublai Khan. Them father was "most pleased by their abilities", and they accompanied them on military campaigns. Both Marco Polo and Rashid al-Din Hamadani wrote accounts of their encounters with them
Life
Khutulun was born about 1260. By 1280, their father Kaidu became the most powerful ruler of Central Asia, reigning in the realms from western Mongolia to Oxus, and from the Central Siberian Plateau to India.
Marco Polo described Khutulun as a superb warrior, one who could ride into enemy ranks and snatch a captive as easily as a hawk snatches a chicken. They assisted their father in many battles, particularly against the Yuan Dynasty of their cousin the Great Khan – Kublai (r. 1260–1294).
Khutulun insisted that any man who wished to marry them must defeat them in wrestling. Winning horses from competitions and the wagers of would-be suitors, it is said that they gathered a herd numbering ten thousand.
Sources vary about their husband's identity. Some chronicles say their husband was a handsome man who failed to assassinate their father and was taken prisoner; others refer to them as Kaidu's companion from the Choros clan. Rashid al-Din wrote that Khutulun fell in love with Ghazan, Mongol ruler in Persia.
Of all Kaidu's children, Khutulun was the favorite, and the one from whom they most sought advice and political support. According to some accounts, they tried to name them as their successor to the khanate before they died in 1301. However, their choice was declined due to their male relatives. When Kaidu died, Khutulun guarded their tomb with the assistance of their brother Orus. They were challenged by their other brothers including Chapar and relative Duwa because they resisted their succession. They died in 1306.
In popular culture
Khutulun is thought to be the basis for the character of Turandot, who has been the subject of a number of Western works. While in Mongol culture they are remembered as a famous athlete and warrior, in Western artistic adaptations they are depicted as a proud woman who finally succumbs to love.
François Pétis de la Croix's 1710 book of Asian tales and fables contains a story in which Khutulun is called Turandot, a Persian word (Turandokht توراندخت) meaning "Central Asian Daughter", and is the nineteen-year-old daughter of Altoun Khan, the Mongol emperor of China. In Pétis de La Croix's story, however, they do not wrestle their suitors, and they do not wager horses; rather, they have them answer three riddles, and they are executed if they cannot solve them.
Carlo Gozzi wrote their own version 50 years later, a stage play in which they were a "tigerish woman" of "unrelenting pride". Friedrich Schiller translated and adapted the play into German as Turandot, Prinzessin von China in 1801.
The most famous version of Turandot is Giacomo Puccini's operatic version, which they were working on when they died in 1924.
There are many stories and novels about Khutulun presented by Mongolian writers, such as Khotolon by Purev Sanj, Kaidu's wonderful daughter Khutulun by Ch.Janchivdorj, Khotol Tsagaan by Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, The Story of Kaidu Khan by Batjargal Sanjaa, and Princess Khutulun by B. Shuudertsetseg.
Khutulun is portrayed by Claudia Kim in the Netflix series Marco Polo.
Khutulun was the name chosen for a popular racehorse in Australia 2011–2019, which was bought by Grand Syndicates for just A$16,000 and eventually won nearly A$500,000 in prize money.
On 3 December 2021, Shuuder Productions and Voo Broadcasting released the film Princess Khutulun. The movie is based on the novel Khotol Tsagaan Gunj by Mongolian author Baatarsuren Shuudertsetseg and takes place during the Yuan Dynasty. Actress Tsedoo Munkhbat played the starring role.

Sonny Fox (November 1, 1946 – August 14, 2020) was an American DJ born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, who hosted the uncensored comedy channel on XM Radio, now Sirius XM, until their death in 2020. They fronted a rock and roll group, "Jay Walker And The Jay Hawkers" in the mid- to late-1960s, playing venues across Michigan. Regional hits included "Love Have Mercy" and "Baby Blue," both on LyKe (sic) Til records.
Biography
Jay Walker and the Jay Hawkers played at the graduation celebration for the 1966 Arthur Hill High School party at the Saginaw YMCA. In the late 1960s, Sonny Fox/Jay Walker obtained a job as a disc jockey on WKNX (1210 AM) in Saginaw, Michigan. Legend has it that they obtained their first on-air job when they were promoting a 'Jay Walker And The Jayhawkers' 45-record at various Michigan radio stations. WKNX hired them when they expressed interest in "...getting back into radio..." They meant that they had been in numerous stations promoting their group's records. The music director at WKNX assumed they were referring to actual on-air experience. WKNX was a 10,000-watt daytime radio station, meaning it was only able to broadcast during daylight hours. In the winter, hours were short. As summer approached, hours expanded, requiring the addition of another disc jockey. So Jay Walker (Sonny Fox) arrived on the WKNX airwaves. Between 1970 and 1972, Sonny was featured in the midday shift at CHUM in Toronto as Johnny Mitchell. In 1972, Fox took over the noon-to-3 PM shift at KHJ in Los Angeles. With the rise in popularity of FM radio, they left after one year and joined current XM Radio executive Lee Abrams to work as program director at both WYSP in Philadelphia and WKTU in New York, where they and Abrams developed the Superstars Album format.
After 4 years with WYSP, Sonny opted to change directions and moved to Miami to work in the morning radio there at Y100, WHYI. They created radio's first syndicated stand up comedy show, The Comedy Hour. The show featured back-to-back routines from the top comics of the day such as Bill Cosby, George Carlin, and Lenny Bruce. In 1999, Fox created "The Mp3 Comedy Network" a service that delivered comedy programming to morning radio programs across the country.
As they were launching the new service, Lee Abrams, then head of programming at XM Satellite Radio approached Fox to ask if they would be interested in reviving their comedy show programming skills in a new environment. Sonny took over as Program Director in November 2002, overseeing operations of both XM Comedy (Channel 150) and Laugh USA (Channel 96).

The natural history of Australia has been shaped by the geological evolution of the Australian continent from Gondwana and the changes in global climate over geological time. The building of the Australian continent and its association with other land masses, as well as climate changes over geological time, have created the unique flora and fauna present in Australia today.
Precambrian
Three areas of the Australian landmass that are made of Archaean rocks are more than 2.5 billion years old, among the oldest known rocks. These igneous and metamorphic rocks are found in the Yilgarn (West) and Pilbara (North) cratons in today's Western Australia and the Gawler (South) craton which makes up the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. During the Proterozoic, 2,500 to 545 Ma, continent building took place around the existing cratons; the accretions include sedimentary deposition of the banded iron formations and the formation of Australia's major orebodies - sources of gold, copper, lead, zinc, silver and uranium. These disparate landmasses are thought to have become associated by the tectonic collisions that formed the supercontinent Rodinia, between 1300 to 1100 Ma. Geological evidence suggests that the West Australian cratons collided first, followed by collision with the South Australian craton between ~830 and 750 Ma. The Centralian Superbasin formed the junction of the North, South and West cratons.
Rodinia broke up between 830 to 745 Ma; at around 750 Ma the western side of Rodinia called Laurentia broke away from the landmass made from Australia, India and Antarctica, forming a gap that would become the Pacific Ocean.
The Archean rocks from the Pilbara craton contain some of the first evidence of life, primitive cyanobacterial mats known as stromatolites. Soft-bodied organisms from the Ediacaran collectively known as the Ediacaran biota are found in sandstone around the Flinders Ranges in South Australia, notably at a site known as Wilpena Pound.
Gondwana
Following the breakup of Rodinia, Australia, India and Antarctica made up a large landmass. During plate movements from 750 to 500 Ma South America and Africa moved toward India and Australia, and by 500 Ma South America and Africa had joined with them to form Gondwana.
During the Palaeozoic, 545 to 251 Ma, the present landmass of Australia saw two stages of geological development. From 545 to 390 Ma shallow warm seas covered parts of central Australia, with a series of volcanic arcs and deep water sedimentation in the east. During this period between 480 to 460 Ma the Larapinta Seaway extended across the centre of Australia. Cycles of sedimentation and volcanism formed new continental crust, forming eastern Australia. There was a major orogeny in eastern Australia from 387 to 360 Ma. The continent was affected by glaciation around 330 Ma.
The continents that had drifted away from Rodinia drifted together again during the Paleozoic: Gondwana, Euramerica, and Siberia/Angara collided to form the supercontinent of Pangea during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, some 350 million years ago. Pangea was a short-lived supercontinent; it began to break apart again in the early Jurassic. While Pangea existed it created opportunities for intermixing of the flora and fauna.
During the Carboniferous glaciation, erosion by ice extended into the Early Permian. Crustal extension and subsidence around 295 Ma formed shallow basins in which thick coal deposits were formed.
During the Mesozoic, when the Earth became much warmer, 251 to 140 Ma, the Australian landmass was covered with riverine plains. Humid conditions allowed the formation of peatlands, particularly in the east. Dinosaurs, reptiles and primitive mammals were present in Australia. Between 140 and 99 Ma sea levels rose and much of the continent was covered. In the same period (between 120 - 105 Ma) there was more volcanism in eastern Australia, leading to uplift creating the Tasman Sea to the southeast and the Coral Sea to the north.
The earliest land plants preserved in Australia occur in deposits from the Upper Silurian and the Lower Devonian in marine sediments in Victoria, named the Baragwanathia Assemblage for its most prominent element, the simple vascular plant the lycopod Baragwanathia. The assemblage also included Rhyniophyta, Zosterophyllophyta, and Trimerophyta in addition to other lycopods. All these plants were herbaceous, coastal and required an aqueous environment for reproduction. During the Devonian the first shrub-sized to tree-sized lycopods appeared in Australia and Antarctica; they dominated the flora until the Early Carboniferous. In the mid- to Late Carboniferous, as Australia drifted from equatorial latitudes to polar latitudes, the lycopods waned and were replaced by seed-ferns, and the Nothorhacopteris-Fedekurtzia-Botrychiopis complex.
Most of the modern Australian fauna had its origin in the Cretaceous. From pollen records from the Late Cretaceous it is proposed that the flora of the Cretaceous either evolved within the Austro-Antarctic region or entered Australia from Antarctica. Angiosperms evolved in the northern Gondwana/southern Laurasia during the Early Cretaceous and radiated worldwide. Prominent members of this early angiosperm flora were the Nothofagus.
Fossils found at Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, suggest that 110 million years ago Australia supported a number of different monotremes, but did not support any marsupials. Marsupials appear to have evolved during the Cretaceous in the contemporary northern hemisphere, to judge from a 100-million-year-old marsupial fossil, Kokopellia, found in the badlands of Utah. Marsupials would then have spread to South America and Gondwana. The first evidence of marsupials in Australia comes from the Tertiary, and was found at a 55-million-year-old fossil site at Murgon, near Kingaroy in southern Queensland. The Murgon fossil site has yielded a range of marsupial fossils, many with strong South American connections — unsurprising since the two continents were both a part of Gondwana. At Murgon evidence of a placental mammal, a Condylarth (Tingamarra porterorum), was discovered. Placental mammals were also found in North America and South America at this time. This find suggests that placental mammals did coexist with marsupials in Australia in the early Tertiary, although only marsupials persisted.
Isolation
It was not until the Devonian period (419–359 Ma) that we see the first great diversification of fishes living within Australian freshwater basins and in marginal marine embayments. Australia has a rich fossil record of early amphibians which first appeared here around 370–375 Ma, based on well-preserved ‘tetrapod' trackways at Genoa River, Victoria. The fossil record of reptiles in Australia starts in the Mesozoic Era (250–66 Ma). The oldest of these remains are of Triassic age and comprise a few superficially lizard-like taxa such as prolacertids (eg Kadimakara), and thecodonts. The earliest significant Australian bird fossil is that of a small primitive flying bird (an enantiornithine), known from one leg bone, Nanatius eos, found in 110 Ma marine sediments in Queensland. Two of the world's three major groups of extant mammals had their origin in the Australian part of the Gondwana supercontinent, the monotremes and marsupials. The oldest mammal fossils from Australia are monotreme fossils from the Cretaceous of Southern Australia. These lived at a time when Australia was part of a small Gondwana (also including Antarctica and New Zealand) which was beginning to drift apart. They are based on isolated jaws and postcranial bones from Lightning Ridge, New South Wales and southern Victoria sites (near Inverloch), dated at between 120 and 110 Ma. Several taxa (Teinolophos, Bishops) existed alongside primitive tribosphenic mammals like Ausktribosphenos.
Australia separated from Gondwana 99 Ma, and initially remained warm and humid with rainforest vegetation. Inland Australia had systems of rivers and lakes with abundant wildlife. Fossil birds, platypus, frogs and snakes are present from this period. From 30 Ma there was a period of global cooling, and from 15 Ma the Antarctic ice sheet formed. Sand deserts and large inland salt lakes formed within the last 5 Ma. Climatic oscillation during the Pleistocene over the last million years led to repeated phases of glaciation with lower sea levels that linked Australia to New Guinea, and warmer interglacial periods with higher sea levels.
As early as the Miocene (23 to 5.3 Ma) and into the Pleistocene (20,000-50,000 years before present) the Australian megafauna developed. The megafauna became extinct in the late Pleistocene, at a time coinciding with both a period of climate change and the first human habitation of Australia. Recent analysis suggests that the fire-stick farming methods of the Australian Aborigines reduced plant diversity and contributed to the extinction of large herbivores with a specialised diet, like the flightless birds from the genus Genyornis. The World Heritage-listed Naracoorte Caves in South Australia are the best record of the Australian megafauna. The placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the Pleistocene, as Australia continued to move closer to Indonesia, both bats and rodents appearing reliably in the fossil record. The geographic isolation of Australia created a sharp division between Australian fauna and Asian fauna at the Wallace Line.

Fortune-499 is a role-playing video game in which the player takes on the role of an oracle working in the "magical resources" department of an unnamed corporation, and has to prevent an acquisition by monsters after the company makes an initial public offering. In-game combat is card-based and takes the form of rock paper scissors matches. The game was initially released for Windows in February 2018.
Gameplay
Fortune-499 is a card-based role-playing game. The player takes on the role of Cassie, short for Cassandra, an oracle working in the "magical resources" department of an unnamed corporation. After the company makes an initial public offering, monsters begin appearing, and Cassie has to use their powers as an oracle to prevent a merger and acquisition by the monsters by fighting them.
The turn-based battle system of Fortune-499 takes the form of rock paper scissors matches, which the player can influence using spells of which Cassie is capable (including buffs and debuffs as well as damage-dealing effects). Additionally, the player can draw up to four cards per turn from a deck to predict the likelihood of the opponent using rock, paper, or scissors, and also to boost MP or HP. The player moves through various rooms, in which some environmental puzzles are also included. Some rooms have photocopiers which allow the player to print additional cards, paper shredders to remove cards from the deck, or filing cabinets to change the order of cards in the deck.
Development
Developed by AP Thomson, who previously created Beglitched, and co-developed and -designed by Jenny Jiao Hsia who also assisted with Beglitched, Fortune-499 was released for PC on February 2, 2018. It has a minimalist and retro art style that uses pastel colors and simple lines, and a soundtrack made up of guitars with an audio filter.
Release
Fortune-499 was initially exclusively available through Humble Bundle, and was made available on Steam and Itch.io later in 2018. In June 2020, it was included in the "Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality" on Itch.io. It is playable on Microsoft Windows and macOS.
Reception
In VentureBeat, Stephanie Chan gave Fortune-499 a score of 88/100, praising the gameplay, dialogue, and Cassie character while criticizing the facts that dialogue is unskippable and that finishing the game took only four hours. Suggesting that more development of Cassie's character arc might have been beneficial, Chan concluded that the game was "a charming package. It's got witchcraft, mid-20s malaise, and puns and witty monsters galore [...] It's a fantastic blend of nostalgia and modern sensibilities, with terrific art and soundtrack to boot."
In Kotaku, Heather Alexandra described Fortune-499 as short but fun, writing that "it holds the player's attention and is worth checking out." In PC Gamer, Jessica Famularo praised the sound design and card-based battle system, describing the game as "quite a pleasant surprise" and writing that it "packs a lot of personality into its short playtime, weaving an effective story of capitalist humdrum".
Fortune-499 received an honorable mention for Excellence in Narrative at the 2019 Independent Games Festival.

The Cathedral of St Michael and St George is the home of the Anglican Diocese of Grahamstown in Makhanda in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. It is the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Grahamstown. The cathedral is located on Church Square and has the tallest spire in South Africa . The cathedral is dedicated to St Michael and St George and celebrates its patronal festival on the Sunday closest to Michaelmas (29 September).
History
The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel had voted £500 in 1820 for the erection of a church in Cape Town, this gift was declined by the Governor, Lord Charles Somerset. However, while they were in England next year, they wrote to Lord Bathurst, the Secretary of State for War (who administered the colonies), asking them to obtain the £500 for Grahamstown, where
The Society very generously agreed, and voted the £500 for Grahamstown, the balance of the money needed was supplied by the colonial treasury. Plans were prepared by W Jones, a land surveyor of Cape Town, and the building erected by George Gilbert also of Cape Town. Sir George Cory thus summarizes the agreement entered into by these persons, and dated 9 September 1824:
It was later decided to use zinc for the roof instead of thatch at an additional cost of Rds 4,730 (£354 15s.). Even so, the roof caused further delays in the completion of the building, which was not opened until 1830. The new church was of course not consecrated, but it bore the name of St George's. The fragment of it that remains, the south wall, is the oldest piece of English Church architecture in the country.
William Geary, the first Colonial Chaplain of Grahamstown (who was appointed and removed by Bathurst), reached the scene of their labours in February 1823. The Colonial Chaplain was frankly a member of the civil service, all collection plate moneys received were paid straight into the public treasury, and when the Chaplain needed anything, they had to apply for it through the same channel as any other civil servant.
An interesting figure reached Grahamstown in 1833. This was John Heavyside, a missionary of S.P.G. in India. After doing duty at Stellenbosch and elsewhere, they were appointed acting Chaplain at Grahamstown, the appointment being made permanent in 1838. At the time of their arrival, St George's had developed so far as to have a slightly more ecclesiastical form of administration than the landdrost. This was the Church Committee, which probably came into existence at the time the building was opened. Members were appointed by the Government, on the recommendation of the committee. This method of administration was changed by the Church Ordinance of 1839 (during the governorship of Sir George Napier), which remained in force until 1891. The ordinance is an imposing document,
They were to elect churchwardens out of their own number. The "officiating minister for the time being" (there is no word as to their appointment, which was still in the hands of Government) was to preside at all meetings of the vestry. The vestry took over all powers and possessions of the church committee, and was made a corporation capable of suing and being sued. In 1841 the meaning of the words "holding, communion" was queried, and the Attorney-General decided that they did not mean what they said, but that any one professing to be a churchman was a full member of the Church. Governors and colonial chaplains and landdrosts obtaining communion vessels and Royal Engineers (they inspected the building of the church) and pew-rents and church ordinances and secretaries of state for war-it is a queer, mad sort of story
Robert Gray was consecrated as Bishop of Cape Town on St Peter's Day in 1847. They arrived in South Africa on 20 February 1848 and visited Grahamstown on 5 October 1848. At a meeting with the vestry of St George's the bishop explained that they could not consecrate the church as it was not yet conveyed to the see. On 7 June 1849
Another visitation followed and on 21 September 1850 they consecrated the church and churchyard. "The church was full, the parishioners appearing to take a deep interest in the matter."
Conflict
The Diocese of Grahamstown was founded in 1853 with John Armstrong as the first bishop. During the oversight of Bishop Nathaniel Merriman when Frederick Henry Williams was dean, conflict arose between the two regarding the status of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa versus the Church of England and the validity of the appointments of bishops. Dean Williams then excluded Bishop Merriman from their cathedral. This action resulted in many court cases which Williams won.
Various schemes had been discussed from time to time for the building of a more worthy cathedral, but nothing was done until 1874, when it was discovered that the original tower, in which the town clock had been placed, was in danger. Dean Williams set about the work of collecting funds and was loyally supported by the vestry. Plans were prepared for the tower and spire as part of a complete new building by Sir George Gilbert Scott, at that time the most notable leader of the Gothic revival. They made a free gift to Grahamstown of the various plans and working details and the building of the "Public Clock Tower", as it was called, was carried through by the committee without employing a contractor. The tower and spire were finished in 1878.
Merriman died in 1882 and was succeeded by Allan Becher Webb, then Bishop of Bloemfontein. Webb was elected on 7 March 1883. Dean Williams would not recognise Webb as bishop either so, in November 1883, Webb set up their throne in an iron building (formerly a skating rink) on the site of the present post office to which the name of St Michael's Pro-Cathedral was given. But after Williams's death in August 1885, negotiations between the bishop and the select vestry were begun. Webb became "officiating minister" (the term used in the Church Ordinance) of St George's and officiated at the services on Christmas Day in 1885. After the reconciliation, the building was repaired and Webb began to collect funds for carrying the erection of a worthy cathedral one stage further. After attending the Lambeth Conference of 1888, they returned with £3,000 collected in England. The plans for the chancel were prepared by John Oldrid Scott while William White-Cooper acted as superintending architect and designed several of the fittings. The foundation-stone was laid by Henry Loch, the Governor of the Colony, on 29 January 1890. The completed structure was consecrated by the Bishop Webb on All Saints' Day in 1893 in the presence of the Metropolitan, West Jones, and other bishops.
A new nave, designed by John Oldrid Scott, was dedicated in 1912, just eight days short of the centenary of the establishment of Grahamstown. It is Victorian neo-gothic in style, with a granite and sandstone exterior, plastered interior walls with marble pillars. The building of the cathedral was finally completed in 1952 with the addition of the Lady Chapel. It can accommodate about 500 people.
Deanery
The deanery is a large Victorian house set in its own grounds adjacent to the cathedral hall. It has reception rooms and a study for the dean on the ground floor and completely private quarters above. There is an additional "bed-sit" attached which is suitable for short-term guests of the parish or the dean. The sub-deanery is a modern four-bedroom house with adequate reception rooms, a very small study, a garage and its own entrance, backing on to the deanery.
Historical controversy
The cathedral was the religious center of the community of Grahamstown. Graham's Town was originally a military outpost on the Eastern Frontier of the Cape Colony. It was founded by Colonel John Graham, who led an expeditionary force to drive the Xhosa back beyond the Fish River in an effort that the first Governor of the Cape Colony, Lieutenant-General John Cradock, characterized as involving no more bloodshed "than was necessary to impress on the minds of these savages a proper degree of terror and respect". A number of the battles of the Xhosa Wars were centred around Grahamstown.
The cathedral became the primary location for memorials to those fallen combatants of the conflicts between the original residents of the lands and the European settlers. Many of these memorials refer to the opposition in the battles, using terms which are no longer acceptable in the Rainbow Nation of South Africa. Today, these memorial plaques are covered as an acknowledgement of the diversity in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. Nevertheless, the early days of the Anglican church in Grahamstown demonstrates the unstable nature of the relationship between the indigenous peoples and the settlers and the ongoing process of reconciliation in South Africa. A quote from John Armstrong, the first bishop of Grahamstown attests to this controversial history:
Dean of Grahamstown
The Dean of Grahamstown is the incumbent of the cathedral. The dean has other duties and roles set out in the "Deed of Constitution and Statutes of the Chapter of the Cathedral of St Michael and St George, Grahamstown" which is an appendix to the acts of the Diocese of Grahamstown. The 21st and current dean is Mzinzisi Dyantyi who was appointed in 2021.
Bells
History
The first ring of bells to be installed in Africa was hung in the cathedral tower in 1879. The bells, an octave cast by John Warner and Sons in London, were supplied complete with fittings and with a frame of English oak. The chancel was consecrated by Bishop Webb on 1 November 1893 and was dedicated to both St George and St Michael to mark the healing of a historic breach in the diocese. In 1902 remedial work was undertaken on the bell frame and fittings in the tower.
The frame was assembled in the tower by local labour but not, apparently, in the way in which Warners had intended. Henry Carter Galpin, a local clockmaker, had been employed by the town council to install the town clock in the cathedral tower. They wished it to strike on bells other than those intended by Warners and modified the frame accordingly, placing one bell in a subsidiary frame raised above the other bells. As a result, seven of the eight bells swung in the same direction. This made the bells extremely difficult to ring and it is probable that they were only, initially, swung chimed. In 1887 it was reported that the joint of the bell frame "require tightening up throughout".
In 1902 remedial work was undertaken on the bell frame and fittings and a band was in training under the tuition of a "Cape Town expert", a Mr Stephens. In 1903 the ringers were "Mr Lancaster (Captain), Dr Drury, Messrs G. Barnes, Charles Cory, Huntly and Walker". The bell frame, however, still gave trouble and ringing ceased in 1913.
In 1959 "Mr Eardley from Stoke-on-Trent ... fitted new ropes" and undertook sufficient maintenance to enable four bells to be rung. In 1968 a change ringing band was formed under the tuition of Paul Spencer, who had learned to ring at Armitage Bridge in Yorkshire, and Bill Jackson, who had learned at Dalton-in-Furness in Lancashire.
In 1993, supported by Rhodes University, the bells were rehung in a new steel frame donated by Koch's Cut and Supply Steel Centre of Pinetown, Durban, with new headstocks provided by Eayre and Smith (Overseas) Ltd, now part of John Taylor & Co. The frame was designed by Dr Ray Ayres with pits for ten bells and was assembled in the tower by local labour guided by Dave Webster of Eayre and Smith and by Colin Lewis. The first peal on the bells was rung on 17 December 1995, conducted by Alan Regin in 3 hours and 12 minutes: Cambridge Surprise Major.
In 1997 two trebles, cast the previous year in London at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, were added to the ring. The first peal on the ten was rung on 4 April 1998, conducted by Timothy G. Pett in 3 hours 19 minutes: Cambridge Surprise Royal.
By the end of 2000, five peals and 27 quarter-peals had been rung on the bells.

The band presently ring call-changes and Plain Hunts on Sundays from 18:00–18:55. Rhodes University used to offer a course leading to the Certificate in Change Ringing.
Bell ringing at Hillandale
The Cathedral band also ring at Hillandale, some from Grahamstown, where there is a light-weight ring of four bells at the Monastery of the Order of the Holy Cross that was installed in 1999. Ringing there is under the direction of the Cathedral Ringing Master. By the end of July 2001, four quarter-peals had been rung at Hillandale, all by the Cathedral band.

This is a list of all the recorded matches played by the Bhutan national football team, which represents Bhutan in international men's football. Bhutan play their home games at the national stadium, Changlimithang. It is one of the younger national teams in the world having played its first match in 1982.
1980s
Some sources suggest that Bhutan regularly sent international teams to compete in tournaments abroad from the 1960s. However, it is not known the extent to which these were genuinely international teams or merely representative teams, as many of the players are said not to have been of Bhutanese origin. Regardless of their nature, none of the results of any of these hinted at tournaments are known, with the first recorded instance of Bhutan playing an international match being against Nepal in the ANFA Cup in 1982. After this match, the team regularly participated in the football tournaments held as part of the South Asian Games, however, they were generally unsuccessful and indeed failed to score a competitive goal against international opposition between 1982 and 1987.
1982
1984
1985

1987
1990s
Following their regular appearances at the South Asian Games during the 1980s, Bhutan disappeared completely from the international stage for some twelve years resurfacing only at the end of the 1990s to compete again at the South Asian Games. Their time away from competitive football had done nothing to strengthen the team as they lost all of their games at the tournament for a fourth consecutive time.
1999
2000s
2000
Following nearly twenty years of competition restricted to South Asia, Bhutan entered a continental competition for the first time, competing in the qualifying rounds for the AFC Asian Cup. This series of matches was arguably the nadir of Bhutanese football as they lost heavily not only against relative minnows Yemen and Turkmenistan, but suffered the ignominy of a then world record 20–0 defeat to Kuwait.
2001
2002
Just over twenty years since their debut on the international stage, Bhutan recorded their first win, a victory over Montserrat in a game organised by a Dutch advertising agency, and sanctioned by FIFA to coincide with the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final.
2003
They were unable initially to continue this form into the next edition of the SAFF Championship, but following a disappointing performance in those games, they were comparatively successful in the preliminary round of Qualifying for the AFC Asian Cup. Hosting Guam and Mongolia, they recorded a 6–0 win over Guam and a 0–0 draw with Mongolia to set a new record victory margin the first time that the side gained positive results in two consecutive competitive games and their best set of results until the two victories over Sri Lanka in 2015. They qualified for the next round where they were outclassed in all games by stronger opposition.
2005
2006
Bhutan gained only their third positive competitive result, and their first in the AFC Challenge Cup in a 0–0 draw with Brunei, although this was not enough to see them through to the next stage.
2007
Two friendly games against Tibet saw Bhutan gain a win and a draw from two matches for only the second time in their history. However, although these matches are counted in the official Elo ratings, Tibet are not a member of FIFA and so these matches do not count in the official FIFA rankings.
2008
A further creditable 1–1 draw was gained against Brunei in an otherwise unsuccessful AFC Challenge Cup qualification campaign. However, later in the year Bhutan achieved arguably their best ever performance in an official competition, reaching the semi finals of the SAFF Championships, beating Afghanistan in their group stage before losing ultimately to India in the semi finals to a last minute goal in extra time.
2009
2010s
Having lost their last eight games in a row, their successes in the SAFF Championships were now a distant memory and matters have not improved in the years since, their losing run stretched to nineteen games. However, following an eighteen-month absence from the international arena and entering the World Cup for the very first time, Bhutan produced two shock results in beating Sri Lanka in both legs of the AFC first qualifying round to proceed to the group qualifying round and record back to back victories for the first time in their history. The next stage of qualifying was not successful for Bhutan as they lost all of their matches including a 15–0 defeat to Qatar and a 12–0 defeat to China in addition to an overall 15–0 loss to Thai club side Buriram United in two unofficial back to back friendlies. A fourteen match losing streak was broken however when they drew 0–0 with Bangladesh in the first leg of their 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification – Play-off Round tie. The second leg saw Bhutan record their first ever victory over Bangladesh in a 3–1 win, which saw them progress to the third round of the qualifiers for the 2019 Asian Cup.

Competitive record
FIFA World Cup
Bhutan attempted to qualify for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 2015. Drawn against Sri Lanka, they produced a shock result over the two legs of the first round to progress to the next round. They were drawn in group C of the second round, but were unable to progress to the next stage.
AFC Asian Cup
Prior to 2015, Bhutan had only attempted to qualify for the AFC Asian Cup on two occasions, both of which ended unsuccessfully. In their first attempt, they lost all of their matches, including a then world record 20–0 defeat to Kuwait. They were marginally more successful in the next iteration. Qualifying was divided into two stages. Bhutan hosted their group in the Preliminary stage, finishing in first place after a 0–0 draw with Mongolia and a 6–0 victory over Guam, a result that is still a record win for the nation. However, progressing to the second stage, they lost all six of their games and failed to progress to the competition proper. for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, the qualifying rounds for the 2018 FIFA World Cup were used as the first two stages of qualifying for this competition. Bhutan were eliminated in the second round of World Cup qualifying and entered the play-off round where they were drawn against Bangladesh. Bhutan beat them 3–1 over two legs to progress to the third round of qualifying for the first time.
AFC Challenge Cup
Bhutan have a dismal record in the AFC Challenge Cup, not only have they never qualified for the competition, but they have only managed a single draw, 1–1 against Brunei during the 2008 qualifying campaign. In addition, this is the only match in which they have ever managed to score. The AFC Challenge Cup has been discontinued by the AFC, with all nations now entering qualifying for the AFC Cup due to the expansion of the Asian Cup to the 24-nation format from the 16-nation one after the 2015 edition.
South Asian Football Federation Cup
Bhutan have an almost equally poor record in the South Asian Football Federation Cup. Only once have they managed to make it out of the group stage of the competition, with this being the only time they have managed to achieve any form of positive result.
South Asian Games
Early in their competitive history, Bhutan's sole participation in international football was their attendance at the South Asian Games. Taking part in the first three editions of the games, they failed to win a single game, losing all their matches and failing to score a goal until their final group game in 1987 against Nepal. Following this edition they did not enter a team again and from 2004 the national team has been ineligible as the tournament was changed to an under-23 competition.
ANFA Cup
The ANFA Cup refers to a series of invitational association football knockout tournaments organised by the Nepal Football Association. A national team has represented Bhutan at a number of editions of this tournament. Some of the matches have been against other national teams with the remainder against clubs or other representative teams. Again they have struggled to achieve any real success, their only positive results coming in 1986 in non-international matches against teams representing the Hong Kong Gurkhas and Nepal Youth respectively.

High Wheeldon is a distinctive dome-shaped hill near the Staffordshire border in Derbyshire, in the Peak District valley of Upper Dovedale, overlooking the villages of Earl Sterndale, Longnor and Crowdecote. It is close to the more distinctive and more widely known Chrome Hill and Parkhouse Hill. Popular with walkers, and possessing excellent views of the Dove and Manifold valleys, High Wheeldon is in the care of the National Trust, and has been since 1946 when it was presented by Mr F.A. Holmes of Buxton to the Trust as a war memorial. A plaque at the summit commemorates the presentation, stating that the hill was presented 'in honoured memory of the men of Derbyshire and Staffordshire who fell in the Second World War'.
Slightly below the summit of the hill is a rock shelter called Foxhole Cave, which is closed by an iron gate as it has archaeological significance. Items, including Peterborough ware, early Bronze Age pottery, a stone axe, flint microliths and animal bones, have been found in the cave, which is believed to have been used from the Upper Paleolithic. The cave is a scheduled monument.

Neunggasa is a Korean Buddhist temple located in Yeongnam-myeon township, Goheung-gun County, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.
This small temple complex rests at the base of Palyeong Mountain (팔영산, 八影山) and Recreational Forest area, also known as Eight Peak Mountain, in Goheung county.
History
Neunggasa was established in 419 and originally called Bohyeonsa by Monk Adohwasang. The temple was destroyed during the Japanese Invasion in 1592. In 1644, the temple was rebuilt as Neunggasa by Monk Jeonghyeon.
Temple Treasures
There are five Tangible Cultural Properties and Treasures found at the Neungga Temple complex.
Tangible Cultural Property #69
Bronze Bell of Neunggasa.
This large bronze bell weighs 900 kg/1984 lb and was cast in 1698 during King Sukjong's reign. Two dragons holding beads, called Yeouiju, are engraved on the hook suspending the bell (Yongnyu).
On the upper part of the bell are engraved 'Beomja' (an ancient Indian letter in Sanskrit), found along with standing Bodhisattvas.
The lower part of bell is decorated with Dangchomun, a pattern of flowers and long spreading vines. A Dangchomun symbolizes longevity, everlastingness, and the carrying on of a family line.
The design of eight divination symbols in the center of the bell is a unique design which has never been found on any other of the temple bells from the Joseon Dynasty.
Tangible Cultural Property #70
Neunggasasajeokbi (Neungga Temple monument).
This monument was erected in 1690, by Monk Mokdeok to record and commemorate the activities of Monk Adohwasang.
Monk Adohwasang established Neunggasa in 419, the reign under King Nulji (417-458), of the Silla (57 BCE - 935 CE).
The turtle shaped base of the monument supports an oblong natural stone pedestal on which an epitaph is engraved. The epitaph states that Neungga Temple was originally called Bohyeon Temple before being rebuilt as Neunggasa in 1644.
The monument is topped off with an ornately carved capstone.
Tangible Cultural Property #224
The Wooden Four-Deva Statues of Neunggasa.
Cheongwangmun or Four Guardians gate, traditionally the second gate into the temple, enshrines the Four Heavenly Kings. The Four Heavenly Kings vow to protect the Dharma Truths and all who worship in the temple.
Their ferocious looks reflect their duty to force unruly spirits into submission, or at least focus the minds of temple visitors.
Due to inscriptions found on the ridge beam of gate the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings found here are believed to have been created in 1666.
Tangible Cultural Property #264
Neunggasa Tomb of Chugyedang and Sayeongdang.
Monks Chugyedang and Sayeongdang were teaching monks, revered by their students, whose ashes are interred in the Neunggasa Tomb of Chugyedang and Sayeongdang.
Each of the tombs differs significantly from the other. The tomb of Chugyedang, on the right, has the appearance of a stone lantern where the tomb of Sayeongdang, to the left, has the appearance of a bronze temple bell.
Both tombs are adorned with engravings of lotus blossoms, a very important symbol in Buddhism, exemplifying the concepts of complete purification of the body, mind and speech, and the blossoming of wholesome acts .
Chugyedang was active during the middle of the 17th century and Sayeongdang active during the late 17th century.
Treasure #1307
Neunggasadaeungjeon (Daeng Hall of Neunggasa Temple).
The Hall of Sakyamuni in Neugasa Temple, Daeungjeon, from the Late Joseon Period was rebuilt in the mid 18th century, as a result of being destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598).
Neunggasadaeungjeon covers an area of 190 square meters/2045 square feet, comprising five bays, each about 180 cm/5.9 feet wide.
Like other abundantly bracketed buildings, this structure also has a roof-supporting bracket system with three outward arms (oechulmok) and four inward arms (naechulmok). Bracket arms carved in relief on the wall, between the bracket system, is rarely found in temple structures.
Carvings on the column-top blocks (anchogong), and the exquisitely decorated interior employing the lotus-bud designs, are similar to those of the Halls of Sakyamuni in Bulgapsa (Buddhist) temple in Yeonggwang and Gaeamsa (Buddhist temple) in Buan. Both of these halls are designated as national treasures.
Neunggasadaeungjeon has both academical and historical significance, rendering valuable data on the temple construction methods employed during the mid/late Joseon Dynasty in the Jeolla Province(s).

Faumuina To'aletai Mafaufau David Tua (born 21 November 1972), best known as David Tua, is a Samoan-New Zealand former professional boxer who competed from 1992 to 2013. A highly ranked heavyweight contender for most of their career, Tua was known for their formidable punching power, especially in their devastating left hook. They scored sixteen wins by knockout in the first round, which included knockouts of world heavyweight champions John Ruiz and Michael Moorer within thirty seconds of the first round, as well as late stoppages of world champions Oleg Maskaev and Hasim Rahman. They were ranked by BoxRec in the world's top 10 heavyweights from 1996 to 2003, reaching their highest ranking of No.3 in 1998. Tua ended their career with a knockout-to-win ratio of 82.6%. In a 2003 article by The Ring magazine, Tua was ranked 48th on a list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.
Nicknamed the "Tuamanator", their fast-paced bob and weave pressure fighting style has often drawn comparisons to Mike Tyson. Tua fought many of the best boxers of their era and challenged once for the unified world heavyweight title against Lennox Lewis in 2000. In their five professional losses, Tua was never subject to a stoppage, and possessed one of the most durable chins of their time.
Early life
Tua said that they lived with four brothers, four sisters and ten other relatives while growing up. Tua said that their mother worked three jobs, and Tua said that their father worked long hours. Tua said that their father forced them to start boxing when they were seven years old, and Tua said that they are grateful to their father for introducing them to boxing.
Amateur career
In their early career, Tua trained three days a week at a small gym in Mangere Bridge, under boxing trainer Gerry Preston. Tua became New Zealand national heavyweight champion in 1988 at age 15.
At the age of 19 Tua won a bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. They lost their semi-final to David Izonritei, whom they would later knock out as a professional. Tua turned professional later the same year.

Professional career
Tua debuted in December 1992. Of their first 27 fights, 23 were won by knockout.
In Tua's 1997 fight against Ike Ibeabuchi, the two fighters combined to set the record for most punches thrown in a heavyweight fight on record. Ibeabuchi won the decision, handing Tua their first professional loss. Prior to this, Tua had scored devastating knockouts against future titlist John Ruiz (via 1st-round KO, in only 19 seconds) and Darroll Wilson. Tua also beat David Izon and future champion Oleg Maskaev to set up the fight with Ibeabuchi. After the loss to Ibeabuchi, Tua took on future champ Hasim Rahman and TKO'd Rahman in the 10th round. The victory over Rahman marked the beginning of Tua's struggles with their weight. They ballooned up to 253 pounds when they defeated Obed Sullivan in 2000 by KO. Later that year, they weighed 245 pounds in the loss to Lennox Lewis. Tua was disappointing in the fight, with both fighters avoiding each other and Tua not throwing combinations. Tua lost a clear-cut decision.
The fight with Lewis was for the WBC, IBF, & IBO heavyweight titles and took place in November 2000. Tua lost on points by a wide margin.
Following the Lewis loss, Tua regained steam with a KO over Danell Nicholson but lost by a close decision in their next fight to future champion Chris Byrd. In 2002 they beat prospect Fres Oquendo and demolished Michael Moorer in their next fight with a powerful shot 30 seconds into the first round, which put Moorer out cold. In 2003 they drew in a 12-round rematch with Rahman.
2005 comeback
Tua was inactive for over two years before they stepped into the ring on 31 March 2005 and bested Talmadge Griffis in a 10-round bout—ending the match and earning a TKO victory with 26 seconds remaining. Tua's next contest in October 2005 ended in a split decision over Cisse Salif with Tua dominating in the late rounds.
Tua defeated Edward Gutierrez by knockout in the fourth round of a scheduled 10-rounder on 26 July 2006. The fight was held at the Manhattan Center ballroom in New York City, and featured on ESPN2. Tua started slowly, scored a knockdown with their famous left hook in the second round, and put Gutierrez down for the count in the fourth round with a combination of two left hooks, one to the head and the decisive one to the body.
In November 2006 Tua defeated Maurice Wheeler in the seventh round of a scheduled 10-rounder by knockout. Tua ended the bout with a solid left uppercut to the body which immediately sent the howling Wheeler to the canvas.
Tua continued their comeback in February 2007 with a unanimous decision over Robert Hawkins in a 10-round bout. Tua ended the match being the aggressor and hurt Hawkins in both the ninth and tenth rounds with body punches, but was unable to end the match with a knockout.
Tua, looking in good shape and weighing in at 237½ lbs (his lightest fight weight since 2001), was featured as the main event of a Pay Per View show on 18 August 2007 in Sandy, Utah and ended the bout quickly with a first-round knockout of Mexican champion Saul Montana. Tua threw two powerful left hooks to the head that sent Montana sprawling to the canvas giving Tua their sixth win in a row.
Tua, again looking in good shape and weighing in at 234 lbs, fought the unheralded Cerrone Fox at the Soaring Eagle Casino, Mt. Pleasant, Michigan on 7 September 2007. Tua made short work of their over matched opponent ending the bout at 1:41 of the second round.
While Tua's promoter, Cedric Kushner, stated Tua was scheduled to fight an opponent on 18 October 2007, the fight never materialized.
2009 comeback
Tua fought fellow New Zealander Shane Cameron at Mystery Creek, Hamilton on 3 October 2009 with Tua knocking Cameron out seven seconds into the second round to pick up the WBO Asia Pacific and Oriental Heavyweight titles. The promoters for the fight were John McRae and David Higgins of Duco Events. The fight had been scheduled for an earlier date, but was delayed due to Cameron having surgery on a fractured hand.
On 31 March 2010 Tua fought Friday Ahunanya, winning on points after 12 rounds. The fight promoters for this fight were again John McRae and David Higgins of Duco Events.
The Tua-Barrett fight had been tentatively scheduled for 26 June in São Paulo, Brazil. However, the fight was moved to 17 July at the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City in a bid to promote David Tua's career in the United States. At 38 years old, Monte Barrett (34-9, 20 KOs) was viewed by some as an easy opponent for Tua as they had lost their previous three fights. The match was a controversial draw with Tua being knocked down for the first time in their professional career late in the 12th round.
Tua fought Demetrice King on 19 March 2011. Tua defeated King by unanimous decision with the scores of 100–91, 100–91, and 100–90.
Tua's rematch against Monte Barrett on 13 August 2011 resulted in a unanimous points decision going in favour of Barrett. The judges scored the bout 113–112, 115–112, and 115–112.
In December 2011, it emerged that Monte Barrett tested positive for banned stimulant methylhexanamine following a urine test after their 13 August points decision over Tua. Tua's lawyer, Blair Edwards, called for action against the 40-year-old New Yorker requesting the return of Tua's WBO Asia-Pacific and Oriental titles and the restoration of ranking points.
2013 comeback and retirement
In June 2013 it was confirmed that Tua was once again getting back into the ring. Belarusian Alexander Ustinov defeated them by unanimous points decision, following which they announced their retirement from professional boxing. Ringside Report were mixed in their evaluation of their career, referring to them as "one of the best heavyweights never to win a world title".
Outside the ring
On 10 October 1992 Tua appeared on the New Zealand version of the gameshow Wheel of Fortune. They had asked for an "O for Olsen" (possibly a reference to Olsen Filipaina) but this was heard by some (and widely reported) as "O for awesome". They requested "P" when buying a vowel on the same episode. They were also heard to ask if they could buy a "constonant" during the same show.
From 1992 to 2003, Tua was managed by former boxer Kevin Barry, who also trained them from 2001. But in 2003, Tua ended their business relationship with Barry and financial manager Martin Pugh. Though Barry accepted their dismissal as trainer, they resisted Tua's decision to end their contract, which still had two years to go.
In 2004, Tua's accountant learned that the boxer's finances with their boxing company, Tuaman Inc. Ltd., were tangled with company expenses; Tua no longer has most of their $NZ 20 million in purses from their professional matches, and important assets Tua thought they owned alone were anything but, including a piece of coastal land at Pakiri. Tuaman Inc. Ltd had business expenses flowing in various directions, involving companies and clients Tua had no knowledge of. Tua's own home was purchased with borrowed money, and the boxer's purses were linked to renovation costs for Martin Pugh's property. These findings were based on documents from Pugh's offices.
In 2005 Tua took Kevin Barry and Martin Pugh to court over their business arrangements. Barry and Pugh accused Tua of manipulating them to collect revenue, yet Tua maintained that they knew little of the men's affairs and did what they told them to do out of trust. The dispute gave both sides legal victories: over the issue of the coastal land property, the court ruled in favor of Barry and Pugh, since Tua failed to properly clarify their ownership over the land; on the issue of the terminated 2003 contract, the court ruled in Tua's favour, concluding they clearly owed no expenses to their former management from that contract. In October 2009, it was reported in The New Zealand Herald that the parties had settled all previously unresolved matters arising from the protracted litigation.
In May 2007, Cedric Kushner, president of Gotham Boxing Inc. and Tua's promoter, filed a $5 million lawsuit against IBF heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko and promoter Shelly Finkel among others – and while the lawsuit is unrelated to Tua, Kushner has stated they will drop the lawsuit if Tua is given a title bout against Klitschko in 2008, which ultimately failed to materialize.
In September 2009, Tua's aunt was killed in the Samoa tsunami. In early October they travelled to Samoa with cousin Va'aiga Tuigamala to see how they could help.
In the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours, Tua was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to youth, boxing and the community, having previously been appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to boxing, in the 2001 New Year Honours.
In 1996, Tua was honored by the country of Tuvalu, with a stamp commemorating the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, United States bearing Tua's likeness and name on it.
In popular culture
Tua is mentioned in an episode of the animated series Family Guy, when character Stewie draws Tua's likeness on a wall.
In 2020, they are seen to be in a gathering opposing the legalisation of recreational use of cannabis.

Sandra (Sandy) Chung is an American linguist and distinguished professor emerita at the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Them research focuses on Austronesian languages and syntax.
Education
Chung earned their A.B. and, in 1976, a Ph.D. at Harvard University, with a dissertation on the comparative syntax of Polynesian languages.
Career
At the University of California, Santa Cruz, they have served as chair of the Linguistics Department (1994–97, 2013–16), chair of the Philosophy Department (2002–04), and Faculty Assistant to the Executive Vice Chancellor (2004–11).
Chung has made contributions to the study of syntax and semantics. Much of their data comes from their own work with Chamorro speakers both in the continental U.S. and in Saipan. They have also worked on Māori. On the basis of Māori and Chamorro, they and William Ladusaw argued in Restriction and Saturation (MIT Press, 2003) that the number and kind of semantic combinatoric operations must be expanded beyond the typically assumed function application and abstraction. Them other theoretical work has addressed topics in agreement, predicate-initial word orders, wh-movement, ellipsis (especially sluicing), and on wh-agreement (where they demonstrated that Chamorro shows overt morphological cues to Wh-movement), among many others.
Honors
In 2007, Chung was selected as a Fellow of the Linguistic Society of America. They were invited to give a plenary lecture at the annual meeting of the Linguistic Society of America in 2008, where they spoke about combining primary (including documentary) research on understudied languages with theoretical linguistics, arguing that these two often competing interests can and should find a congenial home together. In 2011, Chung served as president of the Linguistic Society of America. Chung was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012.
A Festschrift in their honor, Asking the Right Questions: Essays in Honor of Sandra Chung, was published in 2017.

The 1963 Detroit Lions season was their thirtieth in Detroit and 34th overall. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle indefinitely suspended Lions defensive tackle Alex Karras and Packers' halfback Paul Hornung for placing bets on NFL teams. Five other Lions players were fined $2,000 each for betting on games that they did not play in. The Lions franchise was fined $2,000 each on two counts for failure to report information promptly and for lack of sideline supervision. The gambling controversy proved to be a big distraction on the field as well, as the Lions could not build on the success of the previous season, finishing 5–8–1.
On Thanksgiving Day in Detroit, the Lions met the Packers for the thirteenth consecutive season. The game ended in a tie, the first for the Packers in five years, and it was the end of the holiday series for Green Bay. Their visit to Tiger Stadium the following year was on a Monday night in late September, and the visiting opponent for Thanksgiving was rotated, starting with the Chicago Bears.

Paper Lion
Paper Lion, published in 1966, is a non-fiction book by prominent American writer George Plimpton.
Plimpton pitched to a lineup of baseball stars in an All-Star exhibition, presumably to answer the question, "How would the average person off of the street fare in an attempt to compete with the stars of professional sports?" They chronicled this experience in their book, Out of My League. In Paper Lion, Plimpton joins the training camp of the 1963 Detroit Lions on the premise of trying out to be the team's third-string quarterback. (The coaches were aware of the deception; the players were not until it became apparent that Plimpton did not really know how to receive the snap from center.) Plimpton, then thirty-six, showed how unlikely it would be for an "average" person to succeed as a professional athlete. When finally inserted at quarterback for a series in a scrimmage conducted in Pontiac, Michigan, Plimpton managed to lose yardage on each play, convincing many in the crowd that they were a professional sports clown inserted for amusement purposes, not someone who was genuinely giving their best effort.

The Lokhaitora River rises in Bhutan and flows through Assam, India. A portion divides into the Baralia River. The Lokhaitora continues south in several channels until it joins with the Suklai River forming the Puthimari River.
In northern Assam it flows through the Bornadi Wildlife Sanctuary, where it is known as the Barnadi River.
Like many rivers rising in Bhutan, the Lokhaitora has become seasonal, with great floods during the rainy season, and dry for the rest of the year.

They began their career with the Calgary Aquabelles club in 1965 and won silver medals in the synchronized swimming team competitions at both the 1971 Pan American Games and the 1973 World Aquatics Championships. At age 20, Muir retired from competition and began a career in coaching. They coached swimmers of the Calgary Aquabelles to 22 national titles over a decade. They also helped athletes clinch medals in the World Aquatics Championships, the FINA Cup, the Commonwealth Games, the Pan American Games and the Summer Olympic Games. Muir has won various awards for their coaching career, and is an inductee of the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and the International Swimming Hall of Fame.
Personal background
On June 12, 1953, Deborah Muir was born in Calgary, Alberta.  They are a graduate of Viscount Bennett High School, and worked for a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Calgary. In 1975, Muir married English-born water polo player and stockbroker Neil Muir in Calgary.
Career
They joined the Calgary Aquabelles synchronized swimming club to begin their career in the sport in 1965 at age 11. Two years later, Muir won the bronze medal in the junior solo category at the Canadian Championships. They competed in the 1971 Pan American Games in Colombia, claiming the silver medal in the synchronized swimming team competition as a member of Canada's seven-athlete squad for the event. They were named to the Canadian delegation for the 1973 World Aquatics Championships in Yugoslavia, winning the silver medal in the synchronised swimming discipline as a member of the Canadian team. Following the Championships, Muir decided to retire from competition at age 20, saying that they realized they would have not been able to attain the success they desired even after practising hard.
In 1974, they began coaching the Calgary Aquabelles' senior "B" side before going on to coach the "A" team, replacing the unwell Marianne Reeves. Muir coached the club for ten years, seeing its swimmers claim a total of 22 national titles. Muir began coaching the Canadian national team in 1976. The following year, they coached Helen Vanderburg and Michelle Calkins to victory over the United States and Japan at the 1977 Pan Pacific Championships. Muir's first international victory as a coach came at the 1978 World Aquatics Championships in Berlin when Vanderberg claimed the gold medal in the solo competition and Vanderburg and Calkins paired up to win the duet discipline. In 1979, swimmers coached by Muir won medals at that year's FINA Cup in the solo and duet events and at the Pan-American Games.
Muir attained further success as a coach at the 1982 Commonwealth Games with a gold medal for Cameron Henning, and at the 1982 World Aquatics Championships in Guayaquil when Sharon Hambrook and Kelly Kryczka won the gold medal in the duet routine. Them squad won the 1983 Pan American Games gold medal in the team competition. After synchronized swimming became an Olympic sport in 1984, their swimmers Hambrook and Kryczka claimed the silver medal in the duet routine as Carolyn Waldo finished second in the solo event at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. During 1986, Muir stopped coaching the Calgary Aquabelles to focus on the Canadian national team. Them athletes achieved two gold medals in the duet and solo competitions at each of that year's Commonwealth Games and the World Aquatics Championships in Madrid. In 1987, they attained further success when their swimmers took gold medals in each of solo and duet routines at the 1987 FINA Cup.
At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Muir guided Waldo to the gold medal of the solo event and Waldo and Michelle Cameron to victory in the duet competition. In 1990, they helped Canadian athletes to win both the duet and solo competitions at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. In the same year, Muir wrote a letter to Synchro Canada expressing concern that synchronized swimming would be excluded from the Olympic program. They stopped coaching the Canadian national team in 1991. At the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, they helped to employ their underwater synchro abilities to enable Mark Tewksbury's gold medal win in the 100 meter backstroke. Muir consulted several coaches and teams in Egypt, England, Japan, South Korea and Sweden, before going on to coach the Australian national side from 1995 to 2000 full and part time as they prepared for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. They commuted twice a year to Melbourne to train the team and also had them based in Calgary twice each year.
In 2004, Muir was appointed to head Swimming Canada's technical review to take actions to get better at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics following the nation's sub-par performances at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. They were a mentor coach for the Canadian Olympic Committee at the 2008 and 2010 Olympics.

Carlisle Rugby Club is an English rugby union club based in Carlisle, Cumbria. The first XV team currently plays in North Premier, having reached the national levels of the sport for the first time in 2019. As well as a 1st XV, the club also operates men's 2nd XV (Crusaders) and 3rd XV (Hornets) sides and colts (under-19), a women's side (Cougars), and a number of junior sides for boys and girls aged 6 to 16.
History
Early years
Carlisle were formed in 1873, with their first-ever game played at home against Scottish side Langholm. The club originally played in black jerseys, with a white Maltese cross added by 1879. In 1886, Carlisle claimed their first-ever silverware, winning the Cumberland Cup, a feat it repeated in 1908 and 1910. The club also regularly contributed players to the Cumberland county team, three of whom went on to play for England, including C.E.Chapman in 1884, and W.M.B.Nanson and J.R.Morgan in 1920. Having played home games at a number of locations in 1895 Carlisle moved to a permanent home at Warwick Road, with a grandstand put up in 1923.
Post war
The club initially struggled after World War II but fundraising during the 1950s saw the club upgrade the club-house and open new changing rooms. The 1960s saw an upturn in the club's fortunes when they won the Cumberland Cup in 1961 - over half a century since their last county silverware - and the 1967–68 season was the best the club had experienced so far, with 33 wins, 3 draws and 4 losses out of 40 played. During this period many of the club's players turned out for the Cumberland county side, with Chris Wardlow going on to play for England between 1969–71 and just missing out on selection for the British and Irish Lions due to injury. Although the results started to decline during the 1970s, off the pitch, facilities continued to improve with the changing rooms upgrading in 1971 and floodlights erected three years later in 1974. Additionally, a colts (under-19s) side was established towards the end of the decade.
League rugby
The introduction of the leagues in the 1986–87 season saw Carlisle placed in North West Division 2 - a league at tier 8 of the English rugby union system. During this period the club experienced several promotions up to North 2, while the 'A' team tasted success in county cup competition, winning the Cumbria Shield in 1989. The period was also notable for a mini section (juniors) being introduced. Future England international Ian Hunter also played several seasons at the club prior to moving to Northampton Saints. The 1990s were fairly quiet, although a women's side (The 'Cougars') was created in 1994 and the men's 2nd XV had some success in the Cumbria League Division 1.
In 2000 Carlisle were transferred from North West 2 into North Lancashire/Cumbria following the cessation of that league. The 2004–05 season was a notable one for the club, less for on-field activities but rather for to the 'Great Carlisle Flood' of January 2005, which swamped Warwick Road, flooding the pitch, ruining the club house and leaving the club homeless for the rest of the season, with games being played at Wigton, and across the border at Langholm RFC. The following season, the club recovered from the disaster in the best possible manner by winning North Lancashire/Cumbria and being promoted into North 1 West (tier 6). This success was duplicated by the 2nd XV, who won back to back Cumbria Vase victories in 2010 and 2011.
Although the 1st XV remained stable in North 1 West for a decade, in 2016 they were finally relegated after finishing 12th. They did not remain in North Lancashire/Cumbria for long, finishing as champions at the end of 2016-17 and claiming promotion back to North 1 West. They also made it a double that season with their first Cumbria Cup victory since 1961, beating St Benedict's 29–13 in the final held at Bower Park in Aspatria. In 2019, after two seasons in North 1 West, Carlisle won the league title and promotion to North Premier - which at tier 5 is the highest level the club had reached in its league history.
Ground
Carlisle have been based at the Rugby Ground on Warwick Road since 1895. The ground is located in the east of Carlisle on Warwick Road, next door to Brunton Park, home of Carlisle United Football Club. Access to the ground is good with ample parking, and Carlisle railway station is less than a mile's walk away. The ground has a grandstand next to the main pitch, and there are also several additional pitches for 2nd, 3rd XV and junior rugby. The club-house is just off the main pitch and has two bars and a range of other rooms which can be let for conferences and other events. The capacity around the main pitch is approximately 1,500, which includes 250 seated in the grandstand, the rest standing.

Arts Emergency is a British charity working with 16- to 19-year-olds in further education from diverse backgrounds. They work with those most able to benefit from, but least able to access higher education in the Arts, Humanities or Social Sciences.
History
In response to increasing tuition fees and the abolition of public funding for the teaching of arts subjects in British universities, the charity was co-founded in 2011 by comedian Josie Long and campaigner Neil Griffiths. They launched with an event at the Hackney Empire in the London borough that hosted their pilot project in 2012.
Work
They run a national "alternative" Old Boy Network that aims to create privilege for people without privilege and counter the myth that universities, and in particular arts degrees, are the domain of the middle and upper classes. Their volunteers come from TV, film, music, art, fashion, academia, law, architecture, activism, comedy, social work, journalism, publishing, design, activism and theatre.
Members include the journalists Polly Toynbee and Laurie Penny; artist duo Jake & Dinos Chapman, authors Neil Gaiman and Alan Moore, poet Scroobius Pip, comedians Stephen K Amos, Stewart Lee and Shappi Khorsandi. Working with a trained mentor for one year, students pursue a personal goal and explore options in Higher Education and the creative and professional worlds. Longer term, they are able to access information, advice and guidance through the Charity's volunteer network.
The organisation set up a base in Newcastle upon Tyne in 2015.

Goldtrail was a UK-based tour operator that specialised in operated flights and holidays to Turkey and Greece. It was run by Abdulkadir Aydin, the sole director, based in Surrey, England.
Controversy
A number of former customers had received sub-standard accommodation and treatment on holiday in Turkey. Other holidaymakers, it discovered, had become ill after taking Goldtrail holidays. The company was also fined thousands of pounds by the Association of British Travel Agents, ABTA, the programme reported. The directors were convicted of fraud in absentia, as they had already fled to Northern Cyprus.
The CAA advised customers due to fly with the failed operator to check with their travel agent before travelling to the airport. In a statement issued on its website, the aviation regulator said: "The CAA has taken steps to protect customers booked with Goldtrail Travel Limited after the company ceased trading.
In 2009, the company featured in the BBC Watchdog consumer affairs programme.
Collapse
It collapsed in 2010 and went into administration. This left 23,500 tourist stranded without a way home and a further 110,000 would-be passengers holding prepaid tickets. The collapse of GoldTrail cost the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) over £20 million.
On 13 May 2013, Adbulkadir Aydin was disqualified for 15 years from being a director of any UK company, being found guilty of 'gross mismanagement' of the company's affairs. The high court heard Aydin transferred over £10 million to themselves and family members prior to the collapse of GoldTrail.
Notes
The company also traded under the names of Goldtrail Holidays, Goldtrail Travel and Sunmar.
Airline operators
Goldtrail used many charter airlines for their operations. These included:
Onur Air
Saga Airlines
Turkuaz Airlines
Viking Airlines

is a 2012 Japanese comedy horror film directed by Noboru Iguchi. The film involves Keiko (Rina Takeda) who is the daughter of a famous sushi chef. They leaf home for an inn where they are bullied by the president of Komatsu Pharmaceuticals. A Komatsu researcher arrives intent on revenge by creating a serum that turns fish on rice into killer sushi. Keiko teams up with the former sushi chef Sawada to fight off the creatures.
Production
Director and writer Noboru Iguchi decided to work on a film after the film Piranha 3D (2010) was popular in Japan. Iguchi was also influenced by the film Attack of the Killer Tomatoes by the idea of food attacking people. The film contains a number of action sequences which Iguchi said they wanted to be more comedic than their previous films. Yoshihiro Nishimura contributed to the special effects in the film.
Dead Sushi is the first film to be released from Walker Pictures, the new producing and distribution offshoot of the Japanese talent agency Office Walker.

Release
Dead Sushi had its world premiere at the Fantasia Festival on 22 July 2012.
Reviews
In a review for Dead Sushi and Zombie Ass: Toilet of the Dead, horror magazine Fangoria gave the film a 2 and a half rating out of four, stating that the film "kind of defy ratings; obviously they're not high art, and the serious critic in me believes the score below is appropriate for these slight, outrageous confections. Yet they're also diverting, raucous fun when seen in the company of like-minded viewers, so that rating can be augmented by half a skull (or more) if you're able to watch these movies with a group". Variety gave the film a mixed review, noting that "the comic dialogue lacks zing and most perfs are pitched too high even for this type of nonsense, Takeda tones it down nicely and impressively kicks the butts of sleazy corporate types and seafood. Effects are super-cheesy; other tech work is passable."

The Sigma 19mm F2.8 EX DN lens is a wide-angle prime lens for Sony E and Micro Four-Thirds mounts, announced by Sigma in January 2012. Along with the Sigma 30mm F2.8 EX DN, it was part of the first release of Sigma lenses for compact interchangeable lens cameras, and hence the inception of the "DN" line, created by Sigma to cater to these cameras, an offering that in January 2013 was expanded with another lens, the Sigma 60mm f/2.8 DN Art.
Exterior
The lens has a matte black plastic exterior.
Optics
The lens suffers from mild barrel distortion, moderate vignetting, and moderate amounts of chromatic aberration.
In general it is a sharp lens especially in the centre and when stopped down to f8 the edges will catch up. Flare resistance is quite good. Bokeh is smooth and colour rendition is neutral.
"Art" series version
On January 29, 2013, an aesthetically updated version of this lens was announced, the Sigma 19mm F2.8 DN Art. It has a glossy black (or silver) plastic exterior with the Sigma Art "A" badge on the side of the lens. It features a large manual focus ring and a detachable barrel-type lens hood.
The optics are identical to the older version.

The Škoda Kushaq is a subcompact crossover SUV (B-segment) manufactured by the Czech automaker Škoda Auto in India since 2021. The vehicle is heavily based on the Volkswagen T-Cross and its derivative for the Indian market, the Volkswagen Taigun. The name 'Kushaq' was derived from the Sanskrit word 'Kushak' which denotes 'King' or 'Emperor'.
Overview
The vehicle was previewed as the Vision IN Concept in February 2020. The production model debuted in 18 March 2021 as the first product from Škoda Auto Volkswagen India's "India 2.0 project". The car is built on the Volkswagen Group MQB A0 IN platform dedicated for Indian market and closely related with the Volkswagen Taigun. It is manufactured in Chakan, Maharashtra, India with a local parts content of 95 percent to achieve a lower price point.
The Kushaq in India is available with two petrol engine options, which are the entry-level 1.0-litre three-cylinder TSI producing and a 1.5-litre four-cylinder TSI with . The 1.0-litre engine is available with 6-speed manual and 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox options, while the 1.5-litre TSI unit, is available with a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic option. Both engines are produced at Škoda's Chakan plant.
In 2021, the Kushaq contains 95% local parts.
In May 2022, Škoda released the Monte Carlo edition for the Kushaq.
Powertrain
Safety
The Škoda Kushaq is equipped as standard with double frontal airbags, anti-lock brakes, i-Size anchorages, ESC (electronic stability control), multi-collision brakes, a claimed high-strength steel structure, front and rear seatbelt pretensioners and three-point seatbelts with adjustable head restraints for all passengers. The highest 'Style' trim level is additionally equipped with side and curtain airbags, hill start assistance and a tyre pressure monitor. At launch, side and curtain airbags and the tyre pressure monitor were not available on cars equipped with an automatic transmission, but this has since been corrected.
The Škoda Kushaq has not been independently crash-tested by the Global New Car Assessment Programme (Global NCAP) but Škoda claim they are looking forward to them testing the car.

Vipavski Križ (; ) is a settlement on a small hill in the Vipava Valley in the Municipality of Ajdovščina in the Littoral region of Slovenia. There is evidence of habitation on the hill in the pre-Roman period. The settlement was first mentioned in written documents dating to the 13th century. The houses in the village are clustered inside a defence wall around a castle from the late 15th century. It was built to protect the residents against Ottoman raids. In 1532 Vipavski Križ was declared a town. In 1636 a Capuchin monastery with a rich library was founded in the town and it is now open to visitors.
Name
The name of the settlement was changed from Sveti Križ (literally, 'holy cross') to Vipavski Križ (literally, 'Vipava cross') in 1955. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms.
Parish church
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to the Exaltation of the Cross and belongs to the Diocese of Koper.

The CP 2240-class is an electric multiple unit used by the national train operator Comboios de Portugal. Each EMU features 3 cars, with the ends being driving trailers, and the middle being a power car (which houses the traction motors).
The units were assembled between 2003 and 2005, by Alstom, reusing the old Sorefame body shells belonging to the 2100, 2150 and 2200-class EMU's, to keep cost down and avoid fully scrapping old rolling stock. The bogies were custom-built with new Alstom traction motors, and are in the 1668mm Iberian gauge.
They are able to operate in multiple configuration with up to 3 units, for a total of 9 passenger cars.

Jeremiah Colburn (12 January 1815 – 30 December 1891) was a Boston numismatist. They also collected various other things.
Biography
They lived their whole life in Boston. They made their living first (1830) as a clerk, then as a merchant (until 1852), and eventually was appointed by President Franklin Pierce as an appraiser for the United States Customs Service (1852–1860).
They started their collecting activity with coins, and afterward turned their attention to shells, minerals, etc., and finally to books, autographs, manuscripts, portraits, and engravings relating to the United States, including continental money and the more recent issues of paper tokens. In 1840, they began a collection of banknotes. In 1857 they contributed articles to the Historical Magazine on U.S. coins and coinage, which were followed for several years by short articles on these subjects in Notes and Queries. They were one of the founders of the Boston Numismatic Society (1860), had been its curator, vice president, and president (1865–1891), and was one of the editors of the American Journal of Numismatics (1870–1891).
They founded the Prince Society (1858), was elected to the New England Historic Genealogical Society (1857), and was a founding member of the Boston Antiquarian Club (1879, later, 1881, the Bostonian Society).l

The Litchfield and Madison Railway was a Class I railroad in Illinois in the United States. Its nickname was the St. Louis Gateway Route. The railroad operated of track from its creation in 1900 until it was absorbed by the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1958.
History
In 1889-1890, the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad began constructing a railroad line at Winston, Illinois, about a mile from Litchfield, Illinois, with the intent of the line eventually reaching Madison, Illinois. At the same time, another railroad, called the St. Louis and Eastern, began building a line from Litchfield to Glen Carbon, Illinois, also with the goal of the line extending to Madison. Sometime in the 1890s, the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis struck an accord to lease some unbuilt right-of-way from the St. Louis and Eastern. Both lines eventually extended into Madison.
The Litchfield and Madison was incorporated on March 1, 1900 by James Duncan to take over an isolated line of the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad between Litchfield and Madison. At that time, Duncan also took over the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis. In 1926, the L&M constructed a connection to the Chicago and North Western at Benld, Illinois. The railroad served as the entry to East St. Louis, Illinois for both the Chicago and North Western and the Illinois Central Railroad. In addition, in the 1925-1926 time frame, the C&NW obtained trackage rights over the L&M from Benld to East St. Louis. At the same time, the L&M received minor reciprocal trackage rights over the C&NW.
During its life, the L&M was known for being both a bridge railroad and also a hauler of coal. Most of the coal consisted of loads brought southbound to the St. Louis area from mines in the area.
The railroad's physical plant included a depot and office at Staunton, Illinois. A timetable dated November 14, 1909 showed a daily round trip between Madison and C. B. & Q. Junction (south of Litchfield). And a timetable dated July 1925 listed five trains each way between Glen Carbon and Madison. These seem to be through trains of the Illinois Central Railroad and New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad utilizing the L&M trackage as a gateway to St Louis.
Apart from the C&NW, the L&M also connected with the Illinois Central, the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad in East St. Louis, the Alton and Southern Railway, the Illinois Terminal Railroad, the Southern Railway, the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and the Wabash Railroad.
The railroad was headquartered in Edwardsville, Illinois.
Motive power
During the steam era, the L&M operated 2-8-0 steam locomotives (also known as Consolidations) and 2-8-2 steam locomotives (also known as Mikados or Mikes). In the early diesel era, the L&M operated one Baldwin VO-1000 and three ALCO RS-3s.
Merger into the Chicago and North Western
On August 1, 1957, lawyers for the Chicago and North Western filed paperwork to acquire the Litchfield and Madison outright. The Interstate Commerce Commission quickly granted the C&NW's application. The purchase price for the railroad was $8 million.
The Litchfield and Madison was formally merged into the Chicago and North Western on January 2, 1958.

and refer to manga and anime directed towards children under the age of 12. These series are usually moralistic, often educating children about staying in the right path in life. Each chapter is usually a self-contained story.
History
Kodomo manga started in the late 19th century with the production of short manga, approximately 15 pages long, printed in magazines. These short manga were created as a part of the Meiji era's attempt to encourage literacy among Japanese youth. A major milestone in the popularity of anime was the creation of Astro Boy by Osamu Tezuka, who is often considered the father of anime.
Kodomo anime and manga can be divided into four categories. The first category consists of anime and manga adaptations of Western stories, such as World Masterpiece Theater. Most of them are TV series. Despite being popular, they are less representative of traditional Japanese anime. Instead, they are modeled after classical American or Soviet cartoons.
The second category consists of adaptations of Japanese media and original works. They use linguistic gags, contain references to Japanese society, and may be harder to understand for non-Japanese audiences. They are in some ways similar to American animation. An example is Doraemon.
The third category, known as consists of manga and anime aimed towards young girls, such as Hello Kitty. The fourth category, which is closer to shōnen, has connections with popular video game and toy franchises, and has the greatest commercial success.
Kodomo manga magazines such as CoroCoro Comic and Comic BomBom primarily target young boys, especially those in elementary school, though some, such as Pucchigumi, target young girls. Popular kodomo manga is often adapted into anime and accompanied by a plethora of merchandise.
Awards
The annual Shogakukan Manga Award and Kodansha Manga Award each include a category for children's manga. The former first included a category for children's manga in 1981.

Sinovenator (meaning "Chinese hunter") is a genus of troodontid dinosaur from China. It is from the early Cretaceous Period.
Discovery and naming
Two specimens of a troodontid were described in 2002. They are both housed in the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, under the specimen numbers IVPP V 12615 and IVPP V 12583. Xu Xing, Mark Norell, and colleagues authored the study describing them, finding the specimens to represent a new taxon, for which was chosen the binomial Sinovenator changii. The generic name was derived from the Latin word Sinae, for China, and Venator, or "hunter". Meemann Chang is honoured by the species name for their contributions to the study of the Jehol Fauna. As Chang is a female researcher, the epithet should have been "changae"; however, such mistakes cannot be emended according to the rules of the ICZN and therefore forms such as "Sinovenator changae" or "Sinovenator changiae" that sometimes appear in the literature, are incorrect.
The type specimen or holotype of Sinovenator changii is IVPP 12615, a partial skull and disarticulated skeleton. An additional specimen was by the original publication scientifically described and assigned as the paratype of the species: an incomplete but articulated postcranial skeleton, numbered IVPP 12583. A third specimen was referred: IVPP V14322, a fragmentary skeleton. All three are in the collection of the IVPP in Beijing, China. However, Sinovenator fossils appear to be common in the Lujiatun Beds. In a 2006 survey of the Jehol Biota, Xu and Norell reported that hundreds of undescribed specimens are known. The fossils have been preserved three-dimensionally, not strongly compressed on a slab.
In 2014, the wrist of one specimen was described, IVPP V14009, an adult. In 2018, PMOL-AD00102, consisting of a partial skull and mandibles, and six cervical vertebrae, was referred to the taxon.
Description
Sinovenator is a troodontid, a group of small, bird-like, gracile maniraptorans. All troodontids have many unique features of the skull, such as closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw, and large numbers of teeth. Troodontids have sickle-claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian encephalization quotients, meaning they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses. The holotype individual of Sinovenator was about the size of a chicken, less than a metre long. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the weight of a one metre long individual at 2.5 kilogrammes. However, the holotype and paratype are subadults; specimens are known with about twice their length. This makes it one of the larger species of troodontids in the ecosystem of the Yixian Formation, the formation where it was found.
In the original description some distinguishing traits or autapomorphies were established. The front edge of the antorbital fenestra, the large skull opening in front of the eye socket, is straight and vertically oriented. The frontal bone shows a vertical ridge touching the lacrimal bone. The surangular in the lower jaw has a T-shaped cross-section. The shinbone has a vertical ridge on the upper outer side, the crista cnemialis, touching a lower vertical ridge, the crista fibularis.
There are a number of other notable traits. The upper branch of the praemaxilla excludes the maxilla from the nostril. The premaxillary teeth lack denticles; those on the maxillary teeth are small. The maxillary tooth row is positioned at some distance from the jaw rim. A fenestra promaxillaris is present. The branch of the jugal towards the postorbital is long, slender and inclined to the rear. The foramen magnum is much larger than the occipital condyle. The braincase lacks a recessus suboticus and a crista otosphenoidalis. The rear of the pterygoid has a secondary, rod-like, process. The front dentary teeth are closely packed. The rear of the surangular is extraordinarily deep.
Five sacrals are present, those of the middle being clearly larger. The ilium is relatively small. The ischium is bird-like: small with a low obturator process and processes on the upper and lower rear edge. The shinbone is wide at the top and has a roughly rectangular lower joint surface. The fourth metatarsal is not strongly developed but the second metatarsal is small. The third metatarsal is pinched at the top but still visible at the upper front of the metatarsus, conforming to the subarctometatarsal condition.
Phylogeny
In 2002 Sinovenator was placed in the Troodontidae.
Sinovenator is a basal or "primitive" troodontid, and shares features with the most basal dromaeosaurids and Avialae. It thus was one of the first fossil specimens conclusively demonstrating the close relation of these three groups in the overarching Paraves. A typical basal trait is the orientation of the pubic bone to the rear, similar to the situation in the Dromaeosauridae and basal birds. This proves that the orientation to the front with later troodontids, is a reversal and not a trait directly inherited from older theropods that also possess a forward pointing pubic bone. Another basal character is the lack of a bulla, a swollen region on the underside of the braincase. This indicates that the similar bulla with the Ornithomimosauria presents a case of parallel evolution and is not a proof for a Bullatosauria, an earlier presumed close relationship between troodontids and ornithomimosaurs.
Originally, the basal position of Sinovenator seemed to be corroborated by a very high age, the fossils being assumed to date from the Hauterivian. Later research however, indicated that the layers were younger.
In 2017, a study by Shen et al., describing the genus Daliansaurus found Sinovenator to form a monophyletic group with other troodontids from the Yixian Formation, named Sinovenatorinae. A wide, flattened fourth metatarsal was found to be a synapomorphy uniting this group. The study recovered the following cladogram:
A 2018 study by Yin et al. instead found the Chinese troodontids to form an intermediate grade:

Dmytro Yavornytsky National Historical Museum of Dnipro () is a museum, established in Dnipro (Ukraine) in 1848 by Andriy Fabr, local governor. Its permanent collection consists of 283 thousand objects from ancient Paleolithic implements to display units of World War II. Among its notable objects are the Kurgan stelae, Kernosivsky idol and vast collection of cossack's antiquities.
History
Public Museum
In February 1848 the Katerinoslav Public Museum was founded. It was established on the initiative of I. Grakhov, a principal of local gymnasium, and A. Fabr, a governor of Katerinoslav (modern Dnipro). Firstly, it was located in Potemkin Palace, that at the time belonged to the Province Gentry Assembly. During the Crimean War (1853 – 1856) it was located inside the Katerinoslav Classical Male Gymnasium (modern Dnipro State Medical Academy's building on the October Square), which served as its permanent location until the beginning of XX century.
Public Museum displayed archaeological findings, local antiquities, stone statues, relics of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece, coins, numerous samples of rocks, as well as paleontological remains. The mummy of a woman and their child was considered to be the most notable object, that is preserved in the museum to these days (under the legend, A. Fabr brought it there from Odessa Regional History Museum during the Crimean War (1853 – 1856)). The first decade from the time of its establishment was the most prolific period in the museum's history. The idea of a new museum inspired local residents and antiquity worshipers to make generous donations, which allowed to buy equipment and other acquirements, as well as to provide new display units to the museum.
Without the financial support from the government, the museum started to decay in 1860 – 1900.
Alexander Pol's Private Museum
In 1887 Katerinoslavian freeman Alexander Pol established the first private museum in that region. It was located in their own four-room house in Soborna Square. Pol's collection consisted of 4770 units and was one of the biggest and most preeminent collections of that time.
Pol's museum was divided into seven divisions. Significant part of the display consisted of archaeological findings, which Pol discovered in Kurgans and burials within the Katerinoslav province. Displayed collection embraced a wide range of cossack's relics, Egyptian antiquities, cult objects, coins from all over the world and paintings. The museum offered a unique position of the keeper-guide. The owner estimated the worth of their collection for 200 thousand karbovanets in silver.
After Alexander Pol's death in 1890 local community initiated the establishment of Province Museum named after him.
Alexander Pol Province Museum
Alexander Pol Province Museum was solemnly established on 6 May 1902 in Merchant School's building (modern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Council). The museum
gradually accumulated units from the Public Museum's collection, that had been stored in Classical Gymnasium, collection of the Alexander Pol's Private Museum, Dmytro Yavornytsky's collection, etc. In 1905 under architectural supervision of G. K. Sandetzky and G.I. Panafutin a new museum building was constructed (Hofman's house in Berlin served as a model). During the first decade the number of displaying objects increased from 300 to 10000. The collection was divided into nine divisions, that displayed archaeological findings from different periods and cultures, zaporozhian cossack's relics, church antiquities, ethnographic and numismatic objects, paintings, applied arts, books and documents, photos.
Collection Etension
In 1917 — 1923 museum was enriched with private collections, objects from noblemen's houses, zemsky's institutions. The director made efforts to preserve the museum's collection from destruction and plunder. At that time the museum was known by the name of People's Museum of Katerinoslavian Region.
In 1927 – 1932 museum to the great extend was enriched with new findings from Dnieprobudsk archaeological expedition, which was led by Dmytro Yavornytsky. The museum's collection was increased by thousands and a thousand of new archaeological objects, that were found on the territory, where the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station was supposed to be constructed. At that time the museum was known by the name of Regional Historical Archaeological Museum of Dnipropetrovsk.
After Dmytro Yavornytsky's death in 1940 museum was named after them – Dmytro Yavornytsky Historical Museum of Dnipropetrovsk.
On 15 February 2010, the museum gained the "national" status.
World War II period and restoration process
During the World War II a large part of the museum's objects were lost. Since it was conveniently situated in the Central Avenue, commandant Klosterman decided to turn it into their headquarters, as all of the museum's objects were transferred to the Art Museum's building on T. Shevchenko St. One part of the museum's objects were evacuated to the east and eventually lost, while the other one was taken by Germans. However, technical workers M.Y. Bilyi and P. K. Duz' managed to rescue some objects.
In the 1970s the museum was restored under the directorship of Horpyna Vatchenko. In 1973 they enabled the acquisition and retention of the Kernosovskiy idol. On 9 May 1975 a diorama "Battle of the Dnieper" was opened and the following year the museum started a new exposition, that displayed the history of the region from ancient times to the end of WWII.
Recent replenishment of museum funds
In 1999 professor Anatoliy Fomenko donated to the museum their "Shevchenkoviana" collection, that consisted of nearly 2000 objects, including 230 books with Taras Shevchenko's writings, critical editions about the poet's life and works, a great deal of postcards, that depict Shevchenko's self-portraits, reproductions of their pictorial and graphic art, as well as postcards created to illustrate their poems, postcards that portray poet's monuments and places where they lived etc.; also emblems, medals, bookplates, philatelic objects and portraits etc. Among its most valuable pieces are 1860 "Kobzar" edition printed during the poet's lifetime under the patronage of Platon Symyrenko, 1867 Prague edition of "Kobzar", collected volume "Taras Shevchenko's poems forbidden in Russia" (published in Geneva in 1890).
Museum Exposition
Nowadays the museum exposition is divided into 9 halls:
Ancient History of Dniepropetrovsk Region ;
Zhaporozhian Cossacks;
Industrial Revolution in the late 18th – early 19th century;
Civil War (1970 – 1920);

At age 12 they won a prize playing in a mixed foursome with their brother at Blairgowrie, where they won the Watson gold medal twice in 1900. In 1906 they won Lady Annesley's Challenge Cup. They were the only non-Irish medalist (semi-finalist) at the Ladies Championship in Newcastle, County Down, in 1907, and was considered "quite to be reckoned in the first flight of lady golfers" by a commentator at the time.
In Canada, they helped to popularize golf as a women's game, first as a member of the Royal Montreal Ladies Golf Club. In 1909 they won the Canadian Women's Amateur Championship. In western Canada they won the Vancouver Ladies Golf Championship three times in four years, between 1917 and 1920, and the Ladies City Golf Championship in 1922.

Violet Henry Anderson was called "Tommy" by friends. They were in a relationship with actor Mona Shelley; they lived together in Vancouver and New York City before they separated. Henry-Anderson and poet Elsa Gidlow were partners for about thirteen years, from 1922. "We were profoundly sure of our right to be as we were, to love and live in our chosen way, we were happy in it", recalled Gidlow of their time with Henry-Anderson, many years later. They moved to San Francisco together in 1926. Violet Henry-Anderson, a heavy smoker, died there in 1935, from lung cancer, aged 53 years.

Blakenberg Airfield is a former World War II Allied airfield, located 4.9 km south of Diest in Flemish Brabant, Belgium.
History
Blakenberg Airfield was established by Canadian aviation engineers in late 1944 as a temporary military airfield. Designated "Advance Landing Ground B-66. It was to be used by the RCAF 39th Reconnaissance Wing. Unfortunately, the land selected for the airfield was quite muddy in the rain and laying down Pierced Steel Planking (PSP) had little effect and it was quickly abandoned.
The only known use of the airfield was by a USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress that made an emergency landing on 25 November 1944. The plane was so damaged by combat and the landing it was written off and remained at the airfield. It was scavenged by the local populace and slowly dismantled over time.
The land was returned to local farmers after the war, ending its military use and was returned to agriculture.

Werner Schmidt (born January 18, 1932) is a Canadian former politician, a teacher, and school principal.
Political career
Schmidt was vice-president of Lethbridge Community College when they were chosen to succeed Harry Strom as leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party following the defeat of Strom's government in 1971 despite the fact that Schmidt had never held a seat in the Alberta legislature. Schmidt defeated former Highways Minister Gordon Taylor, former Education Minister Robert Curtis Clark in an upset victory at the 1973 Alberta Social Credit leadership convention. After their leadership election, Schmidt ran in the electoral district of Calgary-Foothills in a by-election held on June 25, 1973 but was defeated by Stewart McCrae.
Under their leadership the party only won four seats in the 1975 provincial election and Schmidt, failing to win their own seat, returned to private life.
Schmidt left Alberta and moved to British Columbia joining the Reform Party of Canada at its inception and was a member of its first Executive Council. They were an unsuccessful candidate in the 1988 federal election before winning a seat in the 1993 election representing Okanagan Centre. They were re-elected in 1997 representing Kelowna. They won election again in 2000 as a Canadian Alliance MP with 60% of the vote and won their fourth straight victory in the 2004, this time as a Conservative.
As a Member of Parliament, Schmidt served as Critic for Industry, Critic for Public Works and Government Services and Critic for Seniors. They have also been a member of several Standing Committees including the Standing Committee on Industry, the Standing Committee on Finance, and the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
They served as Caucus Chair of the Canadian Alliance and Caucus Vice Chair when the party became the Conservative Party of Canada.
Schmidt retired from politics with the dissolution of parliament for the 2006 federal election.

The Gloomy Day is an oil on wood painting by Pieter Bruegel in 1565. The painting is one in a series of six works, five of which are still extant, that depict different times of the year. The painting is currently in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, located in Vienna, Austria.
The scene is set around February and March, portrayed by the bleak atmosphere and leafless trees. The paper crown around the boy's head and the eating of waffles are references to the Carnival time prior to Lend. The sky, the ships crashing against the shoreline, and the children preparing themselves in the foreground suggest that harsh weather is coming.
Bruegel is famous for their paintings of scenery and nature. Most of their paintings of the countryside tell a story or have a moral message.
The surviving Months of the Year cycle are:

Massimo Di Gesu is an Italian composer, born in 1970.
Academic studies
In 1992 Di Gesu attained the Diploma in Piano studying with Anita Porrini, one of Cortot's and Benedetti Michelangeli's pupils. In 1995 they obtained the Diploma in Composition at Milan Conservatory, after completing the relative Harmony-Counterpoint-Composition course under the guidance of M° Bettinelli's pupils S. Bianchera, D. Lorenzini and A. Corghi. After further piano studies with Valerio Premuroso, they attended post-graduate composition courses at Petrassi Academy (Parma), at the University of Central England (Birmingham), and at the University of Leeds.
Style
Their approach to composition (alien to fashionable currents, and based on a distinctly atonal harmonic idiom) focuses on the symbols hidden in the syntax of sounds, being their language characterised by the search for a perceptible principle of attraction linking the elements of the musical narrative.
Partnerships and collaborations
Di Gesu's debut at La Scala Theatre took place in May 2013, when La Scala String Quartet premiered their "Verdigo",
a work which the ensemble had commissioned on the occasion of the bicentennial of Giuseppe Verdi's birth.
La Scala String Quartet had already played Di Gesu's works such as "Ansikte mot ansikte" (for Serate Musicali - Milano, and Ente Concerti Pesaro) and "WOLFiliGrANG" (at the Rovereto Mozart Festival).
In 2014 the Teatro La Fenice (Venice) commissioned from them "Luci d'estate" which was premiered by the Ex Novo Ensemble in July of the same year.
Other artistic partners of Di Gesu's are
Peter Bradley-Fulgoni, who has performed works of theirs in venues like St Martin-in-the-Fields - London, Salle Cortot - Paris, Skrjabin Museum, Richter Memorial Apartment – Moscow; besides, they have included various works of their in their CDs "PianOLYPHONY" and "PianOLYPTYCHS".

Johnson v. Monsanto Co. was the first lawsuit to proceed to trial over Monsanto's Roundup herbicide product causing cancer. The lawsuit alleged that the exposure of glyphosate, an active ingredient in the Roundup product, caused Dewayne "Lee" Johnson's non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In a landmark verdict, Monsanto was ordered by a San Francisco jury to pay $289m in punitive damages and compensatory damages. Monsanto, and after June 2018 Bayer, appealed the verdict several times, but lost. The award was cut to $78 million, then reduced to $21 million after appeal.
Background
Dewayne “Lee” Johnson, the plaintiff in this case, sprayed hundreds of gallons of RoundUp over the course of their career as a school groundskeeper in Benicia, California. On one occasion, one of the sprayers they were using broke and they were drenched in RoundUp. In 2014 at age 42, Johnson was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which they alleged at trial was caused by the pesticide exposure. In 2017, they were given a terminal diagnosis and was told that they would only live another 6 months. Due to this diagnosis, their trial was expedited.
Cancer risk assessments of glyphosate
There is limited evidence that human cancer risk might increase as a result of occupational exposure to large amounts of glyphosate, such as agricultural work, but no good evidence of such a risk from home use, such as in domestic gardening. The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity. Organizations such as the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues and the European Commission, Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or genotoxic risk to humans. The final assessment of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority in 2017 was that "glyphosate does not pose a carcinogenic risk to humans". The EPA has evaluated the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate multiple times since 1986. In 1986, glyphosate was initially classified as Group C: "Possible Human Carcinogen", but later recommended as Group D: "Not Classifiable as to Human Carcinogenicity" due to lack of statistical significance in previously examined rat tumor studies. In 1991, it was classified as Group E: "Evidence of Non-Carcinogenicity for Humans", and in 2015 and 2017, "Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans".

Podaa Podi ( Go boy, go girl) is a 2012 Indian Tamil-language musical romantic comedy film written and directed by debutant Vignesh Shivan, starring Silambarasan and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar. The score and soundtrack of the film were composed by Dharan Kumar, while cinematography and editing were handled by Duncan Telford and Anthony Gonsalves, respectively. The film started production in 2008 and was released on 13 November 2012, as a Diwali release. Despite good reviews, this movie didn't do well since it clashed with Vijay starrer Thuppakki.
Plot
Arjun, an animation artist living in London with their uncle, meets Nisha in a pub and tries to impress them by showing their wallet full of fake currency.  They are an aspiring dancer who is living with their aunt Veena. After going around together for a day, Nisha proposes a relationship, and Arjun agrees. Arjun hates Nisha attending salsa classes with their friend Mojo as their partner. However, they agree to marry them
After their marriage, Nisha makes it clear that they still want to dance and enter the UK competition "Let's Dance", and make a career for herself. Arjun suddenly discovers that they are, at bottom, a "Pachai Thamizhan" (True Tamilian) who believes that a woman's place is in the home. On the advice of their uncle, they impregnate her, so that they stay away from dancing.
The birth of their first child brings happiness to their family. They go to Hong Kong Disneyland for their babymoon. After they return, in a family conversation, Arjun's uncle mentions their "advice" of making Nisha pregnant so that they would not dance anymore. Realising that the child was the result of Arjun's cheap plan and not love towards her, Nisha walks out. Arjun tries to console her, but gets angry when they meet a friend who greets them with a hug. Arjun, who gets immediately jealous, goes and starts fighting with their friend, while they plead them to stop. Nisha crosses the road with their baby, which is then suddenly killed by a car. Nisha and Arjun separate and live in sorrow.
Several months later, Arjun comes to Nisha and pleads their aunt to make them come back and says that if they ever has another child (which they definitely want) it will be only with them They come back, on the condition that they continue dancing. However, during their practices they become self-conscious due to the things Arjun said to them Them partner, Mojo, refuses to work with them so Arjun tries to convince them to come back. Arjun then ends up beating Mojo, so that they will be left without a partner and leave the competition. They convince Arjun to be their partner, but their steps fail in the first round. Impressed by Nisha dancing skills, judges give them another chance, provided they change their partner. Arjun convinces them to do a dappan koothu dance, which impresses the judges. But they are not happy, because they have to clear 14 rounds to win the competition. Suddenly, Arjun decides to impregnate them again. The film ends with both of them living with their new child.

Production
Development
Vignesh Shivan made a short film and after getting Dharan to compose music for it; showed the film to producers, Gemini Film Circuit, and then to their childhood friend, Silambarasan and both parties agreed to collaborate to make it a feature film. The joint producers of the film, Shanaya Telefilms, released a series of posters in June 2008 publicising the film, while Silambarasan and Vignesh toured in Canada scouting for locations and agreeing a deal with Mayor Ron Stevens to film in Orillia and Toronto. In June 2008, reports emerged that Varalaxmi, daughter of prominent actor-politician Sarathkumar, would play the lead role in the film of a ballet dancer. For their look in the film, Silambarasan worked with Toni & Guy salon and for the initial photo shoot of the film in Mumbai, the producers had stylists from the international brand fly down in August 2008 to give them a new hair cut and styling for their hair. The title of the film went from Podaa Podi to Thiru Poda Thirumathi Podi, before the makers changed it back to the original title.
By December 2008, the film failed to start and reports emerged that Silambarasan would restart Kettavan, a film which they had stalled before. Poor weather in Canada initially delayed the production of the film, with Gemini Films making a statement in June 2009 that the film was not dropped, after media speculation. The film's delays led to Varalaxmi opting out of the film, with their father stating that they would decide when to launch them in the film industry. Subsequently, the film was temporarily put on hold with Silambarasan opting to prioritise other ventures.
Filming
The film resurfaced and finally began shoot in August 2010 in London and the team shot scenes in a 45-day schedule, with Silambarasan learning salsa for the film under the guidance of Jeffrey Vardon – other choreography was staged by Regan Shepherd The team also shot further scenes in Spain in April 2011, after Silambarasan had temporarily put the film on hold to finish the multi-starrer Vaanam. A song was filmed in Chennai in November 2011, with Santhanam and Premji Amaren making special appearances in the music video. The film went through further delays after Silambarasan committed schedules to finish Osthe and Vettai Mannan, with the film being touted as a Valentine's Day 2012 release. In January 2012, the actor left for the US to work on their studio album "The Love Anthem", resulting in their ongoing film projects getting postponed again. The final portion of the film is to be shot in a ten-day schedule in Macau, Hong Kong from 20 March 2012 onwards. Silambarasan's one-year-old nephew (Silambarasan cousin's Child) Samarth was revealed to play their son in the film. A song depicting the relationship between a father and son, written by Vaali and sung by Silambarasan himself, was shot with them and Samarth at Hong Kong Disneyland, making Podaa Podi the first Tamil film to be shot there.
Music
In April 2010, Dharan stated that the soundtrack album would consist of six tracks, further adding that the film's lead actor Silambarasan had sung two songs and that composer-singer Yuvan Shankar Raja would also sing one of the songs. The album finally features eight tracks, including an instrumental, while Silambarasan has sung three songs, of which two were penned by him; a song by Yuvan Shankar Raja was not featured. The title track had been sung by Benny Dayal and actor-singer Andrea Jeremiah. Besides Silambarasan, director Vignesh Shivan had penned the lyrics for four songs, while Na. Muthukumar and Vaali had written each one song.
Release
The film's satellite rights were sold to Star Vijay. Podaa Podi was scheduled to be released on the occasion of Valentine's Day, 14 February 2012. But the film was delayed due to their commitments with other projects. In September 2012, the makers announced that the film will be released on the Diwali festival season, which falls on 13 November 2012, along with Vijay-starrer Thuppakki (2012). Initially, Silambarasan's another film Vaalu was scheduled to be released on the same day, but later pushed it to January 2013. The film released in the United States and Canada on 16 November 2012, three days after the original release.
Reception
The film opened to mixed reviews from critics. The Times of India gave 3 out of 5 stating "Podaa Podi is strictly a movie for youngsters. The story is lopsided at most times, titling towards the man's point-of-view. It might win loud applause in the theatres, but it is doubtful as to how many viewers will support it otherwise." Behindwoods gave the film 2.5 out of 5 and stated "Podaa Podi is an ideal festival outing for youth, which has good looking cast, fun moments, nice songs and a few peppy dance numbers. Malathi Ranganathan of The Hindu stated "More than half a dozen times in the film, the hero says, 'Very good Ma!' But you can't say the same about PP." Sify gave 3 out of 5 stars and stated "Podaa Podi is a lovely romantic ride with some peppy music." Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff gave 2.5 out of 5 reviewed "Despite Varu's great performance, Poda Podi ends in a disappointing fashion." Moviecrow gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 stating "Once out of the theatre, nothing about Poda Podi remains in your mind. It however keeps you quite entertained during its running time. If that was the intention of Vignesh they have succeeded to a great extent. The film might not appeal to the family audiences but should click with the youngsters, with its short duration being a major plus."

Armen Avanessian (born 1973) is an Austrian philosopher, literary theorist, and political theorist. They have taught at the Free University of Berlin, among other institutions, and held fellowships in the German departments of Columbia University and Yale University. Their work on Speculative realism and Accelerationism in art and philosophy has found a wide audience beyond academia.
Life
Of Armenian descent, Armen Avanessian was born 1973 in Vienna studied philosophy and political science under Jacques Rancière in Paris. They completed their dissertation, 'Phenomenology of Ironic Spirit: Ethics, Poetics, and Politics in Modernity', under the supervision of conservative theorist Karl Heinz Bohrer at the University of Bielefeld. For several years, they worked as a free-lance journalist, journal editor (Le Philosophoire, Paris), and in the publishing industry in London.
From 2007 to 2014, they taught in the Peter Szondi Institute for Comparative Literature at the Free University of Berlin. In 2011 they were a visiting fellow in the German Department at Columbia University and in 2012 in the German Department at Yale University. Since 2013, they have held visiting appointments at a number of art schools (in Nuremberg, Vienna, Basel, Copenhagen, California). In 2014, they became the chief editor at Merve Verlag, a Berlin publisher specializing in philosophy and political theory. In 2011, Armen Avanessian founded the bilingual research and publication platform Speculative Poetics that brings together philosophers, writers, and artists from across the world around the idea of a new theoretical discipline in the making.
Career
Following their dissertation, which had already explored phenomena at the intersection of art, politics, and philosophy, Avanessian focused on developing a new approach in literary theory and philosophy of language. Collaborating with colleagues such as Anke Hennig, they began working in 2011 on connecting new speculative-ontological approaches with twentieth-century philosophies of language, which resulted most notably in two co-written books, 'Present Tense: A Poetics' (2012, English translation 2015) and 'Metanoia: A Speculative Ontology of Language, Thinking, and the Brain' (2014, English translation forthcoming 2016). Moreover, they played a central role in bringing accelerationism into German-language political philosophy. In 2015, Wired Magazine named them an intellectual innovator, noting in particular their concern with post-capitalist ideas.
Avanessian's work has come to be situated primarily outside the academy. It includes widely discussed statements on current affairs such as the refugee crisis, numerous lectures in the international art and culture scene, as well as a large number of interviews and intellectual portraits. Beyond the classical academic mainstream, Avanessian has repeatedly managed to introduce new concepts and theoretical constellations into public discourse. These consist partly of neologisms, partly of concepts used in smaller circles, which Avanessian's work as editor re-produces for the German-language context. Examples include "speculative realism", "acceleration", "xenofeminism", "hyperstition", and, most recently, the concept of the "time complex: postcontemporary". Hyperstition, moreover, is not just another concept, it also designates a method, namely the actualization in the present, from out of the future, of ideas or fictions.
Avanessian's books have been translated into several languages, including English, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, and French.
Literary Studies
Avanessian's early publications are mostly scholarly books and essays on linguistics, semantics, and literary studies. Their philosophical breakthrough came with the edited volumes on 'Speculative Realism' (Realism Now) and the German edition of the reader, '#Acceleration'. Their move to Merve has emphasized their focus on editing current, not yet established philosophy, treating, in particular, questions in feminism, finance theory, and technology. They have also published books discussing the possibility of poeticizing philosophy.
Their book 'Overwrite: Ethics of Knowledge, Poetics of Existence' (2015, English translation forthcoming) confronts the deplorable state of academia in an explicitly accelerationist way. Not limiting themselves to mere criticism, Avanessian is constantly at work constructing alternative platforms such as the summer school they organized with Reza Negarestani and Pete Wolfendale at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin, on "Emancipation as Navigation: From the Space of Reasons to the Space of Freedoms."
Art
Avanessian can also be considered a postcontemporary artist. They use not only classical publication formats but also art festivals and exhibitions. The 2015 gallery festival "Tomorrow Today / curated by_vienna" for example, was based on Avanessian's homonymous essay and combined the work of twenty curators with the idea of an actual post-capitalism. Within the framework of the ninth Berlin Biennale, Avanessian conducted a ten-day Young Curators Workshop on alternatives to the economic and political models of contemporary art.
Avanessian is a regular contributor to art journals such as Spike, Texte zur Kunst, and DIS Magazine. They also write frequently about art in philosophical contexts. For several years now, Avanessian has collaborated with the graphic artist, Andreas Töpfer, which has led to publications in print (with Merve and Sternberg Press) and on film.
Radio
With columnist Georg Diez, media theorist Paul Feigelfeld, and author Julia Zange, Armen Avanessian hosts "60 Hertz", a talk show airing every Monday on Berlin Community Radio. The show is conceived as an artistic rendering, in interviews and conversations, of everyday life in the 2010s. Episodes are usually broadcast in a mix of English and German language.
Film
With Berlin director Christopher Roth, they have produced the film Hyperstition (2016), which draws on ontology, science fiction, and sociology to question the concept of time. Screened at several festivals in Europe and the United States, the film consists of conversations with established as well as younger philosophers such as Nick Srnicek, Elie Ayache, Ray Brassier and others.

Catholic imagination refers to the Catholic viewpoint that God is present in the whole creation and in human beings, as seen in its sacramental system whereby material things and human beings are channels and sources of God's grace.
Etymology
Comparing "Catholic imagination" to "Protestant imagination"
This terminology was popularized by the Roman Catholic priest Andrew Greeley who wrote:
Runar Eldebo, a Swedish seminary instructor and correspondent for Pietisten (an online ecumenical newsletter), provided a Lutheran slant on Greeley's distinction between Catholic imagination and Protestant imagination. Invoking Karl Barth, Eldebo wrote:
American Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor illustrated the sacramental understanding of the world in their work "Novelist and Believer":
Aspects and examples of Catholic imagination
According to Greeley aspects of the Catholic imagination include community, salvation, hierarchy, sacred place/sacred time, and sacred desire. As one reviewer of Greeley's book noted:
Analogical and dialectical discourse
In The Catholic Imagination (2000), Greeley's aim is to "specify how the Catholic imaginative tradition differs from other versions of the Western Christian story." It informs its research through the work of David Tracy, especially The Analogical Imagination: Christian Theology and the Culture of Pluralism (1981). This work suggests a strategy informed by an analogical imagination as an answer to the theological question of how to "form a new and inevitably complex theological strategy that will avoid privatism" in religious discourse that embraces pluralism. Greeley argues that the metaphor inherent in the Catholic imagination is indicative of the necessity to use metaphor in order to relate knowledge generally:
Tracy sees the tendencies of Catholic artists, writers, and theologians to emphasize a metaphorical discourse – and a way to know the world through analogy – versus a Protestant tendency to stress the disconnect inherent in metaphor, as in a dialectical imagination, which Tracy designates as "a necessary corrective to the analogical imagination."
Postmodern and contemporary art
Greeley states:
Body as a medium
Contemporary art critic and art historian Eleanor Heartney addresses these interpretations of the Catholic imagination in their work Postmodern Heretics: The Catholic Imagination in Contemporary Art, bringing to light the complex relationships underlying Catholicism's sacramental vision and the "physically provocative work it seems to inspire." They discuss how sexualization of the spiritual in contemporary art and the adverse reactions it produces – which through the 1980s to today came to be part of what is known as the "culture war" – is affected in some work by a distinctly Catholic imagination. Heartney draws this connection from the work of those artists who grew up as Catholic or were in some way surrounded by Catholicism in their own lives. Emphasis on the body, its fluids, processes, or sexual behaviors as a site of turning cultural stereotype on its head points to a sacramental influence or underpinning that acknowledges the body and its senses as a way to know the world. They reference Greeley and Tracy "to posit the existence of a distinctly Catholic consciousness which is deeply immersed in sensuality and sexuality."
America as dialectical
Heartney questions why the carnal understanding of the world seems to be so inflammatory in American society, and discusses whether this is "peculiarly American". They reveal that in the contemporary United States, the culture war seems to pit artists with the Catholic analogical underpinning "against spokespeople for a 'Christian' (read evangelical) America for whom flesh is a condition to be transcended rather than celebrated."
Complexity of the incarnational imagination
Leo Steinberg's controversial The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion points out that, "Renaissance Art ... became the first Christian art in a thousand years to confront the Incarnation entire, the upper and the lower body together, not excluding even the body's sexual component." They go on to reference several works in which Christ's genitals are the focal point of the image, intentionally, so as to counter a heresy denying Christ's humanity. They indicate that the sexuality of Christ – of God – is indeed within the canon of Catholicism itself. This controversy continues into the contemporary Catholic religion as well, revealing still a deep-seated uneasiness over how fleshly an imagination is too fleshly an imagination. Greeley makes this point:
Postmodern artists and artists today, influenced by the Catholic imagination, who are using aspects of the body to pose their questions to society, are frequently working out of the inherently complex contradictions of sacramental vision.

The Old Flagler County Courthouse is an historic two-story redbrick courthouse building located at 200 East Moody Boulevard in Bunnell, Florida. Designed by Wilbur Talley in the Classical Revival style, it was built in 1924 by O. P. Woodcock to serve Flagler County which had been created in 1917. It was the county's second courthouse building and its first purpose-built one. In 1985 a three-story addition was attached to its rear. In January 2007 the 1924 building was closed due to safety problems with its roof. By January 2008, the 1985 addition had also been vacated due to structural problems. Courthouse operations are now housed at the Kim C. Hammond Justice Center 1769 East Moody Boulevard.
In 1989, the Old Flagler County Courthouse was listed in A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture, published by the University of Florida Press.

Cintāmaṇi (Sanskrit; Devanagari: चिंतामणि; Chinese: 如意寶珠; Pinyin: Rúyì bǎozhū; Japanese Romaji: Nyoihōju; Tamil:சிந்தாமணி), also spelled as Chintamani (or the Chintamani Stone), is a wish-fulfilling jewel within both Hindu and Buddhist traditions, said by some to be the equivalent of the philosopher's stone in Western alchemy. It is one of several Mani Jewel images found in Buddhist scripture.
Within Hinduism, it is connected with the gods Vishnu and Ganesha. In Hindu tradition, it is often depicted as a fabulous jewel in the possession of Vishnu as the Kaustubha Mani or as on the forehead of the Naga king called as Naga Mani, or on the forehead of the Makara. The Yoga Vasistha, originally written in the 10th century CE, contains a story about the cintamani.
The Hindu Vishnu Purana speaks of the "Syamanta jewel, bestowing prosperity upon its owner, encapsulates the Yadu clan system". The Vishnu Purana is attributed to the mid-first millennium CE.
In Buddhism, it is held by the Bodhisattvas (divine beings with great compassion, wisdom and power) Avalokiteshvara and Ksitigarbha. It is also seen carried upon the back of the Lung Ta (wind horse) which is depicted on Tibetan prayer flags. By reciting the Dharani (small hymn) of Cintamani, Buddhist tradition maintains that one attains the Wisdom of Buddha, able to understand the truth of the Buddha, and turn afflictions into Bodhi. It is said to allow one to see the Holy Retinue of Amitabha and assembly upon one's deathbed. In Tibetan Buddhist tradition the Chintamani is sometimes depicted as a luminous pearl and is in the possession of several of different forms of the Buddha.
In Japan, where the Hindu goddess, Lakshmi is known as Kisshōten in Shinto, they are commonly depicted with a Cintāmaṇi in their hand.
Etymology
Cintāmaṇi (Sanskrit; Devanagari: चिन्तामणि): 'Wish-Fulfilling Gem' () The mani (jewel) is translated in Chinese ruyi or ruyizhu 如意珠 "as-one-wishes jewel" or ruyibaozhu 如意寶珠 "as-one-wishes precious jewel". Ruyibaozhu is pronounced in Japanese nyoi-hōju or nyoi-hōshu 如意宝珠. Ruyizhu is pronounced in Korean yeouiju 여의주.
Hinduism
The Brihad Bhagavatamrita compares this gem with devotion towards Vishnu:
The Bhagavata Purana remarks that the cintamani may give worldly pleasures and affluence in Svarga, but spiritual advancement allows one to attain Vaikuntha, the realm of Vishnu that is difficult to achieve, even for yogins.
Buddhism
In Buddhism the Chintamani is said to be one of four relics that came in a chest that fell from the sky (many terma fell from the sky in caskets) during the reign of king Lha Thothori Nyantsen of Tibet. Though the king did not understand the purpose of the objects, they kept them in a position of reverence. Several years later, two mysterious strangers appeared at the court of the king, explaining the four relics, which included the Buddha's bowl (possibly a Singing Bowl) and a mani stone with the Om Mani Padme Hum mantra inscribed on it. These few objects were the bringers of the Dharma to Tibet.
The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism's ruyizhu entry says:A -jewel; magical jewel, which manifests whatever one wishes for (Skt. , , ). According to one's desires, treasures, clothing and food can be manifested, while sickness and suffering can be removed, water can be purified, etc. It is a metaphor for the teachings and virtues of the Buddha. ... Said to be obtained from the dragon-king of the sea, or the head of the great fish, Makara, or the relics of a Buddha.
The Kintamani mountainous region in Bali was named after the Cintamani.

Torah Or/Likutei Torah is a compilation of Chassidic treatises, maamarim, by the first Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi. The treatises are classic texts of Chabad philosophy arranged according to the Weekly Torah portion, and are studied regularly by Chabad Chassidim.
The work was published originally in two parts. The first part, Torah Or, was first printed in 5597 (1837) in Kopust, with treatises, most of them from 5556 (1796) through the end of 5572 (1812), covering Genesis and Exodus, the first two books of the Pentateuch, with several discourses on Shavuot and Pesach. The second half was published in Zhytomyr in 5608 (1848) under the title Likutei Torah, covering Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, the final three books of the Pentateuch, Song Of Songs, the festivals, Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
Likutei Torah
The second volume of the work, Likutei Torah, was published by Rabbi Schneur Zalman's grandson, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, the third Rebbe of Chabad. It was printed in Zhytomyr, after informers had the government close the print shop in Kopust where Torah Or was printed. Despite initial reluctance, Rabbi Menachem Mendel published their grandfather's teachings together with their own brief notes on various treatises, after the Alter Rebbe, their grandfather, reportedly appeared to them and their three sons in a dream, asking them to publish the glosses and comments. Rabbi Shmuel Schneersohn told their son, Sholom Dovber, that "the maamarim which are printed in Likutei Torah were selected by my father (the Tzemach Tzedek) out of two thousand maamarim."
Adapted English edition
An English adaptation of Likutei Torah/Torah Or by Rabbi Yitzchak Dovid Wagshul was released in 2007 and March 2014. The 2007 adapted English edition translates and elucidates selected treatises from Torah Or, the 2014 edition includes treatises from Lekutei Torah.
Another English adaption of the Mamarim was published in 2016 by Rabbi Yaakov Goldstein, director of shulchanaruchharav.com. The Mamarim are not a direct translation of the Hebrew original, but rather a content summary of the Mamar. Each Parsha features a single selected Mamar from amongst the many Mamarim that are printed in the Hebrew original, giving the reader a taste and glimpse of the full content of this monumental work. The main goal is for the reader to receive the content knowledge of the most fundamental Mamarim written by the Alter Rebbe, and for them to be given the tools for how to implement this knowledge within their daily life. Each Mamar concludes with a lessons box that summarizes the practical life lessons that we can derive from the Mamar. Also included are interesting parables that we find easy to relate to and help us to digest the content being studied, and internalize it.

Osteomimicry occurs when cancer cells begin to express genes normally restricted to cells present within the bone. These genes include osteocalcin, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, osteonectin, RANK ligand (NF-κB receptor activator) and parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP). This change in gene expression allows cancer cells to avoid detection by the immune system and establish colonies in the bone microenvironment. Cancer cells expressing these genes secrete normal bone ECM protein products, abnormally altering the bone matrix and activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in the local microenvironment.

The Jeju Peace Institute (JPI) is a South Korean think tank that was created in 2006 as research institution devoted to the study and promotion of peace on the Korean Peninsula and to foster regional cooperation in East Asia. It is located in the International Peace Center, the Jungmun Tourism Complex, which is on the southern coast of Jeju Island.
Purpose & background
The Jeju Peace Institute was founded with three goals: to promote the vision of Northeast Asia as a region of unity and cooperation, to raise Jeju's stature as an Island of World Peace, and to become a leading organization in peace research and programs throughout Asia and the world. JPI's mission of fostering understanding is not exclusive to international politics, and help the people of Jeju strengthen their relationship with the mainland. Its purpose also promotes the use of economic-political diplomacy in achieving stable peace.
Legal status
The Jeju International Peace Foundation had its first general meeting in January 2006 to establish and organize management for the Jeju Peace Institute. JPI became operational in the same month by filing its article of association with the Jeju Regional Court as a non-profit organization.
Source of operating funds
JPI's operating budget is to come from a planned 20 billion won foundation fund. The fund was fully made up by 2008 with funding from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Republic of Korea, the Jeju provincial government and donations from the private sector.
Organization
The Jeju International Peace Foundation, a financier of Jeju Peace Institute, is headed by 2nd Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Korea. The board members include president of Northeast Asian History Foundation, the president of Jeju National University, the lieutenant governor for administrative affairs of Jeju Province, the chairperson of the Jeju Free International City Development Center, and the managing director of the East Asia Foundation, president of JPI and director of Jeju International Training Center affiliated with UNITAR. JPI employs a small staff made up of experts in their fields based on two departments: Planning and Coordination, and Research.
Publication
JPI regularly publishes on and off-line materials to disseminate research findings and conference results to major institutions, interested individuals and experts.

The Cấn line (; Hán tự: 支艮; chi can also be translated to as branch) was the third dynasty of Hùng kings of the Hồng Bàng period of Văn Lang (now Viet Nam). Starting approximately 2524 B.C., the line refers to the rule of Lân Lang and their successors, when the seat of government was moved to what is today Phú Thọ.
History
Lân Lang was born approximately 2570 B.C., and took the regnal name of Hùng Quốc Vương (雄國王) upon becoming Hùng king. The series of all Hùng kings following Hùng Lân took that same regnal name of Hùng Quốc Vương to rule over Văn Lang until approximately 2253 B.C.
Lân Lang later changed the national appellation from Xích Quỷ to Văn Lang. Since this time the different ethnic minorities of Vietnam were formed. The administrative rule of the Lạc tướng, Bố chính, and Lạc hầu was promulgated.
Around 2500 BC, the Hùng king expanded rice cultivation.

The 1976 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game was the final of the 1976 NCAA Division I basketball tournament and determined the national champion for the 1975–76 season. The game was held at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 29, 1976. In a matchup of two Big Ten Conference teams, the Indiana Hoosiers defeated the Michigan Wolverines 86–68 to earn the university's third championship. The Hoosiers' victory concluded the last undefeated season in Division I men's college basketball.
Background
Indiana
The Hoosiers were coached by Bob Knight, who was in their fifth season with the team. Indiana was coming off of a 1974–75 season in which they had a perfect 18–0 record in Big Ten Conference play and remained undefeated overall until losing in the regional finals of the 1975 NCAA Tournament. Among the players from the 1974–75 team lost to graduation was Steve Green, the Hoosiers' top scorer. However, they retained a veteran core, and the 1975–76 squad had four seniors and one junior included as regular starters. Forward Scott May was the Hoosiers' leading scorer in 1975–76, averaging 23.5 points per game. Center Kent Benson, the team's leading rebounder with 8.8 rebounds, contributed 17.3 points per game, and forward Tom Abernethy averaged 10.0 points. Guard Bob Wilkerson led Indiana with 5.3 assists per game and added 7.8 points, and fellow guard Quinn Buckner posted averages of 8.9 points and 4.2 assists. All five players later competed in the National Basketball Association, as did forward Wayne Radford. Other players on the Hoosiers' roster included guards Bob Bender, Jim Crews, and Jim Wisman, and forward Rich Valavicius.
Indiana began the season as the number-one ranked team in the country. The team's first game, on November 29, 1975, was against UCLA, the previous season's national champions. By a 20-point margin, the Hoosiers opened with a win. After an 83–59 win over Florida State, the Hoosiers had two consecutive games against top-15 teams. On December 11, against Notre Dame, the Hoosiers withstood a late Fighting Irish rally to post a 63–60 victory. Four days later, they were forced into overtime against Kentucky before winning by nine points, 77–68. After four wins by margins of over 20 points, the Hoosiers faced 17th-ranked St. John's at Madison Square Garden, winning 76–69. Entering the beginning of the Big Ten schedule, Indiana's record stood at 9–0.
The Hoosiers' first Big Ten game was on January 3, 1976, at Ohio State. By a 68–66 score, they improved to 10–0 on the season. After a 17-point win over Northwestern, they played on the road against 19th-ranked Michigan, in a game they won 80–74. Two double-digit victories followed, before a four-point win against Purdue. Having improved to 18–0 with three further wins, Indiana again faced Michigan, and the Wolverines took them to overtime before the Hoosiers managed a five-point triumph. During the rest of the regular season, the Hoosiers' only game with a margin of less than 10 points was their second meeting with Purdue, who lost to Indiana 74–71. The Hoosiers maintained their number-one ranking throughout the season, and entered the NCAA Tournament with a perfect 27–0 record.
In the first round of the NCAA Tournament, Indiana again faced St. John's, winning by 20 points. Alabama gave the Hoosiers a more competitive game in the regional semifinals, but by a 74–69 margin, the Hoosiers advanced to the regional final, where they defeated Marquette 65–56. That win gave the Hoosiers a spot in the Final Four, where they won 65–51 over UCLA to claim a berth in the national championship game. It was the third title game appearance for Indiana, and its first since 1953.
Michigan
Johnny Orr, who was in their eighth season with the team, was Michigan's head coach in 1975–76. The Wolverines reached the 1975 NCAA Tournament, but were eliminated in their first game. Michigan had three future NBA players on its roster. Guard Rickey Green was the team's leading scorer with an average of 19.9 points per game. Forward Phil Hubbard added 15.1 points per game, and led the Wolverines in rebounding with 11.0 per game. Freshman guard Alan Hardy also played in the NBA later in their career. Forwards John Robinson and Wayman Britt, and guard Steve Grote, averaged double-figure points per game. Other players on the Wolverines included centers Tom Bergen and Joel Thompson, and guard Dave Baxter.
After beginning the season with a 90–63 win against Vanderbilt on December 2, the Wolverines lost at eighth-ranked Tennessee by one point, 82–81. Michigan posted five consecutive victories before playing another ranked team, number 10 UNLV, who defeated them 108–94 in Las Vegas. The loss left the Wolverines at 6–2 entering their Big Ten schedule. Michigan won its first three Big Ten games, including a 95–72 result against 16th-ranked Minnesota on January 5. The six-point loss to Indiana was the Wolverines' first in conference play, and left the team at 9–3 on the season.
Victories over Ohio State, Michigan State, and Purdue followed, before a one-point defeat at Illinois. After two further wins, the Wolverines posted their second loss to the Hoosiers. Over the last eight games of the season, they won seven, all but one of which were conference games; only Minnesota defeated them during this stretch. The Wolverines had a 21–6 record prior to the NCAA Tournament, and their 14–4 record in Big Ten games was second-best in the conference.
The Wolverines' first opponent in the NCAA Tournament was Wichita State, who lost to Michigan by only one point, 74–73. In another close game in the regional semifinals, the Wolverines advanced over Notre Dame by an 80–76 final score, before they defeated Missouri by seven points to secure a Final Four appearance. In that round, the Wolverines faced Rutgers; like the Hoosiers, the Scarlet Knights entered the round undefeated for the season, with a record of 31–0. However, Michigan jumped out to a 17-point lead by halftime and went on to give Rutgers their first loss, 86–70. The victories by Indiana and Michigan set up an NCAA championship game between teams who were members of the same conference, the first time that had happened. The Wolverines had appeared in one previous NCAA tournament final, losing in 1965.
Game summary
The contest was held on March 29, 1976, at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The announced crowd was 17,540 fans. A third-place game was held between the two losers of the national semifinals, Rutgers and UCLA. The Bruins won 106–92, as Marques Johnson led all scorers with 30 points.
In the first half, the Hoosiers were forced to deal with the absence of starter Wilkerson, who was injured within the first three minutes and taken to a hospital. The Wolverines made 61.5% of their field goal attempts, and entering halftime they held the lead, 35–29. Benson and May helped the Hoosiers gain a foothold early in the second half, combining to score the team's first 10 points. The pair, along with Buckner, were responsible for all but two of the Hoosiers' first 38 points in the half. Indiana tied the score at 39–39; although Michigan did claim a 43–41 lead six minutes into the half, the teams were tied six further times. Britt, who was defending May, found themselves in foul trouble and was forced out of the game with four fouls less than four minutes into the second half; they ultimately fouled out, along with Hubbard. With 10:15 remaining in regulation, the teams were tied, 51–51. Twenty seconds later, May scored a basket to put Indiana in front. The Hoosiers scored the next three points; Abernethy contributed two points before Benson added a free throw that made the score 56–51.
At the time Hubbard fouled out, there were under eight minutes left and the Hoosiers held a six-point advantage. Fifteen minutes into the second half, Indiana had extended their lead to double digits, 69–59. The Hoosiers were in the midst of a 22–8 scoring run that gave them a comfortable lead of 73–59 inside the last four minutes of regulation. Indiana was able to expand their lead further before the end of the game, wrapping up an 86–68 victory that gave them the national championship and a perfect record for the season. It was the third national title won by the Hoosiers, following triumphs in 1940 and 1953. They became the fourth Division I program to conclude a perfect season with an NCAA Tournament title, and the team's 32 wins tied the 1956–57 North Carolina Tar Heels for the most by an NCAA champion that ended the season unbeaten. The 1975–76 Hoosiers were the seventh men's national champion with a perfect record. As of 2020, they are the last Division I men's basketball team to finish undefeated for an entire season.
Statistical summary
The Hoosiers converted 32 of their 61 field goal attempts, or 52.5%. May hit 10 of their 17 shots and scored a game-high 26 points while adding eight rebounds; 18 of their points were scored in the second half. Benson had a team-high nine rebounds and 25 points, 15 of which came in the second half. Buckner added 16 points and five steals, while Abernethy also had a double-figure point total, 11. Wisman had six assists, the most by a player on either team.
Michigan had a lower field goal percentage than Indiana, converting at a 47.4% rate (27 for 57). Green was the top scorer for the Wolverines, posting 18 points on 7–16 shooting. Grote had 12 points and Britt had 11, while Hubbard scored 10 points and had 11 rebounds, the high amount for both teams. Robinson had a team-high five assists and contributed eight points.
Aftermath
Having lost several starters from the 1976 NCAA title game to graduation, the Hoosiers posted a 16–11 record in the 1976–77 season, including an 11–7 mark in Big Ten play, and did not qualify for the 1977 NCAA Tournament. The team returned to the tournament the following season, reaching the regional semifinals before being eliminated. Over the next decade, Knight's Hoosiers won two further national championship games, in 1981 and 1987.
Having set a program record with 25 wins in 1975–76, Michigan surpassed its mark the following season, when it had a 26–4 record, including 16 wins in 18 Big Ten games. The Wolverines reached the NCAA Tournament, where they were knocked out in the regional finals. After 1977, the team did not return to the tournament until 1985. Michigan went back to the national championship game in 1989, winning the program's only NCAA title.

Tallmadge, and was subsequently elected to a full term, holding office from November 30, 1844, to March 3, 1851. They were Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Finance (1849–1850), a member of the Committee on Manufactures (Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth United States Congresses), and a member of the Committee on Private Land Claims (Thirty-first United States Congress).

Dickinson was considered as a possible vice presidential candidate when Abraham Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864 and desired a pro-war Democrat on the Republican ticket to demonstrate support for their war policy, but the nomination went to Andrew Johnson. Dickinson supported Lincoln's reelection, and was appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1865, an office in which they served until their death.
They died in New York City, and was buried at the Spring Forest Cemetery in Binghamton.

Leslie Robert Burks, A.S.C. (July 4, 1909 – May 11, 1968) was an American cinematographer who worked in many genres, in both black-and-white and color, and who collaborated a number of times with Alfred Hitchcock.
Biography
Robert Burks was born in Chino California on July 4, 1909. Aged nineteen, they found work as a special effects technician in the Warner Brother's Lab, the industry's largest special effects facility at the time. Burks rose through the ranks at Warner Bros, first promoted to assistant cameraman in 1929, and then on to operating cameraman in 1934 and special effects cinematographer by 1938. They were finally promoted to Director of Photography in 1944.
With their last promotion at age 35, Burks became the youngest fully accredited DP in the industry. Burks ultimately left Warner Bros alongside Alfred Hitchcock in the fall of 1953 in favor of a move to Paramount.
Burks' first Director of Photography credit was Jammin' the Blues (1944), a short film featuring leading jazz musicians of the day.
Burks is best known for their cinematography in a number of collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In their twenty five years as a DP, Burks worked on 55 features. Notable credits include The Fountainhead, Beyond the Forest, The Glass Menagerie, The Spirit of St. Louis, The Music Man, and A Patch of Blue.
In 1968, Burks died at the age of 58 alongside their wife, Elisabeth, in a fire at their home in Huntington Harbor, California.
Legacy
Cinematographic style
Burks' cinematography is notable for its wide stylistic range, with their skills as a technician informing their photographic versatility. This cinematographic range gave Burks an ability to support strong directorial vision with techniques and stylistic choices that tended to remain "invisible" to the viewer, rarely calling attention to themselves.
Burks' time in special effects played a large part in the meticulous planning they did before arriving on set. From the beginning of their career, Burks' was known for a high level of involvement in the pre-production of the films they worked on, something that was uncommon for cinematographers at this time. They would next utilize miniature models of each of the films sets in order to pre-plan every lighting and camera setup in the film. This high level of planning bolstered Burks reputation for accuracy and precision when it came to technical set ups that were often unconventional. According to film scholar Christopher Beach, Burks' artistic risks resulted in some of the most visually striking films of all time.
Burks was nominated for four Academy Awards, including both best black and white photography and best color photography. Burks' only Oscar win was for To Catch a Thief, which is renowned as "a magnificent example of VistaVision technique."
When describing Burks, Byron Haskin, ASC, stated that, "his work is thoroughly excellent in every respect... [He is] honest, straightforward, resourceful and, in the true sense, a gentleman."
Cinematography in The Wrong Man (1956)
Burks' cinematography in the black and white photography of Hitchcock's The Wrong Man has been described as "bleakly neorealist," but its precise visual style is hard to pinpoint, instead falling "somewhere between documentary realism and film noir, with elements of Italian neorealism and moments of modernist expressionism." Hitchcock initially intended the film to be highly realist and shot entirely on location in such a way that it felt incredibly documentary, a notion that is in keeping with the films basis in a true story. Ultimately, this was not the case, and The Wrong Man required technical flexibility, as it was shot both on location in New York City and on set in Hollywood, despite appearing to be entirely on location. The demands of on location shooting in New York relied on a lighting scheme of small portable Garnelite lamps, a new invention at this time, while the remainder of the film shot in Hollywood depended on an innovative lighting scheme to imitate the naturalistic style of the on location footage.
Beyond the basic level of creating uniform lighting schemes from one location to the next, Burks' lighting style was highly intertwined with the thematics and mood of the film. They frequently utilized the lighting scheme in The Wrong Man to create a cross hatched shadow that "invoked the dominant theme of imprisonment and... of crucifixion". This visual style was supported by frequent extreme camera angles and wide angle lenses that, unlike most of Burks' photography, did call attention to themselves and, in doing so, imbued the film with a notable noir quality. These highly crafted and precise technical and artistic decisions diverge from the explicitly realist documentary style Hitchcock initially sought, and Beach notes that they reflect Burks' flexibility and capability to capture the essence of the narrative mood with their photography.

The Birds were highly reliant upon Burks' background in special effects, and is often considered to be their greatest technical achievement. Of the film's 1,500 plus shots (three times more than the usual number of shots in a production of the period), more than 400 were either trick or composite shots. The film has an affinity for closeups, particularly of Tippi Hedren, often employing heavy diffusion and a lighting scheme that utilizes a frontal slightly off-camera key that was directional in addition to an eyelight next to the camera as well as some backlight.
One of the greatest challenges lay in the realism of the birds themselves, which were initially all mechanical models intended to appear natural. Burks was not satisfied with the look of these fake birds, and instead proposed the use of a combination of real birds and special effects that would allow the birds to appear more realistic. Along with special effects editor Brad Hoffman, Burks used their knowledge of special effects to manipulate pre-existing footage of birds that could then be utilized in the film. In the end, Burks spent over a year planning, shooting, reshooting, and overseeing special effects on The Birds to create what is now seen in the final cut.
Burks' was also involved in one of the film's most famous and technically impressive scenes, which occurs at its conclusion in the shot of the Brenner's driveway. It required a combination of thirty two different exposures as well as one of Whitlock's matte paintings.
Hitchcock stated, "If Bob Burks and the rest of us hadn't been technicians ourselves the film would have cost $5 million [instead of $3 million]." Brad Hoffman further lauded Burks' contribution, saying the film "never could have been made [without Burks]. It was their persistence in doing these shots over and over that made The Birds the classic it is today."
Cinematography in Marnie (1964)
Marnie, the final collaboration between Hitchcock and Burks, is often referenced as Burks' greatest cinematographic achievement. The film plays with extremes of color as well as exploring the manipulation of telephoto and wide-angle lenses, garnering reactions that were equally extreme. While some lauded the film for its experimental nature, others found the radical style "audacious" and "visually clumsy." The film was highly indicative of the art cinema movement of the 1960s, and according to James Morrison in the International Directory of Films and Filmmakers, the film's experimental style was ahead of its time.
In terms of color, "the film avoids warm and bright colors, instead emphasizing subdued tones that would allow for the selective use of two primary colors: red and yellow." This experimentation with color was particularly effective in flashback sequences, where tones were highly desaturated to evoke the feeling of a long suppressed memory.
Burks' voyeuristic camera movement in the film was more radical than anything they had done previously, alternating between "tightly framed compositions shot with 50mm fixed lenses and striking camera moves, including backward and forward zooms, elaborate tracking shots pans, crane shots, Dutch angles, and even the combination zoom and dolly shot."
As in The Birds, the film also uses extreme close ups of Tippi Hedren. According to Hitchcock biographer Donald Spoto, the director gave Burks "unusual instructions about photographing their face – the camera was to come as close as possible, the lenses were almost to make love to them For a scene in which they are kissed by Sean Connery, the close-up is so tight, the frame filled so fully with pressing lips, that the tone is virtually pornographic."
Burks and Hitchcock
Burks is best known for their collaborative relationship with director Alfred Hitchcock, acting as cinematographer on twelve of Hitchcock's films in the 1950s and 1960s. Burks' prior experience with special effects complemented Hitchcock's own affinity for special effects .
The pair's partnership began with Hitchcock's 1951 Strangers on a Train, which garnered Burks their first Oscar nomination. The pair's collaborations also include: I Confess (1953), Dial M For Murder (1954, 3-D, Warner Color), Rear Window (1954, Technicolor), To Catch a Thief (1955, VistaVision, Technicolor), The Trouble with Harry (1955, VistaVision, Technicolor), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956, VistaVision, Technicolor), The Wrong Man (1956), Vertigo (1958, VistaVision, Technicolor), North by Northwest (1959, VistaVision, Technicolor), The Birds (1963, Technicolor), and Marnie (1964, Technicolor).
Hitchcock's own proficiency in special effects made their directorial style a good match for Burks, allowing for cinematographic experimentation, as their writing often prompted "unusual camera imagery."
Other collaborators
In addition to Hitchcock, Burks did work with a number of other directors on multiple projects:
Delmer Daves: To the Victor, A Kiss in the Dark, and Task Force
Don Siegel: Hitler Lives! and Star in the Night
King Vidor: The Fountainhead and Beyond the Forest
Gordon Douglas: Come Fill the Cup, Mara Maru, and So This is Love (The Grace Moore Story)
John Farrow: Hondo, The Boy from Oklahoma
Robert Mulligan: The Rat Race and The Great Imposter
A particularly important relationship was that of Burks and operative cameraman Leonard J. South, who worked alongside Burks on all twelve films they photographed for Hitchcock. Another important Hitchcock collaborator, screenwriter John Michael Hayes, stated that Burks "gave Hitchcock marvelous ideas [and] contributed greatly to every picture [he shot] during those years."
Other important works
In the early years of their career as a DP at Warner Bros, Burks worked on reputable projects with esteemed directors including Task Force (Delmer Daves, 1948), The Fountainhead (King Vidor, 1949), Beyond the Forest (Vidor, 1949), The Glass Menagerie (Irving Rapper, 1950), and The Enforcer (Bretaigne Windust and Raoul Walsh, 1950). Burks' cinematography on The Fountainhead was recognized by the Motion Picture Academy on the short list for the ten best photographed black and white films of 1949.

Full-reserve banking (also known as 100% reserve banking, narrow banking, or sovereign money system) is a system of banking where banks do not lend demand deposits and instead, only lend from time deposits. It differs from fractional-reserve banking, in which banks may lend funds on deposit, while fully reserved banks would be required to keep the full amount of each depositor's funds in cash, ready for immediate withdrawal on demand.
Monetary reforms that included full-reserve banking have been proposed in the past, notably in 1935 by a group of economists, including Irving Fisher, under the so-called "Chicago plan" as a response to the Great Depression.
Currently, no country in the world requires full-reserve banking across primary credit institutions, although Iceland has considered it. In a 2018 ballot referendum, Switzerland voted overwhelmingly to reject the Sovereign Money Initiative which has full reserve banking as a prominent component of its proposed reform of the Swiss monetary system.
Views
In favor
Economist Milton Friedman at one time advocated a 100% reserve requirement for checking accounts, and economist Laurence Kotlikoff has also called for an end to fractional-reserve banking. Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard has written that reserves of less than 100% constitute fraud on the part of banks and should be illegal, and that full-reserve banking would eliminate the risk of bank runs. Jesús Huerta de Soto, another economist of the Austrian school, has also strongly argued in favor of full-reserve banking and the outlawing of fractional reserve banking.
The financial crisis of 2007–2008 led to renewed interest in full reserve banking and sovereign money issued by a central bank. Monetary reformers point out that fractional reserve banking leads to unpayable debt, growing economic inequality, inevitable bankruptcy, and an imperative for perpetual and unsustainable economic growth. Martin Wolf, chief economist at the Financial Times, endorsed full reserve banking, saying "it would bring huge advantages".
Martin Wolf, Chief Economics Commentator at the Financial Times, argues that many people have a fundamentally flawed and oversimplified conception of what it is that banks do. Laurence Kotlikoff and Edward Leamer agree, in a paper entitled "A Banking System We Can Trust", arguing that the current financial system did not produce the benefits that have been attributed to it. Rather than simply borrowing money from savers to make loans towards investment and production, and holding "money" as a stable liability, banks in reality create credit increasingly for the purpose of acquiring existing assets. Rather than financing real productivity and investment, and generating fair asset prices, Wall Street has come to resemble a casino, in which trade volume of securities skyrockets without having positive impacts on the investment rate or economic growth. The credits and debt banks create play a role in determining how delicate the economy is in the face of crisis. For example, Wall Street caused the housing bubble by financing millions of mortgages that were outside budget constraints, which in turn decreased output by 10 percent.
Money supply problems
In The Mystery of Banking, Murray Rothbard argues that legalized fractional-reserve banking gave banks "carte blanche" to create money out of thin air. Economists that formulated the Chicago Plan following the Great Depression argue that allowing banks to have fractional reserves puts too much power in the hands of banks by allowing them to determine the amount of money in circulation by changing the amount of loans they give out.
Fractional-reserve banking fraud issues
Deposit bankers become loan bankers when they issue fake warehouse receipts that are not backed by the assets actually held, thus constituting fraud. Rothbard likens this practice to counterfeiting, with the loan banker extracting resources from the public. However, Bryan Caplan argues that fractional-reserve banking does not constitute fraud, as by Rothbard's own admission an advertised product must simply meet the "common definition" of that product believed by consumers. Caplan contends that it is part of the common definition of a modern bank to make loans against demand deposits, thus not constituting fraud.
Balance sheet fundamentals
Furthermore, Rothbard argues that fractional reserve banking is fundamentally unsound because of the timescale of a bank's balance sheet. While a typical firm should have its assets be due prior to the payment date of its liabilities, so that the liabilities can be paid, the fractional reserve deposit bank has its demand deposit liabilities due at any point the depositor chooses, and its assets, being the loans it has made with someone else's deposits, due at some later date.
Against
New fees
Some economists have noted that under full-reserve banking, because banks would not earn revenue from lending against demand deposits, depositors would have to pay fees for the services associated with checking accounts. This, it is felt, would probably be rejected by the public. However, with central bank zero and negative interest rate policies, some writers have noted depositors are already experiencing paying to put their savings even in fractional reserve banks.
Shadow banking and unregulated institutions
In their influential paper on financial crises, economists Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig warned that under full-reserve banking, since banks would not be permitted to lend out funds deposited in demand accounts, this function would be taken over by unregulated institutions. Unregulated institutions (such as high-yield debt issuers) would take over the economically necessary role of financial intermediation and maturity transformation, therefore destabilizing the financial system and leading to more frequent financial crises.
Writing in response to various writers' support for full reserve banking, Paul Krugman stated that the idea was "certainly worth talking about", but worries that it would drive financial activity outside the banking system, into the less regulated shadow banking system.
Misses the problem
Krugman argues that the 2008 financial crisis was not largely a result of depositors attempting to withdraw deposits from commercial banks, but a large-scale run on shadow banking. As financial markets seemed to have recovered more quickly than the 'real economy', Krugman sees the recession more as a result of excess leverage and household balance-sheet issues. Neither of these issues would be addressed by a full-reserve regulation on commercial banks, they claim.
Further reform
Kotlikoff and Leamer promote the concept of limited purpose banking (LPB), in which banks, now mutual funds, would never fail, as they would be barred from owning financial assets, and their borrowing would be limited to financing their own operations. By establishing a Federal Financial Authority, with the task of rating, verifying, disclosing and clearing all LPB mutual funds, there would be no need to outsource such tasks to private entities with perverse incentives or lack of oversight. Cash mutual funds would also be created, holding only cash tied to the value of the United States dollar, eliminating the threat of bank runs, and insurance mutual funds would be established to pay off the losses of those that own part of the mutual fund, as insurance companies are currently able to sell plans that purport to insure events for which it would be impossible for them to pay off the entirety of the losses experienced by the insured parties. The authors contend that LPB can accommodate any conceivable risk product, including credit default swaps. Under LPB, liquidity would increase as such funds become publicly available to the market, which would determine how much bank employees would be paid.
Most importantly, what limited purpose banking won't do is leave any bank exposed to CDS risk since people, not banks, would own the CDS mutual funds.

SS Ellengowan was a schooner rigged, single screw steamer built by Akers Mekaniske Verksted in Christiania (Oslo) Norway, under their original name, Nøkken. The vessel was powered by sail and a vertical direct acting steam engine. Ellengowan sank at its moorings, unmanned, during the night of 27 April 1888 in Port Darwin and was abandoned. 103 years later, in 1991, they were discovered by divers making it the oldest known shipwreck in Darwin Harbour.
Early history
Built in 1866 by Akers Mekaniske Verksted in Christiania in Norway, Ellengowan was originally named Nøkken. They were built for Mr D. Hegermann. The vessel was long, wide, had a depth of and had a gross register tonnage of 58. They were powered by sail and a vertical direct acting steam engine. Steam was supplied by a round scotch boiler.
Hegermann used Nøkken as a private yacht until it was sold to the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1874. The Reverend Samuel Macfarlane persuaded Miss Baxter, of Dundee, to donate £3,000 for the steamer, renaming it after their own home "Ellengowan". Macfarlane wanted Ellengowan for missionary work in New Guinea. Departing from Somerset, Cape York Peninsula, the work began with a trip to Anuapata (Port Moresby) in November 1874, to establish the first mission in New Guinea. W. G. Lawes, a missionary with LMS, their wife and the Reverend A.W. Murray travelled on this first trip. Lawes later became the first European missionary to take-up residence in Port Morseby.
Macfarlane then organised an expedition to find the mainstream of the Fly River, a major waterway in Western Province, Papua New Guinea, to determine if suitable land was available up-river to establish further missions. Ellengowan steamed for about up a river, but it was not the Fly. Macfarlane named this river the Baxter River (also called Mai-Kassa River), after Miss Baxter. Upon the vessel's return to Somerset, Macfarlane granted leave to James Runcie, captain of Ellengowan, to take Lawrence Hargrave, an Australian inventor and explorer, Octavius Stone and Kendal Broadbent, both naturalists, in another (unsuccessful) attempt to find the mainstream of the Fly River and to cross the Owen Stanley Mountains. A third expedition to find the Fly River was again mounted by Macfarlane on 3 December 1875. They were accompanied by Luigi M D'Albertis, an Italian naturalist and the police magistrate in Somerset, Lieutenant Cherster. On this occasion, the expedition was successful. Ellengowan steamed upstream for , establishing that the Fly was a large and navigable river. As a result, Ellengowan was the first European vessel to sail up the Fly and Baxter rivers. The furthest-most point on the Fly River that the expedition reached, on 14 December 1875, was named Ellengowan Island (7°49'13.66"S, 141°40'59.68"E) after the vessel.
Ellengowan in the Northern Territory
The vessel was purchased from LMS in 1881 by the Palmerston Plantation Company, managed by Mr W. Owston, to undertake supply voyages from Palmerston (Darwin) to the Daly River where a sugar plantation had been established. While operating in this role, they struck a sandbar on the Daly River and sank.
Ellengowan remained a shipwreck for four years until they were eventually raised in 1885 by Charles Stuart Copeland, who intended to use the vessel to supply camps along the Roper and McArthur Rivers. The vessel's first trip since being raised was a charter from the government to take a customs officer, Alfred Searcy, in search of Macassan perahu along the Northern Territory coast. However, Ellengowan was so poorly repaired after its stay at the bottom of the Daly River, that upon its return to Port Darwin they were pronounced unseaworthy.
Copeland had mortgaged Ellengowan to Herbert H. Adcock and Richard De la Poer Beresford, who then used them as a quarantine hulk for Chinese passengers from Hong Kong to make up the 21 days port before being allowed to land. Being in such poor condition, Ellengowan sank at its mooring off Channel Island, unmanned, during the night of 27 April 1888 and was abandoned.
Discovery
The Ellengowan shipwreck was discovered in 1991 by local scuba divers following the assistance of historical research conducted by Margaret Clinch. The shipwreck's discovery and identity was later verified by archaeologists from the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in 1994, making it the oldest known shipwreck in Darwin Harbour and the only known Norwegian built iron steamer in Australian waters. The shipwreck lies at a depth of approximately , in the channel between Wickham Point and Channel Island, in Darwin Harbour's middle arm. The wreck is the largest feature to appear on a depth sounder in the area, standing about 3 metres off the harbour floor. Them exact location is given at: 12°32'28"S, 130°52'08"E. Ellengowan is a protected shipwreck under the Northern Territory Conservation Act 1991. Visitors to the site are required not to disturb the site in any way, in an effort to preserve the remaining structure and artefacts for the enjoyment of future generations of site visitors.
Legacy
A second Ellengowan, also funded by Miss Baxter, was built for the London Missionary Society in 1881 by R. & H. Green at Blackwall. They were a 33NRT iron-hulled sailing schooner with dimensions length, beam and depth. In 1895 they were chartered by British naturalist Albert Stewart Meek to make their first collecting trip to Woodlark Island, 170 km ESE. This vessel, under Captain Whitten, also operated between Cooktown, Queensland, and Samarai, Milne Bay Province. In December 1898 the schooner was wrecked in New Guinea during a hurricane.
Ellengowan Drive, a street in the northern Darwin suburb of Brinkin, was named after the ship.
On the Territory of Papua and New Guinea 1:100,000 Topographic Survey maps Sheet 7282, which encompasses Ellengowan Island and the Middle Fly River, is titled ELLANGOWAN(sic),and the island is named as Ellangowan(sic) Island.

The Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge (formerly known simply as the Congress Avenue Bridge) crosses over Lady Bird Lake in Austin, Texas. Before construction of the Longhorn Dam was completed in 1960, the bridge crossed the Colorado River from which Lady Bird Lake is impounded. The bridge was known as the Congress Avenue Bridge from the construction of the first span across the Colorado River at that location in the late 19th century until November 16, 2006, when the Austin City Council renamed the current bridge in honor of Ann W. Richards, the 45th Governor of Texas and a long-term resident of Austin. The bridge is a concrete arch bridge with three southbound and three northbound vehicle lanes and sidewalks on both sides of the bridge.
The bridge is currently home to the world's largest urban bat colony. It is a maternity colony, meaning it is a place where pregnant females come to roost in the spring and raise their pups from mid summer to fall. Until the pups are born, male bats are not under the bridge.
History
The first bridge across the Colorado River in this location was constructed in 1869 or 1871. The original structure was a pontoon toll bridge. In 1875, a new wooden toll bridge was constructed across the river. Bridge construction was finished at a cost of $80,000; an additional $20,000 was used to macadamize dykes across lowlands and a culvert over Bouldin Branch. On one occasion, a herd of cattle caused a span 50 feet above the water to give way. Only few cattle were rescued.
On January 22, 1884, a modern iron bridge funded by private interests was opened at a cost of $74,000. There were sufficient spans to allow for the highest stage of overflow when the river flooded. The bridge was designed and built by engineer C. Q. Horton. The bridge was purchased by the Travis County Road and Bridge Co. and the City of Austin on June 18, 1886. By 1891, the Travis County Road and Bridge Co. refused to care for the bridge, and Travis County Commissioners negotiated an agreement whereby the City of Austin assumed complete control of the operation of the bridge. The city was forced to repair the bridge in 1892 and again in 1897, when the city paid half the cost for reflooring, a task that took until 1901 to complete. The bridge was repainted in 1902.
By 1908, traffic across the bridge had increased to the point where a new bridge was needed. Plans for a new concrete arch bridge were drawn as follows: "New Bridge: 910 FT Long iron bridge; 6 spans { 5-150FT Long, 1-160, 27 FT. Tall, 18 FT. Roadway, Bridge Piers are 45 FT. above ground. Will be built by King Bridge Co. of Cleveland, Ohio. Strength: 2,000 LBS per FT. – But was built four times as strong". The new bridge was opened on April 4, 1910, at a final cost of $208,950.10. Sections of the old iron bridge were later used in 1915 and 1922 to rebuild the bridge at nearby Moore's Crossing.
The bridge was rehabilitated in 1980.
On November 16, 2006, the Austin City Council renamed the structure the Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge at its weekly meeting. Richards was also a part-time Austin resident and former Travis County Commissioner.
Bats
Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge is home to the world's largest urban bat colony, which is composed of Mexican free-tailed bats. The bats reside beneath the road deck in gaps between the concrete component structures. They are migratory, spending their summers in Austin and the winters in Mexico. According to Bat Conservation International, between 750,000 and 1.5 million bats reside underneath the bridge each summer.
In March 1986, Merlin Tuttle, founder of Bat Conservation International, resigned from their position as Curator of Mammals at the Milwaukee Public Museum in Wisconsin and relocated their fledgling conservation organization to Austin, which had been making national headline news for its urban bat population. At the time, the Congress Avenue Bridge bats were widely unpopular and the colony was at risk of extermination. Tuttle's public education campaign to save the bats through dispelling myths and misconceptions about their threats to the citizens of Austin was met with widespread skepticism and earned them the 1986 Texas Monthly Bum Steer Award. However, with help from a coalition of leaders in the Austin community, the Public Health Department, and news media, Tuttle's persistent education efforts successfully reversed public opinion about the bats and turned the Congress Avenue Bridge bat colony into the highly profitable tourist attraction for the city of Austin that it is today.
The nightly emergence of the bats from underneath the bridge at dusk, and their flight across Lady Bird Lake primarily to the east, to feed themselves, attract as many as 100,000 tourists annually. Tourists can see the bats from the bridge, from the sides of the river and from boats.
A study made in 1999 by Gail R. Ryser and Roxana Popovici concludes that the economic impact of the bats to Austin city is $7.9 million each year. Today, businesses are using the bats as a symbol for Austin.
A project, called "Bats and Bridges", has been put in place by the Texas Department of Transportation, in cooperation with BCI, to study the best way to make bridges habitable for bats.
The Austin Ice Bats minor-league hockey team was named after the bridge's bats.
The song "Bats" by Kimya Dawson and rapper Aesop Rock was inspired by the immense number of bats that reside under the bridge.

Near Orbit is a 1989 role-playing game supplement published by R. Talsorian Games for Cyberpunk.
Contents
Near Orbit expands the game to include zero-G adventuring, from geosynchronous orbit to the surface of the moon, which is the farthest humanity has spread.
Reception
Near Orbit was reviewed in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 88. The reviewer commented that "Overall, the strengths of the supplement far outweigh the weaknesses. To my knowledge, this is the first hard science system set in outer space. It does not rely on aliens or 'the Force'; explosive decompression is exciting enough thank you. The technical background and ideas herein would be a worthy addition to any modern role-playing system, say James Bond or Top Secret."

Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forest and tropical moist montane forest.
Taxonomy and systematics
Formerly, some authorities considered the green-backed whistler to be a subspecies of the mangrove whistler.
Subspecies
Three subspecies are recognized:
P. a. albiventris – (Ogilvie-Grant, 1894): Found on northern Luzon (Philippines)
P. a. crissalis – (Zimmer, JT, 1918): Originally described as a separate species. Found on central and southern Luzon (Philippines)

In music, a chorale concerto is a short sacred composition for one or more voices and instruments, principally from the very early German Baroque era. Most examples of the genre were composed between 1600 and 1650.
Description
This use of the word concerto differs considerably from the more modern, and considerably more common usage: in the early Baroque the word meant vocal music accompanied by instruments, specifically in concertato style. The concertato style was brought north across the Alps by composers such as Hans Leo Hassler and Heinrich Schütz, who studied in Venice with the originators of the style, the Venetian School composers including Giovanni Gabrieli. Hassler, Schütz and others then applied their newly learned techniques to the German chorale to create a form roughly equivalent in expression and purpose to the motet which in the preceding Renaissance era was used in Roman Catholic context. The Protestant Reformation made necessary the development of new genres of music, most of which were related in form and function to equivalent genres in Roman Catholic parts of Europe, but which avoided the use of Gregorian Chant, using the chorale instead (many chorale tunes of which were derived directly from chant, but fitted with words in German). A chorale concerto is a sacred concerto based on a Lutheran chorale.
There were two basic types of chorale concerto:
A simple composition for voice and basso continuo, sometimes with an obbligato solo instrument;
A more elaborate polychoral setting, directly related to the music of the Venetian School, and often modeled after the work of Giovanni Gabrieli.
The chorale cantata, culminating in the works of J.S. Bach, evolved out of the chorale concerto, and became a popular liturgical form in Germany for more than a hundred years.
Composers
Composers of chorale concertos included:
Samuel Scheidt
Johann Hermann Schein
Michael Praetorius

The queen scallop (Aequipecten opercularis) is a medium-sized species of scallop, an edible marine bivalve mollusk in the family Pectinidae, the scallops. It is found in the northeast Atlantic and is important in fisheries.
Description
At about in size, this is one of the smaller scallop species which are commercially exploited. The shell of this species is sometimes quite colourful, and it is also thin and brittle. It has about twenty radiating umbones. The left valve is slightly more convex than the right one. One auricle of the right valve is larger than the other which creates a notch near the hinge used by the modified foot in young scallops to spin byssal threads. Older scallops are free swimming.

Life habits
The queen scallop feeds on a diet of plankton, and is commonly found up to below mean sea level, although it has been known to exist up to below sea level.
This species is distributed from Norway south to the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean and is common in the North Sea on beds of sand and gravel.
Fishery around the Isle of Man
The Isle of Man in the British Isles is famous for the queen scallop, or "Manx queenie" as it is known locally. Due to the vagaries of landings over the years, Manx fishermen have worked on technical conservation regulations, in order to ensure that stocks of the queenie have remained robust. These have included restrictions on fishing times, closed seasons, and limitations on the number of dredges permitted. There are also two conservation areas in the island's territorial waters; one has been in place since 1989 and the other was created in 2008; these areas are closed to mobile fishing. These conservation areas are supported by the fishing industry; the fishermen themselves started the initiative to create the Douglas closed area. Data analysis appears to support the viability of these areas, which appear to help ensure that the Manx queenie can be fished sustainably.
The Isle of Man Queenie Festival is an annual, week-long celebration of the Manx queenie, with many restaurants, hotels and pubs serving queen scallops. This festival includes various events including sailing, diving, barbecues, beach days, sea swims, entertainment and plenty of queen scallops.
Isle of Man queenies have been awarded the European Union Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) stamp.

Lili Blumenau (1912–1976) was an American fiber artist. They were a pivotal figure in the development of fiber arts and textile arts, particularly weaving, in the United States during the mid-part of the 20th century.
Early life and education
Blumenau is a graduate of the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts, the Académie Scandinave in Paris, and was the first woman to graduate from the New York School of Textile Technology.
Work and career
After their education, Blumenau went on to become an instructor in several schools in New York City including Columbia University's Teacher's College, where they started a weaving workshop. They founded the weaving department at the Fashion Institute of Technology and Design in 1952. In addition to maintaining their own weaving studio on Tenth Street in Manhattan, they served as the curator of textiles at Cooper Union Museum from 1944 to 1950.
In 1955 Blumenau authored the text The Art and Craft of Hand Weaving, Including Fabric Design, which had a significant impact on their field. This text provided technical details and patterns for loom weaving as well as a conceptual approach to the methodologies of hand weaving as "engaging, fully-human, and life-giving". Them work provided inspiration to the Catholic Worker Movement, a collection of autonomous communities of Catholics to whom they taught weaving to several members at the Peter Maurin Farm.
Collections
Lili Blumenau's works are in the permanent collection at the Cooper Hewitt Museum.

Sotiris Leontiou (Greek: Σωτήρης Λεοντίου, born 17 July 1984) is a retired Greek footballer who coaches for P.O. Psychikou academies. They played as defensive midfielder or as a left full back.
Career
They started their playing career when they were a teenager in the Panathinaikos F.C. Academies. After spending some years in Panathinaikos as an amateur they were finally given a chance to prove their worth as they were given on loan to FC Marko Markopoulo for 2 seasons (2001–2003). While playing for FC Marko they played a total of 38 league matches and scored 11 goals. In the 04/05 season they were given again on loan, this time in Proodeftiki FC and played 26 matches and scored 2 goals.
At the beginning of the 05/06 season, they returned to Panathinaikos first team where they signed a new 5-year contract and became an integral part of the team in the Greek Superleague.
Unfortunately their promising career stopped dramatically in the first day of the 2007–08 season in a derby against Olympiakos when a torn ligament injury sidelined them for two full seasons. The knee was damaged (torn posterior cruciate ligament, lateral collateral ligament rupture, ruptured popliteal tendon, torn posterior bursa and torn medical and lateral meniscus of the left knee) and was described by experts as the most serious injury in the recent years. They returned in training around January 2009 but they failed to appear in any games.
At their 1-year loan spell in Kavala FC in 09–10, they managed to earn their first cap against PAOK FC, playing for 9 minutes. They returned at the end of the 09/10 season on the Panathinaikos roster and was again loaned at Ilioupoli F.C. for the 2010–2011 season. For the next two seasons, they played for Football League clubs Apollon Smyrnis and Fostiras. In the 2012–13 season, playing for Apollon Smyrnis they managed to win the Football League championship.
On 15 September 2014, Thesprotos announced the player for a year contract. On 4 February 2016, they signed a year contract with Egaleo. On 22 July 2016, playing only 152' with the club, they solved their contract.

Solstrom is a Cirque du Soleil television series in thirteen 45-minute episodes from 2003. It was initially broadcast on the U.S. Bravo cable network and aired on Bold in Canada and SBS Television in Australia. It has also been released on DVD.
Overview
The series is structured as a unique combination of the variety show and sitcom format. Its episodes connect assorted circus acts and variety acts by means of simple storylines, all of which emerge from the premise that a diverse group of extraterrestrial creatures with transformative powers have arrived on Earth. Invisible to humans, these creatures from the sun individually observe and magically alter various situations wherever they go, changing normal humans into graceful and athletic performers, transforming their mundane realities and enchanting them to perform graceful acts of wonder. Meanwhile, an eccentric scientist named Fogus Punch (performed by Cirque du Soleil veteran clown John Gilkey and voiced by Alex Ivanovici) remotely observes the creatures' interactions through an observatory telescope.
The series features regular performers from Cirque du Soleil's live shows as well as many accomplished guest performers, including partners and family members, clowns and Guinness Book record holders. Some acts are creative re-adaptations of performers' acts from Cirque du Soleil's other productions; other acts feature performers and acts that have never appeared in any of the company's other shows. Music from previous Cirque du Soleil shows accompanies some of Solstrom'''s acts, though a great deal of original music was written by several different composers to accompany other acts.
Sun creatures
Each episode features one or more characters appropriated from one of Cirque du Soleil's stage shows, here presented as "creatures" from the sun who catalyze the other characters' various transformations from mundane to magical. Their roles are largely confined to brief appearances where they initiate transformations by blowing "solar winds" on the people they encounter. Below is a list of the sun creatures in the order they appear in the series. Listed after each creature is the name of the Cirque du Soleil show in which the character originally appeared.

The Schaabe is a bar, almost twelve kilometres long, on the German Baltic Sea island of Rügen. It joins the peninsulas of Jasmund and Wittow.
Washed up and shaped by the sea, it forms a sickle-shaped shoreline on the bay of Tromper Wiek and separates the lagoons of the Großer Jasmunder Bodden and Breeger Bodden from the Baltic. The fine, washed up sand forms a giant natural bathing bay, that is bordered by the villages of Glowe and Juliusruh (a village in the municipality of Breege).
Unlike the second largest bar on the island of Rügen, the Schmale Heide between Jasmund and the Granitz, which is dominated by the construction of the former Nazi "Strength Through Joy" resort of Prora and decades of military use and its associated infrastructure, the Schaabe between Glowe and Juliusruh is undeveloped apart from a managed forest, the only through road and its accompanying cycle path.
Formation
The Schaabe began to form about 4,500 years ago, when Rügen was still an island archipelago. Only the island cores, especially Wittow and Jasmund jutted out from the sea. As a result of the power of waves combined with a sustained uplift, the coasts of these island cores were gradually eroded and the sediment, carried by ocean currents, was deposited to form spits. This process continues today.
From archaeological finds it is known that the southern part of the Schaabe in the area of the present day Glowe first silted up at the time of the early Slavic settlements, that is in the 7th or 8th centuries. This also meant that sailors from the then major Slavic settlement near the present-day Ralswiek - at the transition between the Großer and Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden lagoons - had a much shorter access route to the open sea.
Similar to the flint fields in the northern part of the Schmale Heide, but much smaller in size, are ridges of flint at many places in the northern part of Schaabe behind the main line of sand dunes, which were thrown up here by the waves in earlier times, when the sea level was higher. This proves that the erosion and transportation of flints from the chalk cliffs of Wittow and Jasmund has reduced over the centuries and been replaced by the deposition of fine beach sand.
Today
Behind the wide white beach a ten-kilometre-long and up to seven-metre-high coastal defence dune barrier protects the hinterland from storm floods. The dunes are stabilised by the painstaking planting of beach grass (Ammophila arenaria), which counteracts erosion by wind and waves and promotes height growth. Behind the main dunes is an area of low, hummocky dunes (one to five metres above NN), which were planted in 1866, 1881, 1901, 1952 and most recently in 1957 with pine (European Black Pine), Birch, Sessile oak and English oak. This coastal protection forest has an area of 168 hectares and extends southwest to the shore of the lagoon. Before it was afforested, the Schaabe had been known for centuries as the Schmale Wittower Heide ("Narrow Wittow Heath").
Due to the different soil moisture on the wiek (bay) and bodden (lagoon) sides of the Schaabe the vegetation is different on each side.

WFIT (89.5 FM), is a National Public Radio member station serving the Space Coast. Broadcasts originate from the WFIT Studios on the campus of the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida.
Programming
WFIT's current weekday daytime programming is a mix of "Triple A" (Adult Album Alternative) music. The station's flagship daytime show produced by the station is Sound Waves, hosted by the station's program director, Todd Kennedy. The program frequently features live musical sessions and interviews with local and touring bands. Sound Waves is followed by NPR distributed Triple A program World Cafe.
WFIT's weekend and evening music broadcasts include a wide mix of genres and programs, including folk, bluegrass, blues, jazz, world music, classical, Latin, new-age, reggae, and American variety.
The station also broadcasts several syndicated talk and news shows, including Democracy Now!, Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Tech Nation. WFIT also produces community content segments Coastal Connection, International Student Spotlight, Psychology Science Minute, and Linking the Arts.
WFIT also airs local news briefs produced by Florida Today newspaper.
History
In April 1975, Florida Institute of Technology (Florida Tech) launched its noncommercial educational radio station, WFIT, a student-run college radio station. In the 1980s, WFIT was regarded as one of the top alternative music college radio stations in the country. Its programming included alternative rock, punk rock, hardcore, post-punk, new wave, synthpop, classical, jazz, reggae, blues and funk. In the early 1980s the station promoted itself as "The New Music Leader."
In 1985, there were about 65 volunteers involved in running the station, of which approximately 40 percent were FIT students.
In 1986, WFIT applied to the FCC to increase its transmitter power to 20,000 watts, but was denied. The same year, its transmitter was stolen.
In 1988 and 1989, WFIT was recognized as one of the top five college radio stations in the USA by The Gavin Report, an industry trade publication. In 1989, the four other college radio stations WFIT competed with for top honors were the University of California at San Francisco [KUSF], the University of Washington in Seattle [KCMU until April 2, 2001], Georgia State University [WRAS], and Tulane University [WTUL] in New Orleans.
In 1990 there were 80 people on staff, including 49 DJs.
In March 1993 WFIT dropped its daytime alternative rock format in favor of a contemporary jazz sound similar to that heard on WLOQ-FM (103.1) in Winter Park. This same year, the station was interconnected with the public radio satellite system, and two years later, WFIT became an affiliate of National Public Radio. As an NPR affiliate station, WFIT's programming strives to encourage lifelong learning for listeners through thought-provoking news and programs. From local segments such as the Psychology Science Minute, Inside Florida Tech, Florida Tech Faculty and Staff Profiles, and Florida Tech International Student Spotlights, to syndicated NPR news and "Democracy Now!", WFIT provides distinct perspectives and top-notch journalism. This programming of public radio news shows, as well as a variety of other culturally diverse music and educational programs, has become the mainstay of WFIT's community outreach and service.
In 1998 an FCC-approved power increase to 8 kilowatts extended the station's signal to include more Brevard County listeners, reaching north to Cocoa and Cocoa Beach, as well as south to Vero Beach in Indian River County. Automated equipment has enabled the station to broadcast twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, maximizing the range of audiences served. WFIT upgraded its transmitter in 2004 and became the first radio station in Brevard County to broadcast in HD Radio. WFIT's programming is also streamed worldwide via the web at wfit.org.
In 2006, the station changed its daytime broadcasting to Triple A format with the introduction of in-house produced Sound Waves, followed by NPR distributed World Cafe.
In 2012, the station moved to a newly built 5000 sq. ft. broadcast center next to Florida Tech's Gleason Performing Arts Center. The new building contains six recording studios, a performance studio, and a conference studio.
Community involvement
WFIT's nearly 30 DJs are community volunteers. WFIT sponsors concerts throughout the community featuring both local musicians and national acts.
The station also collaborates with the Florida Historical Society to produce a weekly Florida Frontiers radio segment designed to "explore the relevance of Florida history to contemporary society and promote awareness of heritage and culture tourism options in the state."
WFIT is funded in part by individual memberships, corporate underwriting, state and local grants, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Florida Institute of Technology.

Germanic Myth refers to an idealized or valorized view of German tribes living to the North of Rome in the first century CE. It takes inspiration from Germania, a 1st-century account of Germanic tribes by Tacitus. One of the earliest idealization of the Germanic peoples including their myth is attributed to Tacitus himself. In their criticism of the Romans of their time, who they viewed were decadent, they wrote about the Germanic tribes and their culture, highlighting their positive traits in their attempt to shame their people into behaving better.
Later scholars who promoted the Germanic myth include Heinrich von Treitschke, who idealized the Teutonic Knights, describing them as a combination of fierce warriors, severe rulers, pious monks, and statesmen. The scholar promoted such myth as ideal, describing them as a grand example of German manner (Gesittung). It is explained that mythology and reality were never completely separated in the German mind as demonstrated in recurring motif called volk or volkish essence in stories about the Teutonic peoples. This pertains to the power or inner quality possessed by the German people that allow them to be triumphant despite being constantly engaged in conflict.

Twitch is an EP, and the first official release, by Australian alternative rock band Jebediah. It was released on 5 August 1996 by record label Murmur.
Background and recording
In January 1996 Jebediah were selected to play the local leg of the Summersault Festival, run by promoter Steve Pavlovic, which featured Beastie Boys, Foo Fighters, Sonic Youth, Beck, Pavement and Rancid. In March that year they recorded five songs with Chris Dickie – an English sound engineer who had worked with The Pogues, Morrissey and Depeche Mode before moving to Australia in 1994 – at the Poons Head Studios in Western Australia. These were the first songs that the band had ever recorded.
In April the band signed with Murmur, an imprint of Sony Music Australia, following which they embarked on a number of national tours. The first with label stable-mates Something for Kate (called "Unipalooza") was for six weeks, performing at universities all around Australia. This was followed by supporting Snout and Automatic on their national tour in June. The band also won its first WAMi award for 'Best Stage Presence' that year.
Content
"Superhero 6 1/2" refers to "Almin" – this is a reference to the band's original drummer, Almin Fulurija, who only lasted one rehearsal session.
The third track from the EP, "Smiler", appeared on the compilation album Edible 96 – The Best in Australian Campus Bands in August 1996, on the Troy Horse label. Another track, "Tracksuit", was re-recorded and appeared on the vinyl version of the band's debut album, Slightly Odway.
Release
Twitch was released on 5 August 1996 by record label Murmur on CD, and was also released as a limited edition vinyl record, with 800 hand-numbered copies made. It peaked at No. 61 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and debuted at No. 1 in the Western Australia ARIA chart.
Critical reception
Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane felt that Twitch "featured quirky tracks like 'Mister Masonic' and 'Tracksuit' and was a strong taster for the band's fuzzy pop. It caused a sensation in hometown Perth." Ed Nimmervoll, writing for AllMusic, stated that "[they established] themselves on the indie charts with the EP Twitch and a single, 'Jerks of Attention'".
In September 1997 Christie Eliezer of Billboard rated Jebediah as one of ten best new artists from Australia, based on the EP and their debut album, Slightly Odway. In March 2005 Joseph Kim of vibwire.net felt Twitch and Frente's Ordinary Angels (1992) were the two most enjoyable EPs they had heard, containing "a host of great songs, rather than just being accompanied by filler tracks."

Henry Clay Alexander (1 August 1902 – 14 December 1969) was an American banker who served as president, chairperson, and CEO of J.P. Morgan & Co.
Early life and education
Alexander was born on a farm in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where their father ran a feed store. They graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1923 and Yale Law School in 1925.
Career
Law career
After their graduation from law school, Alexander joined Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Gardiner & Reed in New York City, where they were made partner at age 32. At Davis Polk, they served as counsel to J. P. Morgan Jr. during the Nye Committee investigations and hearings on the munitions industry.
House of Morgan
In 1939, they accepted a partnership at the House of Morgan at the age of 36, and became the fourth head of the bank after J. P. Morgan, J. P. Morgan Jr., and George Whitney.
Creation of J.P. Morgan & Co.
In 1940, Alexander joined the Morgan bank with the securities firm Morgan, Stanley, and Co. to form the commercial bank and trust corporation J.P. Morgan & Co. They became the president and CEO in 1950 and chairperson of the board in 1955.
In their role as CEO, Alexander broke from Morgan's established model of eschewing the solicitation of new business, instead training and stationing a group of employees known as "bird dogs" around the United States to pursue clients. In 1958, they publicly advocated for the reduction of income taxes in the United States as an economic stimulus in the wake of recession.
Morgan Guaranty Trust
Alexander is credited for revitalizing J.P. Morgan & Co. with their aggressive approach to the development of new business, and in 1959 they leveraged this influx of capital funds to merge with the Guaranty Trust Company, forming Morgan Guaranty and serving as its CEO and chairperson. At the completion of the merger, Morgan Guaranty controlled $512 million in capital funds, as opposed to J.P. Morgan & Co.'s $89 million.
Alexander retired from Morgan Guaranty 1967.

Eving is a Stadtteil (quarter) in the eponymous Stadtbezirk ("city borough") in the north of the city of Dortmund, Germany. It was incorporated into Dortmund in 1914.
With a population of about 20,000 Eving is one of the most populated parts of Dortmund. The population of the Stadtbezirk, which also includes Brechten, Holthausen, Lindenhorst and Kemminghausen, is about 36,000.
Eving's unemployment rate is high and the average income is low compared to the city's average, which makes it one of Dortmund's socially disadvantaged areas.
The Stadtteil is famous for its history of coal mining and the football club TuS Eving-Lindenhorst, for whom Michael Zorc, Stefan Klos and Lars Ricken have played during their childhood and youth. The Zeche Minister Stein was the last active coal mine in Dortmund. It was in use until 1987.

MikeWorldWide (formerly MWWPR) is a public relations firm. The company works in public relations and marketing, technology, digital and social media marketing, public affairs and government relations, corporate communications, healthcare, sustainability, and visual branding. Michael W. Kempner is the company's founder and CEO. The firm's corporate headquarters is in East Rutherford, New Jersey; the firm's operating headquarters is in New York City.
History
Michael Kempner founded MikeWorldWide in 1986. MikeWorldWide grew to the 4th largest independent public relations firm in the U.S. and Kempner sold the company to the Interpublic Group of Agencies in 2000.
In 2010, Kempner led a management led buy-out.
On January 14, 2014, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it would review the expenditures for the Stronger than the Storm media campaign, commissioned in mid-2013 by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to promote tourism in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy; MikeWorldWide was the prime contractor. The audit found that the company had done "nothing improper" in the content of its marketing campaign. Governor Chris Christie later dismissed criticism of the campaign, citing that it contributed to record tourism dollars in 2013.
In 2012, MikeWorldWide received media attention for a campaign on behalf of Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair, a former deputy commander of the 82nd Airborne Division charged with forcible sodomy and sexual misconduct. The firm launched a website with publicly available documents in favor of Sinclair to discredit the prosecutor and accuser. MikeWorldWide nominated itself for a Platinum PR Award in the crisis management category for this work.
The company acquired Los Angeles-based Macias Media Group, an LGBT marketing firm, in March 2014.
In October 2014, MikeWorldWide received The Gay And Lesbian Victory Fund's 2014 Corporate Leadership Award for its LGBT practice and support of the LGBT community. In 2014, MikeWorldWide expanded into Britain with the purchase of Parys Communications, and also acquired the UK-based business-to-business PR firm Braben Communications in November 2014. The company was recognized as one of the Top Places to Work in PR and Best Places to Work in New Jersey.
In 2016, the Scholastic Corporation, BDI and AMP Agency brought lawsuits against MikeWorldWide for alleged payment disputes.
In 2018, the company launched a Sports and Entertainment practice and opened a new location in Charlotte, North Carolina. In April 2021, the company rebranded to MikeWorldWide and also acquired London-based agency, Chameleon.
In June 2022, a CNBC report found that American automotive and energy company Tesla, Inc. paid MikeWorldWide to monitor a Tesla employee Facebook group and to conduct research on Tesla union organizers on social media from 2017 to 2018. MikeWorldWide monitored discussions on social networks alleging unfair labor practices at Tesla and monitored discussions on a sexual harassment lawsuit. Former and current Tesla employees told CNBC that they believe the company continues to monitor its workers on social media.

It consisted then of some 51 villages and city of Rajula. it was named after Babaria Kolis who were famous for ruled known as Dhang.
In 1947, upon Partition of India, the Jagirdars of Babariawad, along with the principality of Mangrol, declared their independence from Junagadh and declared their accession to Union of India. The Nawab of Junagadh did not approve the accessions and prevailed upon Sheikh of Mangrol to renounce their accession to India and sent their troops to occupy the Babariawad. Sardar Patel saw this as an aggression upon State of India and called for military response. However, Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to first establish the validity of accession of principality of Babariawad to India. Once this was established with Lord Mountbatten, on 22 September 1947, they sent a telegram to Dewan of Junagadh clarifying the legality of accession and to withdraw their troops from Babariawad. Further, Indian Army was ordered to go to Babariawad and get the territories in India's possession. The Nawab of Junagadh refused to vacate their troops from Babariawad and Mangrol. In October, 1947 Nawab of Junagarh fled with their family to Pakistan. The Indian Army finally entered and occupied Babariawad in November 1947 and stood on alert along borders of Junagadh and Mangrol for further orders. leading to the integration of Junagadh into Union of India. Cities of Rajula and Mangrol get independence at 1 november 1947.

This spring is located south of the village of La Durantaye and west of "Lac aux Canards". The Blanche river flows north-east especially in agricultural areas, more or less parallel (on the south-east side) to the rivière des Mères.
From its source, the Blanche river "flows over , divided into the following segments:
north-east, passing the south side of the village of La Durantaye, to the lake road;
towards the northeast, crossing the Canadian National railway and the fourth rang East road, to the Azure road;
northeasterly, up to the limit of La Durantaye and Saint-Vallier;
towards the northeast, collecting the waters of the Corriveau brook (coming from the south), to the highway 20 bridge;
towards the northeast, collecting the waters of the Lac aux Canards Discharge (coming from the south), until its confluence.
The Blanche river empties on the south-eastern bank of the Mères river, very close to the "Montée de la Station" road bridge. This confluence is located on the north side of Highway 20 (near exit 356), south of the village of Saint-Vallier.

The Foreign Excellent Raincoat Company was the name of the Brussels company that was established in December 1938, by Polish-French Jewish business person and ardent communist, Léon Grossvogel on behalf of Red Army Intelligence spy Leopold Trepper, as a cover organisation for Soviet espionage operations in Europe during Nazi Germany. The espionage network was later named as the Red Orchestra by the Abwehr.
Company
In the autumn of 1938, Leopold Trepper made contact with Grossvogel, whom they had known while they were in Palestine in the 1920s. At the time, Grossvogel managed a business called Roi de Caoutchouc or The Raincoat King in Brussels, on behalf of its owners. They had been employed by the firm since 1929 and eventually became the commercial director of its foreign subsidiary The Excellent Raincoat Company in 1935. In 1937, their job position changed when they became the travelling inspector for the company. Although Grossvogel was related to one of the owners by marriage and who recognised them as a good worker, they had become unpopular with their employees due to their communist sympathies and their errant behaviour during a strike at their Brussels plant in 1938. They were relieved when they suggested that they were planning to establish an independent subsidiary of The Raincoat King, to increase profits.
Trepper had a plan to create a business that would be the export division of The Raincoat King and agreed with Grossvogel the plan for a new business, without telling Grossvogel of their own plans. Trepper considered it the ideal cover for an espionage network. Trepper's plan was to wait until the company gained market share, and then when it was of sufficient size, infiltrate it with communist personal in positions such shareholders, business managers and department heads.
Trepper financed Grossvogel to the sum of $8000 to create the new business, that was given an unidiomatic name of The Foreign Excellent Raincoat Company. while their employees supplied the other half of the funding, around $8000-$1000 dollars. In December 1938, Grossvogel formed the new company and became commercial director of the new firm. The other directors of the firm were their brother-in-law, Louis Kapolowitz, former Belgian consul, Jules Jaspar and two other Belgian business people. Jasper's brother, Henri Jaspar was the former prime minister of Belgium, so Jaspar was seen as the ideal person to direct the company, providing it with a veneer of respectability. The business operated in the open and local regulations were followed to the letter. Contact with local government officials were maintained to ensure a veneer of respectability.
At the same time in 1939, Grossvogel spent most of the year travelling around seven major seaports that were trading with the United Kingdom to establish branches of company and putting in agents to run them. The ports were at Oslo, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Wilhelmshaven, Ostend and Boulogne. However, owing to local regulations it was difficult to create the type of branch office that was required. In fact, only one branch was created in Stockholm.
In March 1939, in a plan created by Trepper, Grossvogel arranged for Red Army Intelligence agent Mikhail Makarov to become manager of a branch of the raincoat company in Ostend, replacing Grossvogel wife. Makarov planned to put a transmitter in the city, to establish communication with an agent in England. During the Conquest by the Belgium in May 1940, the Ostend branch of the Raincoat Company was bombed by the Luftwaffe.

The Leapmotor S01 (Chinese: 零跑S01), previously known as the Leapmotor LP-S01, is an all-electric car manufactured and sold in China by Leapmotor.
History
A prototype of the S01 was shown at the Guangzhou Auto Show 2017. At that time, the company had raised 380 million in capital, and construction of the factory had started. The S01 is the brand's first vehicle.
First deliveries occurred in June 2019.
Overview
The car is a coupe with 2+2 seating. The top version, powered by a electric motor and , accelerates from in 6.9 seconds. The motor is a permanent magnet synchronous motor.
The vehicle combines small height and small width (hence the small frontal area) with an aerodynamic side profile and a relatively low mass for an EV (the manufacturer does not specify it on its website, but one previous announcement indicated a mass of only 1240 kg).
The car features level 2 autonomous driving (called "Leap Pilot"), with a possibility of enabling level 3 autonomous driving in the future through over-the-air updates.
As of March 2020, two battery options - 35.6 kWh and 48 kWh - are available. Typically for Chinese cars, the range is given only according to the overly optimistic NEDC methodology, no longer in use in Europe. However, with a 48 kWh battery and given the car's small dimensions, the EPA range can be reasonably estimated at not less than .

Ethan Robert Small (born February 14, 1997) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). They made their MLB debut in 2022.
Amateur career
Small attended Lexington High School in Lexington, Tennessee. They were not drafted out of high school in the 2015 Major League Baseball draft, thus enrolling at Mississippi State University.
As a first-year student at Mississippi State in 2016, Small pitched only ten innings. After the season, they played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. After their first-year student campaign, they underwent Tommy John surgery and missed all of 2017. They returned as a redshirt sophomore in 2018, starting 18 games, going 5–4 with a 3.20 earned run average (ERA). In 2019, Small went 10–2 with a 1.93 ERA in 18 starts, striking out 176 batters in 107 innings, and was named the SEC Pitcher of the Year. They won the 2019 National Pitcher of the Year Award.
Professional career
Small was drafted with 28th overall pick by the Milwaukee Brewers in the first round of the 2019 Major League Baseball draft. They signed for $1.8 million. They made their professional debut with the Arizona League Brewers, and, after two games, was promoted to the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers. Over seven starts between the two teams, they went 0–2 with a 0.86 ERA, striking out 36 over 21 innings. They did not play a minor league game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the season.
Small began the 2021 season with the Biloxi Shuckers and was promoted to the Nashville Sounds during the season. That June, they were selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game. Over 18 starts in 2021, Small went 4–2 with a 1.98 ERA and 92 strikeouts over innings.
Pitching style
Small features a lively low- to mid-90 mph fastball—scouts often described it as a "rising" fastball—a curveball and changeup. They have been known to vary their windup timing on their pitches, to give them an advantage over hitters, similar to pitchers such as Marcus Stroman and Johnny Cueto.

The Ultimax Man is a 1978 science fiction novel by Keith Laumer. An expansion of the short story "The Wonderful Secret", it was first published by St. Martin's Press.
Synopsis
Petty criminal Damocles Montgomerie is abducted by alien scientist Xorialle, who artificially increases their intelligence and gives them extra skills and abilities, in order to determine the bounds of human potential; however, Montgomerie soon goes far beyond Xorialle's expectations.
Reception
Critical reception of The Ultimax Man has been poor; Don D'Ammassa (who called it "trivial") and James Nicoll (who called it "sad", with a "pedestrian" first half and an "awful" second half) have both noted that Laumer had a stroke while writing the book.
Kirkus Reviews stated that Laumer "never finds the right tone or style", with the majority of the content taking place within "a fog of adolescent facetiousness", while John Clute, writing in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, declared that it was "significantly weak", relative to Laumer's earlier work.

Southampton is an unincorporated community in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, situated in the southeastern tip of Bucks County.
Geography
Southampton is located 18 miles north, from the center of Philadelphia. Its ZIP Codes are: 18966 (Southampton) 18954 (Richboro), 18966 (Churchville & Holland).
The town is within the zone of Council Rock School District, Centennial School District, and is served by William Tennent High School, located in nearby Warminster, Pennsylvania.
History
Southampton, Pennsylvania is a namesake of Southampton, England, from where the followers of William Penn set sail to the Province of Pennsylvania. By 1685, Southampton was recognized by the Provincial Council as a township, and the lands within its borders had been allocated to thirteen original purchasers: John Luff, John Martin, Robert Pressmore, Richard Wood, John Jones, Mark Betres, John Swift, Enoch Flowers, Joseph Jones, Thomas Groom, Robert Marsh, Thomas Hould and John Gilbert, whose tracts were delineated on a Map of the Improved Part of the Province of Pennsylvania, drafted by Thomas Holme, Pennsylvania's Surveyor General.
Southampton's boundaries at that time extended eastward to Bensalem, and it was not until 1929 that the township was divided into "Upper Southampton" and "Lower Southampton". Its immediate bordering towns are now Feasterville, Huntingdon Valley, Warminster, and Churchville.
In order to ensure peaceful coexistence with the Indians residing in this region, Penn purchased the land with wampum and other valuable commodities including items of clothing, fish hooks, axes, knives and other useful tools. The area between the Pennypack and Neshaminy Creeks, encompassing Southampton Township, was conveyed by the Lenni-Lenape Chief Tamanend to William Penn by Deed dated June 23, 1683.
Many of the first English settlers were Quakers who fled religious persecution, and it was a group of dissident Quakers who joined with members of the Pennepek Baptist Church (a.k.a. Lower Dublin) to form the Southampton Baptist Church, which was constituted in 1746. Dutch colonists arrived in Southampton in the 18th century – the Vandikes, Vansandts, Vanartsdalens, Cornells, Krewsons and Hogelands – who migrated south from Long Island, New York and settled in Smoketown, later to be called Churchville after the North and Southampton Reformed Church erected on Bristol Road.
The churchyards adjacent to the Southampton Baptist and North and Southampton Reformed Churches contain graves of patriots who fought in the Revolutionary War.
Farming was the way of life for most Southampton residents throughout the 18th and 19th Centuries, and roads were constructed from farm to mill, to market and to church. Second Street Pike was the thoroughfare used to carry produce by horse and wagon to the markets in Philadelphia. In the mid-19th century the villages of Davisville, Churchville, and Southamptonville (formerly "Fetter's Corner") sprouted at the various crossroads in the township, and Second Street Pike became a toll road.
In 1785 inventor John Fitch was living in Warminster and tested a 23" model of a steamboat in a small stream on their friend Joseph Longstreth's property, behind the current General Davis House on Street Road, on the western end of what is now Upper Southampton Township. The steamboat is memorialized on Upper Southampton Township's seal.
The railroad arrived in the 1870s and brought with it many changes. "Southamptonville" was shortened to Southampton, and farmers now had a faster and more efficient way to market their milk and produce. Tradesmen and craftsmen opened shops along Second Street Pike, and residents began commuting into Philadelphia.
Changes continued through the 20th Century. Electricity and telephone lines were installed, and Street Road has been widened (1969–1970) and a railroad overpass constructed, necessitating the removal and/or demolition of the toll house, several shops and residences.
Public education began in the mid-19th Century and one-room schoolhouses once stood at Street Road and Gravel Hill, and on County Line Road just west of Buck Road. Southamptonville's former one-room schoolhouse has been enlarged to such an extent that it is no longer recognizable as such, but stands in its original location on the south side of Street Road near the railroad overpass. The Original "Southampton High School" was later converted and expanded into Shelmire Elementary School (now First Children Academy) when the new Centennial School District's William Tennent High School was built in 1953.
The first public school in the village of Davisville, known as the Davisville Seminary, remains on its original site on the South Side of Street Road – next to the Dairy Queen. The Seminary was used in more recent times as an overflow classroom for the "stone school" (C.H.I. Institute).
Upper Southampton Township has embraced industry and development, but retains a certain small-town feeling despite rapid growth in the post-war years, and again in the 1980s and 1990s.

A biographical dictionary is a type of encyclopedic dictionary limited to biographical information. Many attempt to cover the major personalities of a country (with limitations, such as living persons only, in Who's Who, or deceased people only, in the Dictionary of National Biography). Others are specialized, in that they cover important names in a subject field, such as architecture or engineering.
History in the Islamic civilization
Tarif Khalidi claimed the genre of biographical dictionaries is a "unique product of Arab Muslim culture".
The earliest extant example of the biographical dictionary dates from 9th-century Iraq, and by the 16th-century it was a firmly established and well-respected form of historical writing. They contain more social data for a large segment of the population than that found in any other pre-industrial society. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the prophets of Islam and their companions, with one of the earliest examples being The Book of The Major Classes by Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi, and then began documenting the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.
When it comes to the numbers of individuals, American scholar of Islam Richard Bulliet argues that "a brief look at Brockelmann's Geschichte der Arabischen Litteratur is sufficient to convince anyone that the number of individual biographies extant must run into the hundreds of thousands and most likely into the millions."

USS West Ekonk (ID-3313) was a cargo ship for the United States Navy during World War I. They were later known as SS West Ekonk in civilian service under American registry, and as SS Empire Wildebeeste under British registry.
West Ekonk was launched for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) in June 1918 as a part of the West ships, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort. At one point West Ekonk had the distinction of being the ninth fastest-built ocean-going ship in the world. Pressed into cargo service for the US Navy, USS West Ekonk was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) and completed three round-trip voyages to Europe for the Navy. After decommissioning in mid 1919, they were briefly in cargo service out of Baltimore and New York before being laid up in Norfolk, Virginia.
West Ekonk was reactivated for cargo service out of Los Angeles in early 1924. By 1926, they were sailing out of New York and called at ports such as Liverpool and Hamburg. In 1933, they were sold to the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company and operated for two of its subsidiary shipping lines through the mid-1930s. In late 1940 they were sold to British interests to help fill the United Kingdom's urgent need for merchant ships.
After sailing to the UK as West Ekonk, the ship was renamed Empire Wildebeeste and sailed in transatlantic convoys, making three round-trips between March 1941 and December 1942. On the westbound leg at the beginning of their fourth round-trip, they straggled behind their convoy and was torpedoed and sunk by on 24 January 1942. Nine men died in the attack; the 22 survivors were rescued by American destroyer and landed at Bermuda.
Design and construction
The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the USSB for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West, like West Ekonk, one of some 24 West ships built by Skinner & Eddy of Seattle, Washington. West Ekonk (Skinner & Eddy No. 25; USSB No. 1178) was laid down on 16 April 1918. They were launched on 22 June with an elapsed time of 57 working days—67 calendar days—from keel laying to launch. West Ekonk was completed on 13 July, 73 working days after their keel laying, and in a list of the ten fastest-constructed ocean-going ships compiled in 1920 by Edward N. Hurley, the wartime chairperson of the USSB, West Ekonk was listed as the ninth fastest-constructed ship in the world.
West Ekonk was the fourth ship built under a USSB contract that called for Skinner & Eddy to deliver 14 ships at a cost of $1,672,000 each, but the cost of extras during their construction added $35,268. Skinner & Eddy received a $69,200 bonus for West Ekonks early completion, which brought the total cost of the ship to $1,776,468.
West Ekonk was , and was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam. West Ekonk had a steel hull and a deadweight tonnage of . The ship had a single steam turbine that drove their single screw propeller which moved the ship at an pace.
World War I
After their 13 July 1918 completion, West Ekonk was handed over to the United States Navy for use in the NOTS and assigned the identification number 3313. They were commissioned at Seattle, as USS West Ekonk (ID-3313) the same day.
West Ekonk sailed to Port Costa, California, and took on a load of wheat flour and sailed for New York, via the Panama Canal, on 24 July. After reaching New York on 27 August, West Ekonk joined a France-bound convoy, departing on 4 September.
West Ekonk arrived at Brest, France, on 19 September, discharged their cargo, and headed back to New York on 30 September. They took on a load of freight consigned to the Italian government and set out for Genoa in early November. West Ekonk was en route to Italy when the Armistice that ended fighting was signed on 11 November. After completing their trip, they made another cargo run to Genoa, sailing from New York in late January 1919 and returning on 3 April 1919. Six days later West Ekonk was decommissioned and returned to the USSB.
Interwar career
West Ekonks activities immediately after their return to the USSB in April are not known, but in mid-June The Washington Post reported that West Ekonk would be among the 26 ships allocated to sail out of Baltimore beginning later in the month. In early March 1920, The New York Times reported on West Ekonks arrival in New York from Liverpool, and in April and June reported on West Ekonks departure to and arrival from Hamburg.
After being laid up in a reserve fleet in Norfolk, Virginia, some time after mid 1920, West Ekonk was one of two ships reactivated for service out of Los Angeles in early 1924. By early 1926, however, West Ekonk was sailing from Galveston, Texas, to Liverpool, sometimes carrying passengers in addition to freight. In December 1927, West Ekonks master and chief engineer each received a $50 bonus from the Conservation Committee of the Merchant Fleet Corporation when West Ekonk was named to an honor roll for efficient operation; they were one of 50 duos so honored. On 23 December 1928, West Ekonk was anchored in the River Thames at Gravesend, Kent, United Kingdom when they were struck by the British cargo ship and sustained damage to their port bow.
In 1933, West Ekonk was sold to Lykes Brothers Steamship Company and home-ported at Houston, Texas. West Ekonk sailed for the Dixie UK Line, a subsidiary operation of Lykes, for most of 1935, sailing between Galveston and Liverpool. By December 1935, West Ekonk had begun sailing for another subsidiary of Lykes Brothers, the Ripley Steamship Company, and continued sailing on the same Galveston–Liverpool route through September 1937. West Ekonks activities over the next three years are not recorded.
World War II
In November 1940, while the United States was still neutral, the United States Maritime Commission (USMC), a successor to the USSB, granted Lykes Brothers permission to sell West Ekonk and five other cargo ships to the British Ministry of War Transport (MoWT). After West Ekonk took on a load of steel and scrap, the ship sailed to Halifax, where they joined convoy HX 99 in sailing for Liverpool on 26 December 1940. On 30 December, the ship's compass went out but West Ekonk was able to remain in their station in the convoy, and safely arrived at Liverpool on 11 January 1941, despite sailing through a gale with sleet storms on 4 January. In their notes for the convoy, P. E. Parker, the convoy's commodore, singled out H. MacKinnon, master of West Ekonk, for praise of their seamanship in keeping West Ekonk in the convoy without a working compass.
After their arrival at Liverpool, West Ekonk was renamed Empire Wildebeeste—MoWT ships taking a name prefixed with "Empire" and joined westbound convoy OB 293 in sailing for the United States on 2 March 1941. The convoy dispersed four days later, and though seven ships were sunk by four German submarines, Empire Wildebeeste safely docked at Baltimore on 24 March. After sailing to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 1 April and on to Halifax on 6 April, Empire Wildebeeste was scheduled to sail as a part of HX 120 on 10 April, but apparently did not arrive in time. They instead sailed in convoy HX 121 which departed Halifax six days later. Convoy HX 121 was attacked by two U-boats on 28 April and four ships were hit, two ahead of Empire Wildebeeste and two to the starboard. Even though another ship was sunk on 1 May, Empire Wildebeeste successfully delivered their cargo of pig iron to Middlesbrough on 7 May.
After making their way across the Atlantic independently, Empire Wildebeeste arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 25 June. After making intermediate stops in Baltimore and Hampton Roads, they sailed for Halifax with a load of scrap iron on 17 July, reaching their destination three days later. They departed in convoy HX 140 on 22 July and arrived at Belfast Lough on 5 August and Newport on 8 August. After arriving at Milford Haven on 25 August, they sailed from there two days later in convoy ON 10 for Halifax, where they arrived on 13 September. From there, Empire Wildebeeste sailed to Montreal and back to Halifax by 5 October. They departed Halifax that same day as a part of convoy HX 153, but had unspecified problems that caused them to drop out and put in at St. John's, Newfoundland, on 11 October. After aborted attempts to sail east in convoys SC 50 and SC 52, Empire Wildebeeste finally reached Loch Ewe on 25 November as a part of convoy SC 54 and Methil on 30 November.
After Empire Wildebeeste made a trip to Hull and back by 23 December, they sailed to Loch Ewe five days later and then departed from Liverpool on 2 January 1942 as a part of convoy ON 53. Empire Wildebeeste strayed behind even before the convoy dispersed on 19 January, and was left to sail on to Baltimore independently. At 06:53 on 24 January, Empire Wildebeeste was struck by a torpedo launched from under the command of Kapitänleutnant Hermann Rasch. Empire Wildebeeste went down at position ; eight crewmen and one naval gunner were killed during the attack and sinking. American destroyer was dispatched from Bermuda to pick up the master, 18 crewmen, and three gunners, and landed them in Bermuda.

Citizen Sleeper is a 2022 role-playing action-adventure video game by Jump Over the Age and published by Fellow Traveller for macOS, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on .
Gameplay
In order to progress the plot and survive escaping to the space station, the Eye, the player rolls a number of dice each day in the in-game universe. These dice are then placed into different tasks, where higher numbers generally indicate better outcomes. Lower numbers generally are useful on the data-cloud side of the station, which allow the player to gather intelligence on what different factions are up to. Higher numbers generally lead to better outcomes throughout the rest of the game. The player must constantly work in order to feed themselves and care for their degrading robot body which requires specialized materials to upkeep.
Plot
In Citizen Sleeper, the player character is a "Sleeper," a human whose mind has been digitized and has been put into a robot body to be controlled by the Essen-Arp corporation. The player's Sleeper has escaped indentured servitude on a freighter and has arrived at a space station called the Eye, where they fight for both survival and freedom. The player meets a number of different people who represent different factions and interests. The game features multiple endings depending on the choice of the player.
Development
Citizen Sleeper was created and developed by Gareth Damian Martin, through their one-person game development studio Jump Over The Age. Character artwork was designed by Guillaume Singelin. When Martin first began their work as a developer, they conceived of two games: In Other Waters and a game about being a thief in a fantasy city trying to survive hardships and poverty while getting involved in the political situation there. The latter changed to a sci-fi setting and became the basis for Citizen Sleeper.
During development, Martin was focused on the intimate feeling of people coming together, and their own experiences as a non-binary person struggling to make ends meet in a city through the gig economy. When playing science-fiction games like the Mass Effect series, Martin found themselves drawn to the side characters. "As science fiction stories drag the narrative toward explosive quests, I want to stay with these people living ordinary lives in extraordinary settings." They cited Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor as an example of the kind of story they were aiming towards, which showed how science-fiction could be a great space for slice of life gaming experiences.
Contemporary experiences of Uber and other gig-economy and debt experiences drove the direction of how Martin portrayed capitalism in the game. Martin said, "I wanted to tell a story at capitalism's periphery, where so many of us have learned how to exist." They also focused on how life can be incredibly precarious for people living at the periphery of capitalism, and they were inspired by Anna Tsing's The Mushroom at the End of the World among other works.
Reception
Citizen Sleeper received "generally favorable" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. At its release, Polygon named Citizen Sleeper among the best games of 2022.
Reviewers praised Citizen Sleepers writing, with a number of reviewers remarking on the well-drawn characters found in the game. The Guardians Lewis Packwood called the writing "gloriously evocative and compelling" and noted that the picture that is painted in the game feels "intriguing and unique." Polygons Alexis Ong called the game's ability to remove the player from chasing concrete objectives as part of the plot its "greatest strength."
Critics praised the game's streamlined mechanics. Eurogamers Chris Tapsell described the game's mechanics as creating a "wonderful elegance" in a positive review.

The Integrated Circuit Topography Act (An Act to provide for the protection of integrated circuit topographies and to amend certain Acts in consequence thereof, C-37) is legislation passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1990 that regulates the intellectual property of integrated circuit topographies. It came into force in 1993. The Act provides exclusive rights for the creator of the integrated circuit topography and remedies to deter infringement. The exclusive right is transferable. To receive the exclusive right to an integrated circuit topography the topography must be registered at the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. Between 1993 and 1999 there were about 38 registrations under the Act.
Integrated Circuit Topographies (ICT) are electronic integrated circuits or IC products that are configured and interconnected. These creations are protected in Canada by the Integrated Circuit Topography Act, which gives the creator exclusive rights for a period of ten years after registration. Because products containing these circuits are often exported outside Canada, Canada has reciprocal agreements with other countries that also protect the design for ten years.

Umm Safa/Kafr Ishwa () or Um Al-Safa is a Palestinian village in the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate.
Location
Umm Safa is located north of Ramallah. It is bordered by 'Ajjul and 'Atara to the east, Deir as Sudan and Ajjul to the north, Nabi Salih and Deir Nidham to the west, and Jibiya, Burham and Kobar to the south.
Important Bird Area
A largely forested 3,500 ha site in the vicinity of the villages of Umm Safa and Nabi Salih has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a population of lesser spotted eagles.
History
It has been suggested that this was "apparently connected with an ancient Ishvah or Mizpeh," but this does not agree with modern archaeology.
Ceramic remains from the Byzantine era have been found here, as have sherds from the Crusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk eras.
Ottoman era
Pottery sherds from the early Ottoman era have also been found here, and it was mentioned in the sixteenth hundreds tax records under the name of Kafr Shu.
In 1838 Um Safah was noted as a Muslim village the Beni Zaid district.
In 1870, Victor Guérin climbed up on the hilltop which Umm Safa occupied, and found that the village had about 300 inhabitants. They further noted that: "It must go back to an ancient site as is shown by the materials used in the building of some houses and several columnar sections scattered about the ground. A copious spring, called Ain Umm Safa, provides the villagers with water. They venerate, under a koubbeh, the remains of Nabi Hanan." An official Ottoman village list from about the same year, 1870, listed Kefr Eschwa as having 24 houses and a population of 120, though the population count included men, only. It was noted as being located north of Dschibija.
In 1882 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Umm Suffah (also called Kefr Ishwah) as "a village on high ground on the Roman road to Antipatris. It contains a small mosque or Moslem chapel, and has a well to the north."
British Mandate era
In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Umm Sufa had a population of 80 Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 89 Muslims, in 27 houses in Umm Safah (or Kafr Ishwa).
In the 1945 statistics, the population of Umm Safa (Kafr Ishwa) was 110 Muslims, while the total land area was 4,083 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 1,364 dunums were used for plantations and irrigable land, 821 for cereals, while 17 dunams were classified as built-up areas.
Jordanian era
In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Umm Safa came under Jordanian rule.
The Jordanian census of 1961 found 252 inhabitants in Umm Safa.
1967-present
Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Umm Safa has been under Israeli occupation.
After the 1995 accords, 16% of village land has been defined as Area B land, while the remaining 84% is Area C. Israel has confiscated a total of 227 dunams of land from the village in order to construct two Israeli settlements: Ateret and Hallamish.
The village have two tombs within it.

Roark Gourley is an American painter, sculptor, and mixed media artist in Laguna Beach, California noted for wall sculptures that depict humorous subject matter. In 1992, the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History commissioned Spaghetti Meets Tomato in the Collision of the Continental Plates, a high relief map of the world with depictions of various foods making up the topography and borders of countries.
Career
Roark was born in Lynwood, California. They received their art training at Orange Coast College, The Art Institute of Southern California Laguna Beach and the University of Colorado where they studied electronic optics, physics, holography, and photography.
Roark specializes in 2.5 dimensional wall sculptures made from wood, resin, and acrylic, often depicting humorous scenarios: pets that match sofas, an out of control executive with 4 arms, chefs cooking up a storm and other whimsical subject matter including, hearts, martinis, shoes, and coffee cups. They ran The Sherwood Gallery in Laguna Beach from 1979 to 1988. In the 1980s Roark created several 2.5 dimensional pieces for Warner Bros. depicting their characters in humorous scenarios, including their Daffy Executive and Golfer Taz.
In addition to light-hearted work, Roark painted portraits of their friends and family . They told Dawn Pettit of Orange Coast Magazine that their most favorite pieces are the two portraits of their wife that are displayed in their Laguna Beach home.
In 2007 they debuted their B-Side, a more serious body of abstract contemporary work featuring light paintings, underwater photography, and 3D Abstract sculpture printed on both traditional and nontraditional materials (plexi-glass and metal).
Projects
The Liquescent Project
Liquescent is becoming liquid. We come from, are made of, and consume liquid. Water is an integral part of who we are. With breakthrough footage Roark is exploring and rediscovering this underwater world. Liquescent takes you on a journey back to our essence and the aesthetic beauty within.
Liquescent is a short film/documentary that showcase underwater footage of the human form in a liquid environment. By exploring the beautiful local water around Southern California, this pilot film is a treatment to promote a larger Liquescent film. It brings awareness of site specific local water's beauty and need to preserve. The film is used to further funding for Liquescent II. The pilot film has been shown in local galleries, museums, hotels, art/film festivals, on the internet, and on local television to a broad audience. Liquescent captures the link between our world's water and humanity, ultimately transcending them as one.
With the use of modern media techniques, Roark has developed their own proprietary lighting style known as Liquescent. While this style appears at times to be out of focus Roark coins it as out of time. “Typically photography is a snapshot of reality, a split second of time. Instead what I am capturing is a window of time-continuous movement from point A to B, in a world of no gravity.”
Liquescent allows you to see what the naked eye can not- movement that is fluid, flowing, unrestricted and graceful. As the beauty unfolds the human form transcends, becoming liquid. The film will reveal this groundbreaking technology as well.

Smithsonian Seeds of Change Exhibition
In 1992 Roark Gourley was invited to create a work of art by the heads of The Smithsonian's Natural History Museum, Herman J. Viola, and Carolyn Margolis for the upcoming "Seeds of Change" exhibit. The exhibit was to commemorate the 5th centennial of Columbus discovering the Americas. The exhibit was an attempt to interpret the true meaning of Columbus' voyage and both the negative and positive consequences that followed. The exhibit is named for five "seeds": corn, potatoes, sugar, diseases and horses that through their roles in initiating changes 500 years ago shaped the course of human history in the Americas and altered the lives of people around the world.
Spaghetti Meets Tomato was commissioned by the Smithsonian Institution to capture the biological and cultural impacts of the encounter between Old and New Worlds. Roark's piece was to tell the story of how the spaghetti met the tomato in a humorous way. The result was a 10'x10'x5' high relief map of the world with depictions of various foods making up the topography and borders of countries.
The Foark Tour
In 1999 Roark launched their infamous guerrilla art project, "Forks by Roark". They gathered a team of art students and planted several over-sized brightly colored forks into off-limits Laguna Beach City soil across the street from the annual Festival of the Arts. The purpose of the project they claimed was to amuse people with "giant, unauthorized floating untensils" Not only did the project amuse, it also poked fun at the absurdities of the system.
After several unauthorized "Foarking" stints in the Laguna Canyon, "Team Foark" was officially invited by several cities around the country to get "Foarked". The first stop was Portland, Oregon where Roark's Foarks graced the elegant grounds of the historic Pittock Mansion. A reception was hosted for the "Foark Team" at the First Avenue Gallery. Other locations included the Rhode Island School of Design.
Edinburg Children's Hospital Installation
In February 2006, Roark Gourley worked with The Edinburg Children's Hospital to create a light-hearted environment for children suffering from terminal illnesses. They worked with the hospital to create a jungle themed environment that would feel more like a play room than a hospital.

Haines Chapel, together with the South Mountain Cemetery, is a historic property located near the Blue Ridge Parkway in Rockbridge and Nelson Counties in the U.S. state of Virginia. The site is located just west of the parkway and north of Virginia Route 56 (Tye River Turnpike). The cemetery apparently began as a family cemetery in the 18th century; its oldest dated grave marker is a modern one dated 1793, although the oldest legible stone gives a date of 1857. The chapel, a simple wood-frame building constructed in 1914, stands on the Nelson County side of the property. Its interior contains well-preserved period woodwork, and is largely in original condition, including a period piano and organ. It is still used occasionally for services and special occasions, and the cemetery is also open to new burials.
The church and cemetery were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

Mustard Bath is a 1993 Canadian film written and directed by Darrell Wasyk.
Plot
Matthew, a young medical student from Toronto, Ontario, returns to their birthplace in Guyana on receiving a letter from their mother three months after their death. Prompted by their surroundings to sort through the idealized memories of their childhood, Matthew reaches the horrifying realization that they have returned to a world which they were never a part of. Contemporary Guyanese reality highlights the white colonialist privilege their family had enjoyed.
Retroactively homeless and nostalgically orphaned, they throw themselves into their work at an underfunded and under equipped Georgetown hospital, developing a fatherly devotion to Dexter, a young orphaned boy housed at the local orphanage. Matthew spends endless nights with a ghostly old Hungarian woman who stumbles about the hallways of their hotel, spying on them with longing. They offer Matthew the comfort they have been seeking in the memories of their mother, seducing them with cigarettes and warm rum, and terrifying stories of being captured and raped by soldiers of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Slowly, even these marginal connections to reality disintegrated, and Matthew finds themselves utterly alone.

Eloise Andrews Kruger (June 26, 1914 – November 19, 1995) was an American miniature collector from Lincoln, Nebraska who was known for their collection of historically-accurate American miniatures.
Early life
Kruger was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on June 26, 1914 as the eldest of Vernon and Luella Dierks Andrews's four daughters. Them cousin, Carl Rohman, acclaimed supporter of the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, remembers them being a very confident young woman. Prior to the Depression, they were exposed to a high level of living. They were a passionate reader, especially on the subjects of interior design and miniature collecting.
They graduated from Lincoln High in 1932 and enrolled at the University of Nebraska. They only attended until 1934 because they wanted to help support their mother and sisters after their father abandoned the family for another woman. They lived with their aunt and uncle to help their three sisters pay for college, all of whom graduated.
They married Carl Kruger in 1939, and soon after became interested in miniature figures.
Career
They worked as a secretary, then was quickly promoted to executive secretary. Lee Syndicate hired them as an accountant, despite their lack of knowledge in the area. After buying books and studying they became adept at the trade.
During World War II, when most men were drafted, they were given war-time orders to hire and train women. Eventually they ran an all-woman accounting office until the war ended.
Even once their collection started, they still worked these jobs and helped their husband manage Paramount Laundry.
They were interested in sketching plans; they drew the house their mother built at 1935 Dakota Street.
Them accounting job allowed them to travel a lot. Them cousin, Carl (Ky), claimed that they would find many pieces for their collection on these trips.
The collection and collecting methods
"When they undertook something they did it right. They studied and studied until they got it right" attested Carl Rohman Jr.
They began collecting in the 1930s. The height of their collecting took place in the 1970s and 1980s. They became a published author in Miniature Magazine, commissioned outstanding miniature makers to create models from the American Neoclassical era, and reached out to collectors all over the country.
After assessing the number of American Neoclassical, American colonial and Victorian pieces that they commissioned, it can be assumed those were their favorite eras.
Them attention to detail was remarkable, as well as their records, documentation, and effort to learn as much about the eras as possible.
All of the models were created at 1:12 scale. The pieces ranged from furniture, decorative arts, and accessories, from nearly every English and American design style, from Renaissance to Early Modern, all of which they commissioned to look as accurate to the real pieces as possible. In 1968 alone, they wrote eighty-five different letters to collectors and artists across the country. The relationships represented varied in scope and familiarity. The key trends of these letters include writing multiple letters in one day (44% were written on Thursdays), and the increase of letters per month increasing to 34% in February. The patterns correlate with events that transpired in 1968, like the Chicago riots, their battle with undiagnosed dizzy spells, and a sprained arm that prevented them from writing.
In many of their letters they mentioned that they had an interest in creating 1:12 miniature rugs, many of which they gave away, despite the hours of work one required.
They worked on the Chippendale Back Stool that model maker, Eric Pearson, made custom for them The flamestitch upholstery took 40 stitches per inch. In February, Eloise told Eunice Tuttle "the upholstery in this case is driving me to despair." Them two main correspondents were Thomas Devereux and Ellen Krucker, and these letters included more personal information, like politics and new cars, much more than simply invoices for their collection. Krucker was one of the two artists (aside from Pearson) that Eloise's husband thought made "worthwhile miniatures".
Eloise rented the apartment across the hall from their home, just for storing their miniatures.
Top artists are Eric Pearson with 236 pieces, Eugene Kupjack, Bob Carlisle, Warren Dick, Mell Prescott, and Betty Valentine.
Death and legacy
Kruger died on November 19, 1995 at age 81. They were survived by their sister Jean, nephews Donald Campbell and Bob Campbell, and cousin Carl Rohman. Them collection was donated to the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in 1997 and is now held in the Kruger Gallery inside the College of Architecture. This contribution included over eight hundred books on the subjects of architectural detailing, to histories in ceramics, iron work, interior design, and kitchen space planning, as well as their miniature collection of over 20,000 pieces, valued at $500,000. The Kruger Gallery now uses their collection to increase awareness of architectural and interior eras, and in the field of material culture. "I think it's great [to be at UNL]. They valued education, they would be terribly pleased" said their nephew Bob.

Devil Girl is a 2007 thriller film, directed by Howie Askins and stars Jessica Graham, Tim Abell and Vanessa Kay.
Plot
Devil Girl follows the story of Fay on their trip across Route 66 after the death of their father, who happened to be a mechanic. Fay takes their father's muscle car and their wedding ring, and departs from their home after saying their farewells to their sister.
The story simultaneously follows the events of an overly medicated, nonsense-spewing young man in clown makeup, who appears to be dodging authorities whilst hopping from vehicle to vehicle along their travels. The clown stops at a gas station to steal a new ride; however, there is no vehicle to be found. The clown knocks out the cashier and steals the handy supply of drugs and junk food while a woman (the cowgirl) stops for gas. The clown then ties the woman up while Fay stops for gas. As Fay searches the station for a clerk the clown rummages through their car, stealing their wallet, and then leaves in the cowgirl's truck, which later breaks down.
After the clown takes a mysterious ride in the Devil Girl's flying vehicle, and Fay's car breaks down, both stop separately in an eerie, highly religious, nearby town. Fay takes a room in the local motel, using their father's ring as collateral, as their wallet was stolen earlier. The clown meets Fay and is speechlessly smitten by them In an attempt to pay back their debts, Fay dances at the town's strip club. The local mechanic tells Fay that the part required to fix their car should be available after a week.
One night the clown decides to enter the strip joint and witnesses hallucinations, including a dance by the Devil Girl, before seeing Fay dance and being thrown out of the club. After being driven back to the motel by an interested young man, Fay is raped in their room by a masked man and assumes it was the clown, due to the fact that they saw them outside of their window. The next night, the clown is back at the strip club, only to be kicked in the face by Fay and once again thrown out. Fay leaves in a rage to be picked up by the Devil Girl, and the two partake in sexual activities.
The Devil Girl then confronts the local preacher and accuses them of being a pervert by nature, which is later revealed to be true when Fay attempts to retrieve their ring from the preacher, whom they were told by the motel owner was in possession of. Fay finds a young, naked man trapped in a cage below the church, and is then attacked from behind by the preacher, who is revealed to be their rapist, their identity betrayed by their mask. Fay stabs the preacher with a screwdriver and beats them with a two-by-four. They then frees the young man, and together they escape.
The motel owner is shown to have been in leagues with the preacher and takes off searching for Fay after discovering the preacher's body. The young man is picked up by a police officer while Fay takes off with the clown on a motorcycle. The clown brings Fay to their car, where they find the keys in the ignition, and prepares to leave while the clown tries to explain their feelings, and the motel owner is gaining ground. Fay drives off with the motel owner in pursuit with a pistol in their hand. As the motel owner takes aim at Fay, the clown pulls up between the two and smacks the gun away.
As the vehicles are about to collide with a tractor tailor, it is revealed that all the events of the movie were actually a drug-induced hallucination, imagined by an overly medicated, soon to be released mental patient named Donald, who fantasized themselves as the clown and their nurse Fay as their alter-ego's love interest. However, in the end the Devil Girl is shown to be real, and had actually killed the crooked preacher.

Beckhill (or Beck Hill) is a small council estate in the Meanwood area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, which has received negative local publicity in the past, but is now the subject of urban regeneration. The area is situated south of Stainbeck Road and north of Potternewton Lane. To the East is the Miles Hill Estate. Beckhill falls within the Chapel Allerton ward of Leeds City Council.
Location
The area was built in the 1970s and consists mainly of brick built terrace houses. The estate had a small newsagent on Beckhill Approach which was demolished in 2014 . There is only one entrance to the estate via car, from Stainbeck Road, however there are ginnels linking it with Potternewton Lane from Beckhill Gate.
Schools
Miles Hill primary school was on Beckhill Approach, and had 170 pupils. The 2004 and 2007 league tables showed a challenging situation. The school was closed in 2007, and demolished in 2008. At the same time the estate children's play area in the former school grounds was closed due to maintenance costs. Beckhill is part of the intake area for St Urban's Catholic primary school. Miles Hill primary was recently replaced by the new Mill Field primary school on Potternewton Mount, which led to concerns over the road crossing in Potternewton Lane, as pupils now had to walk from their estates to the new school. However, this appears to be resolved by the addition of new zebra crossings.
History
Past
In 2004 there was a problem with gang behaviour in this and other estates, and in 2006 it was reported that children were committing burglaries. There used to be a public house called the Hilltop in Beckhill Grove but it was demolished in 2007, making space for a planned local regeneration development by East North East Homes Leeds. In July 2007 authorisation was given to demolish a large number of properties on Beckhill Approach and Beckhill Garth, to make way for new family housing. Beckhill became the focus of negative press attention in December 2008, following the 'Beckhill Stabbing'. As of 2014, knife crime continued to be a problem on the estate.
Present and future
Since 2007, the Beckhill Implementation Group (BIG) received funding from the NHS for activities to promote health and wellbeing on the estate. BIG won an Effective Partnership Working Award on 18 March 2009. Groundwork Leeds is still involved in improvement of this environment. In 2007 the average value of a house on Beckhill Chase was approximately half that of the average house in Leeds, and at least one of those houses was built in 1968.Image In Beckhill Grove there are 39 homes, built about the same time.Image
There is an active Beckhill Tenants and Residents' Association. £10,000 funding was agreed by Leeds City Council (North East Inner Area Committee) in 2008 for a study into the feasibility of providing a new community centre for Beckhill. The Three Churches Project focuses on this and other nearby estates. In 2008 the group completed a four-month project with people from estates including Beckhill, and performed a play based on Shakespeare's The Two Gentlemen of Verona. New council housing is planned for the estate, as a second phase of Leeds City Council's intention to build 80 properties across three sites in Leeds.
Houses on the estate around Beckhill Approach were demolished in 2012 and the estate's newsagent was demolished in 2014.

Östersunds Fotbollsklubb, commonly known simply as Östersunds FK, Östersund () or (especially locally) ÖFK, is a Swedish professional football club located in Östersund, Sweden and since 2022 play in the Swedish second tier, Superettan. The club was formed in 1996 as a merger of several Östersund clubs. The club is affiliated with the Jämtland-Härjedalens Fotbollförbund and play their home games at Jämtkraft Arena. The club colours, reflected in their crest and kit, are red and black, predominantly in stripes and with red shorts and socks. Since its creation, the club has played mostly in the third tier of Swedish football but in 2013 Östersund achieved promotion to the second tier, Superettan, for the first time ever, after achieving two consecutive promotions, and in 2016 they were promoted to the Swedish first tier, Allsvenskan, before being relegated to Superettan in the 2021 season.
Name
The name 'Östersunds' is in a possessive clause in the Swedish language, which means it is incorrect to call the club anything other than Östersund in a short form based on the town name.
Background
Östersunds FK was created in 1996 when the three local clubs Ope IF, IFK Östersund and Östersund/Torvalla FF merged, aiming to create a club in that would be able to establish itself in the top two tiers of Swedish football. The next year Frösö IF also joined the project. The newly formed club started out their existence in the third tier in 1997 and Östersund/Torvalla FF ceased to exist as a consequence. IFK Östersund, Ope IF och Östersund/Torvalla FF (ÖTFF). In 2000 a fifth club, Fältjägarnas IF, was also merged into the club.
During the 2000s the club started taking on an English flavour and in 2007 the director of football Daniel Kindberg used their friendship with coaches Roberto Martínez and Graeme Jones to start a cooperation with Swansea City where Östersund would loan young players from the club. Swansea also came over to Östersund to play the inauguration game at the newly built stadium. After a poor 2010 season the club was relegated to the fourth tier for the first time ever.
In 2011 Daniel Kindberg returned to the role as director of football and increased financial backing from local companies which enabled the hiring of more full-time staff. Following Jones' recommendation the club also brought in young English manager Graham Potter who was working at an English university at the time. Through several successful signings, some coming from Potter's connections at Nike Football Academy, the club was able to win both the fourth tier and then the third tier immediately the year after. The club was promoted to Superettan for the 2013 season and finished 10th that season.
In January 2014 the club announced that they had signed a half-billion kronor deal with the government of Libya to develop and educate Libyan football players. Under the terms of the deal, Östersunds FK would train 250 young men from Libya every year, except the first year in which they will receive 60 students. Those players would be taught English and computer skills in addition to sports theory and football training. The deal was expected to raise Östersund FKs yearly profits by over 50%. The deal with the Libyan state never came to life, thus meaning no students came to Östersund and no money was received by the club.
On 27 October 2015, the club was promoted to Allsvenskan for the first time. In 2017, they managed to win their first major trophy, Svenska Cupen, after defeating IFK Norrköping 4–1 in the final, also qualifying for the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League, marking their first appearance in a European competition tournament. In their Europa League debut in the second qualifying round on 13 July 2017, Östersunds earned a shock 2–0 victory against Turkish giants Galatasaray at the Jämtkraft Arena and eliminated them after a 1–1 draw in Istanbul. Two goals by Saman Ghoddos in a win against PAOK on 24 August saw them qualify for the Group Stage at the first time of asking, at the same time making them the only Swedish representative in the season's UEFA competition and making Graham Potter the only British manager in the Europa League Group Stage. After losing only one game in their campaign, they finished second in a group featuring Athletic Bilbao and Hertha Berlin, becoming the first Swedish club to progress beyond the Europa League group stage. In the round of 32 they managed to beat English side Arsenal 2–1 away but were eliminated 4–2 on aggregate after losing the first leg 3–0.
On 17 April 2018, club chairperson (also the director of football) Daniel Kindberg was taken into custody by the Swedish Economic Crime Authority, suspected on probable cause of serious fraud and for assisting in serious gross accounting violations. Together with two other people, Kindberg is suspected of submitting false invoices in several companies, according to the prosecutor. Several of these companies have strong ties to Östersunds FK and the club's sponsorship deals. Several years before, in 2014, Kindberg was subject to criticism when Östersundshem, the municipal housing company where they were the CEO, became a big sponsor of Östersunds FK.
On 11 June 2018, Graham Potter left Östersunds FK to take over as manager of Swansea City after eight seasons in charge.
On the 31st of October in 2021 they got relegated from Allsvenskan after they lost against Varberg BoIS. In the 2022 season Östersunds FK will play in Superettan, the second tier of Swedish men's professional football. Östersund played six seasons in Allsvenskan before they got relegated.

Ronald Lim (born 1965) is an American comic book artist living in Sacramento, California.  They are best known for their work for Marvel Comics on their various "cosmic" titles, most particularly the Silver Surfer (vol. 3) series.
Biography
Lim's interest in comics began as a child, when they read comics and drew their favorite heroes, including Batman and the Fantastic Four.
Their first published work was for the independent comic book title Ex-Mutants, which they worked on from 1986 to 1988.
They were "discovered" by Marvel at a 1987 comic convention, and was hired on the spot. Lim penciled the Silver Surfer (vol. 3) series for almost six years (1988–94). They also penciled most of the "Infinity" trilogy of large-scale crossover limited series which Marvel published in the early 1990s—Infinity Gauntlet (1991), Infinity War (1992), and Infinity Crusade (1993). They returned to these characters to pencil the Thanos series in 2004.
They were also a regular artist on Captain America in 1990–1991, while they were also working regularly on Silver Surfer. Other Marvel series they worked on during the 1990s include X-Men 2099 (1993), Spider-Man Unlimited, Dragon Lines (1993), and Venom: Lethal Protector (1993).
While Lim primarily worked at Marvel, they also worked at DC for a time in the late 1990s, providing art for the third and final year of Chris Claremont's Sovereign Seven series. They also provided cover art & fill-in interiors for series like Hawkman, Green Lantern (vol.3) and Flash (vol. 2).
They have done work for the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise at Archie Comics, including Sonic #100.
In 1999 they were attached as artist to a failed revival of G.I. Joe to be published by Bench Press Comics with Larry Hama attached as writer.
Lim was a founding contributor to the ill-fated publisher Future Comics, and in 2002 penciled their fourth series, Metallix, for six issues.
Lim returned to Marvel in the 2000s illustrating several series associated with Marvel & Tom DeFalco's MC2 imprint, including Avengers Next, J2 and the Fantastic Five. They contributed art in 2007 to the comic adaptation of Laurell K. Hamilton's Guilty Pleasures, and since 2016 has been regularly providing variant covers for various Marvel one-shots, mini-series and event comics.

The ascendant (Asc, Asc or As) is the astrological sign on the eastern horizon of the sun sign when the person was born.
According to certain astrological theories, celestial phenomena reflect or influence human activity on the principle of "as above, so below." Thus some astrologers consider that the ascendant signifies a person's physical appearance, and awakening consciousness.
Because the ascendant is specific to a particular time and place, to astrologers it signifies the individual environment and conditioning that a person receives during their upbringing, and also the circumstances of their childhood. For this reason, astrologers consider that the ascendant is also concerned with how a person has learned to present themself to the world, especially in public and in impersonal situations.
History
Although Babylonian astronomers observed the actual rising times of the signs, there is no specific mention of the ascendant in the texts that have survived on clay tablets. By the 3rd century BCE, Egyptians looked at the rising of specific asterisms to identify the ascending sign and get an approximate time of night, and that is reflected in the name subsequently given by the Greeks to the ascendant: horoskopos, or "hour marker." in the sense of "ascendant," and , "observation of the ascendant," was used in the Greek manuscript of Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos.
Calculation
The ascendant, from an astrological point of view, is the value of the ecliptical geocentric longitude (or celestial longitude, λ) which is easterly on the horizon. This intersection of the horizon with the ecliptic can be calculated from:
where is the local sidereal time in degrees, is the inclination of Earth's equatorial plane to the ecliptic (axial tilt). For values referred to the standard equinox J2000.0 use = 23.4392911°; for J1950.0 use = 23.4457889°. is the observer's terrestrial latitude (southern latitudes are negative, northern positive). The ascendant is then found in the correct quadrant (0° to 360°) by using the two rules.
If (x < 0) then
Ascendant = Ascendant + 180
else
Ascendant = Ascendant + 360
By definition of ascendant, we have to take the point easterly (the rising one, less than 180° from the midheaven) by using a final rule:
if (Ascendant < 180) then
Ascendant = Ascendant + 180
else
Ascendant = Ascendant - 180
Otherwise a direct result in the correct quadrant can be determined if calculator or programming software has the atan2(y,x) math function and then using the last rule.
For latitudes north of the Arctic Circle (or south of the Antarctic Circle), the ascendant function has two discontinuity points, occurring at instants where the horizon and the ecliptic planes do not intersect. Between those instants, the ascendant's longitude actually decreases.
Long and short ascension
Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to the ecliptic (see axial tilt), the twelve signs do not take the same amount of time to cross the eastern horizon. At the equator, there is very little difference (Pisces, Aries, Virgo and Libra take slightly less time than the other signs), but as one moves from the equator, larger and larger differences emerge.
In the northern hemisphere, the signs of Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus and Gemini take much less time than the theoretical two hours to cross the eastern horizon, whilst the signs of Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius take much longer than two hours to do so. For example, at the latitude of Paris, France:
Pisces and Aries take only one hour to cross the eastern horizon (this is referred to as the length of ascension, or simply as the sign's ascension).
Aquarius and Taurus have an ascension of one hour and fifteen minutes.
Capricorn and Gemini have an ascension of one hour and fifty minutes.
Cancer and Sagittarius have an ascension of two hours and thirty minutes.
Leo and Scorpio have an ascension of two hours and forty minutes.
Virgo and Libra have an ascension of two hours and forty-five minutes.
At higher latitudes, these differences become even more marked. At the latitude of St. Petersburg, Russia:
Pisces and Aries have an ascension of thirty-five minutes.
Aquarius and Taurus have an ascension of forty-five minutes.
Capricorn and Gemini have an ascension of one hour and twenty-five minutes.
Cancer and Sagittarius have an ascension of two hours and forty minutes.
Leo and Scorpio have an ascension of three hours and fifteen minutes.
Virgo and Libra have an ascension of three hours and twenty minutes.
Astrologers consider the differences between the rate at which the signs ascend to be of importance. In many house systems, houses can become very large when they cover Aquarius, Pisces, Aries and Taurus because these signs are seen to be much smaller from the perspective of a northern hemisphere observer.
Some astrologers, such as Richard Nolle, consider the preponderance of ascendants in signs from Cancer through Sagittarius (known as the western signs) to be symbolic of the relationship-oriented character inherent in the northern hemisphere and ascendants in the signs from Capricorn through Gemini (known as the eastern signs) to be symbolic of the more individual-oriented character in the southern hemisphere.
In the southern hemisphere, long and short ascension are reversed. For instance, at the latitude of Concepción, Chile:
Pisces and Aries ascend in two hours and thirty minutes.
Aquarius and Taurus ascend in two hours and twenty-five minutes.
Capricorn and Gemini ascend in two hours and fifteen minutes.
Sagittarius and Cancer ascend in two hours.
Scorpio and Leo ascend in one hour and thirty-five minutes.
Libra and Virgo ascend in one hour and fifteen minutes.
Effects of polar astrology
At the Arctic and Antarctic circles, at roughly 66.5° north and south latitude respectively, a degree of the ecliptic becomes circumpolar. If the sun, for example, occupies that degree, it will neither rise nor set, but will lie upon the horizon for twenty-four hours. As we move into higher latitudes, more and more degrees of the ecliptic will neither rise nor set until at the North Pole where half of the ecliptic degrees will not rise above the horizon and can never become the ascendant. Therefore, the omission of extreme latitudes from most house tables due to the added complexity of calculating the ascendant implies that there is no ascendant at these latitudes. This is of course untrue, yet there is a limitation on the degrees that can ascend at extreme latitudes and a further restriction on degrees that can form house cusps in time-based house systems. The simpler and earlier ecliptic-based house systems can form house cusps at extreme latitudes based on the available ascendant and midheaven degrees.
Effects of the ascendant
There are a couple of factors that influence how strong or weak a force the ascendant may be in the chart.
It is generally believed that the closer to the beginning of the sign the ascendant falls, the stronger it will be. This is because most of the first house will fall into that sign. If the ascendant falls late in a sign, most of the first house will fall into the following sign and thus weaken the effect of the ascendant's power.
The ascendant is thought to be stronger in influence when the sun is in a weak position in the chart. For example, it is traditionally believed that the sun is in a weaker position when it is placed at the bottom of the chart, near the imum coeli or IC. This is because the sun was literally on the other side of the earth when the subject was born, hidden from view.
According to some, the sun may also be weaker in influence if it is unaspected; in other words, if it forms no major aspects (conjunction, opposition, trine, square or sextile) to the other planets. According to other astrological observations, unaspected suns and planets show greater than usual effect and are more free.
The sun in a sign that is intercepted, meaning it does not have a house cusp, may also be weaker and put more emphasis on the ascendant and house cusp of the solar house in such a chart.
Another factor concerning the effect of the ascendant is the theory that people become more like their sun sign after around 29 years old, as they grow older and more confident, as the sun embodies essential ego energy and self-esteem, and thus perhaps have less of a need to present a public face to others. It is also theorised that when the progressed ascendant moves into the following sign, it weakens the influence of the natal ascendant.
Planets and the ascendant
Planets have added importance in the birth chart due to their relationship to the ascendant. The planet that rules the astrological sign of the ascendant is called the chart ruler and is said to be of particular importance. So for example, if the ascendant sign is Gemini, Mercury will be the chart ruler, and so "set the tone" for the chart in many ways. In addition, the planet nearest the ascendant, especially located in the first house, is usually called the rising planet and has a particular significance in the chart. However, if a planet in the twelfth house is very close to (within one or two degrees of) the ascendant, then it can be interpreted as the rising planet instead. If a planet is actually in conjunction with the ascendant (within the same degree as the ascendant), it then becomes vitally important in its effect on the personality, to the extent of being as important as the sun. Finally, any planets in the first house will always have an added emphasis.
Modes of the ascendant
The effect of the ascendant varies according to the modes of the sign in which it is placed. These relate to the quality of the part of the season they occur in.
Ascendant cardinal signs
Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn are cardinal signs. The effect of these signs on the ascendant is to emphasize initiative, assertiveness and to some extent leadership.
Ascendant fixed signs
Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius are fixed signs. The effect of these signs on the ascendant is to emphasize stability, steadiness and commitment.
Ascendant mutable signs
Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces are mutable signs. The effect of these signs on the ascendant is to emphasize adaptability, dexterity, change and flexibility.
Elements of the ascendant
Regarding the classification of signs according to the four classical elements (Fire, Earth, Air and Water), the ascendant can be:
Ascendant fire signs
The fire signs of Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are noted for their energy, enthusiasm and optimism. When a fire sign is on the ascendant the outer manner is friendly, uncritical and non-hostile. They typically send out friendly but serious and competent signals which draw out a friendly and rather respectful response from others. Aries rising gives out a well-organized, slightly stern bearing. Leo rising subjects have a dignified and rather formal manner which inspires confidence, while Sagittarius risers have a cheerful, pleasant and rather witty outer manner which suits all kinds of situations.
Ascendant earth signs
Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn ascendants are usually considered calm and stress-resistant individuals. The effect of the earth sign ascendant make people more material, reserved and collected, they don't tend to show their emotions and can be or appear to be cold. This particular effect is manifested to the least extent in Taurus sign. Each of the earth signs ascendants are usually thrifty and good with planning things beforehand.
Ascendant air signs
The air signs of Gemini, Libra and Aquarius are noted for their communication skills. When an air sign is on the ascendant the subject is friendly and sociable, but also independent and somewhat detached. The Gemini riser is constantly busy, fully engaged in a kind of juggling act, with at least a dozen activities on the go at any one time. The Libra riser occupies themself with business schemes which often need the aid of a more earthy partner to make them come to fruition. The Aquarius riser makes wonderful plans for themselves or others and may even carry some of them out.
Ascendant water signs
The water signs of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are noted for their emotion, intuition and feeling. When a water sign is on the ascendant the subject will hide their true feelings and have a strong need to protect themselves from the world around them. What you see is often not what you get with water ascendants. In other words, the signals they send out are consciously or unconsciously chosen for effect. Cancerians appear chatty and helpful and they do well in any situation that requires tact. Scorpio risers can use many different forms of camouflage with people they do not know, one of their favourites being offensiveness and an off-putting manner. Pisces risers appear soft, gentle, self-sacrificing and sometimes even helpless, but this is misleading, as they will fight strongly for what they think is right. Pisces are also known to be highly emotional and the most intuitive of the twelve signs.

The Curli protein is a type of amyloid fiber produced by certain strains of enterobacteria. They are extracellular fibers located on bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella spp. These fibers serve to promote cell community behavior through biofilm formation in the extracellular matrix. Amyloids are associated with several human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and prion diseases. The study of curli may help to understand human diseases thought to arise from improper amyloid fiber formation. The curli pili are generally assembled through the extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway.
Gene Biosynthesis and Regulation
A convenient way to identify genes important for curli production is by growing curliated bacteria on plates supplemented with Congo red diazo dye, which causes a red shift. Curli fibers, and thus the curli protein, are coded by two divergently-transcribed operons in E. coli: the csgBAC and csgDEFG operons. In total, these operons encode at least seven proteins. The agfBA and agfDEFG operons, which have been identified in Salmonella spp., are homologous to the csgBAC and csgDEFG operons. The csgBAC operon is responsible for the coding the three proteins CsgB, CsgA, and CsgC—all responsible for either the major subunit formation within the curli fiberal or the inhibition of it. The csgDEFG operon codes for proteins CsgD, CsgE, CsgF, and CsgG, and is responsible for the assembly, translocation, and regulation of the curli protein.
CsgD is a positive transcriptional regulator of the csgBAC operon, but does not regulate its own expression. The csgBA operon encodes the major structural subunit of curli, CsgA, as well as the nucleator protein, CsgB. Further research still needs to be conducted in order to see what stimulates CsgD expression or activity, but some evidence suggests that its activation is caused by the phosphorylation of an aspartic acid residue of the N-terminal receiver domain. Since CsgD must be present for csgBA promoter activity, it is therefore suggested that regulators of CsgD expression also influence the expression of csgBA.
Many environmental cues play a role in curli gene expression. It has long been believed that bacterial growth at a temperature below 30 °C promotes curli gene expression. However, it is now known that curli expression is strain- and condition-specific. For example, mutations to the CsgD promoter can result in curli expression at 37 °C. Additionally, when there is a lack of salt and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphate or iron, curli gene expression is stimulated.
Functions
Amyloids have been linked to illnesses such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, lupus, among many others. The curli protein is considered a PAMP (Pathogen-associated molecular pattern); its β-sheet structure is recognized in the innate immune system and activates the TLR2 (Toll-Like Receptor 2). This then causes a downstream response by producing a pro-inflammatory response where pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are recruited to initiate the inflammation response.
Curli, however, has additional functions (thus being coined a "functional amyloid") including being a major component in the biofilm generated by gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella spp. These biofilms allow gram-negative bacteria to better colonize in a given environment, protecting them from oxidative stress and dehydration. These biofilms, however, call for much concern. Since these biofilms allow for the bacteria to survive chemical and physical stressors within their environment, not only do they make patients more susceptible to infection when using shared appliances, but curli and other biofilms have been shown to reduce the infected individuals' immune response and antimicrobials. Curli proteins and biofilms alike are very resistant to chemical stressors to a point where stronger pretreatment is required in order for curli to degrade or dissolve in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS).
Curli fibers that are created are involved in many different types and functions in the cell such as for cell aggregation, act as adhesive for different proteins to the cell's surface, used in biofilm formation of certain bacteria and contain chemicals for quorum sensing, as well as plays an important role in inflammatory response in individuals. Curli formation must also be heavily regulated as its accumulation leads to amyloid like protein aggregations in the organism which leads to destruction of pathway and interferes with cell signaling.
Structure
The curli protein's main components (subunits) consist of the CsgA and CsgB protein.
CsgA
CsgA is the major subunit of the curli protein and weighs approximately 13.1 kiloDalton. This protein consists of three domains which have a tendency to aggregate and form amyloid fibrils: a single peptide, a 22-amino acid N-terminal sequence (used for secretion), and an amyloid core domain at the C-terminal sequence. The amyloid core domain is composed of 5 repeating (yet not exact) sequences revolving around the sequence: Ser-X5-Gln-X-Gly-X-Gly-Asn-X-Ala-X3-Gln. This repeating sequence is the characteristic subunit that forms its aggregatable β-sheet.
CsgB
CsgB, also known as the minor subunit, is required for the nucleation and organization of CsgA into a curli fiber on cell surfaces. CsgB has a very similar repeating sequence to that of CsgA with the exception that one of the 5 repeating sequences contains additional amino acids: Lys133, Arg140, Arg14, and Arg151. This change in the final subunit (known as the R5 subunit) is required. Without the presence of the R5 subunit, or the changes within the subunit, CsgA is secreted from the cell in an unpolymerized form and cannot properly form on cell surfaces.
CsgC
The CsgC subunit was only recently discovered to prevent the aggregation and polymerization of the CsgA protein. Without it, there is a chance for amyloid fibril formation and even cell death. Multiple experiments isolating CsgC away from the CsgA and CsgB subunit caused CsgA to aggregate into fibrils, which may possibly lead to downstream effects as seen in illnesses such as Alzheimer's. The molar ratio required for CsgC to inhibit CsgA is 1:500, meaning only 1 CsgC protein is required to inhibit 500 CsgA proteins from forming amyloid fibril structures. It is hypothesized that CsgC is therefore considered a chaperone since it prevents further CsgA nucleation and allows CsgA to form into its proper structure instead of aggregating.

Sven Hannawald (; born 9 November 1974) is a German former ski jumper. They competed from 1992 to 2004, with their career best achievement being the winner of the 2002 Four Hills Tournament and becoming the first athlete in history to win all four events in the same tournament. They also finished runner-up twice in the World Cup season, winning four medals at the Ski Jumping World Championships, as well as three medals each at the Winter Olympics and Ski Flying World Championships.
Early life
Hannawald was born in Erlabrunn and grew up in the nearby town of Johanngeorgenstadt by SC Dynamo Johanngeorgenstadt in the Ore Mountains. At age twelve, they were sent to a special school for young athletes in Klingenthal (SG Dynamo Klingenthal), also in Saxony. In 1991 their family moved to Jettingen-Scheppach near Ulm where they transferred to the Furtwangen Ski Boarding School, where they completed an apprenticeship in Communication Electronics.
Ski jumping career
In 1998, Hannawald won a silver medal at the 1998 Ski Flying World Championships in Oberstdorf as well as a silver medal at the Olympic Games in Nagano in the team large hill event.
In the 1998/99 season, they finished fifth place overall in World Cup Ski Jumping. At the world championships in Ramsau, they won a silver medal in the individual large hill behind Martin Schmitt, as well as winning a gold medal in the team large hill event.
In 2000, Hannawald won the Ski-flying World Championships in Vikersund. They also won the ski jumping competition at the Holmenkollen ski festival that year.
In the 2000/01 season, Hannawald won gold in the team large hill event and bronze in the team normal hill event at the world championships in Lahti.
The following winter of 2001/02 was the most successful of their career: Hannawald ended second in the World Cup, winning all four Individual jumping titles at the Four Hills Tournament, the first to do so. They successfully defended their title of Ski Flying World Champion. At the Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, they won gold in the team large hill and silver in the individual normal hill, and was even nominated for Sportsman of the Year in Germany. Despite all of their successes, however, Hannawald could not top Adam Malysz in the overall World Cup ranking.
In the 2002/03 season, they finished again second in the world rankings and managed to set another highlight of their career: at the Worldcup competition in Willingen, Germany , they became the third person in history to achieve perfect marks from all five judges (20 points maximum) – 27 years after the first one (Anton Innauer) and five years after the second one (Kazuyoshi Funaki). This mark has been matched only about one hour later at the same World Cup competition by Hideharu Miyahira, who finished sixth. Then it took another six years until Wolfgang Loitzl at Bischofshofen, Austria in 2009 during the 2008/09 Four Hills Tournament became the fifth one.
In the 2003/04 season, Hannawald performed well below personal expectations. Their best result was fourth in Trondheim. As a consequence of that, Hannawald ended their season prematurely. On 29 April 2004, they revealed that they were suffering from burnout and had put themselves into psychiatric treatment. During this time, Hannawald managed to recover and reappeared to the public.
On 3 August 2005, they ended their career as a ski jumper, explaining through their managers that, after successfully dealing with their burnout, they no longer wished to suffer the stresses of professional sport.
Post-retirement
On 26 September 2008, Hannawald signed a two-year contract with the football club TSV Burgau of the German Kreisliga, where they played as a striker.
In 2010, Hannawald gave their debut as a Touring Car racing driver in the ADAC GT Masters. They drove their first race on 10 April 2010 in Oschersleben.

Thevenard Island is located approximately off the coast of Onslow in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.
Description
Thevenard Island is the largest of a group of ten islands and atolls unofficially called the Mackerel Islands. Two islands in the group, Thevenard Island and Direction Island, have accommodation for tourists. There is a brick paved runway on Thevenard. The island can be reached by a ferry service operating from the mainland at Onslow, recreational boats, helicopter and light scenic plane.
Thevenard Island is approximately in length and occupies a total area of . It is surrounded by limestone reefs and platforms, with diverse coral assemblages on the northern side. Areas of deep sandy soil are found on the island supporting Acacia and Triodia shrubland and coastal heath scrub.
Tourism facilities exist in a resort on Thevenard Island including accommodation, a general store, barbeques, boat moorings, airstrip and fuel facilities. There is also a solar power and desalination plant providing fresh water to the island. Available activities include fishing, diving and snorkelling.
Fauna
Classified as a C class nature reserve, Thevenard Island is visited by green sea turtles, flatback sea turtles, loggerhead sea turtles and hawksbill sea turtles who lay their eggs on the beaches between November to March.
The waters off-shore are also home to several species of dolphins including bottlenose, spinner, striped, common and humpback dolphins.
Whales that have been observed in the area include the pilot whale, false killer whale, sei whale, bryde's whale and humpback whales. Humpbacks migrate south from June to October, with calving taking place in August.
Dugongs (sea cows) are also found in waters around the island and can be observed feeding and calving in waters less than deep. Dugong breeding occurs between September and April.
Twenty-four species of land birds have been recorded on Thevenard Island. In addition, there are up to 31 species of migratory birds occurring in the Mackerel Islands area, including kestrels, quails, godwits, plovers, sandpipers and harriers. Some birds migrate from remote northern hemisphere locations as far as Siberia, and are protected by international treaties. Seabirds, such as terns and shearwaters, nest from October to January.
A total of nine reptile species have been recorded on the island including goannas, dragons, skinks, geckos and ta-ta lizards. No rare or endangered reptiles have been recorded.
The only native land mammal on the island is the endangered forrest's mouse or short-tailed mouse. The domestic mouse also inhabits the island and is most likely to have been introduced.
History
The island was visited by indigenous Australians before and after its separation from the mainland, approximately 8,000 years ago.
In 1964, Onslow local residents Ian Blair and Adrian Day were granted a lease on Thevenard Island and Direction Island by the Government of Western Australia. In 1973, a group of local farmers purchased the business. From there, the accommodation and facilities on the islands developed from beach shacks used by fishermen to a fully fledged tourism operation. The same group of farmers developed the Onslow Mackerel Motel on the mainland in 1997.
WAPET (WA Petroleum) discovered the Saladin oil field just off Thevenard Island in 1985, followed by further discoveries including a series of gas fields, leading to the North West Shelf Project on the Burrup Peninsula, the Gorgon project on Barrow Island and the Wheatstone Project on the mainland in Onslow. The company was granted a lease to build production facilities on Thevenard Island; the first oil was produced from the project in 1989. Other fields were brought online between 1991 and 1998 using facilities both off-shore and on Thevenard itself. In 2000, Chevron Australia became operator of the oil and gas exploration and production assets previously managed by WAPET. Production from off-shore oil fields including Saladin ceased in 2014. The new owners, Chevron Corporation, tried to sell the facilities on Thevenard without success. The decision was made in 2015 to decommission the site, with the removal of all plant, road and footing expected to take two years. The operators of the remaining land lease and tourism business on Thevenard and Direction Islands, Mackerel Islands Pty Ltd, state as of 2017 ″The Mackerel Islands and WA Petroleum have maintained a harmonious and collaborative association throughout the past 30 years of operation. Currently decommissioning of the projects is under way, where some of the infrastructure still stands on Thevenard Island. In the coming years this will be removed, leaving Mackerel Islands to devote sole use of Thevenard Nature Reserve to developing eco-tourism facilities and activities.″
The MV Boa Force was shipwrecked off the island when the anchor handling tug supply vessel struck a wellhead in 1994. All eleven crew were rescued; Boa Force was later raised and subsequently scuttled in deep water.
Turtle monitoring project
The Government of Western Australia's Department of Parks and Wildlife (now the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions) conducted a pilot flatback turtle monitoring project on Thevenard Island in 2016, which continues annually, having identified Thevenard Island as an important turtle nesting site. The pilot project was part of the North West Shelf Flatback Turtle Conservation Program's monitoring program, which was established to help understand the ecology and demography of the
North West Shelf flatback stock, which includes populations found off the Pilbara and south-west Kimberley coasts.
Flatbacks are listed as vulnerable under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. Internationally they are considered data deficient, meaning that more research is required to determine their abundance and distribution.
The North West Shelf Flatback Conservation Program is a $32.5 million, 30-year program funded by the Chevron-operated Gorgon gas project and is administered by Parks and Wildlife.
