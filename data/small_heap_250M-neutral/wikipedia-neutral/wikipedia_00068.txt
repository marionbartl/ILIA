The 1904 VFL season was the eighth season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs, ran from 7 May until 17 September, and comprised a 17-game home-and-away season followed by a finals series featuring the top four clubs.
The premiership was won by the Fitzroy Football Club for the third time, after it defeated by 24 points in the 1904 VFL Grand Final.
Premiership season
In 1904, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no "reserves", although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.
Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds. Then, based on ladder positions after those 14 rounds, three further 'sectional rounds' were played, with the teams ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th playing in one section and the teams ranked 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th playing in the other.
Once the 17 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1904 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended "Argus system".

Grand final
Fitzroy defeated Carlton 9.7 (61) to 5.7 (37). (For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football).
Awards
The 1904 VFL Premiership team was Fitzroy.
The VFL's leading goalkicker was Vince Coutie of Melbourne with 39 goals.
St Kilda took the "wooden spoon" in 1904.
Notable events
The final home-and-away match between South Melbourne and Fitzroy at the Lake Oval was a torrid affair. Billy McGee of South Melbourne and Harry Clarke of Fitzroy were each suspended for three matches, while South Melbourne's Billy Gent ran amok during the match, charging at players and was reported on three striking charges; Gent was suspended for the remainder of 1904 and all of 1905 (20 matches).
After the drawn match between Geelong and Carlton at Corio Oval on 9 July 1904, a spectator is arrested for attacking the field umpire, Henry "Ivo" Crapp.
The VFL introduces boundary umpires.
In round four, Essendon plays Melbourne in Sydney in front of only 6,000 spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground, loses to Melbourne, takes five days to return to Melbourne by sea, then loses again to Fitzroy in their Saturday's round five match.
In the Final Premiership match Carlton was surging ahead of Fitzroy, and one of the Carlton forwards (Ross, 1996, does not name him, but it was most likely Mick Grace) took a powerful high overhead mark with their knees in their opponent's back. The field umpire, Henry "Ivo" Crapp, obeying the VFL rules of the day, paid a free kick to the Fitzroy player for "interference". Fitzroy steadied and went on to win the game. There was such an outcry after the match that the VFL immediately amended its rules to allow for what it now termed "unintentional interference".

Blackmailers Rekord Orkestr is a Russian rhythm and blues band from Vladimir.
History
The band was created in 1997 by Aleksey Baryshev, a well-known Russian guitar player. At first it was a classical “guitar hero” blues band with an undiluted blues-rock repertoire. However, little by little its creative vision gravitated towards blues formats of Californian persuasion with discernible influences by T-Bone Walker and Tiny Grimes.
At that time, the Blackmailers took part in all major Russian blues festivals and toured the country extensively, but the real breakthrough in the band's life happened in 2004. Under the impression of the Gypsy Cycle of the famous movie director Emir Kusturica, the Blackmailers attempted to mix the blues with South Slavic folk music. It was then that they discovered for themselves Balkan wedding-and-funeral bands, such as Fanfare Ciocărlia, Kočani Orkestar, and Mahala Rai Banda, which later reshaped the Blackmailers' music and concert performances.
In 2005 they released their debut album, Zlatno Zrno Blues. The title was an allusion to the flour mill from Kusturica's Black Cat, White Cat. The record made it to the 2005 Russian Blues Bestsellers Top Ten compiled by the BluesNews network magazine. The band was noticed by the mass media. They played together with the world's top bluesmen, such as Junior Watson, Gary Primich, Vidar Busk, Rick Holmstrom, Mitch Kashmar, and Alex Schultz.
The band's second album, Paradise Fanfare Blues, was released in 2007. Its major influences included Nina Simone, T-Bone Walker, Jimmy Witherspoon, and Johnny Cash on the one hand, and Balkan wedding-and-funeral bands on the other hand. The musicians say that their style is evolving slowly and naturally, and that their new album, another attempt at fusing the blues tradition with the Balkan ethnic music, has turned out to be even more organic and powerful.

The Shaver Transportation Company is an inland water freight transportation company based in Portland, Oregon, United States. The company was founded in 1880 and played a major role in the development of freight transport in the Portland area and along the Columbia.
Early history and founders
In the 1860s and 1870s, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company (OSN) had obtained monopoly power over riverboat navigation on the Columbia River system. This was before the extensive construction of railroads in Oregon and what was then the Washington Territory, so the only way that goods could be shipped to market was by way of the rivers. Many companies arose to compete with the OSN, and one of the few survivors was the Shaver Transportation Company. Founders of the company included steamboat captains James W. Shaver and George M. Shaver.
Shaver Transportation was begun by James W. Shaver, whose family were pioneers in Portland, Oregon. They owned a woodyard business which supplied firewood for trains, powered then by steam locomotives. They also supplied wood from a dock for steamboats. In 1880, James W. Shaver went into the steamboat business with two partners, Henry W. Corbett and A.S. Foster, both prominent members of the early business establishment in Portland, Oregon. They bought out Captain Edward Bureau and began doing business as the People's Freighting Company. Their first vessel was the steamboat Manzanillo, which they put on the route down the Willamette and Columbia rivers from Portland to Clatskanie, Oregon.
Insignia
Shaver Transportation Company was known as the "Red Collar Line."
Early steamboat operations
The next two steamboats owned by the company after the Manzanillo were the Sarah Dixon (named after the mother of company founder James W. Shaver) and G.W. Shaver, named after George Washington Shaver, the father of James W. Shaver. The Sarah Dixon had a reputation as a luxury boat, and in the early 1890s, they were placed on the profitable run on the lower Columbia River from Portland to Astoria, Oregon. On that run they competed with the T. J. Potter, another luxury boat owned by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (ORNC). This competition was resolved in about 1896, when Shaver Transportation took its boats off the Portland/Astoria run in return for a monthly subsidy from ORNC.
In 1897, Shaver Transportation bought their fourth boat, the No Wonder, which had been built in 1877 by another founder of Portland, by George Washington Weidler, for log-towing purposes, and named the Wonder. (Weidler rebuilt Wonder in 1889 and named them No Wonder, hence their name.) Shaver Transportation used No Wonder for log-towing and as a training school for pilots until 1933, when No Wonder was dismantled. 56 years of use was an exceptional length of time for a wooden-hulled boat.
In 1908, the company built the sternwheelers Shaver and a new Dixon as replacements for the old G.W. Shaver and Sarah Dixon. Typical for steamboats built in those days, the Shaver included previously-used mechanical components from other steamboats. In the Shaver'''s case, these included steam valves that had served in at least two prior steamboats going back to 1857. Once built, Shaver was used as a tow and work boat.
Another long-lived Shaver boat was the Henderson, which was launched in 1901, sunk and rebuilt in 1912, rebuilt and re-engined in 1929, and sunk and raised again in 1950.Details of Henderson's 1950 sinking are provided in Marshall, Don: Oregon Shipwrecks, page 206, Binford & Mort, Portland, OR 1984 . Henderson was used in important towing work such as when for example, in the 1940s they were dispatched with four other towing vessels to pull the Standard Oil tanker "F.S. Follis" off from where the tanker had grounded near the mouth of the Willamette River. The end only came for the wooden-hulled Henderson in 1956 near Astoria, when they were damaged beyond their economic value in a collision with them tow.
Design innovations
Shaver steamboats were all sternwheelers, which gave advantages on the Columbia River. They did not require fixed docks for landings, and they were more powerful and easier to steer than sidewheelers. Traditionally, most steamboats on the Columbia River system were sternwheelers. Shaver Transportation broke away from this pattern in 1926 when Shaver was rebuilt as a twin-screw diesel boat. Shaver served in this configuration for about twenty years. One notable tow job was of the when that vessel was taken on tour to the West Coast, including Portland, in 1934.
Another important tow job engaged in by Shaver and four other vessels was pulling the Standard Oil Tanker F.S. Follis off where the tanker had grounded near the mouth of the Willamette River. The plans for the rebuilt Shaver were later used by the Marietta Iron Works (in Marietta, Ohio) to build a vessel which became the pattern for later towboats on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.
Reflection of influence in Portland street names
Many streets in Portland were named after steamboats, steamboat captains or company owners. One example is Hassalo street, named after a famous sternwheeler. Another is Corbett, named after one of the first partners in the Shaver Transportation Company.
Shaver itself is another example, it is named for George Washington Shaver. Both Shaver and Hassalo streets are located near the east side neighborhood of Portland known as Irvington, which in turn was named after steamboat captain William Irving, who as it turns out was married to Elizabeth Dixon, the sister of Sarah Dixon and wife of G.W. Shaver.
Role in film productionHenderson played the part of River Queen in the film Bend of the River in 1952, which was filmed in Oregon and on the Columbia River, and starred James Stewart. To promote this film, Henderson re-enacted a steamboat race on January 24, 1952, with one of the few remaining steamers left on the Columbia River, the steel-hulled sternwheeler Portland'', built in 1947.

La Dame Blanche (French; ) was the codename for an underground intelligence network which operated in German-occupied Belgium during World War I. It took its name from a German legend which stated that the fall of the Hohenzollern dynasty would be announced by the appearance of a woman wearing white.
The network provided information on German troop movements by watching the railway system.
The Dame Blanche network was founded in 1916 by , an engineer working in a telegraph and telephone company in Brussels. The decision resulted from the arrest and execution of Dewé's cousin, , who had themselves founded an intelligence network codenamed "Lambrecht". In order to save the group, Dewé took control and developed it under the name Dame Blanche with their friend Herman Chauvin.
The network was at first affiliated to the British military intelligence service of Cecil Aylmer Cameron via Folkstone. After constant infiltration by agents working for Colonel Walter Nicolai and Abteilung III b, the German counterintelligence service, La Dame Blanche transferred its allegiance to the British Secret Service (later known as MI6) station in Rotterdam, where their new handler was Captain Henry Landau. After the end of the war, Mansfield Smith-Cumming, head of the Secret Service, estimated that Dame Blanche had supplied as much as 70 percent of all military intelligence collected by Allied intelligence services world-wide, not merely that from German-occupied Belgium and northern France.
By the end of the war, its 1,300 agents covered all of occupied Belgium, northern France and – through a collaboration with Louise de Bettignies' network – occupied Luxembourg. The network was known for its high proportion of female members; women may have made up as much as 30 percent of its total personnel.
During the second German occupation of Belgium in World War II, Dewé used the experience of the Dame Blanche network to start a new network, codenamed Clarence. They were shot and killed while trying to avoid capture by the Germans in 1944.
A monument to the Dame Blanche resistance organization has been built near the city of Liège. It is the Chapelle Saint-Maurice (mémorial Walthère Dewé), Rue Coupée 94, Liège, Belgium.

Finn is a German Shepherd and retired police dog of the Hertfordshire Constabulary in England. In October 2016, Finn and their handler confronted a youth who was suspected of being armed; the dog was stabbed and the police officer injured to the hand with a large knife. The dog required emergency surgery, but they returned to duty eleven weeks later. The case received widespread media coverage and initiated a popular campaign to improve legal protection for animals in public service, resulting in a 2019 act of parliament known as "Finn's Law", which went into effect as law in England and Wales in June 2019. It was later proposed for incorporation into law in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The incident
On 5 October 2016, Finn's handler, PC Dave Wardell, operating with the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Police Dog Unit, was called to an incident in Stevenage where there was a search for a male suspect, believed to be armed. PC Wardell and Finn located the suspect who ran off. After a shouted warning, PC Wardell released Finn and the dog seized the youth's leg as they were attempting to escape over a fence. Falling on the ground together, the suspect stabbed the dog in the chest with a large knife, before making a second attack in which they slashed the dog's head and PC Wardell's hand. Despite this, Finn retained their grip on the suspect, enabling PC Wardell to disarm the youth. When other officers arrived, Finn was taken to a veterinary surgeon and then on to a specialist where they received emergency surgery in which part of their lung was removed. PC Wardell later received medical treatment for a hand injury. Fortunately for PC Wardell this was a superficial injury with no long lasting effects on their hand.
Finn recovered from the attack and returned to duty eleven weeks later, before retiring due to age, shortly before their eighth birthday in March 2017. In May 2017 at Stevenage Youth Court, a 16 year-old boy from Lewisham in south London was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for the attack on PC Wardell, but could only be convicted of criminal damage for stabbing the dog. Their conviction for Criminal Damage (over £5,000) actually gave higher sentencing guidelines for the courts when passing sentence to the defendant. They were later sentenced to eight months' detention in a Young Offender Institution.
"Finn's Law"
Finn's case highlighted the limited legal sanctions available against those who injure animals being used by the emergency services. An online petition on the UK Parliament petitions website for a "Finn's Law" attracted more than 127,000 signatures, resulting in the Sentencing Council recommending that in future, similar events should be treated as an "aggravated offence" rather than criminal damage. However, Finn For Change Member of Parliament, Sir Oliver Heald, with Dave Wardell and Finn as mascots took the matter further by proposing a private member's bill, the Animal Welfare (Service Animals) Bill, which was debated in the House of Commons on 5 December 2017. The bill, which was introduced to the House of Commons on 13 June 2018, provided:
The bill completed all the parliamentary stages and received Royal Assent on 8 April 2019 as the Animal Welfare (Service Animals) Act 2019. and came into force in England and Wales in June 2019.
In September 2019, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, announced that a new Animal Welfare Bill, incorporating "Finn's Law", would be part of the new programme of legislation to be introduced into the Scottish Parliament. On 10 February 2020, a motion was put forward through the Northern Ireland Assembly to incorporate "Finn's Law" to Northern Ireland under its own animal welfare laws. The motion was passed unanimously, and was passed to the Northern Irish Agricultural minister Edwin Poots.
Recognition
In October 2017, Finn was awarded the International Fund for Animal Welfare "Animal of the Year Award" in a ceremony at the House of Lords. In May 2018, Finn was awarded the PDSA Gold Medal "for life-saving devotion to duty, despite being grievously injured while preventing a violent criminal from evading arrest", at the charity's music festival at Cheltenham Racecourse, which was the first time the award had been presented at a public ceremony. In March 2019, Finn was awarded the Kennel Club's "Friends for Life" prize at the annual Crufts dog show at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham.
In the spring of 2019, Dave Wardell and Finn participated in the television talent show, Britain's Got Talent, with a mind-reading act which took them to the final and prompted an emotional response from the judges.
Sadly, no one from the investigation team has ever been acknowledged for the complex investigation that was conducted.
Thin Blue Paw Foundation
In May 2020 Finn was named as an Ambassador for the charity the Thin Blue Paw Foundation, an organisation to help support retired police dogs once they have left their role as working police dogs. This is primarily aimed at the other 35 territorial and specialist constabularies, that don't have their own retired police dog charities like in Finn's home constabulary of Hertfordshire.

2017 in film is an overview of events, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies, festivals, a list of films released, and notable deaths in 2017.
Evaluation of the year
Richard Brody of The New Yorker observed that for 2017, "the most important event in the world of movies was the revelation, in The New York Times and The New Yorker, of sexual abuse by Harvey Weinstein, and the resulting liberation of the long-stifled voices of the people who had been abused by them or other powerful figures in the movie business, and, for that matter, in other arts and industries, too." They emphasize that in effect, "[w]hat's missing from the year-end list, and from the era in movies, isn't only the unmade work by these filmmakers but the artistry and the careers of cast and crew members who would have been in their unrealized films."
Highest-grossing films
The top films released in 2017 by worldwide gross are as follows:
Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, The Fate of the Furious, and Despicable Me 3 have each grossed over $1 billion, making them among the highest-grossing films of all time, with the latter being the fourth-highest-grossing animated film.
Wolf Warrior 2, a Chinese film, became the first non-Hollywood film to be listed on the all-time worldwide top 100 box office.
Split, by M. Night Shyamalan, was the year's most profitable film in terms of return on investment (ROI), having generated over 2,000% ROI. It is the 11th film to cross 2,000% ROI, and the first film to do so since 2015.

The Saint Ignatius Jesuit College of Excellence (in Hungarian: Szent Ignác Jezsuita Szakkollégium (SZIK)) in Budapest, Hungary, in the VIII. district is a college of excellence established in 1990. It is run by the Jesuits. It has 60 members of which 15-20 are exchanged every year due to graduation and admission. The important values of SZIK are professionality, spirituality, community and self-government.
History of SZIK
In September 1990, some enthusiastic college students formed the first community, which became the founding team of the future college. The institution did not have a building at that time, in order to acquire one, a property of the disbanded Kispest Workers' Militia was tendered and won.
In search for a long-term maintainer, the choice fell on the St. Martin's Foundation, which was committed to promoting the education of the youth and later took on the role of maintainer. However, as the young people also wanted to provide spiritual care, the Jesuit order was later asked to do so.
The order appointed Szabolcs Sajgó SJ, the editor of the spirituality magazine Heart (Szív), as the first pastor of the dormitory, and they held the position of director for three years. After a two-year break, a Jesuit called László Vértesaljai SJ became the director again, followed by Kiss Ulrich SJ, the relationship between the college and the order deepened: On August 20 1998, János Ádám SJ Provincial Superior decided, that the Society of Jesus assumes responsibility for the College. With the appointment of the Jesuit rector Kiss Ulrich in 2005, another decision was made to add the adjective “Jesuit” to the name of the college. In the autumn of 2011, the College moved to Horánszky Street under the direction of Rector Dr. Péter Smuk. Between 2012 and 2017, Dr. Botond Feledy served as Rector. From September 2017, the head of the college is Balázs Sárvári.

Máire Rita Whelan (born 24 November 1956) is an Irish judge who has served as a Judge of the Court of Appeal since June 2017. They previously served as Attorney General of Ireland from 2011 to 2017. They were the first woman to hold the office of Attorney General.
Personal life
Whelan is from Kinvara, County Galway.  They are married to barrister Bernard McCabe. They live in Dublin.
Early career
Whelan studied politics and sociology at University College Galway, before switching to law, and gained a master's degree from the University of London. They were called to the bar in 1985, and was appointed as senior counsel in 2005.  They are a co-author of National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) Act 2009: A Reference Guide. They have served as financial secretary of the Labour Party, which was the junior member of the 2011 coalition government formed with Fine Gael. Them appointment as Attorney General of Ireland caused some surprise amongst lawyers because they had a relatively low profile, owing to practising in areas of law where many cases are heard in camera.
Nomination to Court of Appeal
On 13 June 2017, it was reported that the Government of Ireland had decided to nominate them for appointment by the President of Ireland, as a Judge of the Court of Appeal. The nomination gave rise to controversy because of the procedure followed. In particular, it was widely reported that the nomination had been made in the absence of an application by Whelan for the position of Judge of the Court of Appeal and in circumstances where other applicants had applied for the post (making their intentions known to Whelan as Attorney General) but were not considered by the cabinet. The decision to appoint Whelan as a judge was taken at a cabinet meeting but Whelan did not leave the room when their nomination was discussed. One of the most serious allegations was that it was also reported that the vacancy on the Court of Appeal had been effectively left open or "frozen" for Whelan as several High Court judges had applied for the position and the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board reported that it was not in a position to recommend any candidate for the vacancy. It was reported that the cabinet would further discuss the nomination as a result of the controversy. Them nomination was criticised by Micheál Martin, Leader of the Opposition, and by Jim O'Callaghan, Opposition Spokesperson for Justice and Equality.
The decision to nominate Whelan to the Court of Appeal was taken at the last cabinet meeting presided by Enda Kenny as Taoiseach, and it was widely viewed as a farewell gift by a Taoiseach to a trusted Attorney General. Although the decision was taken under Kenny, it was left to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to defend and implement it, causing the first controversy of their term of office as Taoiseach.
Notwithstanding the controversy, Whelan did not withdraw their name for consideration and was rapidly appointed a Judge of the Court of Appeal by the President of Ireland on 19 June 2017. They made the formal declaration as a Judge of the Court of Appeal on 21 June 2017. After their appointment and declaration, when they were already a sitting judge, their ability was the subject of exchanges between Micheál Martin and Leo Varadkar in Dáil Éireann leading to fears over the stability of the government. These exchanges led to what was seen as a public rebuke of the Taoiseach and Martin by the then Chief Justice of Ireland, Susan Denham, defending the independence of the judiciary.

The Mystic Mini-Ton, also called the Mystic Mini-Ton 21, is an American trailerable sailboat that was designed by Canadian Bruce Kirby as an International Offshore Rule Mini Ton class, Midget Ocean Racing Club (MORC) and club one design racer and first built in 1977.
Production
The design was built by Boat Company of Mystic in Mystic, Connecticut, United States, starting in 1977. Only 12 boats were completed and it is now out of production.
Design
The Mystic Mini-Ton is a racing keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a fractional sloop rig, a raked stem, a reverse transom, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast.
The boat has a draft of with the standard keel.
The boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor for docking and maneuvering.
The design has sleeping accommodation for four people. Cabin headroom is .
The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 219 and a hull speed of .
Operational history
The boat is supported by an active class club that organizes racing events, the Mini Ton Class.
In a 2010 review Steve Henkel described the design as, "sleek-looking" and noted that boat "had some racing successes in Long Island Sound in their first year, but for some reason not many units were sold, perhaps because the marketers appeared not to push the boat's possibilities as a pocket cruiser. In fact, neither their ads nor their brochure shows their layout below ... But personally, we think she's very good-looking, and knowing that other Kirby designs are almost always good sailors' boats, we have a warm feeling about this one. Too bad they never really caught on."

East Norfolk was a constituency in the county of Norfolk that returned two Members of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom until 1868. A namesake was created in 1885 with representation of one member. That seat was abolished in 1950.
History
The constituency was first created by the Great Reform Act for the 1832 general election, and abolished for the 1868 general election. In that period the Parliamentary County of Norfolk was split into two divisions – Eastern Norfolk and Western Norfolk, each returning two members.
Further to the Reform Act of 1867, Norfolk was reorganised into the North, South and West divisions, with each of the three divisions again returning two members. The Eastern division was replaced by the bulk of the North and South Divisions.
Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the three two-member county divisions were replaced with six single-member divisions. The second version of this constituency was one of the single-member seats. It was abolished under the Representation of the People Act 1948, which came into effect for the 1950 general election.
Boundaries and boundary changes
1832–1868: The Hundreds of Blofield, Clavering, Depwade, Diss, Earsham, North Erpingham, South Erpingham, Eynesford, East Flegg, West Flegg, Forehoe, Happing, Henstead, Humbleyard, Loddon, Taversham, Tunstead and Walsham.
1885–1918: The Sessional Divisions of Blofield and Walsham, East and West Flegg, Taversham and Tunstead, and Happing, the part of the Borough of Great Yarmouth in the county of Norfolk, and part of the Sessional Division of South Erpingham.
As Great Yarmouth formed a separate Parliamentary Borough, only non-resident freeholders of the Borough were entitled to vote in this constituency.
1918–1950: The Urban District of North Walsham, and the Rural Districts of Blofield, East and West Flegg, Loddon and Clavering, St Faith's, and Smallburgh.
The division was expanded to the south, with the addition of eastern parts of the Southern Division of Norfolk (Loddon and Clavering Rural District). Also gained small area to the west from the Northern Division.
On its abolition, the contents of the seat were distributed as follows: North Walsham and the Rural District of Smallburgh to North Norfolk; area to the north and east of Norwich, mostly comprising the (former) Rural District of St Faiths, to the new County Constituency of Central Norfolk; most of the (combined) Rural District of Blofield and Flegg to the new County Constituency of Yarmouth; and the Rural District of Loddon and Clavering (renamed Loddon) back to South Norfolk.

Wing Commander: Armada is a computer game set in the universe of Chris Roberts' Wing Commander franchise. Created by Origin Systems and distributed by Electronic Arts in 1994, Armada was the first official game of the Wing Commander series to feature multiplayer mode. This game was released shortly before Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger and features a new graphics engine, capable of rendering fully 3D ship models, which is more powerful than the sprite-based engine used in Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi.
Gameplay
Armada features single-player and multiplayer modes. In single player, the player fights the computer-controlled opponents in a number of different game types, whereas multiplayer mode allows two players to play the various game modes head-to-head or cooperatively.
Game modes
Battle
Available only in multiplayer mode, this game type consists of a head-to-head dogfight between two players. Each player chooses one of the fighters available from those of the Confed and Kilrathi inventory, then the fights begin. The player who destroys the opponent is the winner.
Gauntlet
This game type is very much like the "Gauntlet" feature from Wing Commander: Academy and is available both in single-player and multiplayer. Two players cooperatively fight computer-controlled ships. The player or players side with either the Terran Confederation or the Kilrathi Empire, then play through 15 levels, each consisting of three separate waves of enemy fighters; as the "Gauntlet" progresses, the enemy ships' strength, number and skill increase. The game ends when the player(s) beat the last wave, or a player's ship is destroyed (in multiplayer the game ends if either player is destroyed). Unlike Academy, where the player could choose which fighter to fly in the "Gauntlet", in Armada the player starts flying either the Arrow or the Dralthi light fighter, then moves to medium and heavy fighters as the game progresses.
One feature was not present in the retail version of Armada but could be enabled by installing a patch released by Origin on their website. The new feature provided each level with a code, enabling the player to restart the "Gauntlet" from the level corresponding to the code, without the requirement to play through all the previous waves.
Armada
This is the main game type featured in Armada, available both in single-player (player vs. computer) and multiplayer (player vs. player). Armada is a strategy driven game type taking place in a randomly generated sector of space which is depicted in the game's main screen: dots indicate star systems connected through one or more line representing the available space lanes for starships. The players choose a side (Confederation or Kilrathi) to play with and begin with their forces placed on the opposite sides of the sector.
Since both sides start with a carrier and a complement of two light fighters, players can build mines on the planets they visit to gather resources with which to build shipyards for more fighters or fortresses to defend specific planets. Action takes place in turns. During their turns, players can move their ships or build mines/shipyards/fortresses, while the other player waits. The game ends when one player is able to locate the opponent's carrier and attack it with heavy fighters: if the assault is successful a cinematic of the carrier blowing up is displayed and the game ends.
Campaign
The "Campaign" mode is very much like the "Armada" game type and consists of 11 scenarios played following the same rules as "Armada". To progress to the next level, one of the two sides must be defeated by destroying its carrier. At the end of the last level, depending on the points gathered during all the matches, one side is the overall winner and a cinematic of either Earth or Kilrah blowing up is shown. The "Campaign" can be played both in single-player and multiplayer.
Reception
Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that "if you've been looking to play - with or against a friend - a title worth owning, wait for Wing Commander 3".

Urban runoff is surface runoff of rainwater, landscape irrigation, and car washing created by urbanization. Impervious surfaces (roads, parking lots and sidewalks) are constructed during land development. During rain , storms and other precipitation events, these surfaces (built from materials such as asphalt and concrete), along with rooftops, carry polluted stormwater to storm drains, instead of allowing the water to percolate through soil. This causes lowering of the water table (because groundwater recharge is lessened) and flooding since the amount of water that remains on the surface is greater. Most municipal storm sewer systems discharge stormwater, untreated, to streams, rivers and bays. This excess water can also make its way into people's properties through basement backups and seepage through building wall and floors.
Urban runoff can be a major source of urban flooding and water pollution in urban communities worldwide.
Pollutants
Water running off impervious surfaces in urban areas tends to pick up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, trash and other pollutants from roadways and parking lots, as well as fertilizers and pesticides from lawns. Roads and parking lots are major sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are created as the byproducts of the combustion of gasoline and other fossil fuels, as well as of the heavy metals nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, and lead. Roof runoff contributes high levels of synthetic organic compounds and zinc (from galvanized gutters). Fertilizer use on residential lawns, parks and golf courses is a measurable source of nitrates and phosphorus in urban runoff when fertilizer is improperly applied or when turf is over-fertilized.
Eroding soils or poorly maintained construction sites can often lead to increased sedimentation in runoff. Sedimentation often settles to the bottom of water bodies and can directly affect water quality. Excessive levels of sediment in water bodies can increase the risk of infection and disease through high levels of nutrients present in the soil. These high levels of nutrients can reduce oxygen and boost algae growth while limiting native vegetation growth, which can disrupt aquatic ecosystem Excessive levels of sediment and suspended solids have the potential to damage existing infrastructure as well. Sedimentation can increase surface runoff by plugging underground injection systems. Increased sedimentation levels can also reduce storage behind reservoir. This reduction of reservoir capacities can lead to increased expenses for public land agencies while also impacting the quality of water recreational areas.
Runoff can also induce bioaccumulation and biomagnification of toxins in ocean life. Small amounts of heavy metals are carried by runoff into the oceans, which can accumulate within aquatic animals to cause metal poisoning. This heavy metal poisoning can also affect humans, since ingesting a poisoned animal increases the risk of heavy metal poisoning.
As stormwater is channeled into storm drains and surface waters, the natural sediment load discharged to receiving waters decreases, but the water flow and velocity increases. In fact, the impervious cover in a typical city creates five times the runoff of a typical woodland of the same size.
Effects
Dry weather discharges
Overwatering through irrigation by sprinkler may produce runoff reaching receiving waters during low flow conditions. Runoff carries accumulated pollutants to streams with unusually low dilution ratios causing higher pollutant concentrations than would be found during regional precipitation events.
Urban flooding
Urban runoff is a major cause of urban flooding, the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by rainfall overwhelming the capacity of drainage systems, such as storm sewers. Triggered by events such as flash flooding, storm surges, overbank flooding, or snow melts, urban flooding is characterized by its repetitive, costly and systemic impacts on communities, even when not within floodplains or near any body of water.
There are several ways in which stormwater enters properties: backup through sewer pipes, toilets and sinks into buildings; seepage through building walls and floors; the accumulation of water on the property and in public rights-of-way; and the overflow of water from water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Where properties are built with basements, urban flooding is the primary cause of basement flooding.
Water pollution
Urban runoff contributes to water quality problems. In 2009 the US National Research Council published a comprehensive report on the effects of urban stormwater and stated that it continues to be a major contamination source in many watersheds throughout the United States. The report explained that "...further declines in water quality remain likely if the land-use changes that typify more diffuse sources of pollution are not addressed... These include land-disturbing agricultural, silvicultural, urban, industrial, and construction activities from which hard-to-monitor pollutants emerge during wet-weather events. Pollution from these landscapes has been almost universally acknowledged as the most pressing challenge to the restoration of waterbodies and aquatic ecosystems nationwide."
The runoff also increases temperatures in streams, harming fish and other organisms. (A sudden burst of runoff from a rainstorm can cause a fish-killing shock of hot water.) Also, road salt used to melt snow on sidewalks and roadways can contaminate streams and groundwater aquifers.
One of the most pronounced effects of urban runoff is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called ephemeral streams). When an area around such a stream is urbanized, the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round streamflow that hurts the vegetation, wildlife and stream bed of the waterway. Containing little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, urban runoff rushes down the stream channel, ruining natural features such as meanders and sandbars, and creates severe erosion—increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely carving the stream bed upstream. As an example, on many Southern California beaches at the mouth of a waterway, urban runoff carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and other wastes, and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.
Because of fertilizer and organic waste that urban runoff often carries, eutrophication often occurs in waterways affected by this type of runoff. After heavy rains, organic matter in the waterway is relatively high compared with natural levels, spurring growth of algae blooms that soon consume most of the oxygen. Once the naturally occurring oxygen in the water is depleted, the algae blooms die, and their decomposition causes further eutrophication. These algae bloom mostly occur in areas with still water, such as stream pools and the pools behind dams, weirs, and some drop structures. Eutrophication usually comes with deadly consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms.
Excessive stream bank erosion may cause flooding and property damage. For many years governments have often responded to urban stream erosion problems by modifying the streams through construction of hardened embankments and similar control structures using concrete and masonry materials. Use of these hard materials destroys habitat for fish and other animals. Such a project may stabilize the immediate area where flood damage occurred, but often it simply shifts the problem to an upstream or downstream segment of the stream. See River engineering.
There are many different ways that polluted urban runoff could harm humans, such as by contaminating drinking water, disrupting food sources and even causing parts of beaches to be closed off due to a risk of illness. After heavy rainfall events that cause stormwater overflows, contaminated water can impact waterways in which people recreate or fish, causing the beaches or water-based activities to be closed. This is because the runoff has likely caused a spike in harmful bacterial growth or inorganic chemical pollution in the water. The contaminants that we often think of as the most damaging are gasoline and oil spillage, but we often overlook the impact that fertilizers and insecticides have. When plants are watered and fields irrigated, the chemicals that lawns and crops have been treated with can be washed into the water table. The new environments that these chemicals are introduced to suffer due to their presence as they kill native vegetation, invertebrates, and vertebrates.
Prevention and mitigation
Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of stormwater, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. Local governments use a variety of stormwater management techniques to reduce the effects of urban runoff. These techniques, called best management practices for water pollution (BMPs) in some countries, may focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions.
Pollution prevention practices include low impact development (LID) or green infrastructure techniques - known as Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in the UK, and Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia and the Middle East - such as the installation of green roofs and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels & oil, fertilizers, pesticides and roadway deicers). Runoff mitigation systems include infiltration basins, bioretention systems, constructed wetlands, retention basins and similar devices.
Providing effective urban runoff solutions often requires proper city programs that take into account the needs and differences of the community. Factors such as a city's mean temperature, precipitation levels, geographical location, and airborne pollutant levels can all affect rates of pollution in urban runoff and present unique challenges for management. Human factors such as urbanization rates, land use trends, and chosen building materials for impervious surfaces often exacerbate these issues.
The implementation of citywide maintenance strategies such as street sweeping programs can also be an effective method in improving the quality of urban runoff. Street sweeping vacuums collect particles of dust and suspended solids often found in public parking lots and roads that often end up in runoff.
Educational programs can also be an effective tool for managing urban runoff. Local businesses and individuals can have an integral role in reducing pollution in urban runoff simply through their practices, but often are unaware of regulations. Creating a productive discussion on urban runoff and the importance of effective disposal of household items can help to encourage environmentally friendly practices at a reduced cost to the city and local economy.
Thermal pollution from runoff can be controlled by stormwater management facilities that absorb the runoff or direct it into groundwater, such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins. Bioretention basins tend to be less effective at reducing temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.
Stormwater harvesting deals with the collection of runoffs from creeks, gullies, ephemeral streams, and other ground conveyances. Stormwater harvesting projects often have multiple objectives, such as reducing contaminated runoff to sensitive waters, promoting groundwater recharge, and non-potable applications such as toilet flushing and irrigation.

Life
Born on 21 March 1727, they were the eldest son of Daniel Lysons of Hempstead Court, Gloucestershire, by Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel Mee of Gloucester. They matriculated at Oxford as a gentleman-commoner of Magdalen College, Oxford on 2 March 1745, graduating B.A. in 1750, and M.A. in 1751; and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College, where they proceeded B.C.L. in 1755.
On 6 July 1756 Lysons was licensed to practise medicine, and in 1759 they became D.C.L., a degree they commuted for that of M.D. on 24 October 1769. They practised for a few years at Gloucester, and was physician to the infirmary there. About 1770 they settled at Bath, Somerset and in 1780 was elected one of the physicians to the Bath General Hospital. They died at Bath on 20 March 1800.
Works
Lysons published:
An Essay upon the Effects of Camphire and Calomel in Continual Fevers. ... To which is added an occasional Observation upon … Inoculation, London, 1771.
Practical Essays upon Intermitting Fevers, Dropsies, Diseases of the Liver, Bath, 1772.
Farther Observations on the Effects of Camphire and Calomel … Being an Appendix to Essays upon these Subjects formerly published, Bath, 1777.
Family
By their marriage, on 6 December 1768, to Mary, daughter of Richard Rogers of Dowdeswell, Gloucestershire, Lysons had no issue. They left their fortune to Daniel Lysons (1762–1834), their nephew.

The Margolis Brown Adaptors Company (MBAC) is an internationally touring physical theatre company that also houses the Margolis Method Training Center now located in Highland, New York. It was established in New York City in 1984 by Kari Margolis and Tony Brown. As co-artistic directors, Margolis and Brown have thus far co-authored, directed, and sometimes performed in 16 full-length theatrical productions, as well as numerous site-specific works at such places as the Brooklyn Museum, Coney Island, and the historic John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge on the Delaware River.
The MBAC were artists in residence at the Brooklyn Arts and Culture Association (BACA) in New York City from 1985 to 1990. In 1987 they established an independent performance space and multimedia center in Brooklyn and mounted four original productions there. The company has toured nationally and internationally to Barcelona, Berlin, London, Singapore and throughout Canada and Mexico. The company relocated to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1993. There they continued to create and produce multimedia theater productions and trained actors in the Margolis Method for over 12 years. MBAC established an international training center in Sullivan County, New York in 2005 and divide their time between New York and Minneapolis. From 2005 thru 2010 the Company divided its time between both sites. In 2011, the Company and Training Center have moved all operations to the Highland NY site.
Performances
MBAC theatrical productions are collaboratively written original performance works produced by the company. Productions are characterized by frequent utilization of multimedia and sparse text, thereby relying on unconventional means of dramatic conveyance. Examples of those alternative dramatic vehicles are projected images, prerecorded or live sound, or an actor's physicality. In addition, the actors often appear in non-representational dramatic situations.

Margolis Method
Margolis has developed a physically based approach to performance called the Margolis Method. The method, along with 25 years of personal research, takes inspiration from the research of such artists as Etienne Decroux, Bertolt Brecht, and Jerzy Grotowski. The method's goal is to analyze and focus the dramatic force and emotion created by an actor's physicality to further the creative and expressive process. It seeks to empower the actor to work simultaneously as a director, playwright and performer.
The Margolis Method was developed in response to what Margolis saw as a fragmented and ineffective way of teaching actors in America. Pedagogically, Margolis rejected the notion that actor training could be broken down into separate contexts (i.e.: stage "voice" and "movement" classes) and instead suggested that all aspects of actor training are inextricably linked. Rather than focusing primarily on establishing character through developing the character's psychological motivations and emotional states, Margolis sought ways to approach drama and character from a physical perspective as well. To accomplish this, Margolis Method focuses on theatrical notions like conflict, timing, and neutrality and employs concepts borrowed from physics, such as inertia, lines of force and density (as well as concrete manifestations of these principles, such as: pendulums, pulleys and elastics).

Alfred Sao-ke Sze (; 1877–1958) was a prominent Chinese politician and diplomat during the most turbulent period in modern Chinese history.
Early life
Sze was born on April 10, 1877. In 1892, Sze moved to Washington, D.C. with their father, who was an attaché of the Chinese legation to the U.S. Sze graduated from Central High School in 1897. They became the first Chinese student to graduate from Cornell University in 1901. They returned to China in October 1902 to work for the Peking Government.
Career
Sze served successively in the Ministry of Posts and Communications, the Jilin provincial government and the Foreign Ministry. In 1905, Sze was part of the Chinese delegation which visited a number of countries to study constitutionalism. In 1908-1910, Sze worked in Jilin, during which time they dealt with the repercussions of the attempted assassination of Itō Hirobumi. In 1911 they were appointed Minister to the United States, Spain, and Peru, but the eruption of the Xinhai Revolution and overthrow of the Qing government intervened and prevented their travel.
Under the Republic of China, Sze served briefly as Transport and Communications Minister and Finance Minister. From 1914-1920 they were China's minister to the United Kingdom, and in 1919 they were part of the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference.
Sze, along with Foreign Minister W. W. Yen, C. T. Wang and Wellington Koo, was part of a Chinese delegation which traveled to the United States in the fall of 1921 to negotiate with the U.S. to impose a limitation of armaments on Japan and to de-escalate tensions over Japan's aggressive, expansionist activities in Shandong.
From 1921-1929, Sze was head of the Chinese legation to the U.S., representing the Peking Government and securing U.S. support to contain Japanese aggression in northern China. In January 1923, President Li Yuanhong nominated Sze for the office of foreign minister, but of all the Cabinet nominations, Sze's alone was rejected by the legislature. However, Sze served briefly as acting foreign minister until the new appointee was agreed. In November 1928, Sze was again appointed minister to Britain and delegate to the League of Nations. They were replaced in the legation to the U.S. by C.C. Wu.
In 1931, they were tapped as foreign minister again, but declined. At the time, they were actively representing the Republic of China at the League of Nations, denouncing Japanese military aggression in Manchuria and demanding the League's intervention. They warned the League that if it failed to act, China would have no choice but to re-arm. The League failed to act, so in December 1931, they offered their resignation. Their offer was declined, and they remained at their post.
In January 1933, they were designated minister to the United States once again. They presented their credentials in February 1933. In July 1935, after the United States and the Republic of China agreed to raise their diplomatic missions from legations to embassies, Sze became the first Chinese ambassador to the United States. They were succeeded by C.T. Wang in 1937.
Sze was a founding member of to the World Bank and was a member of the Advisory Council of the World Bank from 1947 to 1950.
Personal life
Sze married Yu-hua "Alice" Tang. Tang's mother had been a lady in waiting to the Empress Dowager Cixi, their uncle was Prime Minister Tang Shaoyi, and their cousin Tang Pao-yu was married to Wellington Koo.
Sze's elder brother, Shi Sao (aka Chao) Tseng (施肇曾 pinyin: Shī Zhàozēng), born 1868, was also a prominent official and served as a diplomat in the U.S. from 1893 to 1897. Upon returning to China, Shi Sao held several senior railway posts, including Director-General of Lunghai Railways from 1913 to 1922. Sze's younger brother, S.C. Thomas Sze, also attended Cornell and was later a director of the Chinese railroads. The chair of the Sibley School of Engineering at Cornell is named after S.C. Thomas Sze.
Alfred Sze had two sons and four daughters. Szeming Sze was the medical director of the United Nations from 1955–1968. Deson C. Sze was a banker and also served as a private secretary to T.V. Soong. Mai-mai Sze was an accomplished painter, author, and model. Julia Sze-Bailey and Alice Wang lived in Manhattan and Boston, respectively.
Sze died on January 3, 1958, at the age of 80.

KOVO (960 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a sports format. Licensed to Provo, Utah, United States, the station serves the Provo area. The station is currently owned by Dell Loy Hansen, through licensee Broadway Media LS, LLC. It is an affiliate for ESPN Radio, which is also the affiliate of sister station KALL. The station is also broadcasting on FM translator K233DI 94.5 FM licensed to Provo.
History
The station went on the air as KOVO in 1939. In April 1948 it increased its power from 250 W to 1 KW.
Radio pioneer Arch L. Madsen, who would later achieve worldwide stature as Bonneville International Corporation's visionary leader, was KOVO's first station manager. Madsen, who previously built KSUB in Cedar City, Utah, also helped form the Inter-mountain Network which joined KOVO with KALL, KLO, and KOAL.
In much of the 1960s and part of the 1970s, the station was co-owned and managed by prominent Provo citizen, Glen Shaw. The music format was Top 40 rock. Disk Jockeys included David White, Mike VanDorn, Dwayne Case, Leonard Banks, program director Randy Morrison, and others. In the fall of 1968 the youngest DJ at the station, 19 year old Rick Dewey, came on board from stations in Alabama, to attend college in Provo. With their encouragement the station purchased the industry's top jingles package, produced by PAM Jingles in Dallas, giving the station a much-needed upgrade in sound. Along with the talented DJs that the station was procuring in the late 1960s, the station's quality was finally enhanced to the same or higher talent level as the two top rockers in Utah at the time – KNAK and KCPX in Salt Lake City, but its market share was predominantly Utah County and several counties south. Its nighttime signal occasionally reached all the way to Los Angeles, where a segment of its listeners included fellow DJs at the top rocker KHJ, as well as XERB, the “Boss Soul Power” border blaster station in Rosarito Beach, Mexico, who described themselves as fans of the station. With the advent of FM radio's rise, and with Shaw's impending retirement, in the mid-1970s the radio market changed so drastically that the station went into receivership and management changed, but the format remained the same for several years. John VanDorn took over in the mid-1970s as program director.
In 1989 Steven Grow and their brother David purchased the old KOVO radio station with hopes of real estate development. They were anxious to develop the property for the next 6–7 years and to discontinue the use of the property by a radio station. Anticipating the sale of the property, they began to arrange with the management of KOVO to remove its towers. When the property did not sell, the radio station continued to lease the property. When flooding occurred in 1983 and a dike was built, the city was careful to include all of the property in the area protected by the dike, which seemed to indicate the intent to use the property for something other than farming and grazing.
In subsequent years, housing was built to the north of the station, but the property never sold. The Marriott family through First Media Corporation owned this and a number of other major market stations during the 1980s. The FM call letters were KAYK when First Media acquired the stations in Provo. First Media divested all their radio properties in the late 1980s to Cook Inlet Region Corporation of Alaska. On 1986-05-12 the station changed its call sign to KFMY which was maintained itself as "Family Radio" (There was no station promotion using this phrase during this time. Station staff always wondered what KFMY meant.) for the next six years. The FM station was known as K-96 and was a CHR format. The 960 AM station was known as KDOT and played an adult standards format. The FM later became KZOL a satellite automated oldies station as Cook Inlet shopped the station for sale. The FM station still owned by the Cook Inlet (not the Growth Brothers) as well as the 960 AM station, were sold to James Facer a former KJQ account executive, and promoter Jim McNeil. The station briefly simulcasted KXRK (X-96) then at 96.1 FM, then briefly "S.U.N. Student Underground Network", a format aimed at Utah Valley's college students. The station later changed frequencies to 96.3 and moved to Farnsworth Peak near Salt Lake City.
Facer and McNeil sold both stations to Simmons Media in the mid-1990s for approximately $9 Million. While with Simmons media KOVO would simulcast KZNS from Salt Lake City, outside of Cougar Sports 960, BYU Baseball, and Utah Valley men's basketball.
KOVO and KBLQ (KBLQ never broadcast BYU Sports) acquired the rights for BYU Cougars baseball in 2009 and air the conference BYU Baseball games, as well as select other games.
On October 24, 2014, the sale of KOVO by Simmons Media to Dell Loy Hansen's Broadway Media LS, LLC was consummated at a price of $200,000. At that time BYU baseball games would cease on KBLQ and moved solely to KOVO. The station also moved their affiliation from NBC Sports Radio to ESPN Radio.
On May 21, 2015, KOVO expanded their sports content by acquiring BYU Cougars women's soccer games produced by IMG.
KOVO's headquarters are located at 50 West Broadway Suite #200 in Salt Lake City, UT.
Programming
KOVO airs ESPN Radio 24/7 with a few exceptions. Cougar Sports with Ben Criddle every weekday during the afternoon drive. Criddle has rotating co-hosts consisting of former BYU athletes and BYU insiders join them and Hunter Miller daily to discuss the latest news surrounding Cougar Sports. BYU Women's Soccer (Aug–Nov), Utah Valley men's basketball (Nov–Mar), and BYU Baseball (Feb–May) air regularly on the station and preempt ESPN Radio regular program during select days.

Grace Archer (also Fairbrother) is a fictional character from the BBC's long-running radio soap, The Archers. They were one of the original characters and was played by Monica Gray and then Ysanne Churchman. The episode depicting their death was broadcast by the BBC on 22 September 1955, the same evening as the launch of ITV, so as to distract from it.
Storylines
Grace is the daughter of a wealthy English family. They fall in love with Phil Archer (Norman Painting), the son of a farmer, and they are married in April 1955. A few months later, a fire breaks out at the stables while the residents of the village are at a dinner in the church hall. Grace runs into the burning stables to try to save their friend's horse and, as they search, a burning beam falls down onto her, leaving them trapped. Phil and the others at the party learn that Grace is trapped in the shed and they pull them from the wreckage.  They are rushed to hospital, but is pronounced dead on arrival.
Reception
An audience of 20 million tuned into The Archers to hear Grace's death in 1955. A writer for the Sunday Mercury called Grace's death "One of the most controversial events in Ambridge history." Nick Collins, writing for The Daily Telegraph, named Grace's death as one of The Archers' most shocking storylines In 2011, listeners voted Grace's death as their fifth most potent Archers memory in a poll conducted on the BBC's Archers website. The storyline received 9.7% of the vote. The scene is mentioned in the British sitcom The Good Life (series 3 episode 1).

Ecologically based invasive plant management (EBIPM) is a decision-making framework to improve the management of invasive plant species. When land managers are faced with infestations of invasive plants, a step by step framework to develop integrated management plans will improve their success at managing these plants. EBIPM is founded on the principles of ecology to manage invasive weed infestations and restore landscapes. The framework combines an ecosystem health assessment (Rangeland Health Assessment), a method to recognize how ecological processes affect causes of succession, ecological principles to guide the choices of tools and strategies to manage invasive plants and how to use adaptive management to generate a step-by-step decision model. The focus of EBIPM is to encourage managers to move away from simply killing the weeds and move toward management efforts that repair the underlying causes of invasion.
EBIPM guides users through a 5-step process that begins with (step 1) an assessment of rangeland health to (step 2) determine why invasive species are present and what ecological processes are in need of repair. Managers can then (step 3) use ecological principles as targets to (step 4) choose the appropriate tools and strategies that will give them the best chances of successful and lasting results. The final step in the EBIPM process is to use adaptive management to design and implement a management plan.
Background
Land managers have historically used one or more of a number of strategies to treat rangelands dominated by invasive plants. Treatments may have included the use of herbicides, targeted grazing, seeding, controlled burning, biological controls, and any number of other rangeland management treatments. The problem with simply applying treatments is that, while initially weeds are controlled, the treatment does not fix the underlying cause of the problem and the invasive species, more often than not, grow again within a short period of time. The main reason for re-occurring weed infestations is that just applying treatments to control the weeds will likely have little-to-no influence on the ecological processes driving plant community change. The EBIPM framework employs ecological principles and the practices land managers have experience in using to mend actual ecological processes that are in disrepair. This strategy has proven to provide more successful and sustainable invasive plant management.
EBIPM is based on ecological succession which was originally theorized by Frederic Clements and explains the concept of plant community change over time. Steward T. A. Pickett furthered the theory into successional management by developing a hierarchical model that includes the causes for plant community change, the controlling ecological processes, and their modifying factors. This model for successional management proposes three general causes of plant community change: site availability, species availability, and species performance.
Site Availability
Site availability refers primarily to the availability of safe sites, or open niches, in the soil profile Safe sites, spots in the soil where a seed can germinate, emerge, establish, and flourish, are created through the process of disturbance, which is a temporary variation in the typical environmental conditions which often significantly affects and alters an ecosystem. Examples of disturbance include human disruption such as recreation, construction, or fire and it also occurs naturally through wildfire, flood, insect infestation, animal activity and other processes including variations in weather. Disturbances create openings for new or different plants which changes the natural succession of a plant community. Disturbance also lessens the competitive intensity between plants, changes conditions in the environment, and alters the supply rates of resources. Understanding site availability creates an opportunity for land managers to direct plant communities in a desired direction by manipulating disturbances to favor desired species. Applying ecological principles related to the process of disturbance can significantly impact and promote germination, establishment, and growth of native and desired species over invasive species.
Species Availability
Species availability relates directly to the ecological processes of reproduction and dispersal, in other words, the availability of species through propagules either present in the soil seedbank or brought in by dispersal Essentially, species availability is the presence and establishment of various species. Seeds have developed a number of adaptations and are dispersed through various methods including wind, water, barbs, hooks, and awns that stick to animals and clothing, are carried in the wind or water...etc.
Typically, invasive species produce more seeds relative to desired native species often giving the invasive species a competitive advantage. Managers can shift competitive balance back to desired or native species by increasing their reproductive capacity and density (adding seeds...seeding treatment), which can lead to higher densities of desired species. This is often enough for desired plants to swing the competitive balance back to their favor.
Species Performance
Species Performance is how well a given species can perform in diverse environmental conditions based on a range of ecological processes including a species' ability to capture and use resources to survive and increase or spread in the environment despite competition, stress, and interference.
The factors defining a given species' ability to survive and thrive in a number of different environmental conditions are:</p>
resource availability and a species' ability to acquire and utilize those resources
response to environment or a plant's ability adapt to changes in environmental conditions (also called ecophysiological plant traits)
life strategy or a plant's life history strategy and the associated trade-offs influencing the survival or death of a species
stress and the ability of a species to either avoid or tolerate stress, and
interference or the level at which a plant is influenced by nearby plants of differing species.
Most invasive species are efficient at taking advantage of extra resources if they become available through disturbance or some other process. This information can be critical to promoting desired species as land managers attempt to give desired species a competitive edge by manipulating the factors influencing how a species performs.
Steps
The EBIPM model is a five-step comprehensive decision tool designed to improve land management decision-making and increase success rates of invasive species management. In fact, one study showed the EBIPM approach improves the likelihood of success by up to 67% relative to traditional management strategies. This article merely provides a list of the steps. For a more comprehensive look at the EBIPM framework, see the external links section below.
Step 1: Complete a Rangeland Health Assessment
A fundamental element of land management is to evaluate the current condition of the land and learn what ecological processes needs to be fixed. One such evaluation or rangeland health assessment, Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health, is currently being adopted or implemented by most U.S. government agencies as protocol. In the EBIPM framework, this step identifies the ecological processes in need of repair.
The Bureau of Land Management offers comprehensive trainings on Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health and the EBIPM Assessment Guidelines provide an in-depth, how-to guide for completing an assessment as part of the first step of the EBIPM process.
Step 2: Identify Causes of Invasion and Associated Processes Not Functioning
The assessment mentioned in the previous section provides the information for what the current conditions are and EBIPM can inform why those conditions exist and what causes of plant community change/succession and associated processes are not functioning. EBIPM's focus shifts management from trying to kill the weeds to directing the processes driving the three causes of plant community change. This will lead to more predictable and sustainable transitions toward a desired ecosystem.
Step 3: Use Principles to Guide Decision Making
The EBIPM framework is built on the idea tools and strategies are more successful and sustainable when the scientific principles of ecology are considered during the decision-making process. This makes Step 3, and the ecological principles for managing succession, a critical component of the EBIPM process. The ecological principles that provide direction for management were developed from existing scientific literature and are aimed at improving management by providing maximum plant diversity and maximum biomass in the ecosystem. Land managers face difficult decisions in trying to successfully repair and restore complex ecological processes and they often rely solely on their own intuition and experience to determine the tools and strategies they will use. Through the EBIPM approach, land managers combine their knowledge and experience with established ecological principles to choose the best management tools and strategies for dealing with complex problems. This provides an obvious benefit in that the proven scientific knowledge is organized into a functional listing of principles land managers can use to help guide their decision-making.
Step 4: Choose Appropriate Tools and Strategies Based on Principles
The EBIPM framework links the ecological processes driving plant community change with the ecological principles to provide the scientific knowledge about how the processes work and the practices affecting the most positive changes on the land. These principles provide managers an increased understanding of ecosystem processes and the ability to predict outcomes in a variety of situations. The principles can also help managers to understand how processes in need of repair may be to blame for driving successional patterns in an undesired direction toward the increased presence of invasive plants. This produces a more informed base for land managers to use in decision-making.
Step 5: Design and Execute a Plan Using Adaptive Management
Developing rangeland management plans can be difficult and extremely unpredictable but the EBIPM process provides managers a method to work through both of these challenges. However, outcomes and the true effectiveness of management is virtually impossible to predict because of the complexity of any given rangeland ecosystem and the number of variables acting on the system. To combat this, the EBIPM process includes adaptive management which empowers managers to learn by doing in the face of uncertainty. Adaptive management sets treatments up using experimental design so managers can test various management options and see what works best on their land and in their situation.

The 1916–17 season was Stoke's second season in the non-competitive War League.
With the start of World War I, all Football League football was cancelled. In its place were formed War Leagues, based on geographical lines rather than based on previous league placement. Stoke contested the Lancashire Section in the Principal Tournament, and the Lancashire Section Secondary Competition Group D. However, none of these were considered to be competitive football, and thus their records are not recognised by the Football League.
Season review
In the Primary Competition of the Lancashire League Stoke finished in 3rd place with 39 points whilst in the Secondary Competition they finished 2nd with 6 points. During this season the lowest ever attendance was recorded for a Stoke first team match when 394 people saw Stoke play Oldham Athletic at Boundary Park in October 1916. Stoke's best victory in the 1916–17 season was a 7–0 over Bolton Wanderers which was sweet revenge after they had beaten Stoke 9–2 earlier in the season.

"Fine" is a song by American singer Whitney Houston, and was the fourth single from their 2000 compilation album, Whitney: The Greatest Hits.
Composition
"Fine" is a mid-tempo R&B tune, written and produced by Raphael Saadiq and Kamaal Fareed. According to Billboard, it features "languid retro-funk guitars" and a "sneaky hook", brought to life by "richly layered harmonies". It was described as having "a sleek lite-funk sound" by The Star-Ledger.
Critical reception
Billboard wrote that "Fine" is "perhaps their most convincing crack at urbanized pop music to date. [Houston] seems to have eased into the chilled soul that propels a street-wise track. They wisely do not give into the temptation to belt and wail their way through the song [...]. Instead, Houston works the more sultry lower register of their voice, saving the big, beautiful notes as a dramatic accent toward the end of the cut". LA Weekly in its review for Whitney: The Greatest Hits wrote that "Only on the stellar R&B track “Fine” does Whitney stand out. [...] “Fine” is soulful, funky and tight as hell. And the vocal performance ranks among Whitney's best." The Baltimore Sun wrote that "Of the new tracks [on Whitney: The Greatest Hits], only the sultry, soulful "Fine" manages to convey any of the strengths that made Houston a star." and "hearing [Houston] work the tune's insistent, retro-funk groove, there's no doubting that they still have what it takes to make hits". CANOE reviewer Jane Stevenson felt that the song "falls flat". The Star-Ledger wrote that the song "grows tiresomely repetitious". According to New Nation the song takes Houston "to even greater heights, changing [her] vocals to a much lower tone, with an added hip-hop bassline". The St. Louis Post-Dispatch called it "a wonderful composition".
Chart performance
"Fine" appeared on the singles charts only in the United States and in Sweden. The song peaked at number 51 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. In Sweden, it debuted and peaked at number 50, but spent only one week on the chart.
Music video
The music video, directed by Kevin Bray, features Houston at a rooftop cocktail party. In the US, a DVD single was released. It includes the videos for "Fine" and the Houston-George Michael duet "If I Told You That", plus behind-the-scenes footage from the "Fine" video shoot. Houston's then-husband Bobby Brown also appears in the video.

Brothers of Soul was a soul trio composed of Fred Bridges, Richard Knight, and Robert Eaton, who were also a songwriting team involved with around 50 singles. Based in Detroit in the 60's and 70's, they recorded a number of songs, mainly with producer Ric Williams for the Zodiac and Boo labels. Their biggest hit was "I Guess That Don't Make Me a Loser," which peaked at 32 on the R&B charts in May 1968.
History
Bridges and Knight, who had met at the Dodge Assembly Plant, did some writing for La Beat Records, where they began working with Eaton. The first song the three are credited on together is James Shorter's "Modern Day Woman". They then got together to write a song named "Dream." While doing some freelance work for Drew Records, writing for The Precisions, they met Chicago based producer Williams, who became interested in showcasing them as a group. They chose to record under the name Brothers of Soul, a name inspired by the Detroit riots of '67. Under the coordination of Williams, they wrote for Zodiac, producing many Ruby Andrews hits. Their most successful period was from 1968-1969, with their last recordings in 1971. Sometime during this period, Ben Knights replaced Richard Knight, who was serving time in New York. They continued to work together, providing vocal accompaniment for a few years, eventually splitting apart. A hits compilation named "I Guess That Don't Make Me a Loser" was released on CD in 1995 by Collectables Records and digitally in 2008 by S.D.E.G. Records.

Matelica Cathedral ( or Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta) is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Matelica, Marche, Italy, dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. Formerly the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Matelica, it is now a co-cathedral in the Diocese of Fabriano-Matelica.
History and description
The first cathedral of Matelica was built in the historical centre of the town, but fell into ruin after the bishop's seat was moved elsewhere, and was finally demolished in 1530.
It had already been replaced as the town's main church in the 15th century by the church of Santa Maria della Piazza, which was made the cathedral under the name of Santa Maria Assunta in 1785 when Matelica was restored as a bishopric.
The campanile, which dates from the 15th century, is most unusually positioned in the centre of the cathedral's west front. This has sometimes led to suppositions over whether the present church building occupies the same position as the original church or whether repeated re-buildings and restorations over time have had the effect of moving it.
Among the works of art in the cathedral, of particular note for the fine quality of the workmanship is an 18th-century crucifix in wood and silver by Giovanni Giardini of Forlì.

Andrew Jackson Merchant (December 23, 1831 – November 20, 1899) was an American Methodist minister.
Merchant was born on their father's farm in Napoli, New York, on December 23, 1831. They were the grandson of Truman Merchant, a Revolutionary War soldier and cousin of Vice-President Aaron Burr, and was descended from Captain John Marchant, who died along with Sir Francis Drake in their 1595 campaign.
A teacher in their early years, Andrew Merchant enrolled in the first class at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, and graduated in 1857 with Latin Honors. They married Frances C. Peck that same year, and was admitted into the Erie Conference as a Methodist preacher. A so-called "circuit rider," they preached in many locales across western Pennsylvania, southwestern New York State, and northern Ohio, including charges in Punxsutawney, Cleveland, and Meadville, where they died November 20, 1899.
Rev. Merchant sat on the Board of Control of Allegheny College, was a presiding elder and delegate to the General Conference of the Methodist Church in 1896, and served as treasurer of the Erie Conference Educational Association.
They were the father of Frank W. Merchant, a noted newspaperman in Pittsburgh between 1898 and 1931.

William Stanley Russell Thomas (1896 – 21 March 1957) was a physician, barrister and Welsh Liberal politician who served as a Liberal National Member of Parliament.
Education
Educated at Brecon Grammar School, Christ College, Brecon, and Queens' College, Cambridge.
Physician
They qualified as a physician and surgeon at Guy's Hospital and was Treasurer's gold medallist in medicine.
Barrister
They were called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1930.
Politician
Ilford
They were a Liberal candidate for Ilford in the 1931 election. It was a promising seat which the Liberals had nearly gained from the Conservatives in 1929. At the 1931 elections, the Liberal party was split into three groups and Thomas remained with the official Liberals under Sir Herbert Samuel, in support of the National Government. They finished third in Ilford, just behind the Labour candidate.
They remained loyal to the official Liberal party when it left the National government in 1932.
Aberdeenshire Central
Despite their poor showing at Ilford in 1931, for the 1935 election they were selected as Liberal candidate in the promising constituency of Aberdeenshire Central where the Liberal in 1931 finished a close second behind the Conservative in a two-party contest. However, in 1935, the Labour party intervened and in a three-way contest Thomas finished third, again just behind Labour.
Ross & Cromarty
Their next attempt to enter parliament was also in Scotland at the 1936 Ross and Cromarty by-election. In 1935, the Liberal National candidate was re-elected unopposed. When the by-election came around, a minority section of the local Liberal Association wanted a Liberal to stand and were unhappy when the majority decided to support a National Labour candidate. The Scottish Liberal Federation persuaded Thomas to stand as a Liberal candidate. However, the result was a disaster for Thomas as they finished fourth.
Following this disappointment, Thomas decided to switch their support from the official Liberal party to the Liberal National party.
Southampton
Their connection with the Liberal Nationals was far more rewarding when they were chosen as the National government's candidate for the 1940 by-election in Southampton. By then, a war time electoral truce between the main political parties was in operation, so Thomas was returned unopposed.
At the 1945 General election, Thomas sought re-election as a Liberal National candidate in support of Winston Churchill. Southampton was a dual member seat and they ran in tandem with a Conservative against two Labour candidates and a Liberal. However, they lost their seat and finished fourth.
Thomas contested Middlesbrough East in the 1950 general election, however, this time not as a Liberal National but as an official Liberal candidate. They came third with 10% of the vote.
Brecon & Radnor
Despite their Welsh heritage, none of their previous electoral challenges was in their native Wales. However they were selected as Liberal candidate for Brecon & Radnor for the 1955 General election. Having been raised in Brecon, they might have had hopes of winning. However, the Liberals had not contested the seat in 1951 and in 1950, their candidate finished a poor third. The 1955 elections represented the lowest point in the fortunes of the Liberal party and Thomas was to finish third once again.
This was to be their electoral swansong.

Elections to the Haryana Legislative Assembly were held in May 1982. No party gained a majority of seats.
Results
Controversy
In the 1982 election, the INC emerged as a single largest party with 36 seats but INLD and BJP has pre poll alliance and got 37 seats in total. As no party has clear-cut majority, it resulted in a hung assembly and was left to governor's discretion to whom to call upon to form government.
G.D. Tapase (Governor of Haryana) first called on Devi Lal on 22 May 1982 (leader of INLD or LKD + BJP alliance) to prove their majority by morning of 24 May. But in mean time, Bhajan Lal fresh from their re Italic textelection as leader of the INC+Individuals(36+16=52) met the governor and was sworn in as Chief Minister.
But in election of 1987, haryana people gave a clear-cut majority to LKD or INLD and BJP alliance with overwhelming majority of 76(60+16) out of 90 assembly seats whereas INC suffers a humiliating defeat and won just 5 out of 90 seats as compared 36 seats in last assemble election.

Dietmar Bruck (born 19 April 1944) is a former professional footballer who played in the Football League as a full back for Coventry City, where they spent the majority of their career, Charlton Athletic and Northampton Town.
Football career
Bruck began their football career as an apprentice with Coventry City, and made their league debut at home to Swindon Town on 28 April 1961, aged just 17 years 9 days. They became the first substitute used by Coventry City when they replaced Ron Farmer in a 3–3 draw against Manchester City on 4 September 1965. They were part of the Coventry team that won the Second Division title in 1967, and played 189 league games for the club.
They moved to Charlton Athletic in October 1970 for a fee of £15,000, and two years later joined Northampton Town.
After leaving Northampton they were part of the Nuneaton Borough team that reached the first round proper of the 1974–75 FA Cup before moving to Weymouth as player-manager. They were sacked from their post at Weymouth in January 1977, subsequently managed Redditch United and Racing Club Warwick, and in the 1985–86 season had a week as caretaker manager of Leamington.
Personal life
Bruck was born in Danzig, then in Germany, and came to England as a child. They were raised in Coventry and attended Bishop Ullathorne RC School. After their football career came to an end, they worked as a financial consultant for an insurance company, and after retirement worked as a "community champion" with Tesco in Coventry. They were married to Maureen until their death, and in 2003 survived a car crash in which their partner, Sue, was killed.

They also arranged training of local artisans to improve the skill. In addition to textile, the manufacturing of carpets was an important industry. .
Production
Mughal carpet weaving was renowned in Agra, Lahore, and Fatehpur Sikri. The karkhanas of carpet, rugs, tents, and various other floor coverings was called Farrash khana.
Creativity
The Mughal empress Nur Jahan had a personal interest in textiles. Them name is associated with designing many fabrics and dresses, and there is also a carpet named Farshi-Chandni that became well-known during their time.
Special Mentions
The Girdler's carpet is one of the best-documented examples of Mughul carpets.

Gampopa Sönam Rinchen (, 1079–1153) was the main student of Milarepa, and a Tibetan Buddhist master who codified their own master's ascetic teachings, which form the foundation of the Kagyu educational tradition. Gampopa was also a doctor and tantric master. They authored the first Lamrim text, Jewel Ornament of Liberation, and founded the Dagpo Kagyu school.  They are also known as Dvagpopa, and by the titles Dakpo Lharjé "the physician from Dakpo" () and Daö Zhönnu, "Candraprabhakumara" ().
Biography
Gampopa was born in the Nyal (or Nyel) district, Central Tibet and from an early age was a student of medicine in the Indian, Chinese and Tibetan medical traditions. Later in their life they moved to the region of Dakpo (dwags po) in southern Tibet and hence was also called Dakpopa (dwags po pa), the man from Dakpo. The region is also near Gampo Hills, hence their other name, Gampopa. In their youth Gampopa studied under the Nyingma lama Barey as well as under the Kadampa teacher Geshe Yontan Drag. They married a daughter of a man named Chim Jose Darma Wo (mchims jo sras dar ma 'od) and had a child, but they both died, causing them to renounce the householder's life. In 1104, at the age of twenty-five they took ordination, either in Dakpo or in Penyul, at Gyachak Ri monastery ('phan yul rgya lcags ri), receiving the name Sönam Rinchen (bsod nams rin chen)." After becoming a monk in the Kadampa lineage under Geshe Lodan Sherab and focused on studying the Kadampa teachings. In their 30s they sought out and became the foremost student of the yogi Milarepa. Milarepa instructed them in the practice of Vajravārahī, tummo (gtum mo) and Mahāmudrā.
Gampopa's position in the transmission lineage of the Mahamudra teaching is as follows:
Tilopa (988-1069), the Indian yogi who experienced the original transmission of the Mahamudra
Naropa (1016–1100), who perfected the methods of accelerated enlightenment described in their Six Yogas of Naropa.
Marpa (1012–1097), the first Tibetan in the lineage, who translated the Vajrayana and Mahamudra texts into Old Tibetan
Milarepa (1040–1123), poet and master who overcame Marpa's reluctance to teach but nonetheless attained enlightenment in a single lifetime
Gampopa, Milarepa's most important student, who integrated Atiśa's Kadam teachings and Tilopa's Mahamudra teaching to establish the Kagyü lineage
This lineage sequence, taken together, is called the "Five Founding Masters" by the Kagyu school.
After their studies with Milarepa, Gampopa founded Daklha Gampo Monastery (Dwags lha sgam po) in 1121 CE. They had many great students who were accomplished tantric practitioners, both monks and laypeople. Gampopa's teaching joined the Lamrim teachings of the Kadampa school with the Mahamudra and tantric teachings of the Kagyu school. According to Tony Duff, they taught Mahamudra in two approaches, "one is a gradual approach called the Four Yogas of Mahamudra, the other is a sudden approach called Essence Mahamudra."
Dagpo Kagyu Lineages
Gampopa taught extensively, and attracted many students.  They are the source of the major surviving Kagyu sub-schools, all known as the Dagpo Kagyu. Following Gampopa, there evolved the so-called "Four Major and Eight Minor" lineages of the Dagpo (sometimes rendered "Tagpo" or "Dakpo") Kagyu School. This phrase is descriptive of the generation or order in which the schools were founded, not of their importance. The four "major" Kagyu schools were those of:
Barom Kagyu founded by Barompa Darma Wangchug (1127-1194?)
Phagdru Kagyu founded by Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo (1110-1170)
Karma Kagyu, founded by Düsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama (1110-1193)
Tsalpa Kagyu founded by Zhang Yudragpa Tsondru Drag (1123-1193)
The succession of Gampopa's own monastery passed to their nephew, Dakgom Tsültrim Nyingpo (, 1116-1169).
Teachings
Gampopa's most famous teaching is known as "The Four Dharmas of Gampopa", this is outlined in a key text of Gampopa called The Four Dharmas in Brief:"It is necessary for: dharma to turn to dharma; dharma to turn into the path; the path to dispel confusion; and confusion to turn into wisdom"The Four Dharmas in Brief further states about each of the four Dharmas:
(1) Dharma to turn to dharma means to meditate on impermanence, the fact that all things will be left behind at death and that only Dharma is of use, all must be renounced except Dharma.
(2) Dharma turns into the path is explained as:if there is the rational mind of loving kindness and compassion that cherishes other more than oneself-the fictional enlightenment mind-and then on top of that the understanding that all phenomena, outer and inner, appearing as the coming together of interdependency are illusory, then the primal dharma turns into the path.(3) The Path is to be used to dispel confusion means that "confusion has to be dispelled from top to bottom", Gampopa explains this as follows:First, meditation on impermanence dispels the confusion of clinging to this life, then meditation on karma and effect dispels the confusion of bad views, then meditation on the disadvantages of cyclic existence dispels the confusion of attachment to cyclic existence, then meditation on loving kindness and compassion dispels the confusion of the Lesser Vehicle, then meditation on appearances being dream-like, illusory, dispels the confusion of grasping at conceived-of things...(4) Confusion turns into wisdom:If, the force of meditation done on all phenomena being free from birth and cessation in superfact (paramartha satya) causes whatever appears, whatever is known, to be resolved as its own entity, then confusion has dawned as wisdom.
Works
Gampopa's collected works (known as the Dags po'i Bka' 'bum) were published in Dvag Lha Gampo monastery, but that edition has been lost. There are three main editions extant today:
An edition made in Hemis Monastery, Ladhak, in the nineteenth century;
A copy of the above, published in February 1982, in India;
The Derge wood block edition.
Gampopa's The Jewel Ornament of Liberation () is one of their most important works, it has been translated into English, first by Herbert Guenther in 1959 and again by Khenpo Konchok Gyeltsen in 1998.

Rubidgea is a genus of gorgonopsid from the upper Permian of South Africa and Tanzania, containing the species Rubidgea atrox. The generic name Rubidgea is sometimes believed to be derived from the surname of renowned Karoo paleontologist, Professor Bruce Rubidge, who has contributed to much of the research conducted on therapsids of the Karoo Basin. However, this generic name was actually erected in honor of Rubidge's paternal grandfather, Sydney Rubidge, who was a renowned fossil hunter. Its species name atrox is derived from Latin, meaning “fierce, savage, terrible”. Rubidgea is part of the gorgonopsian subfamily Rubidgeinae, a derived group of large-bodied gorgonopsians restricted to the Late Permian (Lopingian). The subfamily Rubidgeinae first appeared in the Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone. They reached their highest diversity in the Cistecephalus and Daptocephalus assemblage zones of the Beaufort Group in South Africa.
History of discovery
The first Rubidgea fossil was discovered by C. J. M. "Croonie" Kitching, the father of renowned paleontologist James Kitching, on the farm Doornberg outside the small town Nieu-Bethesda sometime in the 1930s. In a paper published in 1938, Robert Broom named the fossil Rubidgea kitchingi. Broom noted the large size of the new gorgonopsid fossil, stating that it was a new species. Subsequent discoveries in the following decades confirmed Broom's suspicions that a new subfamily of gorgonopsians should be categorised, and the Rubidgeinae was erected.
Description
Rubidgea was the largest African gorgonopsians and one of the largest gorgonopsians known to have lived. Measurements taken from specimens estimate that adult Rubidgea reached a length of , the largest specimens hosting skulls that measure up to in length. Rubidgea was a heavily-built, large-bodied apex predator, and sported a thick skull with long, sabre-like canines. The Rubidgeinae group as a whole were the largest gorgonopsians known to have lived, and are characterised by their robust skeletal features, particularly their skulls which are heavily-pachyostosed. The genus Rubidgea is composed of three species, R. atrox, R. platyrhina, and R. majora.
Classification
The Rubidgeinae are a subfamily of derived gorgonopsids that have only been found in Africa. They are composed of six genera and 17 species. The Rubidgeinae are closely related to their sister group, the Inostranceviinae, which have only been found in Russia. Out of the gorgonopsian clade, the systematics of the Rubidgeinae is the best resolved due to their distinctive character traits. The systematics of other gorgonopsian subfamilies remain chaotic due to a high degree of cranial homomorphism between taxa, making it difficult to distinguish different taxa effectively. The cladogram below (Kammerer and Rubidge 2022) displays the currently accepted systematic relationships of the Gorgonopsia.
Correlation
Numerous therapsid species, including rubidgenae gorgonopsids, are used as biostratigraphic markers in other African Basins, such as the Upper Madumabisa Mudstone Formation of Zambia, and the Chiweta Beds of Malawi. Rubidgea fossils have been recovered from the Usili Formation of Tanzania, indicating biostratigraphic correlation with upper Permian-aged deposits in South Africa. No rubidgeinae fossils have been found outside of African deposits to date, although the Inostranceviinae are considered to be their Russian counterparts.

"The Coffee Song" (occasionally subtitled "They've Got an Awful Lot of Coffee in Brazil") is a novelty song written by Bob Hilliard and Dick Miles, first recorded by Frank Sinatra in 1946. Later that year it was recorded by The Smart Set, and by others in later years.
The song caricatures Brazil's coffee surplus, jokingly claiming that no other beverages are available. Snowclones on this phrase have been used in analyses of the coffee industry, and of the Brazilian economy and culture.
Sinatra re-recorded the song in 1960 for their inaugural Reprise release, Ring-a-Ding-Ding!
Notable cover versions
The song has been performed by (among others) Louis Prima, The Andrews Sisters, Sam Cooke, The Smart Set, Rosemary Clooney, Eydie Gormé, Mike Doughty, Stan Ridgway, Soul Coughing, Osibisa, Hildegard Knef, and the Muppets. Bob Dorough recorded the song for inclusion on Too Much Coffee Man, a CD of music based on the eponymous Shannon Wheeler character.
The Muppets performed the song as the opening number of a 1997 episode of Muppets Tonight.

Ruins of Nístějka Castle
Nístějka is a ruin of a castle in Vysoké nad Jizerou founded probably in the 14th century by the Waldstein family. In 1390, it passed together with the settlement Vysoké into the property of Vartemberk family and in 1422 into Jenštejn family. Around 1460, the castle was briefly held by Bohemian King George of Poděbrady and their goods were attached to Návarov. Since 1519, the castle has been declared desolate, probably after a previous fire.
The ruins consist of remnants of towers, walls and cellars on a narrow, long promontory over the Jizera river near Hradsko. The castle consisted of an elongated barracks protected by a moat and a cylindrical tower at its head, and a small inner castle where only a backyard with a tank and a rectangular palace was on the rocks.
The castle is declared a protected area for the occurrence of herb Hackelia deflexa. In 1954, 1958 and 1972, archaeological research of the castle was carried out.

The Amsterdam () was an 18th-century cargo ship of the Dutch East India Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie; VOC). The VOC was established in 1602. The ship started its maiden voyage from Texel to Batavia on 8 January 1749, but was wrecked in a storm on the English Channel on 26 January 1749. The shipwreck was discovered in 1969 in the bay of Bulverhythe, near Hastings on the English south coast, and is sometimes visible during low tides. The location in 1969 was found by Bill Young, the site agent/project manager for the sewage outfall being built by the William Press Group. With time on their hands during the long stay away from home, they followed up the rumour of the going aground. They were castigated by the Museum of London for scooping out the interior of the bow with a digger as it could have led to the structure collapsing. However, it uncovered the initial items which led to a more extensive excavation of the cargo which reflected life at the time. The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by Historic England. Some of the findings from the site are in The Shipwreck Museum in Hastings. A replica of the ship is on display in Amsterdam.
Ship
The Amsterdam was a Dutch "Mirror Return Ship" () built as an East Indiaman for transport between the Dutch Republic and the settlements and strongholds of the Dutch East India Company in the East Indies. On an outward voyage these ships carried guns and bricks for the settlements and strongholds, and silver and golden coins to purchase Asian goods. On a return journey the ships carried the goods that were purchased, such as spices, fabrics, and china. In both directions the ships carried victuals, clothes, and tools for the sailors and soldiers on the ship. On an outward voyage of eight months, the ships were populated by around 240 men, and on a return journey by around 70.
The Amsterdam was built in the shipyard for the Amsterdam chamber of the Dutch East India Company in Amsterdam. The ship was made of oak wood.
Maiden voyage
The maiden voyage of the Amsterdam was planned from the Dutch island Texel to the settlement Batavia in the East Indies. The ship, commanded by the 33-year-old captain Willem Klump, had 203 crew, 127 soldiers, and 5 passengers. The Amsterdam was laden with textiles, wine, stone ballast, cannon, paper, pens, pipes, domestic goods and 27 chests of silver guilder coins. The whole cargo would be worth several million euros in modern money.
On 15 November 1748 the ship made its first attempt but returned on 19 November 1748 due to an adverse wind. The ship made a second attempt on 21 November 1748, which also failed and from which the ship returned on 6 December 1748. The third attempt was made on 8 January 1749. The Amsterdam had problems in the English Channel tacking into a strong westerly storm. For many days they got no further than Beachy Head near Eastbourne. An epidemic appeared amongst the crew and a mutiny broke out. Finally the rudder broke off and the ship, helpless in a storm, grounded in the mud and sand in the bay of Bulverhythe on 26 January 1749, to the west of Hastings.
They began to sink into the mud, where much of the keel remains today, perfectly preserved. Some of the cargo, including silver coinage, was removed for safekeeping by local authorities. There was an outbreak of fighting between scavengers and British troops had to be called in to bring the situation to order. The crew were looked after locally before being returned to Dutch soil.
Shipwreck
In 1969, the Amsterdam was discovered after being exposed by a low spring tide. It is the best-preserved VOC ship ever found. Archaeologist Peter Marsden did the first surveying of the wreck, and they advised further excavation.
The wrecksite was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act on 5 February 1974.
The VOC Ship Amsterdam Foundation started researching the wreck, followed by major excavations in 1984, 1985 and 1986, during which huge numbers of artefacts were found. Although the wreck is submerged in the sand and mud of the beach (and is even visible at very low tides), much of the excavation was done by divers, for whom a small tower was constructed near the wreck. Additionally the wreck was surrounded by an iron girder frame. The archeological output was so dense that new ways of researching needed to be developed, all of which were needed to understand the technological, socio-economic and cultural features of the VOC. Some of the finds are on show at the Shipwreck Museum in Hastings, East Sussex, UK, with the exception of the anchor, which is now on display as public art at St Katharine Docks in London. The wreck is protected and diving on it or removing timbers or any artefacts is forbidden. The ship may be visited as the timbers are exposed at very low tides in the sand just opposite the footbridge over the railway line at Bulverhythe.
Ship replica
A replica of the ship was built in Iroko wood by 300 volunteers using modern tools as well as tools of the period, between 1985 and 1990 at the Zouthaven (now Piet Heinkade), Amsterdam. It is moored next to the Netherlands Maritime Museum, where it is open to visitors of the museum (which has now reopened after being closed for several years for renovations).
As for the original ship, there had been hopes in the 1980s that the Dutch Government, which still owns it, might excavate the whole wreck and return it for restoration and display in Amsterdam, like the Regalskeppet Vasa in Sweden, or the Mary Rose in Portsmouth, but the funds were not forthcoming. Several decks and much of the bowsprit lie submerged in the mud and are in remarkably good condition, being naturally preserved by the mud, and much of the cargo is still aboard.
Popular culture
The comic book Angst op de "Amsterdam" of Spike and Suzy is about the Amsterdam. The book was published in 1985 in The Red Series of Spike and Suzy.
In the miniature park Madurodam in The Hague is a model of the Amsterdam on a scale of 1:25. The Amsterdam Museum also has a wooden model of the ship with to the side a 'Camel' lifting mechanism.
Shanty Punk band Skinny Lister, some of whom live in Hastings, released a single "Damn the Amsterdam" about the ship.

Spenser Confidential is a 2020 American action comedy film directed by Peter Berg and with a screenplay written by Sean O'Keefe and Brian Helgeland. The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Winston Duke, Alan Arkin, Iliza Shlesinger, Bokeem Woodbine, Donald Cerrone, Marc Maron, and Post Malone and marks the fifth collaboration between Wahlberg and Berg after Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, Patriots Day, and Mile 22.
The film was announced in 2018 as an adaptation of the 2013 novel Robert B. Parker's Wonderland by author Ace Atkins, itself a continuation of the actual Robert B. Parker detective series Spenser, also portrayed on TV in Spenser: For Hire. It was released on March 6, 2020, by Netflix to mixed reviews.
Plot
Boston police Officer Spenser is jailed after pleading guilty to assaulting Captain John Boylan, who they suspected to be involved in the murder of Gloria Weisnewski, a family friend who protested gentrification. While incarcerated, Spenser studies to become a truck driver in Arizona and is warned to leave Boston. On release, Spenser takes up residence with their friend Henry Cimoli and their roommate, Hawk.
When Boylan is murdered, Detective Driscoll and their partner, Macklin, question Spenser. Driscoll, Spenser's former partner, accepts Spenser's alibi and urges them to leave the city. Spenser becomes suspicious when an honest cop, Detective Terrence Graham, reportedly kills themselves and is identified as Boylan's killer.
Spenser questions Graham's wife, Letitia, and goes to a police bar where they said Graham met with Scotty Traylor, Terrence's partner. Traylor confirms Terrence suspected Boylan of being corrupt. Spenser acquires CCTV footage from a nearby store showing Terrence getting into a yellow Corvette, while two others got into their SUV and followed him. At the murder scene in a local school bus yard, Spenser discovers a toothpick similar to ones Driscoll uses. Driscoll advises dropping the case and denies having been to the crime scene.
Spenser chases the yellow Corvette on foot and is attacked by a dog. Hawk catches the license plate number of the car and traces it to Charles "Tracksuit Charlie" Bentwood, a mercenary hired to intimidate Gloria. Spenser, Henry, and Hawk surveil Bentwood and observe them making a hand off to Macklin. They discover an FBI team led by Agent Burton is also surveilling. Spenser extorts information from an inmate named Squeeb about Wonderland Greyhound Park, learning that it is the site of a future casino that Driscoll and drug gangs wish to invest in.
Driscoll and Macklin send gang members from the Trinitarios to kill Spenser at a restaurant, but Hawk rescues him. Henry, Hawk, and Spenser hide out at the house of Spenser's hot-tempered ex, Cissy. When Letitia's apartment is ransacked, they call Spenser for help and gives them a recording mailed by Terrence on the day they died. It confirms Boylan is dirty and implicates Bentwood, Macklin, and Driscoll. The three had Boylan murdered for giving the information about their business to Terrence, who was then killed shortly after, and both their deaths have been staged to make it appear to be a murder-suicide. Spenser confronts Driscoll, who refuses to turn themselves in. Upon handing the recording over to the FBI, Agent Burton deems it insufficient evidence. Spenser tracks down Bentwood and interrogates him, learning of a drug shipment headed to Wonderland. Spenser and Hawk hijack the drugs, but a thug escapes to warn Driscoll. Spenser's reporter contact declares the drugs to be insufficient evidence. Driscoll calls Spenser, revealing that they have kidnapped Henry. Driscoll demands a meeting at Wonderland, threatening to kill Henry if they do not bring the drugs.
Spenser, Hawk, and Cissy go to Wonderland, where Driscoll and others are gathered on the track. Cissy arrives first to move Henry out of the way, before Spenser and Hawk arrive in a truck and plow through the gang members' vehicles. Driscoll flees into the race track's clubhouse, and Spenser pursues him. After a brawl, Spenser performs a citizen's arrest after realizing how their fight resembles the day they beat up Boylan. They pile the drugs and other evidence on the infield and leave Driscoll, Bentwood, and Macklin restrained nearby. Spenser and Hawk are declared heroes, the casino project is shut down, Boylan and Bentwood are charged in Weisnewski's murder, and Driscoll is convicted and sent to prison.
Spenser, Hawk, Cissy and Henry celebrate by going to a local diner. A TV news report shows Boston Fire Department Chief Marty Foley being arrested over charges of arson. Spenser, who has known Foley since high school, goes into deep thought as Cissy and Henry attempt to draw Spenser out of another case.
Cast
Production
The film, originally titled Wonderland, was produced by Neal H. Moritz, Stephen Levinson, Mark Wahlberg, and Peter Berg through their respective production companies Original Film, Leverage Entertainment, Closest to the Hole Productions, and Film 44. During the autumn of 2018, Winston Duke, Post Malone, Alan Arkin, Iliza Shlesinger, Bokeem Woodbine, James DuMont, Marc Maron Michael Gaston, and Colleen Camp joined the cast of the film.
The script was written by Sean O'Keefe and Brian Helgeland, and filming began late in 2018 in Boston. The residence of character Cimoli was filmed in the Jones Hill neighborhood of Boston, on the street where actor Wahlberg lived during their teenage years, while Raynham Park, another former greyhound racing track, stood in for the Wonderland Greyhound Park, which was demolished in 2017. Funeral scenes were filmed at Central Cemetery in Randolph, Massachusetts.
Music
The film score was composed by Steve Jablonsky, who has worked with director Peter Berg on previous films. The soundtrack was released by BMG.
Release
The film was released by Netflix on March 6, 2020. At a meeting in April 2020 discussing first quarter business data, Netflix reported 85 million households watched the film over its first six weeks of release. In November, Variety reported the film was the 21st-most watched straight-to-streaming title of 2020 up to that point.
Reception
On the review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site's critics consensus reads, "While the buddy cops at the center of Spenser Confidential are plenty affable, the comedy never arrives as this half-hearted vehicle goes purely through the motions." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews."
Elisabeth Vincentelli of the New York Times criticized the film's deviation from its source material, observing that there was "almost no resemblance to the Ace Atkins novel Robert B. Parker's Wonderland ... aside from the Boston location, the main characters' names and something or other about an abandoned dog-racing track." Daniel Woburn of the online entertainment news website Screen Rant elaborated further on this disparity, noting many differences in characterization from the series as a whole and calling out the plot, in particular, as deviating heavily from the original novel with the biggest common thread between them being the finale at the race track.
Sequel
On September 2, 2020, a sequel was confirmed to be in development with Berg, Helgeland, and Wahlberg returning.

Caso Genoa was an Italian football scandal in 2005.
In the 2004–05 Serie B season, Genoa won the Serie B championship and were set to be promoted to the Serie A for the first time in 10 years. Genoa went into their final match of the season against Venezia on 11 June 2005, having already secured at least promotion play-off, and beat Venezia 3–2. However, three days later, it was discovered that Stefano Capozucca, a director of Genoa, had paid Venezia director Giuseppe Pagliara €250,000 for their team to intentionally lose the match.
It was later found that the principal protagonists behind the scandal were Genoa's president, Enrico Preziosi, and Venezia's president, Franco Dal Cin.
On 8 August 2005, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) determined that Genoa would be relegated to Serie C1 with a three-point penalty; it was the second time in Genoa's history that they had dropped out of the top two divisions, the first being in 1970. In addition, Preziosi, Dal Cin, Pagliara and Capozucca were each banned from Italian football for five years, while Michele Dal Cin was banned for three years and one month.

The Wilson Trail () is a long-distance footpath in Hong Kong, 63 km of which runs through Hong Kong country parks. It was named after David Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn, who was Governor of Hong Kong from 1987 to 1992. The Wilson Trail was developed by Friends of the Country Park and sponsored by various private organisations. The construction work of the trail began in 1994. The Wilson Trail was first opened on 21 January 1996.
In all, the Wilson Trail traverses eight of the Country Parks. On Hong Kong Island, Tai Tam Country Park and the adjacent Quarry Bay Country Park begin the journey. Across the harbour, there is a gap where the trail runs through hills outside the parks. Then come the three parks named Ma On Shan, Lion Rock, and Kam Shan. In the central New Territories, the Wilson Trail heads north through Shing Mun Country Park and Tai Mo Shan Country Park. Finally it climbs into the majestic Pat Sin Leng Country Park. Each of the Country Parks the Wilson Trail traverses has its individual character and appeal – offering, as one proceeds from south to north, changing settings with much of interest.
The trail is aligned north-south and runs from Stanley, in the south of Hong Kong Island to Nam Chung, in the northeastern New Territories. Of the four long-distance trails, the Wilson Trail is the newest. Since the trail crosses Victoria Harbour, it makes use of the MTRTseung Kwan O line or buses.
Sections
The Wilson Trail is divided into ten sections: and is marked by distance posts W001 – W137. Although the other major Hong Kong trails measure distance posts every 500m, the distances between posts on the Wilson Trail range from 500m – 650m.
Between Sections 2 and 3, it is necessary to take the MTR from Tai Koo Station (just near the end of Section 2 on Greig Road) to Yau Tong Station and then walk to W020 at the base of Devil's Peak. Previously, Section 3 started at Lam Tin Station but with the opening of Yau Tong Station it was moved.

Errors
Wilson Trail is one of the newest long-distance trails in Hong Kong. However, many hikers find the sign posts are unclear and full of errors. One of the most significant problems is that there are only 137 distance posts along the 78 km trail. They are supposed to be at 500 meter intervals. There are also complaints that some signs are missing or misplaced. However, the situation has improved in the recent years.
Raleigh Challenge
Raleigh International's "Raleigh Challenge - Wilson Trail" is the first hiking competition which covered the longest distance of the Wilson Trail, spanning across the Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories from south to north.

La plaquita or la placa (English: little plate) is a bat-and-ball game played in the Dominican Republic with many similarities to cricket.
Several Dominican MLB baseball players have attested to playing it as children.
Rules
Two teams of two players take turns fielding and batting. There are two wickets which are license plates (called placas in Spanish), with one fielder behind and one batter in front of each wicket. Batters run between the wickets to score runs, with one run scored for each swap of the batters, though they can be put out if a fielder runs them out by hitting a wicket with the ball while they are away from it. One of the fielding team's players throws the ball to the batter at the opposite wicket, who may then try to hit it. The fielding team's goal is to bowl the batter out by knocking over the wicket with the ball. Whichever team has more runs at the end of the game wins.

Caversham Heights is an electoral ward of the Borough of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. The ward was created by a boundary reorganisation prior to the 2022 Reading Borough Council election, and has replaced the Mapledurham ward, with the addition of parts of the old Thames and Peppard wards. During the reorganisation process, the ward was known as The Heights, but the name was subsequent changed as a result of public consultation.
The ward lies in Caversham, once a separate town to the north of the River Thames, and includes the area known as Caversham Heights, together with other parts of the larger area of Caversham. From the south in clockwise order it is bounded by the River Thames, the borough boundary to the west and north, Highdown Hill Road, St Barnabas Road, Evesham Road, Rotherfield Way, Oakley Road, Kidmore Road, The Mount, and The Warren back to the River Thames. The ward is bordered, in the same order, by Mapledurham and Kidmore End civil parishes of Oxfordshire, followed by Emmer Green, Caversham, new Thames, Battle, and Kentwood wards. It is entirely within the Reading East parliamentary constituency.
As with all Reading wards, the ward elects three councillors to Reading Borough Council. Elections since 2004 are generally held by thirds, with elections in three years out of four, although the 2022 elections were for all councillors due to the boundary changes. The ward councillors are currently Isobel Ballsdon and Paul Carnell, both members of the Conservative party, and Sue Kitchingham, of the Labour party.

Californium is an exploration game co-developed by Darjeeling and Nova Productions, and released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux under Proton. Californium was developed as a tribute to science-fiction author Philip K. Dick on the 30th anniversary of their death. The player controls Elvin Green, a struggling writer dealing with family matters, as they discover the means to manipulate reality, and explores several surreal landscapes.
Gameplay
As an exploration game, the player can move Green around the current level, but has no direct means to interact with it. Several non-playable characters can be approached to initiate a one-side dialog with them. Through each level are several cathode-ray tube monitors that once discovered will present a Roman numeral value to the player. This represents the number of reality-warping points that must be found in the nearby area. These points are marked with a glowing Θ (Theta) glyph, but may require the player to look upon the point from a specific vantage point, to turn to look at the point from a specific direction, or to look near the point to eliminate objects in front of it to make it appear. When the glyph is hidden, objects nearby will flicker in and out of reality, allowing the player to recognize the glyph is nearby. Once the glyph is found, the player interacts with their controllers to activate it. This causes a spherical bubble of a new reality to replace what had previously been there. Once all the glyphs for a section are found, the player is given some narrative for the game, and other sections of the level may be made available. Once all sections are completed in the same manner, the player must then find the right vantage point on the level to enable a final large glyph that spans across many difference surfaces.
Plot
Elvin Green is a struggling writer living in Berkeley, California in 1967. Following the death of their daughter Alice, and the departure of their wife Thea Trauberg, Green is struggling writer's block, unable to come up with new material for a book; their publisher threatens to drop him, he's in danger of being evicted from their apartment, and their drug addiction is escalating, manifesting in short seizures. Green suddenly hears a voice in their head coming from the static on their television, telling them to seek out images of the Theta. In finding these, Green is able to alter their reality and slip into a new one.
In this next reality, Green is revered as the Patriot Writer, the most important writer of their generation - however, California is now the California Republic, an authoritarian police state, and Green's wife Thea, an anti-state revolutionary has been captured and is planned to be executed; characters in this new reality, who are versions of their original selves, all suggest Green to collaborate with the state and bear witness against Thea. The voice, meanwhile, taunts Green that their success in this reality has come with a price, as Green explores and finds yet another reality.
In the third reality takes place on Mars, where Green is a Commander of a colony of cyborgs; Green was responsible for creating sentient androids, who eventually enslaved the remaining humanity as workforce. As they prepare for the opening of the museum in their name, colonists let Green know that their wife Thea, a human rebel, is planning to assassinate them at the museum's opening. Green's AI companion, Alice, in the meantime, encounters a technological anomaly, and becomes sentient, which terrifies them The voice at this point begins to caution Green of exploring more realities, implying that venturing deeper may cause them to lose grip on their reality, but Green does so anyway.
The final reality Green finds is a scattered chaotic mash of the previous three realities; the voice at this point actively dissuades Green from venturing further, and there's a faint background sound of paramedics trying to revive a man - it is implied that Green is in fact encountering a drug-related emergency in the real world. Once Green reaches the top of the chaotic world and finds a giant Theta sigil, they appear in a dark void with a single desk and a typewriter. They then awakens in their original apartment and experiences another seizure, as they sit down in front of the static on the television again.
Development
Californium was borne out of an idea between the development teams Darjeeling and Nova Productions in 2011 as the 30th anniversary of Dick's death was approaching. Darjeeling digital producer Noam Roubah noted that many of the themes that Dick had written about have since come to pass in the 21st century, such as the Internet and the dehumanization of human communications. The developers initially thought of doing a web-based project but within a few months opted to use a video game for this work. The teams brought artist Olivier Bonhomme to create surreal environments to reflect a more psychedelic feel, acknowledging the influence of recreational drugs in Dick's life, rather than the darker tones used in other adoptions of Dick's works. The developers took inspiration from Dick's earlier years in crafting Green; the departure of Green's wife and their dismissive editor are similar concepts Dick had to face early on.
The gameplay's central concept, of discovering the Theta glyph to change reality, was inspired by autobiographic material Dick wrote on coming to an epiphany in 1974 on seeing a woman wearing an ichthys symbol, which caused them to have a vision of a "pink beam" that would impart wisdom and insight to those it touched. The impact in the game comes from another of Dick's essays, "If You Find This World Bad, You Should See Some of the Others", in which Dick considers that many alternate realities are occurring simultaneously with the current one, and may come to see those though the subconscious. Journalists from Ars Technica and Motherboard have noted the game shares many similarities with Dick's 1981 VALIS, the first of a planned trilogy, which presents a story in which human behavior is controlled by external intelligence.
The game was developed with financial support from the French broadcaster Arte, and was released to coincide with an Arte mini-series on the writer. Though the game was meant to be a tribute to Dick, the developers could not get appropriate rights from Dick's estate to use their name in any of the promotional materials for the title.
Reception
Wireds Julie Muncy wrote that while Californias mechanic of finding the hidden glyphs may become tedious, the game performed well as a "deep dive" in the ideas Philip K. Dick wrote about. Daniel Oberhaus for Motherboard similarly found the gameplay overly repetitive and felt because the developers could not attach Dick's name to the game, the game's connection to the author was weak, using only the more obscure biographical facts about Dick's life to make the association. Oberhaus though praised the game's visuals and attention to era-specific details. Martin Robinson of Eurogamer similarly found the details relating to Dick and their writings to be well done, but the central gameplay mechanic of finding the hidden glyphs become frustrating as there seemed to be no logic into how to reveal some of the glyphs. Rock Paper Shotguns John Walker commented that the approach of showing the bubbles of alternate realities was "extraordinary as a piece of level design", while some of the attempts at meta-fictional narration had been better accomplished in The Stanley Parable.

In nanotechnology, nanorods are one morphology of nanoscale objects. Each of their dimensions range from 1–100 nm. They may be synthesized from metals or semiconducting materials. Standard aspect ratios (length divided by width) are 3-5. Nanorods are produced by direct chemical synthesis. A combination of ligands act as shape control agents and bond to different facets of the nanorod with different strengths. This allows different faces of the nanorod to grow at different rates, producing an elongated object.
One potential application of nanorods is in display technologies, because the reflectivity of the rods can be changed by changing their orientation with an applied electric field. Another application is for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Nanorods, along with other noble metal nanoparticles, also function as theragnostic agents. Nanorods absorb in the near IR, and generate heat when excited with IR light. This property has led to the use of nanorods as cancer therapeutics. Nanorods can be conjugated with tumor targeting motifs and ingested. When a patient is exposed to IR light (which passes through body tissue), nanorods selectively taken up by tumor cells are locally heated, destroying only the cancerous tissue while leaving healthy cells intact.
Nanorods based on semiconducting materials have also been investigated for application as energy harvesting and light emitting devices. In 2006, Ramanathan et al. demonstrated1 electric-field mediated tunable photoluminescence from ZnO nanorods, with potential for application as novel sources of near-ultraviolet radiation.
Synthesis
ZnO nanorods
Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod, also known as nanowire, has a direct bandgap energy of 3.37 eV, which is similar to that of GaN, and it has an excitation binding energy of 60 meV. The optical bandgap of ZnO nanorod can be tuned by changing the morphology, composition, size etc. Recent years, ZnO nanorods have been intensely used to fabricate nano-scale electronic devices, including field effect transistor, ultraviolet photodetector, Schottky diode, and ultra-bright light-emitting diode (LED). Various methods have been developed to fabricate the single crystalline, wurtzite ZnO nanorods. Among those methods, growing from vapor phase is the most developed approach. In a typical growth process, ZnO vapor is condensed onto a solid substrate. ZnO vapor can be generated by three methods: thermal evaporation, chemical reduction, and Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS) method. In the thermal evaporation method, commercial ZnO powder is mixed with SnO2 and evaporated by heating the mixture at elevated temperature. In the chemical reduction method, zinc vapor, generated by the reduction of ZnO, is transferred to the growth zone, followed by reoxidation to ZnO. The VLS process, originally proposed in 1964, is the most commonly used process to synthesize single crystalline ZnO nanorods. In a typical process, catalytic droplets are deposited on the substrate and the gas mixtures, including Zn vapor and a mixture of CO/CO2, react at the catalyst-substrate interface, followed by nucleation and growth. Typical metal catalysts involve gold, copper, nickel, and tin. ZnO nanowires are grown epitaxially on the substrate and assemble into monolayer arrays. Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) has also been recently developed. No catalyst is involved in this process and the growth temperature is at 400 ~500 °C, i.e. considerably milder conditions compared to the traditional vapor growth method. Moreover, metal oxide nanorods (ZnO, CuO, Fe2O3, V2O5, others) can be simply made by heating initial metal in air in a thermal oxidation process. For example, to make a dense "carpet" of CuO nanorods it was found to be enough to heat Cu foil in air at 420 °C. Apart from these manufacturing schemes, ZnO nanorods and tubes can be fabricated by the combination of deep UV lithography, dry etch, and atomic layer deposition (ALD).
InGaN/GaN nanorods
InGaN/GaN nanorod array light-emitting diodes can be manufactured with dry etching or focused ion beam etching techniques. Such LEDs emit polarized blue or green light Three-dimensional nanorod structures have a larger emitting surface, which results in better efficiency and light emission compared to planar LEDs.
Ink-printed quantum dot nanorod LED (QNED) displays are being researched by Samsung, with InGaN nanorod LEDs replacing the organic OLED layer in QD-OLED displays.
Gold nanorods
The seed-mediated growth method is the most common and achieved method for synthesizing high-quality gold nanorods. A typical growth protocol involves the addition of citrate-capped gold nanospheres, served as seeds, to the bulk HAuCl4 growth solution. The growth solution is obtained by the reduction of HAuCl4 with ascorbic acid in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant and silver ions. Longer nanorods (up to an aspect ratio of 25) can be obtained in the absence of silver nitrate by use of a three-step addition procedure. In this protocol, seeds are sequentially added to growth solution in order to control the rate of heterogeneous deposition and thereby the rate of crystal growth.
The shortcoming of this method is the formation of gold nanospheres, which requires non-trivial separations and cleanings. In one modification of this method sodium citrate is replaced with a stronger CTAB stabilizer in the nucleation and growth procedures. Another improvement is to introduce silver ions to the growth solution, which results in the nanorods of aspect ratios less than five in greater than 90% yield. Silver, of a lower reduction potential than gold, can be reduced on the surface of the rods to form a monolayer by underpotential deposition. Here, silver deposition competes with that of gold, thereby retarding the growth rate of specific crystal facets, allowing for one-directional growth and rod formation. Another shortcoming of this method is the high toxicity of CTAB. Polymers, such as Polyethylene glycol (PEG), Polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) coating; dietary fibers, such as chitosan; or biomolecules, such as phospholipids have been used to displace the CTAB out from the nanorod surface without affecting the stability has been reported.
Cation exchange
Cation exchange is a conventional but promising technique for new nanorod synthesis. Cation exchange transformations in nanorods are kinetically favorable and often shape-conserving. Compared to bulk crystal systems, the cation exchange of nanorods is million-times faster due to high surface area. Existing nanorods serve as templates to make a variety of nanorods that are not accessible in traditional wet-chemical synthesis. Furthermore, complexity can be added by partial transformation, making nanorod heterostructures.

Frenier is a ghost town in St. John the Baptist Parish, in the U.S. state of Louisiana. The community is located less than northeast of Laplace and north of Montz.
Schlösser
The community of Frenier was once known as Schlösser. Named after Martin Schlösser, an early German immigrant. Martin and their brother Adam began clearing out the forests and harvesting the local timber. Over the years more German settlers arrived and the village of Schlösser grew to over twenty-five families. With fierce competition in the timber industry the Schlösser brothers quit the business and converted to farming. Cabbage grew very well in the Louisiana soil and the brothers began exporting sauerkraut to New Orleans. Then in 1854 the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad built a line through the area. During this time the fare for a train ride was only three cents per mile. Sauerkraut was exported up to Chicago, Illinois. Because the rail service to Chicago was only 40 hours, the sauerkraut export became very lucrative. For several decades the export of Frenier sauerkraut to the French Market and Chicago served as the main source of income for these families.
Destruction
On September 29, 1915, the New Orleans Hurricane of 1915 destroyed the community of Frenier. Some of the locals sought refuge in the railroad depot, which collapsed during the hurricane and killed the 25 people hiding inside. In the aftermath it was determined that the hurricane killed 275 people and caused an estimated dollar in damage.
Legend of Julia Brown
Some of the surviving locals began telling stories of a voodoo priestess named Julia Brown that predicted the event. According to local historians the town of Frenier had no doctors and Julia Brown likely served as the local healer. A few months before they died they began repeating the phrase "One day I'm gonna die, and I'm gonna take all of you with me".
Survivors said that a few weeks before the hurricane arrived they began sitting on their front porch rocking back and forth while playing their guitar and singing:
According to the legend on September 29, 1915, Julia Brown died and most of the population gathered to bury the voodoo priestess. During the funeral at around four o'clock the hurricane arrived and completely destroyed the town.

Nightmare in the Daylight is a 1992 American made-for-television thriller film directed by Lou Antonio, starring Jaclyn Smith and Christopher Reeve. It premiered on CBS on November 22, 1992.
Plot
Sean Farrell (Reeve) is a lawyer working in San Francisco, who in the past beat their long-lost wife, Jean, who disappeared in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. One day, they notice Megan Lambert (Smith), a Wisconsin teacher visiting the city with their husband Peter (Mason) and son Jamie (Bell). They grow convinced that Megan is their wife, and ignores any denials they are making. After kidnapping them for a short period of time, they contact their first wife's father, who tells Sean that Megan is not their daughter. Sean, by now, is too obsessed with Megan though, resulting in the woman and their family living in constant fear.

Production
The film was shot in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Reception
Variety wrote of the film: "The game-playing limps on, with Smith distressed and Reeve looking severe as though they'd both just read the script. Smith and Mason play well through some good naturalistic domestic scenes, but that doesn't much help the cause. By the end of the caper, Nightmare in the Daylight affirms the purposelessness of the venture. Tech credits are swell, with Michael Paul Clausen's production design a plus."

Long Island, New York is not known for having many tall buildings. As a suburban region, residents and local governments have generally opposed proposals to construct tall buildings, to distinguish it from neighboring Queens and Brooklyn, which are geographically part of Long Island but are part of New York City. Most of the tallest buildings were constructed by government entities, who are exempt from local zoning regulations.
Long Island has one building taller than , the Stony Brook University Hospital tower, and at least four other buildings taller than 200 feet, including Nassau University Medical Center and the Alfonse M. D'Amato United States Courthouse. Long Island has no cluster of high-rises dense enough to create an urban landscape, although there are regions with a larger number of scattered high-rises. A number of non-building structures are also prominent, such as the stacks of the Northport Power Station.
This article covers buildings in Nassau County and Suffolk County. Buildings in Queens and in Brooklyn are listed in their own articles, as the New York City boroughs are conventionally excluded from cultural definitions of Long Island.
Overview
Long Island has few tall buildings, in contrast to neighboring New York City. Long Island's identity as the birthplace of suburbia involves a desire to maintain the opposite of an urban landscape, with a flat landscape where high-rises are seen to be eyesores that clash with their surroundings, and even three-story buildings can provoke opposition. This has been characterized as a desire to prevent Long Island from being "Queensified", referring to the neighboring New York City borough. The North Shore Towers complex of three 32-story apartment buildings, immediately over the border from Nassau County in Queens, has been often cited as the kind of development Long Islanders seek to avoid.
It has been noted that since most buildings are lower than the trees, views from the few tall buildings consists almost of treetops punctuated by water towers. The buildings themselves are generally regarded as being architecturally undistinguished.
As of 1974, there were 107 municipal zoning codes on Long Island, most of which limited buildings to four stories; in 2016 there were 175 zoning and building districts, stymieing the construction of tall buildings. Most tall buildings on Long Island have been built by the state or county rather than private developers, as they are exempt from these local codes. The opposition to high-rises also had a racial element, being stereotypically associated with minority residents.
Patterns of development
While Long Island has no cluster of high-rises dense enough to create an urban landscape, there are regions with a larger number of scattered high-rises. One is the region in and around northern Uniondale in central Nassau County, including Hofstra University's library and six dormitory buildings, Nassau University Medical Center, Nassau Community College, four office buildings, and a hotel. Another cluster of mid-rise apartment buildings is along the waterfront in Long Beach.
A handful of tall buildings are part of former state psychiatric institutions scattered around Suffolk County, including Edgewood State Hospital (now demolished), Kings Park Psychiatric Center, and Pilgrim Psychiatric Center.
Long Island also has several non-building structures, including broadcast antennas, smokestacks, and water towers. The most prominent of these are the four 620-foot stacks of the Northport Power Station, and other power plants constructed by the Long Island Lighting Company.
History
In the mid 20th century, Democrats generally favored more high-rises, while Republicans opposed them. In the late 2000s, the Lighthouse Project proposal to construct a 60-story tower, later changed to two 30-story towers, near Nassau Coliseum was vigorously opposed.
The 21st century saw the beginning of a movement in certain regions towards transit-oriented development around Long Island Rail Road stations, with 11,000 housing units approved in the nine years preceding 2016. The villages of Hempstead and Mineola were seen as being particularly receptive to taller residential buildings, along with Great Neck Plaza, Glen Cove, Long Beach, Farmingdale, Ronkonkoma, Riverhead, and Riverside. On the other hand, the proposed Nassau Hub development surrounding Nassau Coliseum is envisioned as a "walkable, engaging suburban downtown" with no buildings over 100 feet. Increasing the number of rental units, which are rare in the region, was seen as important to attracting young adults and thus employers, as well as retaining older residents who might otherwise relocate to Florida.

Söngvakeppnin (known from 1986–1989 as Söngvakeppni sjónvarpsstöðva and in 1981, 1983 and 1990–2012 as Söngvakeppni sjónvarpsins, literally "The Television's Song Contest") is an annual music competition organised by Icelandic public broadcaster Ríkisútvarpið (RÚV). It determines the for the Eurovision Song Contest.
Format
The contest was first organised in 1981, although neither it nor its subsequent 1983 edition were used to determine any Eurovision Song Contest representatives until Iceland made its ESC debut in 1986. Since then, RÚV has used Söngvakeppni sjónvarpsins to select the Icelandic entry, but has also used an internal selection at times, between 1995 and 1999 and in 2004, 2005 and 2021.
Söngvakeppni sjónvarpsins has consisted of a multi-artist competition, with between 5 and 10 songs competing. Most contests in the past have been a one-night event, however since 2006 the contest has consisted of a number of semi-finals aired before a grand final.
It was known for RÚV to change the performers for Eurovision. This can be seen in 1986, when winner Pálmi Gunnarsson was joined by Eiríkur Hauksson and Helga Möller to form ICY for Eurovision. In 1994 RÚV were not happy with the winning song, and so enlisted Frank McNamara to rearrange the entry and select a new singer.
Songs in Söngvakeppni sjónvarpsins were once only allowed to be performed in Icelandic. However winning songs were normally translated into English for Eurovision. This rule was abolished in 2008, when English language songs were allowed to compete for the first time.
Winners
The first 33 winners of Söngvakeppnin have gone on to represent Iceland at the Eurovision Song Contest. Iceland has never won the contest (the only Nordic country never to do so), but they have come second twice: in 1999 (when an internal selection was used), losing to Sweden, and in 2009, when they lost to Norway.
2020 was the first time in history where the winner of the contest, in this case Daði og Gagnamagnið, did not advance to Eurovision, as the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, RÚV internally re-selected Daði og Gagnamagnið to represent the country at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, with the song also chosen internally.
The following table lists entries which finished fifth or higher at Eurovision:

Periodic elections for the Tasmanian Legislative Council were held on 3 May 2014. The two seats up for election were the electoral division of Huon and the electoral division of Rosevears. These seats were last contested in 2008.
Huon
Independent MLC Paul Harriss held Huon from 1996. In 2014, Harriss resigned from the Legislative Council to successfully contest the Tasmanian House of Assembly seat of Franklin as a Liberal candidate at the 2014 state election. The favourite prior to the election was Peter Hodgman, the uncle of Premier Will Hodgman who had previously held the seat as an independent from 1974 to 1986 before serving in the House of Assembly as a Liberal from 1986 to 2001. Hodgman was running as a Liberal candidate. Their highest profile opponent was Huon Valley Mayor Robert Armstrong, running as an independent. Other candidates included Liz Smith, a Huon Valley councillor who resigned from the Greens to run as an independent; Jimmy Bell, the manager of the Huon Valley Police and Citizens Youth Club; Rodney Dillon, an Amnesty International worker who was the 2013 Tasmanian Humanitarian of the Year; Pavel Ruzicka, a sawmiller; and Helen Lane.
The results are final.
Rosevears
Independent MLC Kerry Finch has represented Rosevears since 2002. They re-contested the seat. The Liberal Party endorsed Don Morris, a long-time political staffer and former Senate candidate, in a break from their tradition of not challenging sitting independents. The Liberal Party targeted Finch as a "closet Green" regarding their left-leaning voting record. No other candidates nominated.
These results are final.

Bitter Sweet is the debut extended play by Nigerian singer-songwriter Majeeed. It was released on 25 March 2022 by Dream Empire Music, through Dvpper Music. Bitter Sweet is built around the early life of a Nigerian teen, transiting into an early adult. The album is a mixture of Afrofusion, and Afropop, with R&B, and Soul percussive rhythms. It was produced primarily by Majeeed, along with production from Dalor Beats, Poposky Beats, Shugavybz, BlaiseBeatz, and Mr Kleb. The EP received favorable reviews from critics.
Lyrically, Bitter Sweet communicate, with elements that associate with love, and romance, including unrequited love, toxic affair, and adulthood pressure. Its lead singles include, "Time" released in 2021, and produced by Majeeed, and "Yawa No Dey End" released in 2022, and produced by Shugabeatz. The song was later supported with a new version with Joeboy, which peaked at number 41, on Nigeria TurnTable Top 50 chart. On 26 March 2022, the extended play peaked at number 8, on Nigeria Apple Music Top Album chart.
Background
On 19 February 2021, Majeeed released "Time", a song they produced at Harrysong house. 6 months after, they secured a record deal with Dream Empire Music in August, and began working on their debut ep. On 25 February 2022, they released "Yawa No Dey End", a song produced by Shugabeatz. With an accompanying music video directed by Kemz. They tell BellaNaija that "he makes music that heals and tells stories that give a connection to nature, on how to feel and how the world really works." They further tell Chinonso Ihekire, a music editor for the Guardian Life Magazine, that "it is a true-life story. It is my reality and the same with most people. Bittersweet is more than just a project to me; it is a compilation of all my relationship problems."
Composition
The EP opening track "How I Care" describes their feelings, and tells us how they feel about them In "No Room For Love", Majeeed has fallen for a girl and tells them to be plain with their feelings towards him, besides being found in a toxic romance, they also don't seem to understand them and their circumstances fully. With a voice sample that reads (“one simple bag for a baby girl”) and Majeeed replies (“a baby girl needs love”). In "Yawa No Dey End ", the project lead single boasts all of Majeeed's trademark. They casually sing about what might kill him, like their responsibilities as a provider in a struggling economy, and their mother's financial needs. In "Tough Love" you can see how they process their partner's behavior and seeks an effortless type of Love. Between "Smile For Me", and "Time", with the help of their lady before the record fades. Majeeed, we know you're trying to hold on, and dealing with a woman who doesn't feel like she's getting what they deserve isn't always easy.

Christopher Basstian (1820–1895) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament from Southland, New Zealand.
They represented the Wallace electorate in , from 6 August to 6 December. One newspaper said before the by-election Mr Basstian's strong squatting proclivities ought certainly to prevent them getting the support of the "bona fide" settlers of the district and those who have any regard for its future prosperity (so preferred Dr Monckton). Another report said that they pronounce in favour of abolition (of the provinces) and is otherwise moderate in politics.
They were defeated in the 1875 general election, held in December.

2-Heptanone, also known as methyl n-amyl ketone, or Heptan-2-one, is a ketone with the molecular formula C7H14O. It is a colorless, water-like liquid with a banana-like, fruity odor. 2-Heptanone has a neutral formal charge, and is only slightly soluble in water.
2-Heptanone is listed by the FDA as a "food additive permitted for direct addition to food for human consumption" (21 CFR 172.515), and it occurs naturally in certain foods (e.g., beer, white bread, butter, various cheeses and potato chips).
The mechanism of action of 2-heptanone as a pheromone at odorant receptors in rodents has been investigated. 2-Heptanone is present in the urine of stressed rats and believe that it is used as a means to alert other rats. Certain species of worms are attracted to 2-heptanone and bacteria can use this as a means of pathogenesis. 2-Heptanone has also been found to be excreted by honey bees when they bite small pests within the colony such as wax moth larvae and Varroa mites. Though it was historically believed to be an alarm pheromone, 2-heptanone has been shown to act as an anaesthetic on the pests, enabling the honey bee to stun the pest and eject it from the hive. The work could lead to the use of 2-heptanone as an alternative local anaesthetic to lidocaine, which although well established for clinical use, has the disadvantage of provoking allergic reactions in some people.
2-Heptanone was one of the metabolites of n-heptane found in the urine of employees exposed to heptane in shoe and tire factories. This commonly occurs from exposure to plasticisers. 2-Heptanone can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled and consumed. Exposure to 2-Heptanone can cause irritation of skin/eyes, respiratory system, headaches, vomiting, and nausea.
In mice 2-H is a urinary component and pheromone. It has a high affinity for the main olfactory epithelium. Gaillard et al 2002 found that it agonizes one specific olfactory receptor, and that that OR only binds 2-H.

Illang: The Wolf Brigade (; also known as Inrang) is a 2018 South Korean science fiction action film directed by Kim Jee-woon and starring Gang Dong-won, Han Hyo-joo, Jung Woo-sung and Kim Mu-yeol. It is a live-action adaptation of the Japanese animated film Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade.
The film is set in 2029 where South and North Korea prepare for a unified government after a severe economic depression slams both countries. South Korean police launches a special unit, known as "Illang" (The Wolf Brigade), in response to the rise of an anti-reunification domestic insurgency called "The Sect".
The film was released on July 25, 2018. Distributed by Warner Bros. Korea, the film had cost 19 billion won () to produce. It received mixed reviews and under-performed at the domestic box office, selling around 897,000 tickets against its break-even point of six million tickets. The film competed in the San Sebastián International Film Festival for the Golden Shell, becoming the second South Korean film to do so.
Synopsis
In 2024, when "political order in the Korean peninsula is shaken," following territorial disputes between China, Japan, and South Korea. The events prompt Japan to remilitarize, and the U.S. and Russia to ramp up military interests in the area. Fearing the possibility of war, North Korea and South Korea agree to re-unify for the sake of survival, with a five year interim put in place as preparation for the reunification. This generates significant backlash from the region's powers (the U.S, Russia, China, and Japan) who oppose reunification.
Significant tariffs are imposed upon both countries, creating an economic depression for both, and weakening public support for reunification. The unrest generated by the political tension in Asia, economic depression, and opposition to reunification results in a domestic terror group known as "The Sect" to form. The Korean police forces quickly become overwhelmed with the size and violence of protests in the regions, prompting the government to create a new, elite police force called the "Special Unit." The unit is characterized by their futuristic military gear, and respirators containing glowing red lights. A year after the formation of the Special Unit, an incident known as "Bloody Friday" occurs, in which the special unit mistakenly fires upon young girls in a suspected Sect compound. After the event, significant opposition to the Special Unit forces the group to utilize their iconic gas masks, to hide their identity as well as provide use in case of bio-hazardous threats.

Production
The film was financed by Union Investment Partners, with production being announced in 2013. Filming began on August 16, 2017 in Studio Cube, a South Korean filming complex, and completed on March 23, 2018.
Costumes for the film were designed by Hollywood artist Vanessa Lee, who also worked on the special effects costume for the 2006 film Underworld: Evolution and superhero costumes in the Avengers film series.
Webtoon writer Yoon Tae-ho penned a prequel titled Illang: Prequel, which took place five years before the events of the film. It was developed by Kakao Pages and Daum Webtoon and was released on June 27, 2018, beginning a weekly run of chapters that led up to the film's release on July 25.
Release
Illang: The Wolf Brigade was released in South Korea on July 25, 2018. Netflix acquired the international distribution rights of the film.
The film was selected to compete at the 66th San Sebastián International Film Festival, which was held from September 21–29, 2018. It was Kim Jee-woon's second film to compete at the festival after I Saw the Devil in 2010. Kim and lead actor Gang Dong-won were set to attend the event.
A red carpet and showcase event for the film was held on July 18, 2018 at Times Square Mall in Yeongdeungpo-gu with the attendance of the director and cast.
Reception
Critical response
Mamoru Oshii, the writer of the novel which the film is based on, attended a special screening and commented, "I think this is a powerful movie that provokes lots of thought ... The balance between the realistic locations and the futuristic technologies like iron armor and diverse guns was very impressive."
As per Yonhap review, the film "spent so much time trying to recreate the world from the animated movie and remakes it into a big-scale action blockbuster that it never got the simple things right... the film falls short of properly delivering the intense inner conflict felt by Joong-kyung."
Jason Bechervaise from Screendaily wrote that the film "contains moments of stylistic brilliance through some compelling set-pieces. Yet moving the story from Japan to a Korean peninsula which is on the point of reunifying in 2029 results in a film which is both over-plotted and melodramatic."
Box office
On the first day of its release, the film attracted 274,525 admissions. After five days of release, Illang: The Wolf Brigade earned a total of .
The film was made on a budget and targeted to attract around 6 million moviegoers. However, due to negative reviews from both critics and audience members, the film screened for only three weeks, and ended up attracting a total of 897,254 moviegoers, grossing . The number of South Korean film admissions in July 2018 dropped by 21.4% from 2017, to 5.39 million, due to the sluggishness of this film and the absence of intermediate films to replace it. The number of South Korean film admissions in July 2018 was the lowest since 2008.

William Fisk (1796–1872) was an English portrait and history painter.
Life
They were born at Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex, the son of a yeoman farmer at Can Hall. Their father sent them to school at Colchester, and at nineteen years of age placed them in a mercantile house in London. There they remained for ten years. They married about 1826, and after the birth of their eldest son they devoted themselves seriously to art as a profession.
Between 1835 and 1848 they lived in Howland Street, off Tottenham Court Road, in London. They eventually retired to some property at Danbury in Essex, where they died on 8 November 1872.
Works
In 1818 Fisk sent to the Royal Academy a portrait of Mr. G. Fisk, and in 1819 a portrait of a Child and Favourite Dog. In 1829 they sent to the Royal Academy a portrait of William Redmore Bigg, R. A., and continued to exhibit portraits there for a few years. At the British Institution they exhibited in 1830 The Widow, and in 1832 Puck.
From about 1834 Fisk took to painting the large historical compositions, for which they became best known. They took care to obtain contemporary portraits and authorities for costume, which they faithfully reproduced on their canvases. Some of them were engraved, and were popular. They comprised Lady Jane Grey, when in confinement in the Tower, visited by Feckenhain (British Institution, 1834); The Coronation of Robert Bruce (Royal Academy, 1836); La Journée des Dupes (Royal Academy, 1837); Leonardo da Vinci expiring in the arms of Francis I (Royal Academy, 1838); The Chancellor Wriothesley approaching to apprehend Katherine Parr on a charge of heresy, and Mary, widow of Louis XII of France, receiving Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, ambassador from Henry VIII (British Institution, 1838); The Queen Mother, Marie de' Medici, demanding the dismissal of Cardinal Richelieu (British Institution, 1839); The Conspiracy of the Pazzi, or the attempt to assassinate Lorenzo de' Medici (Royal Academy, 1839), which was awarded the gold medal of the Manchester Institution for the best historical picture exhibited in their gallery in 1840.
About 1840 Fisk started a series of pictures connected with the reign of Charles I, namely, Cromwell's Family interceding for the life of Charles I (Royal Academy, 1840); The Trial of the Earl of Strafford (never exhibited, engraved by James Scott in 1841, and acquired for the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool); The Trial of Charles I in Westminster Hall (Royal Academy, 1842); Charles I passing through the banqueting-house, Whitehall, to the Scaffold (Royal Academy, 1843); The last interview of Charles I with their Children (British Institution, 1844). They were also a frequent contributor to the Suffolk Street exhibition.
Their obituary in the Art Journal said that "if Mr. Fisk's works may not be classed in a high rank of historical painting, they are the most creditable examples — well composed, careful in execution, and accurate in costumes and accessories."

Nonferrous archaeometallurgy in the southern Levant is the archaeological study of non-iron-related metal technology in the region of the Southern Levant during the Chalcolithic period and Bronze Age from approximately 4500BC to 1000BC.
Chalcolithic period
The first known use of metals in the Southern Levant is during the Chalcolithic period (end of 5th–most of the 4th millennium BCE). More than 500 metal objects were found, mainly in hoards, burials, and habitation
remains. Most of the metals originate from sites in the southern part of Israel and Jordan; very rarely do they occur beyond the center of Israel and north of Wadi Qana. The metal findings from this period were separated into three groups; most of them belong to the following first two groups:
Prestige/cult-elaborated and complex-shaped objects made of copper (Cu) alloyed (a deliberate
choice of complex minerals that could be reduced to a mixture of metals with specific recognizable
and desirable properties, totally different from unalloyed copper) with distinct amounts of antimony
(Sb) or nickel (Ni) and arsenic (As). They were cast using a “lost wax” technique into single closed clay moulds and then polished into their final shining gray or gold-like colors depending on the amount of antimony or nickel and arsenic in the copper. The Nahal Mishmar hoard was the biggest hoard (416 metal objects comprising mainly artistically complex-shaped objects), found hidden in a cave by Nahal Mishmar, Judean Desert, Israel.
They were wrapped in a straw mat (e.g., Shalev; Tadmor). Carbon-14 dating of the reed mat in which the objects were wrapped suggests that it dates to at least 3500 B.C.
The origin of the complex source material for the production of these objects is currently unknown. The nearest suitable ore is in Trans-Caucasus and Azerbaijan — more than 1500 km from the finding sites of the objects. Some clay and stone cores and clay
mould remains were petrographically analyzed and the results point to a possible local
production in the area of the Judean Desert, within the metals distribution zone in Israel, which is concentrated mainly in the southern part of the country: between Giv'at Oranit and Wadi Qana (east of
modern Tel Aviv) in the north and the Be'er Sheva valley sites in the south. Currently, no production
remains or production sites of these prestige/cult objects were found.
Unalloyed copper tools comprising mainly relatively thick- and short-bladed objects (axes, adzes,
and chisels) and points (awls and/or drills) made from a smelted copper ore, cast into an open mould and then hammered and annealed into their final shape. The copper tools were produced in the Chalcolithic villages on the banks of the Be'er Sheva valley where slag fragments, clay crucibles, some possible furnace lining pieces, copper prills, and amorphous lumps were found, in addition to high-grade carbonated copper ore (cuprite). The ore was collected and selected in the area of Feinan in Trans-Jordan and transported to northern Negev villages some 150 km to the north, to be smelted for the local production of these copper objects.
A third group of eight gold (Au) and electrum (Au + up to 30% Ag) solid rings was found in Wadi Qanah cave.
This unique find, with no dated parallels, is attributed by the excavators to the Chalcolithic period based on local stratigraphic and geological evidence and 14C dating of ground samples from the vicinity of the finds in the cave. Surface analyses of these objects revealed a surface
gold enrichment caused by the depletion of silver and the copper traces. This effect could be caused naturally by deposition but could have been achieved intentionally at the time of production in
order to achieve a yellow color for the electrum rings rich in silver, as well. During the Chalcolithic
(copper and stone) era at least two, if not three distinct industries of different metals were operating
and their products were found in the Southern Levant.
Early Bronze Age
During the next thousand years of the Early Bronze Age (end of 4th–end of 3rd millennium BCE) the same unalloyed copper production of the Chalcolithic (group 2, above) continued for the production of short blades and points. The same metal technique was used for the novel production of long blade weapons
(riveted daggers and knives, heavy tanged swords, and epsilon-shaped axes). The same copper production
technique of casting into an open mould and then hammering and annealing, was used to produce all other
metals as well, including jewelry of thin plates, sometimes decorated, and elongated thin wires (mainly for rings and bracelets) made of unalloyed copper as well as from silver (first appearance) and gold.
Archaeological remains of Early Bronze copper mining and copper smelting in the vicinity of the
mines were found in Trans-Jordan (Feinan), the Arava Valley (Timnah), and southern Sinai. The only production remains of metal are those of copper and include copper slag, prills, and amorphous copper lumps and small shallow ball-shaped clay crucibles with a socket. In the Early Bronze I site of the Ashkelon Marina, in the southern part of the Israeli coast, small shallow open pits, probably for the melting of copper in a crucible, were found next to copper industrial remains.
All pits showed a similar structure of a red soil burnt layer covered within by a white thin layer of calcite. No archaeological material was found associated with these human-made rudimentary remains. In the vicinity, and detached from the installations, scattered remains of pottery sherds, bone fragments, copper slag remains, and some pieces of clay crucibles were found. They were dated to Early Bronze Age I. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of the fill of the pits and thermoluminescence (TL) ages of quartz grains extracted from the hardened red layer of the pits showed that the last burning activity was conducted during the same period: 5260 ± 380 years ago (OSL) and 5180 ± 380 years ago (TL).
Most of the metal products are found in burials, and are mainly from the Early Bronze I. The same types of metals continue in sites and tombs throughout the entire Early Bronze and all over the local distribution map of Early Bronze sites in Israel, from the Upper Galilee in the north to Ein Besor and Malhata in the northern Negev. A single hoard of copper objects probably from the Early Bronze I was found with no related archaeological context in the
fields of Kfar Monash.
During the Early Bronze period the Southern Levant's metal industry became more specialized and organized in separated places for the different parts of production, and the products became more homogenous, as did the different materials and modes of production. For the first time in the Southern Levant's metal history, significant typological and technological affiliations to the growing metal industries in the two major imperial centers (Egypt and Mesopotamia) on both sides of the “Fertile Crescent” were visible. During all the Early Bronze Age there is no archaeometallurgical evidence for bronze production and no bronze objects were found during this period in the Southern Levant as opposed to unalloyed copper.
Middle Bronze Age
In the Middle Bronze (MB) Age (end of 3rd–middle of 2nd millennium BCE) hundreds of metal objects were found. The development of more complex weapons (longer daggers, swords, complex battle axes, etc.) was possible by alloying the copper with arsenic or with tin. All the MBII weapons that were analyzed were made of copper alloyed either with tin (14%–2% Sn) or with arsenic (4.3%–0.5% As), sometimes with a mixture of both usually in low concentrations. These changes in the metal properties of weapons are also reflected in the composition of small objects, like toggle pins that were probably made mainly from re-melting of scrap. Lead (Pb) started to play a greater role as a major alloy for thick casts of copper-based objects, mainly of battle axes during this period.
Although two definite major alloying compositions for the production of MBII copper-based artifacts, (1)copper with arsenic and (2) copper with tin, are detected, to date no visible connection of specific alloy with specific type of object or different periods has been seen: both alloys appear in similar objects and in burials dated to the beginning as well as to later parts of the ca. 400 years of the MBII age. Currently, there is no visible correlation between any specific alloying tradition and the spatial distribution of finds, as well. Similar objects made of arsenical coppers and of tin bronze were found in the same geographic region and identical objects with similar metal composition were found in distant areas like Palestine and Upper Egypt. The difference in the overall alloying pattern curve in Jericho and in Tell El-Dab'a shown by Philip (1995) does not necessarily have to be related to two different production centers, but could as well be the result of comparing different groups of objects (i.e., more prestigious weapons of control alloying either with tin or with arsenic) at Tell El Dab'a and similar objects mixed with simpler copper-based ones (like simple daggers, knives, toggle pins, etc.) in Jericho and/or types like the spearheads that have more mixed, low levels of both alloys.
The examination of metal composition in the formation of different types does add knowledge concerning production modes. The thicker the object is, the more lead was
deliberately added to the cast. The highest amounts of lead were measured in the duckbill axes, less in the flat socketed axes, and much less in thinner blades like spears and daggers, which were much more worked and annealed after being cast. This observation corresponds well with the controlled alloying of the duckbill axes and ribbed daggers (with much less lead in the latter) from the MBIIa, but does not correspond with the spears. Although they are derived mainly from MBIIa contexts, their composition is less controlled and more varied. There might be a connection between the level of allowing control and the investment in the cast — the more complex types, like duckbill and flat socketed axes and ribbed daggers, are usually cast in steatite, two-piece closed and well-carved moulds.
On the other hand, some of the less controlled alloyed types, like spearheads and knives as well as more simple tools such as chisel points, were mainly cast into open, relatively roughly carved limestone moulds.
Late Bronze Age
Hundreds of metal artefacts were found from the Late Bronze Age (second half of 2nd millennium BCE): ca.
200 blade weapons, 140 metal vessels, some working tools, small arrowheads, and decorative objects. All
the blades analyzed were made of tin bronze and most of all the other copper-based objects are either tin bronze alloy or have tin in their metal as impurity.
At this stage, large quantities of copper and tin ingots (i.e., 10 tons of Cu and 3 tons of Sn ingots in one cargo of Uluburun shipwreck from the 14th century BCE) were found all over the coasts of the Mediterranean and in several shipwrecks under the sea, mainly off the southern coast of Turkey. In Canaan at that time, Cypriot, Egyptian, Syrian, and Mesopotamian types of bronze objects were found, besides the local Canaanite metal collection. These were all basically made of tin bronze. The “prestige” objects like sickle blade swords or cast-hilt daggers were alloyed with highquality (11–13% by weight) Sn, whereas the simpler and probably less expensive objects had lower levels of tin in the metal.
Iron Age
Copper and copper-based metals continued to be the major metal in use during the first part of the Iron Age (end of 2nd–beginning of 1st millennium BCE). Bronze scrap re-melting continued (mainly v-shaped clay crucibles, slags, clay tuyères) and structures of open campfires full of metal production remains were found in several sites in Israel associated mainly with the Philistines and the Sea People settlements on the northern Sharon coast between modern Tel Aviv and Haifa, e.g., Tel Qasile, Tel Gerisa, Tel Dor, and Tel Dan, in northern Israel. Only later in the Iron Age did metallic iron start to play a major role as a base metal for tools and weapons.
XRF analyses of metals, metallurgical remains, and FTIR + XRF analyses of archaeological sediments
from the open industrial area G in Tel Dor enabled the identification of the exact locations of metal working during the end of the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age. It was also possible to partially reconstruct the pyrotechnological events that probably involved re-melting bronze in an open fireplace. Even after thousands of years the ash, charcoal, calcite, and burnt ground in the immediate vicinity of the metal work area retained significantly higher values of copper (circa 0.05 wt% Cu) than the surrounding archaeological layers.
During Iron Age II and III and the Persian Period (the first half of the first millennium BCE), copper-based objects continued to be present beside growing numbers of iron products. Silver hoards containing small tongueshaped bar chunks or scrapped jewellery became more and more common in the archaeological context in Israel as well as all over the Mediterranean. A similar phenomenon was evident during the Persian Period on the coast of Israel, where copper and copper-based objects were found in relatively large quantities and with parallels in other sites all around the Mediterranean Sea. What could be defined as a basic Phoenician metal “kit” is composed mainly of the “Irano–Scythian” shape of three winged and socketed arrowheads made mainly of tin bronze, sometimes with arsenic and/or lead and left as-cast, and “hand”-like decorated fibulae made of good quality (7 wt%–12 wt% Sn) tin bronze and lead (up to 17 wt% Pb). They underwent mechanical treatment after casting and an extensive final cold working in the area where the needle spring was fastened into the fibulae body. Long unalloyed copper nails that were found in coastal sites as well as part of the structure of ships were found in the shipwreck from Ma'agan Mikhael.

This announcement, based on three Nebraska statutes enacted in 1891 and 1947, is known as the "One City, One School District" plan.
This issue is highly controversial in Omaha. Supporters of the plan claim that a single school district is necessary to promote a cohesive Omaha community, ensure academic equity in all Omaha schools and prevent OPS from becoming locked into a declining property tax base. Opponents contend that Omaha-area residents should be able to choose from a number of school districts, and that the schools would become less efficient in one large school district. Discussions among the school districts have been unproductive; the issue figured prominently in the 2006 session of the Nebraska state legislature.
Split the District
The Nebraska legislature passed a bill (LB 1024) on April 13, 2006, that addresses the "One City, One School District" issues. The governor of Nebraska signed it later that day. It requires each metropolitan class city to have a "learning community" that consists of all of the school districts in the county where the city is located and any county that shares a border with the city. The learning community will be composed of voting representatives from each school district and will also include the superintendents of the districts as non-voting members. A learning community will be charged with helping to distribute property tax revenue more evenly throughout the school districts in its area.
In general, a learning community leaves the boundaries of school districts untouched. However, LB 1024 also calls for OPS to be broken into three separate school districts. The exact boundaries for three new Omaha school districts are to be chosen by the Omaha learning community. Their choices are limited by requirements of LB 1024 that each new district consist of contiguous high school attendance areas and include either two or three of the seven existing high schools. That allows about 20 ways to group the seven schools, depending on which adjacent high school attendance areas are grouped with the geographically most central area.
The three-district plan for OPS was proposed in amendment AM3142, introduced on the day the legislature first took up LB 1024. The suburban school districts reluctantly supported the three-district plan, seeing it as the most favorable to them of the bills proposed. The OPS leadership vehemently opposed the plan. AM3142 was approved on the day it was introduced by a counted vote of 33 to 6 with 10 senators not voting. Five days later a motion to reconsider AM3142 failed in a roll-call vote of 9 to 31 with 9 senators not voting. The roll call showed legislators from Omaha split six in favor of the three-district plan (Sens. Brashear, Brown, Chambers, Jensen, Pahls and Redfield) and five opposed (Sens. Bourne, Friend, Howard, Kruse and Synowiecki).
It is suspected that OPS may file a suit challenging the new law. On May 16, 2006, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed a suit against the governor and other Nebraska state officials charging that LB 1024, originally proposed by state senator Ernie Chambers, "intentionally furthers racial segregation." The NAACP lawsuit argues that because Omaha has racially segregated residential patterns, subdivided school districts will also be racially segregated, contrary to United States law.
According to April 2006, information published by Associated Press, the current Omaha public school district has approximately 45,000 students classified as 46 percent white, 31 percent black, 20 percent Hispanic, and 3 percent Asian or American Indian. News reports indicate that division of the city of Omaha into three new school districts, as ordered in April, 2006, by the Nebraska legislature and including current Elkhorn, Millard and Ralston public schools, is often expected to result in black students concentrated in a North Omaha district, white students in West Omaha district, and non-English speaking students in a South Omaha district. However, the law does not mandate such a result. Within its requirements, new districts may be drawn in several different ways.
LB 641, approved on May 7th, 2007, repealed the requirement that the Omaha Public Schools district be broken up into three districts.

NGC 5861 is an intermediate spiral galaxy in constellation Libra. It is located at a distance of circa 85 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 5861 is about 80,000 light years across.
The galaxy features two long spiral arms that dominate the optical disk. The one arm can be traced from its beginning at the center for nearly one and a half revolutions without branching, whereas the other starts to form fragments after one revolution, forming a moderately chaotic pattern. The galaxy hosts a hydroxyl megamaser.
Two supernovae have been observed in NGC 5861: SN 1971D and SN 2017erp. Observations by Hubble Space Telescope indicate that possibly there is a light echo created by SN 1971D.
NGC 5861 is the foremost member of a small galaxy group that also includes NGC 5858, which lies 9.6 arcmin north, forming a non-interactive pair. It is located within the same galaxy cloud with NGC 5878.

Imma dipselia is a moth in the family Immidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1906. It is found on the Sulu Archipelago in the southwestern Philippines.
The wingspan is about 26 mm. The forewings are fuscous, slightly ochreous tinged and with a whitish-ochreous somewhat irregular line from the middle of the costa to two-thirds of the dorsum, faintly bent in the disc. A whitish-ochreous waved line is found from the costa before the apex to the termen above the tornus, dilated on the costa. The hindwings have median and submedian grooves. They are dark fuscous, but lighter towards the base.

The O'Donoghue of the Glens (Irish: Ó Donnchadha na nGleann), Prince of Glenflesk, is the hereditary chieftain of their sept of the Kerry Eóganacht, Munster, Ireland. In 1944, their father was one of the few Chiefs of the Name recognized by Edward MacLysaght, the first Chief Herald, as having a verifiable pedigree and entitled to use the title and receive courtesy recognition by the Irish State.
Ancient heritage
The Eóganacht dynasties ruled the south of Ireland for 500 years or so till the end of the first millennium. According to the Irish origin myths, they descend from Eógan Mór II, son of Ailill Aulom, who was son of Mug Nuadat, (Eógan Mór I), who was supposed to have lived some time in the 2nd century. Over the years, various septs of the Eóganacht branched off and some faded into insignificance. The O'Donoghue of the Glens is one of the Eóganacht lineages which remain to this day with an acknowledged Chief.
According to tradition, The O'Donoghue Mór and The O'Donoghue of the Glens descend from sons of Auliffe Mór O'Donoghue (d. 1158), Cathal and a younger son Conchobar, respectively (though Y-DNA evidence suggests they are of different lineages). Auliffe Mór's dynasty is that of the Cinel Laegarie of Eóganacht Raithlind/Uí Echach Muman, whose original territory was in West Cork prior to the time of Brian Boru, after which they invaded and secured the kingdom of the Eóganacht Locha Léin, displacing the Loch Lein O'Moriarty's and O'Carrolls.
12th century
There was much internecine war during the time of Auliffe Mór, when the O'Brien dynasty of Thomond were battling (ultimately unsuccessfully) for control of all Munster. The O'Briens were pressuring the Eóganacht from the north and the east, forcing them southwest into Kerry. The Cashel O'Donoghues, by then pressured by their Eóganacht cousins, the increasingly powerful MacCarthy dynasty, would surely have been amongst them.
Auliffe Mór was arguably one of the most powerful warlords of the time and it would not be unnatural for a weakened Eóganacht sept to join Auliffe Mór, who was successfully preventing the O'Briens from overrunning South Munster. They completed the cathedral of Achadh Dá Eó on the heights overlooking the Lakes of Killarney just prior to their death in 1158. It was during a campaign in Waterford that same year that Auliffe Mór was killed on the bank of the River Suir by Muircheartach son of Toirdhealbhach Ó Briain, well east of the MacCarthy territory, which indicates the scope of their efforts to maintain the sovereignty of Desmond.
In the following years, a number of sons of Auliffe Mór are recorded in the annals – Aed, slain 1161; Muirchertach, slain 1163; Murchad, died from wounds, 1169; Cathal (ancestor of the Mór) slain fighting the oversea men, 1170; Conchobar (ancestor of the Glens) slain 1178 ('la Donhnall, lá derbrathaire fein' added by a later hand and perhaps inaccurately translated as 'by Domnall, their own 'brother) 1178; Domnall, slain 1178.
13th–16th centuries
Next recorded in The Glens pedigree is Aoch na Meidhe (of the monks) (d 1231), then Séafra of the Mansion (d.1253) recorded as living in Glanerought on the Tousist peninsula. This is the first mention of the given name, which has been traditionally used through the generations of the family for eight centuries. According to Burke, the title first appeared in the 14th century with Geffery O'Donoghue of the Glynn. In the 16th century, the lands of The Glens comprised 'the wild glen of the Clydagh' and the parish of Killaha. Their family seat was Killaha Castle, overlooking the Glen of the Flesk River, built in the 16th century.
17th–20th centuries
In 1603 after the end of the Desmond Rebellions the Chief of the time was attainted as a result of their participation in the rebellion but was later able to regain their title and lands in 1609. The heart of rebellion still remained though, for in February 1642 Tadhg O'Donoghue and their three sons, Geoffrey, Tadhg and Daniel participated in the siege of Tralee Castle. In 1643, Geoffrey the Poet became Chief. They were noted for their lavish banquets at the top of Killaha Castle, but that all changed after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. They lamented:
Time was when I saw the Gaedhil in silks and in jewels,
Capable, propertied, earnest, perceptive, just,
Merry, sagacious, noble, lordly, intrepid,
Poetical, truthful, wine-loving, feasting – once.
In 1652 the castle was hit with newly employed cannon by General Ludlow's army and partially destroyed. The Chief was forced to flee into the fastness of the glen, but the Glens family remained in their territory. Lands in Glenflesk had been awarded to a number of English settlers in the Act of Settlement of that same year, but this wild place and its people was not conducive to English settlement and most of those English families soon abandoned their grants. After the Act of Settlement, one of Geoffrey's most often quoted stanzas is:
Alas, alas, how weak is nobility now!
The serving maids have cuffs and frilly lace;
Upstart in hats – a shoddy improvement, that!-
And torn-eared caps on people of noble race.
Glenflesk itself was known as the haunt of outlaws and tories, and in popular parlance the English referred to it as the 'Robbers Glen'. The dispossessed families of The O'Donoghue Mór had fled to the glens after the family's attainder in 1586 following Rory Mór's death at the end of the Desmond Rebellion, and they were no doubt the core of the rapparees inhabiting that stronghold in the Glen of the Flesk. They became notorious as the 'Dangerous O'Donoghues' who constantly harassed the English colony brought into the Killarney region by the undertaker Browne family, known as the Earl of Kenmare. In the late 18th century, the Glen was a haven during the Rightboy Movement which originated in Munster.
The Down Survey estimated the territory of The Glens to be five quarters, each of four ploughlands (a ploughland being roughly 120 acres), although this does not include the "unusable" lands controlled by the sept. It indicates that The Glens paid MacCarthy Mór forty shillings annually. 'No explanation is given as to why this clan was so slightly assessed.'
Throughout the centuries, the Glens family managed to retain their title and territory, and eventually built Killaha House near their ruined castle. The Chiefs were consistently devoted to Irish independence and one of the few Gaelic magnates who did not conform to the established Church. They remained in their territory throughout the years of English oppression, never faltering from their faith or deserting their clann.
In the middle of the 19th century Daniel Ó Donoghue, MP from Tralee, married Marie Sophie Ennis, the only daughter and heiress of Sir John Ennis. Upon the death of their father, the family moved to their estate at Ballynahown Court near Athlone. Killaha House became a Presbytery in 1887 and is currently in private hands. The ruined castle is now a national monument owned by the Office of Public Works.
21st century
The current Chief, Geoffrey Paul Vincent, lives near Tullamore in County Offaly.  They are a member of The Standing Council of Irish Chiefs and Chieftains with a keen interest in Irish history. They have seven children, and their son, Geoffrey is their chosen Tánaiste (successor).

The Kentucky Wildcats college football team represents the University of Kentucky in the East Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Wildcats compete as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. The program has had 37 head coaches since it began play during the 1881 season. On November 27, 2012, Mark Stoops was introduced as Kentucky's 37th head coach.
The team has played more than 1,150 games over 122 seasons of Kentucky football. Both the inaugural 1881 squad and the revived 1891 squad have unknown coaches according to university records in winning two games and losing three. Since 1892, eight coaches have led the Wildcats in postseason bowl games: Bear Bryant, Fran Curci, Jerry Claiborne, Bill Curry, Hal Mumme, Rich Brooks, Joker Phillips and Mark Stoops.
Two of those coaches also won conference championships: Bryant and Curci won a combined three as a member of the SEC.
Curci is the leader in seasons coached with nine. Bryant is the leader in games won, with 60 victories during their eight seasons with the program. Jack Wright has the highest winning percentage of those who have coached more than one game, with .875. Bernie Shively has the lowest winning percentage of those who have coached more than one game, with .200. Of the 36 different head coaches who have led the Wildcats, Bryant and Jerry Claiborne have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in South Bend, Indiana.

Bill Yidumduma Harney is an elder of the Wardaman people, known as an artist, storyteller, and musician. As of 2022, they live at Menngen Station, near Katherine in the Northern Territory of Australia, which lies in the traditional lands of the Wardaman people.
Early life
Harney was born in 1931 at Brandy Bottle Creek, on Willeroo Station, NT. Their biological father was the Irish-Australian writer William Edward Harney, but they were brought up in a traditional Aboriginal community by their adoptive Aboriginal father, Joe Jomornji, and mother, Ludi Yibuluyma. Their sister was taken as part of the Stolen Generations, but they escaped because their mother covered them in charcoal to hide the whiteness of their skin.
Aboriginal teachings and awards
Harney is well known as an advocate and ambassador for Aboriginal Australians, and has made several international tours promoting knowledge of Aboriginal Australians. They also appear regularly on TV, radio, and film, often speaking on the subject of Aboriginal astronomy. In 2003 they published, with Hugh Cairns, Dark Sparklers, detailing the astronomy embedded in the Wardaman culture. They have been a finalist several times in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. In August 2009 they featured in a two-man The First Astronomers show with astrophysicist Ray Norris at the Darwin Festival, and in November 2009 they were prominent in the Message Stick episode on Aboriginal astronomy produced by ABC TV.
In 2020, the International Astronomical Union's Working Group for Small Body Nomenclature formally approved the asteroid 1979 MR2 as 7630 Yidumduma in honour of their sharing and promotion of traditional Wardaman astronomical knowledge through film, television, and books, including Dark Sparkers and Four Circles.

In physics, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, μ or β, is the rest mass of the proton (a baryon found in atoms) divided by that of the electron (a lepton found in atoms), a dimensionless quantity, namely:
μ =
The number in parentheses is the measurement uncertainty on the last two digits, corresponding to a relative standard uncertainty of
Discussion
μ is an important fundamental physical constant because:
Baryonic matter consists of quarks and particles made from quarks, like protons and neutrons. Free neutrons have a half-life of 613.9 seconds. Electrons and protons appear to be stable, to the best of current knowledge. (Theories of proton decay predict that the proton has a half life on the order of at least 1032 years. To date, there is no experimental evidence of proton decay.);
Because they are stable, are components of all normal atoms, and determine their chemical properties, the proton is the most prevalent baryon, while the electron is the most prevalent lepton;
The proton mass mp is composed primarily of gluons, and of the quarks (the up quark and down quark) making up the proton. Hence mp, and therefore the ratio μ, are easily measurable consequences of the strong force. In fact, in the chiral limit, mp is proportional to the QCD energy scale, ΛQCD. At a given energy scale, the strong coupling constant αs is related to the QCD scale (and thus μ) as
where β0 = −11 + 2n/3, with n being the number of flavors of quarks.
Variation of μ over time
Astrophysicists have tried to find evidence that μ has changed over the history of the universe. (The same question has also been asked of the fine structure constant.) One interesting cause of such change would be change over time in the strength of the strong force.
Astronomical searches for time-varying μ have typically examined the Lyman series and Werner transitions of molecular hydrogen which, given a sufficiently large redshift, occur in the optical region and so can be observed with ground-based spectrographs.
If μ were to change, then the change in the wavelength λi of each rest frame wavelength can be parameterised as:
where Δμ/μ is the proportional change in μ and Ki is a constant which must be calculated within a theoretical (or semi-empirical) framework.
Reinhold et al. (2006) reported a potential 4 standard deviation variation in μ by analysing the molecular hydrogen absorption spectra of quasars Q0405-443 and Q0347-373. They found that . King et al. (2008) reanalysed the spectral data of Reinhold et al. and collected new data on another quasar, Q0528-250. They estimated that , different from the estimates of Reinhold et al. (2006).
Murphy et al. (2008) used the inversion transition of ammonia to conclude that at redshift . Kanekar (2011) used deeper observations of the inversion transitions of ammonia in the same system at towards 0218+357 to obtain .
Bagdonaite et al. (2013) used methanol transitions in the spiral lens galaxy PKS 1830-211 to find at .
Kanekar et al. (2015) used near-simultaneous observations of multiple methanol transitions in the same lens, to find at . Using three methanol lines with similar frequencies to reduce systematic effects, Kanekar et al. (2015) obtained .
Note that any comparison between values of Δμ/μ at substantially different redshifts will need a particular model to govern the evolution of Δμ/μ. That is, results consistent with zero change at lower redshifts do not rule out significant change at higher redshifts.

The 2022 Frontier League season was the 29th season of professional baseball in the Frontier League, an independent baseball league in the United States and Canada, since its creation in June 1993. There are 16 Frontier League teams, split evenly between East and West divisions.
The Schaumburg Boomers entered the season as the defending champions, having defeated the Washington Wild Things, three games to two, in the league's 2021 championship series. In 2022, however, they were defeated in four games by the Québec Capitales.
Season schedule
The 16 teams in the league are split evenly between two divisions, East and West.
Due to the folding of the Southern Illinois Miners following the 2021 season, the league introduced a new team, the Empire State Greys, to compete as a traveling team with a roster of players from the Empire Professional Baseball League.
The season was played with a 96-game schedule; teams play either three or four series against their division rivals while facing the eight teams from the other division at least once each. The top three teams in each division will qualify for the 2022 playoffs, with the first-place team already qualifying for the division championship, and the second and third place teams playing each other in a wild card game.

Kaili is an Austronesian dialect cluster of the Celebic branch, and is one of the principal languages of Central Sulawesi. The heartland of the Kaili area is the broad Palu River valley which stretches southward from Central Sulawesi's capital city, Palu. Kaili is also spoken in the mountains which rise on both sides of this valley, and along the coasts of the Makassar Strait and the Gulf of Tomini.
Dialects
Taking a fine-grade view, it is possible to distinguish sixteen regional varieties of Kaili. Following the practice of Kaili people themselves, each variety is named after its negator. For example, in the Tawaili region northeast of Palu, Kaili speakers use rai as their word for ‘no,' while speakers in the Parigi region on the Gulf of Tomini use tara. These two varieties can be referred to as ‘Kaili Rai' and ‘Kaili Tara,' irrespective of whether one intends for these varieties to be regarded as languages, dialects, or subdialects. These varieties can also be referred to as ‘Tawaili' and ‘Parigi.'
The following table is a list of lowest-level Kaili varieties, presented by negator and alternate name(s) by which each has been known.
Classification of Kaili varieties
Adriani 1914
The linguist Nicolaus Adriani recognized eight languages. In this early work, several Kaili varieties were as yet unknown to the author.
Tawaili (= Rai)
Palu (= Ledo)
Lole (= Unde)
Ganti (= Ndepuu)
Sigi (= Ija)
Pakuli (= Ado, Edo)
Parigi (= Tara)
Sausu (= Ta'a)
Esser 1938
The linguist S. J. Esser divided Kaili into western, central and eastern groups. Esser was unclear whether their divisions represented dialects or languages, but Noorduyn concluded they intended one language with three principal dialects.
West Kaili (= Ende, Tado, Inde, Da'a, Unde, Ndepuu)
Central Kaili (= Ledo, Ado, Edo, Ija, Taa)
East Kaili (= Rai, Tara, Ta'a)
Kruyt 1938
Using anthropological rather than linguistic criteria, Alb. C. Kruyt divided peoples of this area into three ‘rings' or ‘circles.'
Pakawa ring (= Ende, Tado, Inde, Da'a)
Kaili ring (= Unde, Ndepuu, Rai, Tara, Ta'a, Doi, Ledo)
Sigi ring (= Ado, Edo, Ija, Taa)
Barr and Barr 1979
Barr and Barr recognized one language with six dialects (they also included Kulawi as a seventh dialect, but left Ende and Tado out of consideration since those varieties are not spoken in Central Sulawesi).
Pekava (= Inde, Da'a)
Banava (= Unde, Ndepuu)
Tawaili-Sindue (= Rai)
Parigi (= Tara, Ta'a)
Palu (= Doi, Ledo)
Sigi ( = Ado, Edo, Ija, Taa)
Ethnologue 2009
The Ethnologue (16th ed., 2009) recognizes four languages. In this subclassification, Kaili Ledo is best regarded as an 'everything else' category 'awaiting further research.'
Baras (= Ende)
Kaili Da'a (= Tado, Inde, Da'a)
Kaili Ledo (= Raio, Rai, Tara, Ta'a, Doi, Ledo, Ado, Edo, Ija, Taa)
Kaili Unde (= Unde, Ndepuu)

A special situation in finance is an atypical event which has the high potential to alter the future course of a business, materially impacting the company's value. The connotation of the event may be both positive (for example, merger or acquisition) and negative (conflict, distress, etc.) The notion also covers corporate restructuring and corporate transactions, such as spin-offs, share repurchases, security issuance/repurchase, asset sales, or other catalyst-oriented situations. Further, a shareholders conflict is also considered a special situation.
Seeking for and investing in special situations is a strategy pursued by a number of investors. To take advantage of a special situation, a hedge fund manager must identify an upcoming event that will increase or decrease the value of the company's equity and equity-related instruments.
Definition
There is also a definition of special situation by Benjamin Graham:
Classes of special situations
In their well-known book Security Analysis, Benjamin Graham divides special situations into six classes:
Class A: Standard arbitrages, based on a reorganization, recapitalization or merger plan
Class B: Cash payout, in recapitalization or mergers
Class C: Cash payments on sale or liquidation
Class D: Litigated matters
Class E: Public utility breakups
Class F: Miscellaneous special situations

The Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome, , usually known as MACRO, is a municipal contemporary art museum in Rome, Italy. The museum is housed in two separate places: a former brewery in Via Nizza, in the Salario quartiere of the city; and a former slaughterhouse in Piazza Orazio Giustiniani, in the quartiere of Testaccio.
History
The project began in the late 1990s in the site of the old Peroni Brewery. After an initial phase of restructuring, which allowed the opening of six rooms in September 1999, the museum was officially opened 11 October 2002.
Since 2003 the museum has also had an annex entitled MACRO Future, which comprises two refurbished buildings of 1,000 square metres each in the former slaughterhouse of Rome, several kilometers away in the Testaccio neighborhood.
Renovation
Since July 2004, an extension has been under construction in order to present all of the permanent collection. These arrangements have been entrusted to the French architect Odile Decq.
Collection
MACRO's permanent collection includes a selection of some of the most significant expressions of the Italian art scene since the 1960s, such as the group Forma 1 with the works by Carla Accardi, Antonio Sanfilippo, Achille Perilli, Piero Dorazio, Leoncillo and Ettore Colla; the Arte Povera with Mario Ceroli and Pino Pascali; the Scuola di Piazza del Popolo with Tano Festa, Mario Schifano, Titina Maselli and Mimmo Rotella.
The gallery collects works by such artists as Giovanni Albanese, Andrea Aquilanti, Gianni Asdrubali, Domenico Bianchi, Bruno Ceccobelli, Sarah Ciracì, Enzo Cucchi, Fabrice de Nola, Gianni Dessì, Gianfranco Baruchello, Daniele Galliano, Federico Guida, Felice Levini, Fabio Mauri, Luigi Ontani, Cristiano Pintaldi, Piero Pizzi Cannella, Gioacchino Pontrelli, Sissi, Marco Tirelli.

The Moore Square Historic District is a registered historic district located in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, the district is centered on Moore Square, one of two surviving four-acre (1.6 hm) parks from Raleigh's original 1792 plan. The park is named after Alfred Moore, a North Carolina judge who became an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. Originally a residential neighborhood, Moore Square developed into a primary commercial hub in the city throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The district includes East Hargett Street, once known as Raleigh's "Black Main Street", because it once contained the largest number of businesses owned by African-Americans in the city. City Market, Marbles Kids Museum/IMAX theatre, Pope House Museum, Artspace, and the Long View Center are located in the Moore Square district. Events that take place in Moore Square include the Raleigh Arts Festival, Artsplosure, Movies in the Park, the Street Painting Festival, and the Moore Square Farmer's Market The approximate district boundaries include Person, Morgan, Wilmington, and Davie Streets.
In addition to its national listing, Moore Square is one of six local historic overlay districts (HOD) in Raleigh.

Scott N. Howell (born September 28, 1953) is an American politician from Utah. They were the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate from Utah in the 2000 and 2012 elections.
Early life and education
Howell was born in Provo, Utah. They grew up in Salt Lake City. They attended Dixie State College in Southern Utah on a football scholarship and graduated from the University of Utah with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science.
Career
After graduation, Howell went to work with IBM, where they advanced through the years until they became the director of Global System Integrators/Channel Strategies and the executive of IBM Public Sector operations. In these roles, they helped governments worldwide increase effectiveness and efficiency through information technology.
In 2003, Scott completed a year of Harvard Executive Education to become an "IBM Certified Professional." In 2006, Howell completed the IBM certification and became a "Master Deal Maker," which was taught at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.
Internationally, Howell was a "Smart Communities" advocate. In this role, they consulted with the governments of Australia, Japan, Italy, and Latvia.
They and their wife, Linda, are the parents of four sons.
Utah Senate
Howell served in the Utah State Senate for three terms, including eight years as the Senate Democratic Leader. Under their guidance, Utah became one of the first states to utilize on-line government services, such as vehicle registration. In addition, they drew on their experience in business to make improvements in health care, transportation, public safety, and tax reform. Legislative committee assignments included Health and Human Services, Education, Government Innovation, Transportation, and Olympic Sports Authority. Howell was a ranking member of the "Executive Appropriations Committee," in charge of fiscal appropriations of Utah's $1.3 billion annual budget.
2012 U.S. Senate election
At the Utah Democratic Convention on April 21, 2012, Howell defeated Pete Ashdown to secure the Utah Democratic Party's nomination for the U.S. Senate race against the incumbent senator, Orrin Hatch, Utah's six-term senator seeking their seventh. Howell did this after securing 63% of the vote at the convention in Salt Palace Convention Center. During their pre-convention campaign, Howell emphasized their electability, highlighting their position as a conservative Democrat who possessed the same socially conservative values as Utah voters.
Howell's 2012 campaign is running on three platforms: energy, education and the economy. In August 2012, Howell accused Hatch of "Ducking Debates," because Hatch failed to show up for debates against them and other candidates running in the 2012 U.S. Senate Race. Howell was quoted in the article as saying, "I believe they think the best way to keep their job is to not let people see they have a choice. I think they [Hatch] knows people will see that I'm the candidate that represents Utah the best." A few days later, the Salt Lake Tribune published an article calling for Hatch to be debating their opponents, "Utah voters deserve to see and hear the candidates air their differences up close." The article also referenced Hatch in their 1976 campaign by saying, "Hatch should agree to several debates well before voters have to make up their minds. Hatch thought that would be fair when they were trying to unseat an incumbent 36 years ago. They were right then, and fair is still fair," referencing when Hatch challenged the then incumbent senator, Frank Moss.
Community involvement
National memberships include the Harvard Policy Group at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, the United States Internet Council (board member), and the Democratic Leadership Council (which advocates free market solutions to government problems). Scott also served as an officer in the State Legislative Leaders Foundation and was nominated to and attended the Darden School of Business (University of Virginia) education program for leaders and "rising stars." While in Utah, Scott served on the "2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Organizing Committee". In 1992, they were appointed as a board member to the "Intermountain Health Care" organization and served until 2002.
In 2007, Howell was appointed as a Trustee to the Board for Sutter Health. Howell worked with the Pioneer Park Coalition of Salt Lake City to create a stable, productive environment in the Pioneer Park area.

Bhadarwahi is an Indo-Aryan language of the Western Pahari group spoken in the Bhadarwah region of Jammu and Kashmir, India.
The name Bhadarwahi can be understood either in a narrow sense as referring to the dialect, locally known as Bhiḍlāi, native to the Bhadarwah valley, or in a broader sense to cover the group of related dialects spoken in the wider region where Bhadarwahi proper is used as a lingua franca. In addition to Bhadarwahi proper, this group also includes Padri, Bhalesi, and Khasali (Khashali) dialect. The Churahi language is closely related.
The name of the language is spelt in the Takri as . Variants include Bhaderwahi (), Baderwali (), Bhadri (), Badrohi (), Bhadlayi (), and Bhadlai ().
Phonology
According to Masica (1991) there are a set of lateral retroflex affricates /ʈ͡ꞎ ɖ͡ɭ ɖ͡ɭʱ/ from old /Cr/ clusters.
Status
The language is commonly called Pahari. Some speaker may even call it a dialect of Dogri. The language has no official status. According to the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the language is of definitely endangered category, i.e. many Bhadravahi parents are not teaching this language to the children with which the number of its native speakers is decreasing. Some other languages, such as Kashmiri and Urdu/Hindi are taking this place.

Coconut production plays an important role in the national economy of the Philippines. According to figures published in December 2009 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, it is the world's second largest producer of coconuts, producing 19,500,000 tonnes in 2009. Production in the Philippines is generally concentrated in medium-sized farms.
The Philippines is the world's top producer and exporter of virgin coconut oil.
History
According to the United Nations, coconut production in the Philippines grew at the rate of 5.3 per cent per year from 1911 to 1929, and increased by 3.5 per cent from 1966 to 1970.
In 2012, the Philippines exported more than 1.5-million tonnes of copra, coconut oil, copra meal, desiccated coconut, coco shell charcoal, activated carbon and coco chemicals, a 1.49 per cent increase compared to the volume exported in 2011.
In 1989, it produced 11.8 million tonnes and at the time was the second largest producer but has since surpassed Indonesia. In 1989, coconut products, coconut oil, copra (dried coconut), and desiccated coconut accounted for approximately 6.7 percent of Philippine exports.
As of the early 1990s, about 25 percent of cultivated land was planted with coconut trees, and it is estimated that between 25 percent and 33 percent of the population was at least partly dependent on coconuts for their livelihood. Historically, the Southern Tagalog and Bicol regions of Luzon and the Eastern Visayas were the centers of coconut production. In the 1980s, Western Mindanao and Southern Mindanao also became important coconut-growing regions.
In the early 1990s, the average coconut farm was a medium-sized unit of less than four hectares. Owners, often absentee, customarily employed local peasants to collect coconuts rather than engage in tenancy relationships. The villagers were paid on a piece-rate basis. Those employed in the coconut industry tended to be less educated and older than the average person in the rural labor force and earned lower-than-average incomes.
There are 3.6 million kilometres dedicated to coconut production in the Philippines, which accounts for 25 per cent of total agricultural land in the country. Land devoted to cultivation of coconuts increased by about 6 percent per year during the 1960s and 1970s, a response to devaluations of the Philippine peso (PHP) in 1962 and 1970 and increasing world demand. Responding to the world market, the Philippine government encouraged processing of copra domestically and provided investment incentives to increase the construction of coconut oil mills. The number of mills rose from 28 in 1968 to 62 in 1979, creating substantial excess capacity. The situation was aggravated by declining yields because of the aging of coconut trees in some regions.
In 1973, the martial law regime merged all coconut-related, government operations within a single agency, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA). The PCA was empowered to collect a levy of P0.55 per 100 kilograms on the sale of copra to be used to stabilize the domestic price of coconut-based consumer goods, particularly cooking oil. In 1974, the government created the Coconut Industry Development Fund (CIDF) to finance the development of a hybrid coconut tree. To finance the project, the levy was increased to P20.
Also in 1974, coconut planters, led by the Coconut Producers Federation (Cocofed), an organization of large planters, took control of the PCA governing board. In 1975 the PCA acquired a bank, renamed the United Coconut Planters Bank, to service the needs of coconut farmers, and the PCA director, Eduardo Cojuangco, a business associate of Marcos, became its president. Levies collected by the PCA were placed in the bank, initially interest-free.
In 1978 the United Coconut Planters Bank was given legal authority to purchase coconut mills, ostensibly as a measure to cope with excess capacity in the industry. At the same time, mills not owned by coconut farmers—that is, Cocofed members or entities it controlled through the PCA—were denied subsidy payments to compensate for the price controls on coconut-based consumer products. By early 1980, it was reported in the Philippine press that the United Coconut Oil Mills, a PCA-owned firm, and its president, Cojuangco, controlled 80 percent of the Philippine oil-milling capacity. Minister of Defense Juan Ponce Enrile also exercised strong influence over the industry as chairperson of both the United Coconut Planters Bank and United Coconut Oil Mills and honorary chairperson of Cocofed. An industry composed of some 0.5 million farmers and 14,000 traders was, by the early 1980s, highly monopolized.
In principle, the coconut farmers were to be the beneficiaries of the levy, which between March 1977 and September 1981 stabilized at P76 per 100 kilograms. Contingent benefits included life insurance, educational scholarships, and a cooking oil subsidy, but few actually benefited. The aim of the replanting program, controlled by Cojuangco, was to replace aging coconut trees with a hybrid of a Malaysian dwarf and West African tall varieties. The new palms were to produce five times the weight per year of existing trees. The target of replanting 60,000 trees a year was not met. In 1983, 25 to 30 percent of coconut trees were estimated to be at least 60 years old; by 1988, the proportion had increased to between 35 and 40 percent.
When coconut prices began to fall in the early 1980s, pressure mounted to alter the structure of the industry. In 1985, the Philippine government agreed to dismantle the United Coconut Oil Mills as part of an agreement with the IMF to bail out the Philippine economy. Later in 1988, United States law requiring foods using tropical oils to be labeled indicating the saturated fat content had a negative impact on an already ailing industry and gave rise to protests from coconut growers that similar requirements were not levied on oils produced in temperate climates.
By 1995, the production of coconut in the Philippines had experienced a 6.5% annual growth and later surpassed Indonesia in total output in the world.

Indivisible is a progressive movement and organization in the United States initiated in 2016 as a reaction to the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. The movement began with the online publication of a handbook written by Congressional staffers with suggestions for peacefully but effectively resisting the move to the right in the executive branch of the United States government under the Trump administration that was widely anticipated and feared by progressives. According to Peter Dreier, the goal of Indivisible is to "save American democracy" and "resume the project of creating a humane America that is more like social democracy than corporate plutocracy."
In 2019, Indivisible's Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin were included in Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2019.
Origin
The movement started with the online publication of a 23-page handbook, Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda. The authors of the document, most notably Ezra Levin, Jeremy Haile, Leah Greenberg, and Angel Padilla, were former Congressional staffers. Greenberg worked as an aide to Democratic Representative Tom Perriello of Virginia, while Levin, Greenberg's husband, worked as an aide to Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic Party member of the United States House of Representatives from Texas. After the 2016 presidential election, in mid-December 2016, Levin and Greenberg began working on an online guide in the form of a Google Document on how to make contact with congressional aides as a way of grieving over Trump's victory. Angel Padilla, and Jeremy Haile, and dozens of other staffers for Democratic members of the United States Congress joined in the creation of the online publication.
The authors modeled their document after the Tea Party movement, which focused on local activism and obstructing the Democratic Party's agenda following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008. They thought that similar action taken by the left could be effective against what they perceived as Trump's "bigoted and anti-democratic agenda". The purpose of the guide was to encourage resistance to Trump's presidency, most notably by targeting Republican elected members of Congress by attending town halls, calling congressional officials, visiting their offices, and showing up at public events.
It was first published online on Google Docs on December 14, 2016, with Levin posting a link to it on their personal Twitter account. It soon went viral, with, among others, Robert Reich, Jonathan Chait, George Takei and Miranda July circulating it online.
History
Since the guide's publication, its authors have created a website with further resources on using the guide and organizing local movements. The guide is continuously updated and is available in English and Spanish. By February 4, 2017, less than two months from the publication of the Indivisible Guide, and about two weeks after Trump's inauguration, more than 3,800 local groups identifying as "Indivisibles" had formed and declared their support for the movement. In February, they organized as a 501(c) organization.
Many groups attended town halls, demonstrated against nominees for Trump's Cabinet, and worked with organizers of the Women's March. John Kasich and Mo Brooks acknowledged that the protests would impact efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. David Weigel said the movement was a possible reason for the initial failure of Republicans to pass the American Health Care Act of 2017.
In 2018, the group and its volunteers contributed money, endorsement and volunteer time to many House races, which was followed by Democrats winning back control of the chamber. In 2019, the group endorsed a series of events aimed at supporting the impeachment of Donald Trump.
The group continued its advocacy activities into the post-Trump era; in 2021, Indivisible advocated in favor of Democrats' $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. In October 2021, Indivisible planned to spend $1 million to protect eight Democratic incumbents in Congress, an effort that overlapped partly with that of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In June 2022, Indivisible planned to spend $7 million.

Minot Judson Savage (June 10, 1841 – May 22, 1918) was an American Unitarian minister, psychical researcher and author.
Biography
Savage was born in Norridgewock, Maine in 1841. They graduated from the Bangor Theological Seminary in 1864, and for nine years was in the Congregational ministry, being a home missionary at San Mateo and Grass Valley, California, until 1867. They held pastorates at Framingham, Massachusetts from 1867 to 1869, and at Hannibal, Missouri from 1869 to 1873.
Savage then became a Unitarian, and was pastor of the Third Unitarian Church of Chicago from 1873 to 1874, of the Church of the Unity in Boston from 1874 to 1896, and of the Church of the Messiah (now renamed the Community Church) in New York City from 1896 to 1906. They were an active advocate of Darwinian evolutionistic optimism and social reform, and they also preached a spiritualistic faith in personal survival after death. Their sermons were distributed in the pamphlets Unity Pulpit and Messiah Pulpit.
They were a director of the American Unitarian Association, and served on several councils and conferences. In 1896 they were granted an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Harvard University in 1896.
Their son, Philip Henry Savage, worked as a librarian in the Boston Public Library, and won praise for their own work as a poet.

The Kharkov Mathematical Society (, ) is an association of professional mathematicians in Kharkiv aimed at advancement of mathematical research and education, popularizing achievements of mathematics. The structure of the Society includes mathematicians of Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering, V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University and other higher educational institutions of Kharkov.
History and members of the Kharkov Mathematical Society
Kharkov Mathematical Society was established in 1879 at Kharkov University by the initiative of
Vasilii Imshenetskii, who also later founded the St. Petersburg Mathematical Society.
According to the statute of the society, "the aim of the Kharkov Mathematical Society was to support the development of mathematical science and education".
From 1885 to 1902 in Kharkov lived and worked an outstanding Russian mathematician, Aleksandr Lyapunov: during this period, Lyapunov's activities played an important role in the development of the Society.
From 1902 to 1906, the Kharkov Mathematical Society was headed by Vladimir Steklov, the outstanding student of Aleksandr Lyapunov,
who later organized and became the first director of the Institute of Physics and Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.
Since 1906 and for the next almost forty years the Society was headed by a well-known geometer Dmitrii Sintsov.
Due to their initiatives, the activities of the Society significantly contributed to the improvement of mathematical education in Kharkov.
In 1933 Naum Akhiezer had moved to Kharkov and headed the Institute of Mathematics.
From 1947 Akhiezer became the head of KMS.
Thanks to their efforts, the mathematical community of Kharkiv has significantly strengthened.
Later, the Society was headed by Aleksei Pogorelov, Vladimir Marchenko, Iossif Ostrovskii.
Currently, the president of the Society is Yeugen Kruslov.
At different times, members of society were

In 1990 Vladimir Drinfeld was awarded by Fields Medal.
Publishing activities of the Society
Almost immediately after the foundation, since 1880, the Society published the Communications of the Kharkov Mathematical Society
().
At first, there were two issues a year in size ranging from two to five printed sheets.
In 1960, the publications of the Communications of the Kharkov Mathematical Society were suspended.
Later, in 1965 due to the efforts of Naum Akhiezer the journal Theory of functions, functional analysis and applications was founded, which was published until 1992.
From 1994 to 1999 the Kharkov Mathematical Society participated in the publication of the journal Mathematical Physics, Analysis and Geometry.

Ivantosaurus is an extinct genus of therapsid that lived in Russia during the Wordian stage of the Permian period, named in honor of paleontologist Ivan Antonovich Efremov.
Description
Ivantosaurus is based on a very fragmentary skull, consisting of 2 partial maxillae and a quadrate. The specimen was discovered in the Perm Region of the Ochersky District, Russia. Fossils from the region date to the Upper Kazanian Substage of the Upper Permian, making it one of the latest Therapsids known. It was carnivorous and may have grown to a length of . Ivantosaurus would have been the largest carnivorous therapsid known, exceeding in size even the largest Late Wordian/early Capitanian anteosaurs.
Teeth
Two canine teeth are set side-to-side in Ivantosaurus''' jaw and with their axes inclined forward. It is possible that this therapsid had a unique dentition (no other known animal has two sets of canine teeth), but more likely that a replacement tooth was growing in next to the old tooth about to be lost. Sigogneau-Russell (1989) seems to think this is unlikely, which would make this a quite different animal from Eotitanosuchus''. As with the therocephalian family Lycosuchidae, these may simply be replacement canines. There are few known animals, living or extinct, with two sets of canines (it would be a very inefficient chewing mechanism).

Srughna, also spelt Shrughna in Sanskrit, or Sughna, Sughana or Sugh in the spoken form, was an ancient city or kingdom of India frequently referred to in early and medieval texts. It was visited by Chinese traveller, Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) in the 7th century and was reported to be in ruins even then although the foundations still remained. Xuanzang described the kingdom as extending from the mountains to the north, to the Ganges river to the East, and with the Yamuna river flowing through it. They described the capital city on the west bank of the Yamuna as possessing a large Buddhist vihara and a grand stupa dating to the time of the Mauryan emperor, Ashoka. Srughna is identified with the Sugh Ancient Mound located in the village of Amadalpur Dayalgarh, in the Yamunanagar district of Haryana state of India. To this day, the ancient Chaneti Buddhist Stupa, probably dating to the Mauryan period, stands in the area, about northwest of Sugh.
Identification
Xuanzang saw several stupas, which commemorated the visit of the Buddha or enshrined the relics of Buddhist monks Sariputra and Maudgalyayana. Alexander Cunningham identified the lost city with the village of Sugh (or Sugha) situated from Yamunanagar in the state of Haryana. The city probably lost its importance after the 7th century and the name survived in a localized form. Panjab University's 1965 excavation found artifacts dating from 600 BCE to 300 CE, including grey ware and redware pottery, coins, seals, animal remains, male and female terracotta figurines, animal terracotta figurines and miscellaneous terracotta objects such as flesh rubbers, crucibles, rattle, gamesmen, stamp, seal impression, discs, frames and wheels, balls, goldsmiths heating cup, an ear ornament grooved on the exterior and a broken figurine of a headless child with writing board in lap with sunga (187 BCE to 78 BCE) period alphabets. Collection of these figurines belong to Sunga, Mauryan, Kushana, Gupta and medieval period.
Srughna is regularly mentioned in Panini's Ashtadhyayi, Patanjali's Mahabhashya, the Divyavadana, the Mahabharata, the Mahamayuri, the Brihatsamhita of Varahamihira, etc. Tūrghna, another location mentioned in ancient literary texts, is considered synonymous with Srughna.
The village of Sugh, with the nearby Sugh Ancient Mound, is now a well known archaeological site which has yielded a trove of coins. It was excavated by Cunningham in the 19th century. Suraj Bhan partially excavated the site in 1964–65.
The original site of the Topra Kalan pillar of Ashoka is located about to the west. Ashoka's Rock edicts of Khalsi is also from the region, about to the northeast.
Dhanabhuti, king of "Sugana"
It has been proposed that King Dhanabhuti, the main sponsor of the Buddhist stupa at Bharhut, came from Srughna or Sughana, and that Dhanabhuti was one of its important kings, who, besides building magnificent stupas in their capital city, also made some of the most important donations for the building of the toranas and railings at Bharhut.

Walter Pach (July 1, 1883 – November 27, 1958) was an artist, critic, lecturer, art adviser, and art historian who wrote extensively about modern art and championed its cause. Through their numerous books, articles, and translations of European art texts Pach brought the emerging modernist viewpoint to the American public.
They organized exhibitions of contemporary art for New York City galleries of the period. They were also extremely helpful to Arthur B. Davies, president of the landmark exhibition of 1913, the "International Exhibition of Modern Art," known as the Armory Show, as well as to one of its founders Walt Kuhn, by bringing together leading contemporary European and American artists. Another original founder Jerome Myers spent over a year supervising the American portion of the show.
Pach helped John Quinn and Walter Arensberg gather their collections. They also secured individual works for museums, such as a portrait by Thomas Eakins for the Louvre, and Jacques-Louis David's The Death of Socrates for the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Pach's fluency in French, German, and Spanish made it possible for them to understand and interpret the avant-garde ideas developing in Europe and translate them for the English-speaking audience. They were able to communicate personally with many noted artists in Europe and Mexico and mediate between gallery dealers and museum curators on their behalf. Their correspondence with major figures in 20th-century art are an important source of information, not only about the artists but about the art world during the first half of the 20th century.
Biography
Pach was born in New York City on July 11, 1883. Their father, Gotthelf Pach, was a prominent commercial photographer who, with their family, ran the New York studio of Pach Bros. They did most of the photographic work for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The young Pach often accompanied their father on museum assignments. In 1903, Pach graduated from the City College of New York with a degree in art. They studied with Robert Henri at the New York School of Art and went abroad to paint with William Merritt Chase in the summers of 1903 and 1904.
In 1907, Pach moved to France and became part of the Gertrude and Leo Stein circle, and moved among the Parisian avant-garde, exhibiting with them and writing about their work and new artistic vision. In 1908 they wrote the first article on Cézanne to be published in the U.S., which appeared in Scribner's Magazine. They also interviewed Claude Monet that year and published an article about them in the same periodical. They helped manage and teach in several of William Merritt Chase's summer art schools in various European locales.
Pach was the only American artist to be closely affiliated with the Section d'Or group of artists, including Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Duchamp brothers Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Villon and others. Pach was responsible for securing loans from these painters for the 1913 Armory Show. Most of the artists in Paris who sent works to the Armory Show knew Pach personally and entrusted their works to him.
Pach married artist Magdalene Frohberg in 1914, and their son Raymond was born at the end of that year. They began advising Walter and Louise Arensberg on their art collecting and introduced them to Marcel Duchamp in 1915. The following year, with Duchamp and the Arensbergs, they were a major force in the creation of the Society of Independent Artists. In the summer of 1918 Pach taught two classes, including one on modern art, at the University of California at Berkeley. In the summer of 1922 they taught at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where they lectured and wrote about Native American art. They helped organize exhibitions and raised money for a museum to be dedicated to the indigenous arts of the Americas. They were also a friend of José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera and helped organize the Mexican chapter of the Society of Independent Artists. In 1923 they began an affiliation with New York University, where they taught periodically.
While they are not remembered today as a painter, Pach devoted much of their creative efforts to painting. They thought of themselves both an artist and a writer, despite advice from friends like art historian Bernard Berenson who urged them to devote their time to writing.
Their writings include monographs on a wide range of subjects, social commentary on the art world, and a book on museum structures. Their first publications included brochures for the 1913 Armory Show, including Odilon Redon, and a book about the work of their close friend Raymond Duchamp-Villon titled A Sculptor's Architecture.
In 1923, Pach wrote Georges Seurat, a book art historian John Rewald later cited by as an important text on the artist. Masters of Modern Art and a monograph on Duchamp-Villon in French were published the following year. The first solo exhibition of their own art took place in 1925 at Joseph Brummer Galleries, New York.
They created a stir in 1928 in the art world with Ananias, or The False Artist, a well-known indictment of opportunistic artists and corruption in the art world.
Pach considered Vincent van Gogh a seminal figure in the development of modern art and was the first historian to lecture on them in America. They published their well-received monograph, Vincent Van Gogh, in 1936, and translated the journals of Eugène Delacroix in 1937. Their recollections of a life spent in art, Queer Thing, Painting, appeared in 1938. Ingres was published in 1939, as well as Masterpieces of Art, written for the 1939 New York World's Fair, for which they were the exhibition director. Their 1948 The Art Museum in America called into question the relevance, responsibility, and future of the American art museum. They long championed the artists of Mexico and published an essay on Diego Rivera in 1951 for the National Museum of Fine Arts, Mexico, for its 50-year retrospective exhibition on the artist. Their last book, The Classical Tradition in Modern Art, was published posthumously in 1959.
They died on November 27, 1958 in Manhattan, New York City.

Louis-René Villermé (10 March 1782 – 16 November 1863) was a French economist and physician. They were known for their early studies of social epidemiology, or the effects of socioeconomic status on health, in early industrial France, and was an advocate for hygienic reform in factories and prisons. Their work is considered pivotal in the history of the fields of sociology and statistical inquiry, and they are considered a founder of epidemiology.
Villermé published works on the conditions in prisons in France, and the benefits of helping prisoners return to outside life when their sentences ended. Another concerned the role of industrialization on the general health and quality of life of working-class people. Their best-known work was concerned with workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries, including the children that worked in the mills.
Career
Born in Paris on 10 March 1782, Villermé was a man of many occupations; they covered a wide range of professions in their lifetime including: medical student, army surgeon, author, social economist, and member of several medical boards. They studied with the anatomist Guillaume Dupuytren during 1801–1804. Villermé then spent 10 years serving in the army room during 1804–1814 under the reign of Napoleon. In 1819, Villermé married. After their military service, they began work as Secretary-General of the Société Médicale d'Emulation in 1818. Villermé was elected to the Académie royale de médecine in 1823.
Later in life, they became an economist who wrote about social issues. Villermé was one of the pioneering advocates of hygienic reform and one of the first in France to relate hygienic reform with that of social reform. They conducted numerous early studies on social epidemiology, the health disparities among classes in correlation with wages and living conditions, using their knowledge as a physician to incorporate data analysis as well as social investigations of the working class. They even conducted studies that related mortality rates with income. They were described by Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet as "one of the men who have thrown most light upon this important subject."  They are considered one of the founders of epidemiology.
Villermé was responsible for the establishment in 1829 of what may have been the first journal of urban studies, Annales d'hygiène publique et de médecine légale (Annals of Public Hygiene and Forensic Medicine, 1829). As one of its editors, they advocated for the use of statistics as a tool, and published the works of statisticians from France and other countries. In addition to being a member of the Académie royale de médecine, Villermé was a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques after it was reestablished in 1832. They were appointed by it to lead a commission into textile workers, and served as its president. Their work is considered pivotal in the history of the fields of sociology and statistical inquiry,
Politically, Villermé was a liberal, with an optimistic belief that industrialism and haut commerce could be sources of "productive" wealth which would improve public health. In terms of political economy, they generally did not support government intervention or regulation, believing that a healthy private sector would self-regulate and that enlightened employers would provide higher wages. They did not adopt a radical or proletarian view focused on class relations and political organizing.
However, in the area of child labor, Villermé was an active supporter of government intervention. They strongly advocated against child labor and for the required education of young children, positions that influenced the passage of comprehensive French child labor legislation in 1841.
Works
On Prisons
Villermé published Des prisons telles qu'elles sont et telles qu'elles devraient être (On Prisons as They Are and as They Should Be) in 1820. In this work they called attention to the unhealthy conditions of the prisons in Paris. They outlined several components of the prison systems that they believed should be abolished including torture, ill treatment, cells, and unequal treatment of prisoners based on the amount of money men are able to give up. Villermé urged the government of Paris to take after the newly reformed prison systems of the United States and Russia. Their goal was to persuade officials to reevaluate the unhealthy living environments and treatments of men in prisons so that men are able to become functioning citizens upon their release. This work in particular reflects the multifaceted approach Villermé took in their research, combining knowledge of medicine, data analysis, and social epidemiology.
In the year 1826, they conducted a study connecting mortality rates with wealth and poverty based on neighborhoods in Paris. Louis-René Villermé is also accounted as the author of the one of the first life expectancy tables that directly linked income to mortality rates and life expectancy. They concluded that poor people die younger. This extended into their study in 1829 that reasoned the cause for shorter heights in poorer people was the result of inadequate money to provide proper nutrition. Villermé's work on height is considered the first study in auxological epidemiology.
Tableau
Villermé's Tableau discussed the role of industrialization on the general health and quality of life for the laboring class. Their perspective in this work is unique in that they maintained that the process of industrialization is not completely to blame. They even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. They also discussed the role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, at least half of the workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. They blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization and the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received their reputation as a moral economist.
The Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk Workers
Their most popular work was that of Tableau de l'état physique et moral des ouvriers employés dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie (Study of the Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk workers), the final product of extended research and observation, published in the year 1840. The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed their observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. They brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults as well as the danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and they are considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé covered a wide array of subject matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.

Antonio Abbondi generally known as Scarpagnino (died 1549) was an Italian architect of the Renaissance period, active mainly in Venice.
Biography
Born at Grosio, in Valtellina. In 1505, they became the superintendent of reconstruction for the Fondaco dei Tedeschi in Venice; three years later they were named Proveditore del Sale ("salt curator") of the city.
After a fire destroyed many buildings in the Rialto on 10 January 1514, they played a role in the reconstruction, competing with Alessandro Leopardi, Giovanni Celeste, and Fra Giovanni Giocondo. Abbondi's designs for the Fabbriche Antiche were accepted, and the construction was completed by 1522, including the newly created Palazzo dei Dieci Savi. Also rebuilt was the church of San Giovanni Elemosinario. On 6 October 1527 they were named the proto-maestro for the Scuola di San Rocco, and designed the upper story.

The Matra MS6 was an open-wheel Formula 2 racing car, designed, developed and built by Matra in 1966.
The MS6 were used by Matra International in Formula 2 in 1966. Matra International was managed by Ken Tyrrell and the aim was to break the dominance of the Brabham Formula Two cars. The configuration of the MS6 corresponded to the Matra MS5 from Formula 3. In some sources, the Formula 2 Matras are therefore also referred to as MS5. Officially, however, Matra used the MS6 typology to be able to distinguish between the vehicles.
The car had a stable chassis and Matra International used a Cosworth four-cylinder unit as the engine. Some privateers - the car was also sold to private teams - relied on BRM engines.
Only Brabham cars won until the last race of the season. Only at the last race of the year did Matra win for the first time. At the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, the starting field was supplemented by Formula 2 cars. The rating in this racing formula ended with a triple victory for the MS6. Jean-Pierre Beltoise won ahead of Hubert Hahne and Jo Schlesser.

The Cape Verde women's national football team represents Cape Verde in international women's association football and is governed by the Cape Verdean Football Federation.
History
Introduction
In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team, including Cape Verde who have yet to play in a FIFA sanctioned match. A national team from Cape Verde has not represented the country in the major regional and international tournaments. This includes the Women's World Cup, the 2010 African Women's Championships during the preliminary rounds., and the 2011 All Africa Games. In March 2012, the team was not ranked in the world by FIFA.
Background and development
Women's football in Africa in general faces several challenges, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. At the same time, if quality female players in Africa are developed, many leave their home countries to seek greater football opportunities in places like Northern Europe or the United States. Funding for women's football in Africa is also an issue: Most of the funding for women's football and for the women's national teams comes from FIFA, not the national football association.
The development of football on a national level in Cape Verde is hindered by several factors, including local definitions of femininity that discourage participation in sport, lack of adequate training, a lack of competitive spirit in matches and during training. There is also a lack of available players, with participation rates having peaked at roughly 350 a few years back to roughly 200 current players. The lack of opportunities to go further with football inside the country also discourages continued participation in the sport.
Cape Verde's FIFA trigramme is CPV. The national association, Cape Verdean Football Federation, was founded in 1982 and became affiliated with FIFA in 1986. Between 1990 and 2010, no football administrators from the country attended FIFA run courses related solely to women's football though some attended courses about both men and women's football. Facilities were built to support football for everyone in 2001 when there was a surge of interest in the sport from women and youth players. In 2004, national football umpire training took place, with six of the twenty-six enrolled participants being women, with the women being expected to referee both men and women's matches. Also that year, there were efforts to create a women's futsal competition in São Vicente. lha do Fogo had a women's futsal league in 2005 that included six teams. In July 2011 on the island of St. Nicholas, the first women's soccer national championship was held in the country with EPIF da Praia being crowned the winners and Ajax de São Nicolau coming in second. The national competition had six teams in its inaugural season including EPIF de São Vicente, Ajax de São Nicolau, EPIF da Praia, Académica do Sal, Académica da Boa Vista e Lém. Costs for the competition were covered by the national association. There were efforts to create the league by 2008. In 2011, a FIFA and the Cape Verdean Football Federation sponsored women's coaching clinic was held in the country. The training was conducted by James Doyen French from Portugal and Francisco Baptista Asselan Khan of Mozambique. The training was conducted to help demonstrate the national federation's commitment to women's football. In 2011, a women's football tournament was held in San Vicente. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by African Union of Broadcasting.
Some female Cape Verdan footballers have gone on to play internationally for clubs in places like the Canary Islands with some of the earliest players joining clubs around 2001. Other footballers have played abroad starting in 2004 in the Netherlands, Spain and Luxembourg.

Julian Quintart (born 24 August 1987) is a Belgian, living and performing in South Korea, as a television personality, record producer, disk jockey, model, actor and singer. They were a cast member in the talk show Non-Summit.
Life and career
Quintart arrived in South Korea, from their home in Aywaille, Belgium, when they were seventeen, as a student with Rotary Youth Exchange. They said that a camera crew was, coincidentally, at the airport when they arrived, and questioned them about being in South Korea. They immersed themselves in the culture and learned more of the language. From there, they went on to appear on TV and was able to move into acting. They called it an exciting time, during which they were able to have many experiences that other foreigners could never have, such as going to North Korea, attending a training camp for the South Korean Army, making kimchi the traditional way, and cycling across South Korea. About their learning to speak Korean, in just a few years, they said, "We didn't study Korean to get a high score in school. We just felt the need to communicate clearly with Korean people, which naturally led us to learn the language with great interest."
They have been called a "Jack of all trades". He's been on TV, appearing in SBS Way to Eat Well and Live Well and KBS Star Golden Bell, on dramas, including Sky High, and has performed on Inkigayo. He's been in the movies Papa and My Tutor Friend 2, has held concerts, modeled, been a DJ and music producer. They were a member of the boy band Bonjour in 2006.

In an interview with The Korea Times, they said they did not want to make their role a stereotype of foreigners living in Korea. "He (Daniel) is not typical because they can speak some Korean. I think most foreigners' roles in the dramas are like Dennis Oh and Daniel Henney, who seem very cold. But my character shows another image of foreigners, as cute and cheerful." Also, in 2007, they played another supporting role, in the film My Tutor Friend 2.

Crossley's vanga (Mystacornis crossleyi), also known as Crossley's babbler-vanga, Crossley's babbler, Madagascar groundhunter, or Madagascar groundjumper, is a bird species in the family Vangidae.
Taxonomy
The bird is in the monotypic genus Mystacornis. The species is an example of convergent evolution: its bill and body shape adapted to its habit of looking for insect prey in the leaf litter, eventually becoming so similar to that of ground-babblers that early naturalists initially classified the Crossley's vanga into what was then known as the babbler family, Timaliidae.
Description
Crossley's vanga is a small babbler-like bird, 15 cm long and weighing around 25 g. Its most distinctive feature is the olive-grey bill, which is disproportionately long and slightly hooked at the end. The plumage of the male is olive green on the crown, back, wings, tail and flanks, a grey belly, black throat and face, with a white submoustachial stripe and grey stripe above the eye. The legs are grey and the iris black. The female is similar but with a white throat and belly.
Behaviour
Breeding
The breeding season for this species is from August to November. The male builds a shallow cup nest of twigs and rootlets in a tree or other vegetation around 1.5 m off the ground. Two to three eggs are laid and incubated by both sexes.
Feeding
It forages singly or in pairs. It is a terrestrial bird that feeds on the ground on spiders, cockroaches, earwigs, true bugs, grasshoppers and ants. It rarely flies but instead walks and runs and probing its bill into leaf-litter, mosses, and soil.
Distribution and habitat
Crossley's vanga is endemic to Madagascar. It is distributed in the east of Madagascar in broadleaf forest, from sea level up to 1800 m.

Florida's state forests are state forests overseen by the Florida Forest Service. There are 35 state forests in Florida covering more than 1,058,000 acres. The first state forest in Florida was Pine Log State Forest, established on 6,960 acres in 1936. Cary State Forest was established in 1937. Blackwater River State Forest and Withlacoochee State Forest were added in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Florida began large land purchase and preservation efforts in the late 1970s and management focus shifted from timber and wildlife focuses to a "multiple land use management ethic" including "conservation of natural and cultural resources, wildlife management, protection of water resources, and outdoor recreation."

Phenacobius mirabilis, or the suckermouth minnow, is a North American cyprinid fish, where it occurs in the Mississippi River basin from Ohio and West Virginia to Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico, and from southeastern Minnesota to northern Alabama and southern Oklahoma. It also occurs in the western Lake Erie drainage in Ohio.
Ecology
The suckermouth minnow inhabits small to moderate size streams with clear to turbid water. They prefer a water temperature of 5-25 degrees Celsius and a mixed sandy gravel substrate. Streams with permanent flow and riffles with little siltation are ideal for this species. A highly adaptable species, it has been observed that these minnows can travel long distances.
Appearance
This species gets its name from its sucker like mouth and fleshy lower lip. They are bicolored, meaning the dorsal side is a brownish tone and the ventral side is a silvery white shade. A thin black stripe separates the colors, and a black spot is located on the base of the caudal fin. Males typically are more colorful, while females are larger to aid in reproduction. They range from 5-13 cm.
Life Cycle
Phenacobius mirabilis spawn in groups in between late spring and early summer. Spawning temperatures are around 14-25 degrees Celsius, while temperatures required for the embryos to hatch is around 17 to 23 degrees Celsius. These eggs are laid in gravel beds and require no parental care. This species has a lifespan of 3-5 years.

The Tavannes–Noirmont railway line is a metre-gauge railway line in western Switzerland. The () opened the first section in 1884; the () completed the line between Tramelan and Le Noirmont in 1913. The line was electrified in 1913 and has belonged to the Chemins de fer du Jura (CJ) since 1944.
History
Tramelan-Tavannes Railway
The first railway lines in the Jura were built to connect Switzerland with France. Afterwards efforts were made to connect areas that were not yet developed with Lokalbahnen ("local lines") to the main lines.
The metre-gauge Tavannes-Tramelan railway was opened as a branch line on 16 August 1884 by the (TT) (). The 9 km-long line connected Tramelan with Tavannes, which lay on the existing standard-gauge Sonceboz-Sombeval–Moutier railway opened on 1874. The railway was, after the Lausanne–Echallens (1873), the Rigi-Scheidegg (1874), the Herisau–Urnäsch (1875) and the Waldenburg (1880) lines, one of the first Swiss narrow gauge railways and served as a model for many similar operations.
The railway was initially operated with two class G 2/2 two-axle tender locomotives. A third locomotive was acquired in 1891. A very high level of performance was required for the steam locomotives as the line had gradients of up to 4.0 percent. Shortly before the electrification, the locomotives were equipped with new boilers.
Electrical operations at 1200 volts DC commenced on 15 November 1913. The reason for the electrification was the opening of the meter-gauge, electrically operated Tramelan-Breuleux-Noirmont Railway (TBN).
For electric operations, the TT procured two BCe 2/4 railcars (nos. 60–61) and a two-axle locomotive of class Ge 2/2 (no. 4). Both types of vehicles had the same electrical equipment. The three units were identical to the two railcars, 70–71, and the Ge 2/2 locomotive no. 5 of the TBN. While the railcars were procured for passenger trains, the two locomotives hauled freight trains and were used when double-heading was needed.
The electric supply to the catenary of the two lines was carried out through a substation in Tramelan, which was equipped with backup batteries.
The TT mainly served passenger traffic. At times it was able to pay a modest dividend. Investment in catenaries and new rolling stock were necessary for the electrification in 1913. The First World War led to additional revenue from both passenger and freight transport. In 1917, the railway had the best operating result in its history. Thereafter, however, sharply rising operating expenses affected the balance sheet.
Tramelan – Breuleux – Noirmont Railway
Advances in electrical engineering enabled the continuation of the narrow gauge line from Tramelan through the heights to Les Breuleux and Le Noirmont to connect to the Saignelégier–La Chaux-de-Fonds railway (SC) (). The Tramelan-Breuleux-Noirmont Railway (TBN) was operated at 1200 volts DC from its opening on 16 December 1913.
As already mentioned, the TBN procured two BCe 2/4 railcars (70–71) and Ge 2/2 locomotive (5).
The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 led to increased traffic at the TBN and led to financial relief. At the beginning of the 1920s, declining income from passenger transport increasingly led to financial difficulties.
Tavannes–Noirmont Railway
The TT and the TBN, which opened in 1913, formed a joint operating arrangement and operated the line with the electric rolling stock running through from Tavannes to Le Noirmont. The Saignelégier-La Chaux-de-Fonds Railway (SC) continued to use steam locomotives on the line from Le Noirmont to La Chaux-de-Fonds which made through running difficult.
Since 1 May 1921, standard gauge freight cars have been loaded on transporter wagons in Tavannes, so that they can be carried on the narrow gauge line to Le Noirmont.
On 1 January 1927, the two electrically operated railways TT and TBN, which previously formed a joint venture, joined together to form the (). But even after the merger, the operating results remained modest and the infrastructure became obsolete.
The Tavannes–Noirmont Railway was merged on 1 January 1944 with the SC and two standard gauge railways, the Régional Saignelégier–Glovelier (RSG) and the Régional Porrentruy–Bonfol (RPB) to form the Chemins de fer du Jura (CJ).
Chemins de fer du Jura
With the merger of the four railway companies in the then Bernese Jura, the foundation was laid for a comprehensive technical renovation. The CJ has operated its entire metre-gauge network with 1500 volts DC since 4 October 1953. For this purpose, the overhead line voltage was increased from 1200 to 1500 volts DC. The converter plant in Tramelan was replaced by three rectifiers in Orange, Les Reussilles and Le Noirmont. The rolling stock was almost completely replaced by new vehicles. No changes were made to the existing locomotives.
A train carrying railway staff crashed into a train carrying train axles at Orange between Tramelan and Tavannes on 27 October 1953. Two railway employees were killed by axles flying off a flatcar hauled by Ge 2/2 5. The railway staff train had not waited in Orange to allow the trains to cross.
The 246 metre-long Tavannes viaduct was opened in 1966 to separate the railway from the road in the village of Tavannes.
Current operations
Passenger services run between Le Noirmont and Tavannes almost continuously every hour. They connect with La Chaux-de-Fonds–Saignelégier–Glovelier services in Le Noirmont. There are connections with the regional trains of the SBB towards Sonceboz-Sombeval and Biel/Bienne in Tavannes.
Freight trains run on the line regularly from Monday to Friday. Waste has been carried from Tavannes to the La Chaux-de-Fonds incinerator since 2000. In addition, standard-gauge wagons are carried on transporter wagons, which primarily carry timber logs, fuel oil, gravel and road salt.
Scheduled steam trains are operated by La Traction on the Pré-Petitjean–Saignelégier–Le Noirmont–Tavannes route from July to September.
A depot in Tramelan, where the workshop for all CJ vehicles is located, is used to maintain rolling stock used in regular traffic. Transports Régionaux Neuchâtelois (TRN) rolling stock is also regularly maintained at the local underfloor lathe. Construction service vehicles are maintained at a single-track carriage shed in Le Noirmont.
Route description
The line leaves Tavannes station running parallel to the SBB line to Moutier. After a few metres, it turns left and crosses the Birs on the 246 metre-long Tavannes viaduct. After that, the line runs with a 4.0 percent gradient through meadows and fields. The almost flat route follows the Trame stream from the Orange crossing loop to the halt of Tramelan-Dessous. Trains arrive at Tramelan, home of the CJ's main workshop.
After Tramelan station, the line climbs at 5.0 percent on a winding route to the hamlet of Les Reussilles where the Franches-Montagnes plateau starts. Afterwards, the line passes through several meadows and fields to cross the high moor and "La grande Tourbière" nature reserve. There, the line leave the Bernese Jura and enters the Canton of Jura. After the halt of La Chaux-des-Breuleux, the line reaches Les Breuleux. The line then passes through a tight right-hander and reaches the halt of Les Breuleux-Eglise, the highest point of the line. After passing through beautiful forests and pastures, the line descends on a grade of 4.4 percent to reach Le Noirmont, where the narrow-gauge line from Saignelégier enters the station from the right.
Rolling stock
The following locomotives were available for the Chemin de fer Tavannes–Noirmont and its two predecessors, TT and TBN:

Hannah Shuttleworth (1800-1886) was a philanthropist from Dedham, Massachusetts .
Personal life
Shuttleworth was born in 1800 to Jeremiah Shuttleworth, the brother-in-law of Nathaniel Ames, and their wife, Susanna () Shuttleworth. They had brothers, Sam and Jerry.
Jeremiah was Dedham's first postmaster with the post office housed in their family home, located at the corner of Church and High Streets. For many years, notices—everything from the death of Abraham Lincoln to the announcement of a baseball game—were tacked to a buttonwood tree in front of the house.
At the age of 16, Shuttleworth moved in with Ames. When Ames died in 1822, they left their fortune to their wife and, upon their death, to the unmarried Hannah, their closest living relative. They immediately sold their inheritance for $2,300 and deposited the proceeds with the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company. When they died, their executor received $40,000.
Shutleowrth was "about as shy and retiring as they get." They rarely left their house, but did receive visitors. From their time with Ames and from their inheritance, they became an expert in Dedham's history.
Shuttleworth's will
Shuttleworth left $500 each to of their help.
Dedham Historical Society
In their will, Shuttleworth left their family home and $10,000 to the Dedham Historical Society. In 1886, the 250th anniversary of the founding of the town, Don Gleason Hill announced the gift at the Society's annual meeting in March. The family home, which was on the corner of Church and High Streets, was sold and moved to Bryant Street, but was torn down in the 1970s. The Society constructed a new building on the site to house their museum and archive. The fireproof, colonial style building consisted of a lecture-display hall, basement storage area, and office space. It was described at the time as "one of the finest architectural buildings in the shire town of Norfolk."
Dedham Public Library
They also left $10,000 in their will to the Dedham Public Library. In April 1886, a lot of 19,101 square feet in size was purchased for $2,000 using their bequest on the corner of Church and Norfolk Streets; ground was broken to construct the library on October 13.
Shuttleworth Fund
A third bequest in Shuttleworth's will was for $32,000 to the Town of Dedham to set up a fund to provide assistance to the "worthy poor" of the town. It largely sat in a bank account collecting interest from the time of their death in 1886 to the Great Recession in 2009. By that time, the balance had grown to $230,000. The terms of the will said it could be expended by the Overseers of the Poor, a body which existed when Shuttleworth died but which was abolished in the 1970s. Town Meeting then asked the Great and General Court to declare the Board of Selectmen as the Overseers of the Poor, and the Board then appointed a Shuttleworth Committee. The Committee then began giving grants of up to $500 to help people pay utility bills, for medication, or other needs.
Legacy
Hill wanted to honor Shuttleworth by hanging a portrait of them in the hall of the Historical Society's new building, but it was determined that no photograph or portrait had ever been taken of them Hill then devised a plan to obtain their likeness that was "literally snatched from the grave." As they wrote in Dedham Records, published in 1888
“The morning following their funeral, a cold blustering February day, Gariboldi, the statuary manufacturer, was summoned from Boston, and inside the receiving tomb a plaster cast of their face was taken, and from this alone, with the descriptions which a few friends who knew their best could furnish, Miss Annie R. Slafter, of Dedham, made the crayon portrait which now hangs in the place of honor over the great mantel in our Historical Society room.”
The death mask, drawing, and Shuttleworth's bonnet are now all in the collection of the Historical Society.
When Hill, who was also the Town Clerk, published the early records of the Town in 1888, they dedicated the collection to Shuttleworth. "Her munificent bequeaths," the dedication said, "to our Historical Society and public library, and also to the Town of a large permanent fund to aid the worthy poor, will make them a name a household word. Generations to come will speak them praise."

Robert Mendel Laxer (September 10, 1915 – October 24, 1998) was a Canadian psychologist, professor, author, and political activist.
Life and career
Laxer was born in Montreal, Quebec, in 1915 and graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1936 and a Master of Arts degree in 1939.
Laxer joined the Communist Party of Canada during the Great Depression. They worked as a freelance journalist until 1941 when they joined the Canadian Army and served during the Second World War. Upon returning to Canada in 1947, they became a paid organizer for the Communist Party's successor, the Labor-Progressive Party. Following the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the accusations by Nikita Khrushchev of crimes by Joseph Stalin, and the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary, Laxer joined many other disillusioned Communists in resigning from the party.
They returned to school and ultimately obtained a doctorate in clinical and learning psychology from the University of Toronto. From 1960 to 1964, they were a lecturer in the University of Toronto's department of psychology and a clinical psychologist at Toronto General Hospital.
They then taught at York University, and later became an associate professor at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education and became a full professor in 1968.
In 1969, they joined their son, James Laxer, and Mel Watkins to form the Waffle, a socialist group within the New Democratic Party. Through the 1970s, they wrote numerous articles and books advocating Canadian economic independence from the United States and, in particular, Canadian ownership of the oil industry. They were appointed by Pierre Trudeau to the board of directors of Petro-Canada which had been created as a state-owned crown corporation, in part, due to Laxer's arguments.
In the 1980s, Laxer was active in the Council of Canadians, the peace movement, and as an opponent of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement.
Laxer had two sons, James and Gordon, both of whom were political economists and writers, and a daughter, Linda, a social worker and therapist. James' son Michael Laxer also became a political activist.

The Summa de casibus poenitentiae (Summary Concerning the Cases of Penance) is a book written from 1224 to 1226 by Saint Raymond of Penyafort. It is a guide for members of the Dominican Order when hearing confessions. The work was later revised and annotated by William of Rennes between 1234 and 1245.
Composition
Penyafort's work relied heavily on Gratian's Decretum Gratiani. In it Penyafort put forth the argument that acting in defense of yourself or your property could only occur when an attack was already under way and you were repelling it, or if an attack was imminent. Accordingly, Penyafort put defending yourself and offensive actions in juxtaposition, as defense concerned the immediate future and the present, and offense was an act of vengeance for actions which had already been committed.
Summa de Matrimonio
Following up on poenitentiae, Raymond wrote a Summa de Matrimonio, about issues of marriage. This second work was often appended to the Summa de casibus poenitentiae and was also included together with it, as its fourth and final part, in the printed editio princeps in 1603.

The 1916 Virgin Islands hurricane was a strong tropical cyclone that inflicted extensive damage across the Virgin Islands in October 1916. It was the region's most destructive storm since at least the 1867 San Narciso hurricane; Consul General Christopher Payne and archaeologist Theodoor de Booy considered the 1916 storm as the archipelago's most damaging. Its peak intensity was equivalent to a Category 3 on the modern Saffir–Simpson scale. The storm began as a tropical depression southeast of Barbados on October 6, though little is known about the storm's origins or its developing stages; by the time its center was first located, the cyclone was already a hurricane and causing damage in the Virgin Islands. After forming, the storm moved northwest into the eastern Caribbean Sea and strengthened quickly. Rough seas were produced in the Windward Islands at Dominica and Saint Kitts as the storm passed nearby between October 7–8, damaging coastal villages.
On the evening of October 9, the hurricane traversed the Virgin Islands with an intensity equivalent to a Category 2 on the modern Saffir–Simpson scale, passing directly over Saint Croix and producing gusts as high as . Of the Danish West Indies, Saint Thomas fared worst, with virtually every building sustaining damage. The island harbor suffered greatly and numerous ships were grounded or sunk. Entire towns in Saint Croix and Tortola were destroyed. There were four deaths in Saint Thomas, five in the remainder of the Danish West Indies, and thirty-two in Tortola. After battering the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane continued harmlessly out to sea on a northward and later northeastward trajectory. While well southeast of Bermuda, the storm's intensity peaked on October 12 with maximum sustained winds of . Steady weakening ensued thereafter, and the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 14 before being absorbed by another cyclone east of Newfoundland a day later. Amid the storm's aftermath, coal carriers successfully went on strike for increased wages. Crop production in 1917 was significantly curtailed by the widespread damage wrought to agriculture by the hurricane.
Meteorological history
The 1916 Virgin Islands hurricane was the thirteenth known tropical cyclone of the 1916 Atlantic hurricane season. Owing to a paucity of weather observations in the region, the precise location of the storm was not known contemporaneously until it was already traversing the Virgin Islands as a fully-fledged hurricane. According to a reanalysis of the hurricane in 2008, conducted by the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, the storm began just southeast of Barbados as a tropical depression on October 6. Over the next three days, it traveled on a northwestward course into the Caribbean Sea. Winds in the southern Lesser Antilles remained low as the system passed between Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent on October 7. However, the emergence of low air pressures in Dominica prompted the United States Weather Bureau to begin monitoring the disturbance, requesting additional weather observations to better diagnose the developing tropical cyclone. The tropical storm strengthened into a hurricane on October 9.
Curving towards the north, the storm intensified quickly and made landfall on the Danish West Indies at Saint Croix on the evening of October 9. According to a Weather Bureau report published in the Monthly Weather Review, "The storm was of small area and of great intensity." An air pressure of 963 mbar (hPa; 28.44 inHg) was registered on the island, lower than any other reading in the island's history; based on this reading, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the hurricane possessed maximum sustained winds of at least 110 mph (175 km/h) during its passage through the Virgin Islands, equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the modern Saffir–Simpson scale. The project also noted that the storm may have been a major hurricane at landfall. Gusts may have been as high as 140–160 mph (225–255 km/h). After crossing the islands, the hurricane continued north, its winds increasing further to a peak of 120 mph (195 km/h) southeast of Bermuda on October 12. A ship caught in the hurricane that day reported winds of 105 mph (195 km/h). The storm curved towards the northeast and weakened following this peak intensity, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 14; the system continued its trajectory into the northern Atlantic before it was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone east of Newfoundland on October 15.
Impact
Windward Islands and Puerto Rico
Inclement weather prevailed over the Windward Islands between October 7–8, yielding the storm's only discernible effects during its unclear origins. The developing system generated rough seas off Dominica; damaging waves in Roseau advanced well-inland. Jetties and shore roads were washed away by the surf. Parts of coastal villages and small craft were lost to the heavy seas. Buildings that had stood for 60–70 years were destroyed. Rural parts of the island experienced significant damage. Similar seas were reported on the evening of October 8 at Basseterre in Saint Kitts, where waves overtopped the island's seawall. Strong winds swept over eastern Puerto Rico on October 9 as the hurricane passed to the east. At San Juan, peak winds were just under gale-force, while winds faster than 50 mph (80 km/h) were measured farther east. At Naguabo, the winds held at or above gale-force for 14 hours, with a peak velocity of 70–75 mph (115–120 km/h). Buildings on a mostly abandoned U.S. naval station on Culebra were destroyed by the storm.
Virgin Islands
The hurricane greatly affected the entire Virgin Islands archipelago between the evening of October 9 through the morning of October 10. The islands' resources were already strained due to World War I, exacerbating the hurricane's impacts and thwarting measures implemented by the colonial authorities to bolster the economy of the Danish West Indies. One account called it the most destructive storm since the 1867 San Narciso hurricane. The American consulate in the Danish West Indies sent a cablegram to the U.S. State Department remarking that the hurricane was "the most disastrous known". Accounts of the hurricane in The Bulletin and Lightbourn's Mail Notes, newsletters in Saint Thomas, made similar judgements, as did American archaeologist Theodoor de Booy. There was little warning in advance of the storm's approach: the U.S. Weather Bureau transmitted general notices of the hurricane's path to points in the West Indies on October 8 while hurricane signals were sounded on the Virgin Islands on the afternoon of October 9 hours before landfall, leaving little time for residents to batten down.
Saint Thomas
Of the Danish West Indies, Saint Thomas experienced the most severe effects from the hurricane. Nearly every building on the island incurred damage, and several among them were destroyed. Many buildings that remained standing were nonetheless wrecked beyond repair. Slave cabins were separated from their foundations and smashed into flinders against other buildings or trees. The severity of impacts was largely uniform throughout the island, though Savanne and Frenchman's Hill were most seriously affected. Severe flooding occurred in Charlotte Amalie, Frenchtown, and Lindbergh Bay. The storm surge tore buildings away from their foundations and inundated large tracts of land. Extensive losses were wrought upon shipping. The harbor at Saint Thomas, normally shielded from most tropical disturbances, saw extensive impacts; the harbor was most susceptible to a hurricane approaching from the south, as was the case in the 1916 hurricane. Steamers were grounded upon the island by the force of the wind-driven waves. Beached ships included the ocean liners Calabria and Wasgenwald of the Hamburg America Line and the Danish dredge St. Hilda. Calabria and Wasgenwald, both German ships, were interned in the Danish West Indies since the start of World War I. Calabria was considered a total loss and St. Hilda was reduced to smaller fragments. Two other Danish ships were severely damaged and many smaller vessels capsized. The distress vessel Blandford was the only ship in the harbor not moved from their moorings. Two electric harbor cranes operated by the West Indian Company and built to withstand a 100-mph (160 km/h) wind were mangled and partially strewn in the sea. Recent additions to the Saint Thomas harbor also sustained heavy blows. A machine shop was swept away by the sea.
Electric wires were blown down and warehouses were unroofed across Saint Thomas. The iron sheet roofs of homes were pried off by the wind. Many trees were uprooted or debarked. In the market square, trees laid mangled with communication and electric wires, littering public thoroughfares alongside amalgamations of wind-torn gutters and rooftop tiling. At the supply station of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company, ancillary buildings and storehouses were destroyed. Nearby, a coconut plantation was rendered infertile due to damage sustained to the tops of trees. As sturdier structures, places of worship fared comparably well but were nevertheless subject to the violence of the winds; rectories were seriously damaged and a chapel was destroyed. Some people sought shelter in parsonages. In addition to the winds and surge, the hurricane also produced heavy rainfall; at Charlotte Amalie, the storm's rainfall total in 24 hours was a 1-in-20 year event. Merchant stocks were tarnished by the rainfall. Four deaths—all drownings—were documented at Saint Thomas; these occurred at the harbor in addition to several injuries.
Other islands
On Saint Croix, destruction befell entire towns and many factories. The town of Christiansted reported extensive damage. The schooner Vigilant capsized in the Christiansted reef; the ship was raised after sinking in the 1876 San Felipe hurricane only to suffer the same fate in 1916. In Frederiksted, saltwater was found on the upper-stories of residences, marking the height of the storm's waves. The roof of one home destroyed a stable and a few rooms after being blown away. Ninety percent of fences and most trees were knocked down. Heavy damage was also wrought in rural areas of Saint Croix, where telecommunications were disrupted. At several settlements, homes were badly damaged; only 4 homes of 23–25 at an estate in Annaly were destroyed. Anegada, Tortola, and Saint John of the Virgin Islands were devastated by the hurricane. At Tortola the hurricane's winds were the strongest on the evening of October 9, holding at around 100 mph (160 km/h) for an hour. A report sent to The Sun, a New York-based newspaper, enumerated thirty-two fatalities in Tortola and eight in Saint John. However, a later report indicated five deaths combined in Saint Croix and Saint John from injuries caused by falling walls or trees. More than 50 people were injured in Saint John. Nearly all houses on the Saint John and Tortola were destroyed. Most boats at Tortola were destroyed, and some were dispersed by the storm's wind and waves on inland hills. Significant damage was dealt to the island's crops. Two thousand people were displaced by the storm in Tortola. Across three settlements in Saint John, all houses except one were razed. Swaths of trees were denuded in some areas of the island. Although the force of the storm was stronger on Saint John than on Saint Thomas, the island's lower population led to a lesser monetary toll to infrastructure; however, total casualties were higher in Saint John due to a lack of communications, leaving the island's residents unaware of the storm's approach.
Aftermath
Many residents across the Danish West Indies were rendered destitute, with two-thirds in need of food and clothing and a third needing shelter. Damage from the hurricane was initially estimated by the American consulate at $2 million. However, further surveys of the damage suggested a smaller toll. Christopher Payne, the American Consul General to the Danish West Indies, appealed for $50,000 in immediate relief. The government of the Danish West Indies provisioned $5,000 for relief on October 11. Some of the funds allowed the poor to build new homes, though other parts were loaned without interest. Crews were dispatched to repair effaced mountain roads. Further assistance was provided by the Danish Ministry of Finance. The HMS Valkyrien embarked on a search-and-rescue operation following the storm, extracting survivors from the stricken barquentine Thor. The Valkyrien'''s junior surgeon was sent to Saint John to render assistance due to a lack of any medical personnel on the island. Galvanized by the devastation wrought by the hurricane, coal carriers—workers who refueled coal-powered ships—in Saint Thomas went on a successful strike to demand increased wages, ultimately forming a union with 2,700 members and negotiating a doubling of their pay.
The loss of trees and foliage on Saint Croix caused by the storm led to decreased outputs of bananas, cocoa, mangoes, oranges, and pineapples; virtually every fruit tree was destroyed by the hurricane. In Saint John, oil extraction from the bay tree (Pimenta acris'') in 1917 was a quarter of the annual average; many of the trees were stripped of their leaves. The lime industry was suspended by the severity of damage inflicted upon lime trees; the storm struck amid an effort to establish lime groves on abandoned estates. Difficult living conditions for older populations following the loss of homes and roofs led to increased mortality rates among those older than 40 years old in 1917; mortality rates recovered to longer-term averages by 1918. The extent of the damage to Saint Thomas's harbor may have increased support for the sale of the Danish West Indies to the United States in the 1916 Danish West Indian Islands sale referendum.

The Grand Tours are the three most prestigious multi-week stage races in professional road bicycle racing. The competitions are the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a España, contested annually in that order. They are the only stage races permitted to last longer than 14 days. No cyclist has won all three Grand Tours's mountains classifications in the same year; the only cyclists to win all three Grand Tours's mountains classifications in their career are Federico Bahamontes and Luis Herrera. It is rare for cyclists to ride all Grand Tours in the same year; in 2004, 474 cyclists started in one of the Grand Tours, 68 rode two and two cyclists started all three.
Cyclists are ranked on the basis of their total wins in the three Grand Tours. When there is a tie between cyclists they are listed alphabetically by the Grand Tour they won. The majority of winners have come from Europe, however there have been a few notable victories for cyclists from other continents. Colombia, Australia, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela are the only non-European countries to have a rider win a mountains classification, with twenty-two victories shared between the five countries.
Bahamontes and Gino Bartali, with 9 victories, have won the most mountains classifications at the Grand Tours. Lucien Van Impe is third with 8 and Richard Virenque is fourth with seven. Virenque has won the most mountains classifications at the Tour, with seven. Bartali, with seven, holds the record mountains classifications at the Giro. While, José Luis Laguía both have five victories in the mountains classification at the Vuelta.

Brautmystik (IPA /'brautˌmystik/), literally 'bride-mysticism', often rendered 'bridal mysticism' or 'nuptial mysticism' in English, was a thirteenth-century Christian spiritual movement associated with the Low Countries.
It is particularly associated with Beatrice of Nazareth (d. 1268) and Hadewijch of Antwerp (fl. c. 1250). The movement drew inspiration from the thought of Bernard of Clairvaux, particularly their thinking on the imagery of the Canticle. It was a form of affective piety. It is often associated with the more intellectual, speculative movement, .

Siro (also Syro, Siron, or Syron; fl. c. 50 BC) was an Epicurean philosopher who lived in Naples.
They were a teacher of Virgil, and taught at their school in Naples. There are two poems attributed to Virgil in the Appendix Vergiliana, which mention Siro, and where the author speaks of seeking peace in the company of Siro:
I am setting sail for the havens of the blest to seek the wise sayings of great Siro, and will redeem my life from all care.
Cicero also mentions Siro several times and speaks of Siro along with Philodemus as being "excellent citizens and most learned men." The 5th-century commentator Servius claimed that Siro was commemorated in Virgil's sixth Eclogue as the character Silenus.

Olaya Herrera Airport () is an airport located in Medellín, Colombia, that serves regional and domestic flights. Additionally, the airport is used by general aviation and features several hangars for charters.
Today, it is considered the main regional airport of the country due to the large number of scheduled and charter flights operated to and from the airport. It was formerly known as Medellin International Airport prior to the opening of José María Córdova International Airport in the year 1985, which is located in the nearby municipality of Rionegro, east of Medellin. Between the two airports, there were more than 3.5 million passengers per year, which makes it the second busiest passenger city in Colombia after Bogotá.
In 2016, the airport handled 831,181 passengers, and 848,525 in 2017.
History
Colombian business person Gonzalo Mejía saw an opportunity for the development of an airport in Medellin, given that the mountainous topography surrounding the city made land transport to and from the area difficult, and that the nearest airport was in Puerto Berrio. They secured financing from wealthy business people, chose the land where the airport sits today and overcame obstacles imposed by the local government. They founded Uraba Medellin Central Airways and established it as a subsidiary of Pan American Airways, which at the time had the prospect of becoming the dominant player in global aviation. The airport opened on July 5, 1932, and was named after the then president of Colombia, Enrique Olaya Herrera, who had supported Mejía and their idea of an airport in Medellin.
In the 1940s the city was growing rapidly and new aircraft of the time required better facilities. Therefore, Mejía signed a contract in 1945 for the expansion of the runway and the existing facilities, a work that was completed on May 1, 1947.
In the 1970s, the airport was again over capacity and unable to meet demand, so the construction of new and larger José María Córdova International Airport in the nearby locality of Rionegro was announced. This resulted in the closure of Olaya Herrera Airport in 1986, a year after the new airport opened, and the reallocation of its land to a park. However, many people asked for the airport to remain open, and in 1991, it reopened with only domestic flights after a ruling by Aerocivil. In the same year it closed, the airport saw some improvements as a result of Pope John Paul II's visit to the city in July. The visit also inspired the name for the park which remains on the western portion of the airport grounds: the Aeroparque Juan Pablo II.
It was also one of the mainstays of carrier ACES from its beginnings to its demise in August 2003.
Today it is an airport with heavy use and constant growth (second in number of operations in Colombia) and was declared a national monument on October 19, 1995, for its historical, cultural, and architectural value for the city of Medellin and Colombia. In 2008, the national government gave the airport and five others in Colombia under concession to operating company Airplan, which is conducting a series of renovations to the terminal (at the time of writing they are ongoing).
With an investment of more than US$27 million, Airplan began the transformation under the parameters defined in its concession contract with the Aeronáutuica Public Establecimeinto Olaya Herrera. The modernization plan began in March 2009 and ends in 2014. Among the main objectives are to ensure aviation safety, passenger comfort, and meeting the requirements of ICAO, Aerocivil, and IATA. Olaya Herrera Airport operational spaces have Category B, according to IATA.
Structure and capacity
There are restrictions on the types of aircraft operating from the airport due to its classification as regional airport. Commercial flights can operate aircraft of up to 50 passengers, with the exception of Satena, which operates Embraer 170 aircraft carrying up to 76 passengers.
The passenger terminal has two waiting rooms off the main aircraft apron (which has a capacity of over 30 aircraft). It also has a shopping area with banking establishments, offices and shops, a food court, 11 double counters, airline check-in, a smoking room, and close connection with the Plaza Gardel.
The airport has 111 hangars located south of the terminal, where the executive offices of several commercial, charter, and cargo airlines, as well as flight schools can also be found. Aires Airlines built a hangar on the north end of the airport in order to service aircraft and reaffirm their commitment to Medellin and the new base of operations at the airport. Flight schools Aviation Antioqueña Academy and the Falcons School of Aviation, operate from the hangar area as well.
Along with five other airports, Olaya Herrera Airport was given in concession to private operator Airplan to manage. The proposed works include a total refurbishment of the terminal, the construction of a cargo terminal, repairing the track platform, implementing new security systems, the expansion and refurbishment of waiting rooms and baggage claim belts, construction of a new control tower on the west side, construction of a business aviation terminal that will serve domestic and international flights of this type (with the intention of encouraging the return of international flights to the airport), new shopping areas, among others.
Aerolínea de Antioquia has its headquarters on the airport property and has six hangars to store and perform maintenance on their planes. West Caribbean Airways, when it existed, had its corporate headquarters, operational center, and call center in Hangar 73 on the airport grounds.

Accidents and incidents
On 24 June 1935, Argentinian tango singer Carlos Gardel and nine others were killed in a collision between two Ford Trimotor airplanes at the airport.
On 1 March 1950, a C-47 (registration HK-507) operated by SAM crashed during approach to the airport after encountering adverse weather conditions. The aircraft was returning to the airport after a test flight following repairs to the left engine. During the approach, however, the airplane lost altitude due to severe weather and the left wing impacted a house causing the left engine to detach and the aircraft to plummet to the ground a few hundred meters short of the runway. The co-pilot and a mechanic on board the aircraft perished on impact.
On 13 June 1951, a C-47 (registration HK-504) operated by SAM took off from the airport for a cargo flight to Cartagena but crashed minutes later while attempting to return to the airport after experiencing technical problems. The 2-man crew and one person on the ground perished in the incident.
On 31 March 1991, a Vickers Viscount (registration HK-1708) of Intercontinental de Aviación made an emergency landing at the airport after experiencing an instrument failure during a cargo flight from El Dorado International Airport in Bogota to Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport on the Caribbean island of San Andrés. While cruising at both artificial horizons failed during turbulence and control of the aircraft was only regained at . Inspection after landing revealed structural damage beyond economic repair, probably caused by a gear collapse suffered previously on 14 February 1988.
On 30 November 1996, ACES flight 148 bound to Bahía Solano with a stopover in Quibdó (Chocó) stalled and crashed into a mountain after takeoff. Of the 15 people on board, 14 died in the crash. The cause of the stall and the subsequent crash was found to be the aircraft being overloaded.
On 15 October 2004, a Douglas DC-3C (registration HK-1504) belonging to carrier AeroVanguardia flew into electricity lines and crashed near Medellín on approach to Olaya Herrera Airport while performing a domestic cargo flight from La Vanguardia Airport, Villavicencio to José María Córdova International Airport, Medellín. The flight had been diverted to Olaya Herrera as alternate due to fog. The three crew were killed.
On 18 February 2009, a Basler BT-67 (registration PNC-0211) of the Colombian National Police was destroyed by the accidental detonation of a number of hand grenades. Eight people were injured, four of them seriously. The aircraft was due to fly 25 police officers to El Caraño Airport, Quibdó.
On 2 July 2013, two passengers on board an ADA flight attempted to rob someone outside the plane who allegedly had large sums of money and some kilograms of gold. Police started shooting at the assailants on the runway when they found out what was happening. Eventually three people were arrested. The incident caused the airport to be closed for around 45 minutes.

Library
The Scott County Public Library is located at 110 West 8th in Scott City. The Scott County Library was the first free county public library in the state of Kansas. It was started in September 1923 with the five members of the library committee each checking out a book for themselves and one for their husband thus the library checked out ten books on the first day that it was open. Two rooms on the second floor of the Cretcher Lumber Company office building were made available for the library. L. W. Cretcher, owner of the lumberyard, gave the library a boost by painting the rooms, furnishing a stove, shelves, cupboards, lights, and free rent. In November 1924 a proposal was placed on the ballot for the library to be a county funded entity. A room was set aside in the basement of the newly built courthouse for the library, which at that time possessed 861 books. The library in the courthouse was opened to the public in July 1925. The library remained in the basement of the Scott County Courthouse until a separate library building was constructed at 110 West 8th Street in 1964. This building was with a meeting room available to the public. In 2004, the Scott County Library Board began a fundraising effort for a Library Building expansion of . The Library expansion and remodel to was completed in May 2009.

Manpreet Juneja (born 12 September 1990) is an Indian cricketer who plays for Gujarat in domestic cricket.  They are a right-handed middle-order batsman. Juneja scored an unbeaten 201 on their first-class debut against Tamil Nadu in December 2011, becoming only the fourth Indian to score a double-century on first-class debut. T. A. Sekhar, the mentor of IPL franchise Delhi Daredevils, was said to have been tracking Juneja even before their debut and drafted them into the Daredevils squad in January 2012.
Juneja scored 796 runs from 8 matches at an average of 66.33 in the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. They had three centuries and three fifties to their name in the season.
In 2013 they along with Abdulahad Malek set the highest ever 4th wicket partnership in any forms of T20 cricket(202*)
Juneja made their IPL debut in 2013 (2013 Indian Premier League) against Kolkata Knight Riders.

747 is a piece of performance art by Chris Burden. Burden was photographed firing shots with a pistol at a Boeing 747 passenger airplane while it took off from Los Angeles International Airport at about 8am on January 5, 1973. The piece had a single witness, photographer Terry McDonnell, who filmed the act. Several years later, Burden was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after a photograph of the piece was published in a magazine. A calling card was left by the FBI at their studio and a meeting took place at their lawyer's house. Burden's lawyer explained the nature of Burden's work in performance art to the FBI agent.
Burden said of the act that "the plane wasn't in any danger. I went down to the beach and fired a few shots at a plane flying over head. I wasn't trying to shoot the plane down, it was a more gestural thing, trying to get it photographed — to make an image". Burden said in a 1980 interview with David Robbins that they told the FBI that the piece was "about the goodness of man — the idea that you can't regulate everybody. At the airport everybody's being searched for guns, and here I am on the beach and it looks like I'm plucking planes out of the sky. You can't regulate the world".
The piece is one of a number of photographs of Burden's work that in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
Critic Dominic Johnson in their 2018 book Unlimited action: The performance of extremity in the 1970s wrote of the piece that "threat of criminal damage, mass death and personal ignominy ground the formal challenge that confirms the action as a performance... Uncertainty, notoriety and doubt form part of a work's existential charm".
747 was analysed by Daniel Cottom in their 2002 essay on Burden's art "To Love to Hate". Cottom identifies the piece as belonging to the Western European artistic tradition of 'misanthropy' feeling that Burden "committed an artwork of terrific suggestiveness" when they fired the gun at the airplane.

USA-66, also known as GPS IIA-1, GPS II-10 and GPS SVN-23, was an American navigation satellite which formed part of the Global Positioning System. It was the first of nineteen Block IIA GPS satellites to be launched, and was the oldest GPS satellite still in operation until its decommissioning on 25 January 2016.
Background
Global Positioning System (GPS) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense to provide all-weather round-the-clock navigation capabilities for military ground, sea, and air forces. Since its implementation, GPS has also become an integral asset in numerous civilian applications and industries around the globe, including recreational used (e.g., boating, aircraft, hiking), corporate vehicle fleet tracking, and surveying. GPS employs 24 spacecraft in 20,200 km circular orbits inclined at 55.0°. These vehicles are placed in 6 orbit planes with four operational satellites in each plane.
GPS Block 2 was the operational system, following the demonstration system composed of Block 1 (Navstar 1 - 11) spacecraft. These spacecraft were 3-axis stabilized, nadir pointing using reaction wheels. Dual solar arrays supplied 710 watts of power. They used S-band (SGLS) communications for control and telemetry and Ultra high frequency (UHF) cross-link between spacecraft. The payload consisted of two L-band navigation signals at 1575.42 MHz (L1) and 1227.60 MHz (L2). Each spacecraft carried 2 rubidium and 2 Cesium clocks and nuclear detonation detection sensors. Built by Rockwell Space Systems for the U.S. Air force, the spacecraft measured 5.3 m across with solar panels deployed and had a design life of 7.5 years.
Launch
USA-66 was launched at 21:39:01 UTC on 26 November 1990, atop a Delta II launch vehicle, flight number D201, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration. The launch took place from Launch Complex 17A (LC-17A) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), and placed USA-66 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into medium Earth orbit using a Star-37XFP apogee motor.
Mission
On 30 December 1990, USA-66 was in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , a period of 714.8 minutes, and 54.8° of inclination to the equator. It was initially given PRN 23, which it used until its retirement in February 2004; however, it was subsequently reactivated broadcasting PRN 32 and in February 2008 it rejoined the operational constellation.
It is located in slot 5 of plane E of the GPS constellation. The satellite has a mass of . It had a design life of 7.5 years, but remained in service for over 25 years.
On 25 January 2016, USA-66 was decommissioned, and removed from the GPS constellation. When engineers took it offline, its disappearance triggered a software bug that left the timing of 15 of the remaining GPS satellites off by 13.7 microseconds, causing widespread GPS disruptions.

Bomberman 64: The Second Attack! is an action video game, the sequel to Bomberman 64 released in 1997. The game was not released in Europe. Due to a combination
of releasing late in the Nintendo 64's life cycle, minimal advertising, and mediocre reviews, the game is considered one of the rarest titles for the console.
Gameplay
In many aspects, the game plays identically to Bomberman 64, with features such as the ability to make bombs bigger. As opposed to the circular explosions of the first Nintendo 64 title, the explosions in The Second Attack are the traditional cross "+" shape.
Second Attack brought many new features to the game, such as:
The ability to use the different element crystals with bombs to create certain elemental explosions
A space shop to buy more heart containers, multiplayer stages on which to fight, and the move list of the next elemental astral knight to be fought
Hidden armor pieces that will allow Bomberman to kick bombs without needing the bomb kick item, the ability to throw and pump bombs without the throw item, and the ability to use remote bombs without need of the remote bomb item
Raise Pommy, a fighting partner, by giving them different types of foods. Pommy can also be played by a second human player with a second controller.
Story
In The Second Attack, Bomberman finds a mysterious egg while celebrating their victory over Altair and Sirius on a hot spring planet and decides to take it with them while exploring space in their ship. One day, however, Bomberman's ship gets sucked into a black hole, and they wake up to find themselves in a jail. While in jail, the egg suddenly begins to hatch. The creature inside turns out to be a charabom named Pommy. With the help of Pommy, Bomberman is able to escape.
Bomberman learns there are some elemental crystals being collected by the evil Rukifellth, and the Astral Knights, that hold the current crystals. They are missing the fire crystal which Bomberman has. It's up to Bomberman and Pommy to stop the new evil and retrieve the crystals. Along the way, they meet Lilith, a girl apparently working toward the same goal they are. They subsequently encounter them several more times throughout the game.
Little does Bomberman know that one of the knights is none other than Regulus (now under the name Bulzeeb), who still hasn't forgotten their last battle and their vow to settle their differences once and for all.
Once Bomberman defeats most, if not all of the knights, the way opens to Warship Noah, the cause of the black hole and the HQ of the BHB army. Inside, they face their toughest challenges, including fighting Lilith, now possessed by the goddess Mihaele (a female derivation of the archangel Michael), Rukifellth, whom it is revealed has been possessed by the demon Sthertoth all along (who kills Regulus), and finally Sthertoth themselves (name possibly derived from the Greek demon Stheno or the gods Set and Thoth). If Bomberman goes to the final confrontation without defeating all bosses first, Sthertoth will be impossible to defeat, resulting in a bad ending.
Otherwise, the true final boss of the game will reveal itself and challenge Bomberman to decide the fate of the universe, resulting in the good ending.
In the good ending, Mihaele reunites with Sthertoth (against their will) to become the Angel of Light and Shadow, intending to destroy and recreate the world, but the Angel is defeated by Bomberman, chooses to believe that they can defend the universe, and disappears to lie dormant, releasing Lilith and Rukifellth and reviving the Elemental Knights.
This game gives an origin to Bomberman's universe. The universe was created by an angel, but the angel split into a light and a dark entity, the dark side tried to take over all creation, but the light side made the seven elemental stones and warriors who could control them to fight off the dark side. The light side won and the dark entity was sealed in an additional stone.
The events in the game are set in motion when someone (Rukifellth) finds the stone and upon touching it is possessed by the dark entity, who then brainwashes the warriors created by the light entity to do their bidding (only Regulus resists) and sends them to find all seven elemental stones, so that they can regain their true form from the stone their body is sealed in. Bomberman was in possession of the Fire Stone, the last one they were missing.
Reception
The game received mixed reviews, with GameSpot stating that "Although Bomberman 64: The Second Attack! is not at all revolutionary, it is not especially well executed in any particular area, and it suffers noticeably in the graphics and sound departments, but it still has its moments" and IGN saying: "The game's look aspires to equal the quality first-generation titles like Super Mario 64 and Glover, but falls noticeably short" and "Cheesy music and sound effects never sounded so... average."
The game also brought praise, mostly on the single-player gameplay. GameSpot praised the single player mode, but considered the puzzles too short, saying "Overall, the single-player mode is right about average. Although the new bomb types add variety, most of the puzzles don't require much thought". IGN criticized the game length, but praised the game-play, as they say "The hidden stuff to be found and unlocked is way cool, but the length and difficulty of the one player mode is suspect." Allgame praised both the Pommy sidekick and the single-player mode, "his title does offer a fully developed single-player mode as well, in which the hero must travel to different areas, defeating enemy bosses and gaining new powers. Bomberman 64: The Second Attack! also introduces a cute little sidekick for the hero, who is occasionally helpful and who may "evolve" and grow in power if given the proper attention."

The Matra MS1 (abbreviation of Matra-Sports-1 ) was Matra's first open-wheel formula racing car, and was built in 1965. It was powered by a naturally aspirated, , Cosworth MAE inline four-cylinder engine, producing , mated to a 5-speed Hewland T.L.200 manual transmission, that drove the rear wheels. The body is constructed out of lightweight fiberglass, and the chassis is an aluminum monocoque.
Design
The vehicle was designed as a conventional formula racing car. Since Matra wanted to quickly achieve success in international motorsport, as much as possible was copied from the British Formula 3 racing cars of the time. The vehicle had conventional wheel suspension and a Cosworth engine. This was an innovation insofar as the previous racing cars, which were still designed under the leadership of René Bonnet, had Renault engines in the rear.
The MS1 was a test car that was used to explore the technical possibilities in Formula 3. The tanks were moved to the side panels, supported by crossbars. This design ensured the excellent stability of the racing cars. The MS1 was the basis for the racing model, the MS5. During a thorough inspection, aerospace technicians from Matra found leaks in the tanks and had them sealed by mechanics. This method was used time and time again on the Matra and ensured that problems with leaking tanks were extremely rare.

The VIKOR method is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) or multi-criteria decision analysis method. It was originally developed by Serafim Opricovic to solve decision problems with conflicting and noncommensurable (different units) criteria, assuming that compromise is acceptable for conflict resolution, the decision maker wants a solution that is the closest to the ideal, and the alternatives are evaluated according to all established criteria. VIKOR ranks alternatives and determines the solution named compromise that is the closest to the ideal.
The idea of compromise solution was introduced in MCDM by Po-Lung Yu in 1973, and by Milan Zeleny.
S. Opricovic had developed the basic ideas of VIKOR in their Ph.D. dissertation in 1979, and an application was published in 1980. The name VIKOR appeared in 1990 from Serbian: VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje, that means: Multicriteria Optimization and Compromise Solution, with pronunciation: vikor. The real applications were presented in 1998. The paper in 2004 contributed to the international recognition of the VIKOR method. (The most cited paper in the field of Economics, Science Watch, Apr.2009).
The MCDM problem is stated as follows: Determine the best (compromise) solution in multicriteria sense from the set of J feasible alternatives A1, A2, ...AJ, evaluated according to the set of n criterion functions. The input data are the elements fij of the performance (decision) matrix, where fij is the value of the i-th criterion function for the alternative Aj.
VIKOR method steps
The VIKOR procedure has the following steps:
Step 1. Determine the best fi* and the worst fi^ values of all criterion functions, i = 1,2,...,n;
fi* = max (fij,j=1,...,J), fi^ = min (fij,j=1,...,J), if the i-th function is benefit;
fi* = min (fij,j=1,...,J), fi^ = max (fij,j=1,...,J), if the i-th function is cost.
Step 2. Compute the values Sj and Rj, j=1,2,...,J, by the relations:
Sj=sum[wi(fi* - fij)/(fi*-fi^),i=1,...,n], weighted and normalized Manhattan distance;
Rj=max[wi(fi* - fij)/(fi*-fi^),i=1,...,n], weighted and normalized Chebyshev distance;
where wi are the weights of criteria, expressing the DM's preference as the relative importance of the criteria.
Step 3. Compute the values Qj, j=1,2,...,J, by the relation
Qj = v(Sj – S*)/(S^ - S*) + (1-v)(Rj-R*)/(R^-R*)
where S* = min (Sj, j=1,...,J), S^ = max (Sj, j=1,...,J), R* = min (Rj, j=1,...,J), R^ = max (Rj, j=1,...,J),; and is introduced as a weight for the strategy of maximum group utility, whereas 1-v is the weight of the individual regret. These strategies could be compromised by v = 0.5, and here v is modified as = (n + 1)/ 2n (from v + 0.5(n-1)/n = 1) since the criterion (1 of n) related to R is included in S, too.
Step 4. Rank the alternatives, sorting by the values S, R and Q, from the minimum value. The results are three ranking lists.
Step 5. Propose as a compromise solution the alternative A(1) which is the best ranked by the measure Q (minimum) if the following two conditions are satisfied:
C1. “Acceptable Advantage”: Q(A(2) – Q(A(1)) >= DQ
where: A(2) is the alternative with second position in the ranking list by Q;
DQ = 1/(J-1).
C2. “Acceptable Stability in decision making”:
The alternative A(1) must also be the best ranked by S or/and R. This compromise solution is stable within a decision making process, which could be the strategy of maximum group utility (when v > 0.5 is needed), or “by consensus” v about 0.5, or “with veto” v < 0.5).
If one of the conditions is not satisfied, then a set of compromise solutions is proposed, which consists of:
- Alternatives A(1) and A(2) if only the condition C2 is not satisfied, or
- Alternatives A(1), A(2),..., A(M) if the condition C1 is not satisfied; A(M) is determined by the relation Q(A(M)) – Q(A(1)) < DQ for maximum M (the positions of these alternatives are “in closeness”).
The obtained compromise solution could be accepted by the decision makers because it provides a maximum utility of the majority (represented by min S), and a minimum individual regret of the opponent (represented by min R). The measures S and R are integrated into Q for compromise solution, the base for an agreement established by mutual concessions.
Comparative analysis
A comparative analysis of MCDM methods VIKOR, TOPSIS, ELECTRE and PROMETHEE is presented in the paper in 2007, through the discussion of their distinctive features and their application results.
Sayadi et al. extended the VIKOR method for decision making with interval data.
Heydari et al. extende this method for solving Multiple Objective Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming problems.
Fuzzy VIKOR method
The Fuzzy VIKOR method has been developed to solve problem in a fuzzy environment where both criteria and weights could be fuzzy sets. The triangular fuzzy numbers are used to handle imprecise numerical quantities. Fuzzy VIKOR is based on the aggregating fuzzy merit that represents distance of an alternative to the ideal solution. The fuzzy operations and procedures for ranking fuzzy numbers are used in developing the fuzzy VIKOR algorithm.

Jorge I. Domínguez (born 1945), a scholar of Latin American studies in the United States, taught at Harvard University from 1972 to 2018, when they retired as the Antonio Madero Professor for the Study of Mexico.
They began their teaching career at Harvard in 1972, and in 1979 was granted tenure. From 1995 to 2006, they served as director of Harvard's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs. From 2006 to 2015, they served as Harvard's first Vice Provost for International Affairs in the Office of the Provost, and Senior Advisor for International Studies to the Dean of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences. They also chaired the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies, served as an associate of Harvard's David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, and as an associate of Harvard's Leverett House.
Domínguez has published books and articles on Latin America and, in particular, Cuba. In 1989, Abraham F. Lowenthal described them in Foreign Affairs as the dean of U.S. Cubanologists.
In February 2018, an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education alleged that Domínguez had committed acts of sexual assault and sexual harassment since the late 1970s. In response, Harvard launched a review of the allegations and placed Domínguez on paid administrative leave. They announced they would retire at the end of the Spring 2018 semester, and did so on June 18 of that year. Harvard's Title IX investigation concluded in May 2019 that Domínguez had engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct, and the university stripped them of their emeritus status and disinvited them from its campus. In January 2020, the Latin American Studies Association, of which they had been president, revoked their membership due to their violations of ethical standards.
Background and education
Domínguez was born in Havana, Cuba. They left Cuba with their family for the United States in 1960, when they were 15 years of age.
They attended Belen Jesuit Preparatory School in Miami, Florida, and in 1963 graduated from Fordham Preparatory School, in the Bronx in New York City. In 1967, they received their B.A. from Yale University. They went on to receive their M.A. (1968) and Ph.D. (1972) from Harvard University. They were a member of the Harvard Society of Fellows.
Academic positions
Domínguez began their teaching career at Harvard in 1972, and by 1979 was granted tenure.
They were the Antonio Madero Professor for the Study of Mexico at Harvard until their retirement in June 2018.
From 1995 to 2006, they served as director of Harvard's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs. From 2006 to 2015, they served as Harvard's first Vice Provost for International Affairs in the Office of the Provost, and as Senior Advisor for International Studies to the Dean of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Prior to their retirement, they also chaired the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies, and also as an associate of Harvard's David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, and an associate of Harvard's Leverett House.
Scholarship
Domínguez' books include: The Construction of Democracy: Lessons from Practice and Research; Between Compliance and Conflict: East Asia, Latin America and the New Pax Americana; The Cuban Economy at the Start of the Twenty-First Century; Mexico's Pivotal Democratic Election: Candidates, Voters, and the Presidential Campaign of 2000; Boundary Disputes in Latin America; Constructing Democratic Governance in Latin America; Mexico, Central, and South America: New Perspectives, The United States and Mexico: Between Partnership and Conflict; Democratic Politics in Latin America and the Caribbean; International Security and Democracy; Technopols; Democratizing Mexico; and Conflictos Territoriales y Democracia en America Latina.
Some articles written by Domínguez:
"How Asia Can Tackle Crises", The Straits Times; 19 July 2006
"A Legacy of Mixed Messages", The Boston Globe; 16 January 2006
"Bush Administration Policy: A View toward Latin America"; ReVista, Spring/Summer 2005
"Liberty for Latin America"; The Washington Post; 13 March 2005
"US and Cuba Cooperate on Many Issues"; The Miami Herald; 29 February 2004
"Cuba: Their Brother's Keeper"; Foreign Policy, 139; November/December 2003
In addition to their substantive academic contributions, Domínguez worked over the years to develop the scholarly field of Latin Americanist social science in four large-scale multi-book multi-authored projects involving authors from the United States and most Latin American authors.
First, they encouraged U.S. and Mexican scholars to carry out research on Mexican public opinion and voting behavior. In particular, a team of research colleagues developed panel studies to interview and re-interview individuals during the same presidential election campaigns (2000, 2006, 2012), and within a year or two made the primary data for these surveys freely and universally available on the Web.
Second, working with international teams that featured Cuban social scientists, Domínguez fostered research by Cuban academics and supported their research, writing, and publication in English to make such work better known. This endeavor spanned U.S.-Cuban relations, macroeconomic and microeconomic policies, poverty, social mobility, and territorial inequalities. For this effort to advance and make known the work of Cuban scholars, and for their own research, they received the lifetime contribution award from the Cuba Section of the Latin American Studies Association.
Third, as a founding member of the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Inter-American Dialogue, Domínguez and Dialogue colleagues generated assessments of the state of democratic politics across Latin America. The first book covered every country of Latin America, while the other three books focused on the large countries, with each volume featuring authors from across the continent. This project led to their appointment as a founding adviser for the non-profit Club de Madrid, whose members are former presidents and prime ministers of democratic countries the world over.
And fourth, Domínguez and Rafael Fernández de Castro designed a project of books on U.S. relations with key Latin American countries and subregions; most books with two authors — one from the United States, and one from the respective Latin American country. This project led also to their co-founding of Foreign Affairs Latinomérica and membership on its editorial board.
Sexual harassment and alleged sexual assault
In 1983, Domínguez was disciplined by Harvard's administration for "serious conduct" for sexually harassing Terry Karl, then a junior faculty colleague in Harvard's Government Department (later, a professor of political science and Latin American studies at Stanford University). They were forbidden to hold administrative responsibilities for three years. Nevertheless, Domínguez was subsequently promoted several times, and was appointed the Vice Provost for International Affairs.
On February 27, 2018, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that at least ten women, including graduate students and junior colleagues, described incidents in which Domínguez allegedly sexually assaulted or sexually harassed them, dating back to 1979 and continuing through at least 2015. According to the New York Times, allegations from other women "ranged in severity, from inappropriate full-body hugs to claims by one woman that they grabbed their buttocks and tried to put their hand down their pants." According to the article, Domínguez stepped between the former Venezuelan president, Rafael Caldera, and Karl as they approached one another at a Harvard reception; Dominguez, speaking in Spanish, then introduced Karl to Caldera as their "slave". Karl recounted that they told them one evening, while walking across campus following a meeting, that "this would be a nice place for a rape", making Karl fear for their safety. They felt that despite the administration's acknowledgement of their complaint, Harvard did not take the issue of sexual assault seriously. Some accusers recalled that they dropped classes, abandoned projects, or, as in Karl's case, left the university to escape him.
Domínguez said they were surprised and saddened by the allegations, suggested that their behavior may have been misinterpreted, and further said, "I do not go around making sexual advances."
In response to these accusations, Harvard University announced in March 2018 that it was soliciting additional information from university affiliates regarding Domínguez's alleged misconduct. They were placed on paid administrative leave pending conclusion of an internal review. Domínguez's membership in the Leverett House Senior Common Room was revoked.
On March 6, 2018, Domínguez resigned from their administrative positions and announced their intention to retire fully from Harvard at the end of the Spring 2018 semester. University administrators said that the sexual harassment investigations would not be affected by their retirement.
In May 2019, Harvard concluded its investigation, finding that Domínguez had engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct toward multiple people over a long time. As a result, Domínguez was stripped of their emeritus status and privileges, and disinvited from the University campus and sponsored events.
The Latin American Studies Association revoked the membership of Domínguez in January 2020.
In February 2021 Harvard formally apologized to Karl for failing to adequately enforce sanctions against Domínguez in their sexual harassment complaint against him.

Bureij () is a Palestinian refugee camp located in the central Gaza Strip east of the Salah al-Din Road in the Deir al-Balah Governorate. The camp's total land area is 529 dunums and in 2005, it had a population of 34,951 with 28,770 registered refugees.
The camp was established in 1949 with a population of 13,000 Palestinians from the broader Gaza area. A small percentage of the refugees were housed in the British army barracks but the bulk of them were housed in tents. The UNRWA built concrete homes in 1950 to replace the tents.
Most of the refugees today, like those in most camps in the Gaza Strip today, live in densely populated buildings. The camp does not have a sewage system and most waste accumulates in the Wadi Gaza, a stream north of the camp, and as a result poses a health hazard. Most of the camp's water comes from an Israeli water company.
Bureij has six primary and two secondary schools with a population of 9,306 pupils at the end of 2004. All schools are operated by the UNRWA.
Incidents in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
According to a UN report, on the night of 28 August 1953 bombs were thrown through the windows of huts in Bureij where refugees were sleeping and, as they fled, they were attacked by small arms and automatic weapons. According to Gelber, after one month of Unit 101 starting training "a patrol of the unit [] infiltrated into the Gaza Strip as an exercise, encountered [Palestinians] in al-Bureij refugee camp, opened fire to rescue itself and left behind about 30 killed Arabs and dozens of wounded." According to Bishara 43 Palestinian civilians with seven women amongst them were killed, and 22 wounded. The Mixed Armistice Commission report put the total at " 20" killed and twenty-seven seriously wounded and thirty-five less seriously wounded. Unit 101 suffered two wounded soldiers. Ariel Sharon, who had personally led the attack wrote in their report:
"The enemy opened fire on me from the northwest... I decided that it was better to pass through the camp and slip out the other side than to go back the way I came, because crops, gardens, barbed wire and guards made it difficult to move in that direction... I also decided that offensive action was better than giving the impression that we were attempting to escape... Therefore I invaded the camp with my group."
The raid was heavily condemned by the Mixed Armistice Commission, who called it “an appalling case of deliberate mass murder”, the raid was publicly criticized in the Israeli cabinet by at least one minister. The Mixed Armistice Commission, in an emergency meeting, adopted by a majority vote a resolution according to which the attack was made by a group of armed Israelis. Major General Bennike Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization stated that it was "probable in view of the fact that a quarter of the Israel complaints during the preceding four weeks referred to infiltration in this area" that the likely explanation was a "ruthless reprisal raid".
On 22 August 1988, Hani al-Shami from Bureij was killed by Israeli soldiers from the Givati Brigade. Maher Mahmud al-Makadma was shot and killed by IDF troops while painting slogans on 4 October 1989. On 20 September 1990, an Israeli soldier, Amnon Pommerantz, took a wrong turn into Bureij, panicked when stones were thrown, hit and wounded two children in a waggon while reversing, accidentally rammed a mosque and then got out and laid their rifle down and begged for mercy. They had to get back into their vehicle to shield themselves from stones, and was knocked unconscious. 3 youths doused the car with petrol and set it alight, incinerating Pommeranz. The culprits were identified by photos, and one turned themselves in when the Shin Bet kidnapped their 5 year old brother and threatened to send the boy to a detention camp where they would be raped, unless their elder brother surrendered. In retaliation, a large part of the Bureij camp was bulldozed in a collective punishment measure.
On 11 March 2002, a mass round-up of Palestinians took place when tanks entered the Bureij refugee camp killing two people. An IDF raid on 6 December 2002 by Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships led to 10 people being killed. A UN investigation found that eight of those killed in the attack were unarmed civilians. Of those, two were UN employees. On 6 March 2004 an Israeli raiding force was ambushed and came under fire.
An IDF raid on Bureij refugee camp in July 2007 by approximately 10 tanks and two bulldozers backed by helicopters was ambushed by members of Hamas's armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades killing an IDF soldier. On 6 October 2007, Israeli forces breaking into the eastern part of the camp with the cover of Israeli aircraft led to armed clashes in the camp.
An extra judicial assassination occurred on 27 February 2008 in the camp. During the Israeli shelling of the Gaza Strip in January 2009 ten people were injured at a UN health centre in the Bureij refugee camp and four people killed with 16 others wounded in a market.

On 11 April 1996, a fire began inside the passenger terminal of Düsseldorf Airport, Germany, killing 17 people. , it is the worst structural fire to have occurred in any commercial airport building. According to various sources, between 62 and 88 people were injured. The catastrophic conflagration is considered a prime example for a polystyrene fire, illustrating the flammability of such material. Approximately 1,000 firefighters were involved in extinguishing the blaze, which at the time was the largest fire response in the history of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Cause and timeline
The fire was caused by welding work done to an expansion joint on the elevated access road of Terminal A, which began at around 13:00. Droplets of molten metal started smouldering inside the polystyrene insulation on the dropped ceiling of the arrivals hall below. This slow fire spread out over a large area without being noticed.
At 15:31, a taxi driver informed the fire department that they had observed a few sparks falling out of the ceiling in the arrivals area. Two members of the airport fire brigade arrived on the scene a few minutes later, initially suspecting an electrical failure. At around 15:45, they learned of the welding work directly above, thus being able to finally identify the probable origin. By that time, smoke could be seen emanating from ceiling vents.
The situation ran completely out of control at 15:58. A flashover occurred, setting ablaze approximately of the ceiling within seconds. This was accompanied by an intense buildup of thick, black smoke. A total of 11 metric tons of polystyrene burned down, as well as numerous PVC cable coatings, releasing highly toxic substances including carbon monoxide, dioxins, hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen chloride. As there was neither a sprinkler system nor fire doors (which was not mandatory at that time), a wall of smoke spread through the terminal building.
At approximately 16:00 the headquarters of the airport fire brigade was informed about the extent of the fire, and reacted by calling for assistance from firefighters stationed in the adjacent municipalities. At 16:06, a general call for evacuation was put on the public address system of the airport. Until then, people in those parts of the airport that were not directly affected by the smoke had been unaware of the situation. Flight operations were halted at 16:36.
Many of the firefighters did not have any experience with fires of that kind, and necessary supplies were missing. The airport fire brigade had only been trained to address aviation accidents, not how to respond to a fire inside the airport building. At 19:20, the fire was under control, and it was declared to be put out at 21:30.
Victims
All victims died from smoke inhalation rather than from heat injuries inflicted by the fire.
Due to the thick smoke, nine passengers found themselves trapped inside the airport lounge of Air France on the mezzanine level above the arrivals hall of Terminal A. The self-service Salon was not staffed; passengers eligible to utilize the amenities were given an access code upon check-in. This may have contributed to the lack of knowledge about the nearest escape route which was only 8 metres away from the lounge exit. It led to a flat rooftop via two half staircases. Numerous phone calls were made from inside the lounge, the last one at 16:19. Although one of the victims described the location to be above the Lufthansa check-in, none of the involved personnel were aware of the exact location of the lounge, preventing it from being evacuated in time. All but one occupant suffocated. A French businessman managed to escape by smashing a window with a chair and falling 4 metres to the lower level. They were rescued at around 17:00, suffering from serious head injuries. They fully recovered from their injuries.
Seven people died in two elevators bringing people from the airport parking garage into the Terminal A arrivals hall, which at the time was fully ablaze. The victims had entered the elevators unaware of the fire, only to find themselves exposed to thick, toxic smoke which obstructed the optical door sensors, causing the elevator doors to remain open. A British soldier died inside a lavatory at the arrivals level of Terminal A. The last victim, an elderly woman, had initially escaped the fire but died two weeks later due to the consequences of smoke inhalation.
Aftermath
Due to the effects of fire and smoke, Terminals A and B were rendered unusable, and the total damage was estimated at DM 1 billion. Several airlines temporarily moved their operations to nearby Cologne/Bonn Airport, until tents had been put up at Düsseldorf Airport to provide interim check-in and baggage claim services. These were later replaced by light-metal barracks (Terminals D and E). By 1 July 1996, Düsseldorf Airport had returned to 90 per cent of its original passenger capacity.
Terminal A was extensively renovated, and Terminal B was demolished completely and rebuilt; the terminals reopened in 1998 and 2001, respectively.
Investigation
The official investigation into the accident revealed a number of safety and procedural flaws, as well as possible criminal offences:
The airport fire brigade had not been informed about the welding work, otherwise a fire watch would have been dispatched.
The highly flammable polystyrene sheeting inside the ceiling was installed illegally.
There were no operational procedures for a fire inside the terminal building. Firefighters were missing floor plans and access keys, and communication problems were encountered between members of the airport fire brigade and external forces.
The elevators were not put out of service once the general fire alarm was called.
In late 1996, a court trial was opened, charging a number of people including the two welders, the technical director of the airport, the architect, as well as building inspectors and supervisors. Following lengthy arguments over procedural questions, the case was postponed several times and finally abandoned in 2001, without a verdict identifying those responsible for the disaster.

L'Ami du peuple (, The Friend of the People) was a newspaper written by Jean-Paul Marat during the French Revolution. "The most celebrated radical paper of the Revolution", according to historian Jeremy D. Popkin, L'Ami du peuple was a vocal advocate for the rights of the lower classes and was an outspoken critic against those Marat believed to be enemies of the people, which they had no hesitation mentioning in their writings. These papers were considered dangerous because they often ignited violent and rebellious behavior.
Inception
As an elector for the District of the Carmes Déchaussés in 1789, Marat tried to persuade the electoral assembly to publish a journal to keep their electorate informed of current political events. When they did not take up their proposal, Marat resigned their post as elector in order to concentrate on writing a journal himself, at first entitled Le Publiciste parisien. The first issue was published 12 September 1789. After several issues, the name was changed to L'Ami du peuple.
Early struggles
The journal was printed in octavo format, usually eight pages long, although occasionally expanding to twelve or sixteen pages. Marat ordinarily published L'Ami du Peuple on a daily basis, but there are several gaps in its publication due to Marat's several times going into hiding to avoid arrest, during which they did not print their journal. Their continual attacks against Jacques Necker, Jean Sylvain Bailly, the comte de Mirabeau, the Paris Commune, the marquis de Lafayette, the National Constituent Assembly, the Legislative Assembly, the National Convention, the émigrés, and King Louis XVI themselves caused several decrees of outlawry and accusation against them and attempts to suppress their journal. Their press was destroyed and copies of L'Ami du peuple confiscated at least twice. On one occasion their printer was arrested and imprisoned, and the plates used to print an especially controversial issue—in which they threatened to tear out the heart of Lafayette, burn the King, and impale the deputies of the Assembly upon their seats—were destroyed.
Marat, with no source of independent income, used much of their own savings to print L'Ami du peuple. In early 1792, after returning from a two-month stay in England, they could not afford to continue the journal. With the financial support of their new common-law wife, Simone Evrard, they were able to renew publication. After the suspension of the monarchy on August 10, 1792, the Committee of Police and Surveillance of the Paris Commune gave Marat four of the royal presses, and the new imprimerie de Marat was set up in the basement of the Convent of the Cordeliers.
Marat's time in National Convention
On September 9, 1792, Marat was elected to the National Convention. On September 25, they began a new journal entitled Journal de la République française. In April 1793, the Girondists passed a law (later repealed) making it illegal for members of the Convention to be at the same time legislators and journalists; in response, Marat changed the name of their journal again—this time to Publiciste de la Révolution française—claiming to be a publicist, not a journalist. It would continue under this name until their death.
Marat resigned from the Convention on June 3, 1793, after the overthrow of the Girondists was complete. Their skin disease was now accompanied by a lung complaint, and they spent much of their time in a medicinal bath. Their journal during this time consists mostly of letters from their many correspondents. On July 13, Marat was murdered by Charlotte Corday; the last edition of their journal was published the day after their death.
Impact and influence
In all, Marat's L'Ami du peuple ran to nearly seven hundred issues, and the journal they began at their election to the Convention ran to nearly two hundred and fifty issues, in addition to their many other pamphlets. The popularity of their paper led to many counterfeits during their periods of hiding (by those in sympathy with their views and those wishing to misrepresent him) and after their death. Their incendiary journalism is credited with playing a significant role in the Women's March on Versailles in October 1789, the suspension of the monarchy on August 10, 1792, the September Massacres and inciting other actions of the revolutionary crowd.
In Marat's own words
Marat describes the start and evolution of their journal (alongside their political views) in their journal of March 19, 1793:
At the outbreak of the Revolution, wearied by the persecutions that I had experienced for so long a time at the hands of the Academy of Sciences, I eagerly embraced the occasion that presented itself of defeating my oppressors and attaining my proper position. I came to the Revolution with my ideas already formed, and I was so familiar with the principles of high politics that they had become commonplaces for me. Having had greater confidence in the mock patriots of the Constituent Assembly than they deserved, I was surprised at their pettiness, their lack of virtue. Believing that they needed light, I entered into correspondence with the most famous deputies, notably with Chapelier, Mirabeau, and Barnave. Their stubborn silence on all my letters soon proved to me that though they needed light, they cared little to be enlightened. I adopted the course of publishing my ideas by means of the press. I founded the Ami du Peuple. I began it with a severe but honest tone, that of a man who wishes to tell the truth without breaking the conventions of society. I maintained that tone for two whole months. Disappointed in finding that it did not produce the entire effect that I had expected, and indignant that the boldness of the unfaithful representatives of the people and of the lying public officials was steadily increasing, I felt that it was necessary to renounce moderation and to substitute satire and irony for simple censure. The bitterness of the satire increased with the number of mismanagements, the iniquity of their projects and the public misfortunes. Strongly convinced of the absolute perversity of the supporters of the old regime and the enemies of liberty, I felt that nothing could be obtained from them except by force. Revolted by their attempts, by their ever-recurrent plots, I realized that no end would be put to these except by exterminating the ones guilty of them. Outraged at seeing the representatives of the nation in league with its deadliest enemies and the laws serving only to tyrannize over the innocent whom they ought to have protected, I recalled to the sovereign people that since they had nothing more to expect from their representatives, it behooved them to mete out justice for themselves. This was done several times.

The word complexor was coined by Marcial Losada derived from the words "complex order", to refer to chaotic attractors that are strange and thus have fractal structure (in contrast to fixed point or limit cycle attractors).
Losada claimed that these trajectories reflect the creativity and innovation that characterize high performance teams, while in contrast, low performance teams have trajectories in phase space that approach the limiting dynamics of point attractors. The modeling behind this claim has been strongly criticised for flawed methodology and as an invalid application of Lorenz equations by Brown et al. and by Andrés Navas.

The Irish Catholic Women's Suffrage Association (ICWSA) was an organisation for women's suffrage which was set up in Dublin in November 1915. The association was established rather late in the struggle for women's suffrage (the Catholic Women's Suffrage Society was formed in the UK in 1911), despite the fact that most of Ireland's population was Catholic. Many also considered it risky to start a suffrage association with the potential of war looming over Ireland. Its founder members included Mary Hayden, a professor of modern Irish history at the University of Dublin and the first female to serve in the senate of the National University of Ireland (1909-1924), and Mrs. Gwynn (wife of Stephen Gwynn) who was the Honorary Secretary of the association. The association was non-party, non-militant, and was established to "organise Catholic women to fight for suffrage," educate public opinion, bring Catholic women to realise the need for the female vote, and do the "common good in the name of Catholicism".
Meetings
When the ICWSA was established, they operated from an office at 15 Ely Place in Dublin, Ireland. Their first meeting was on March 29, 1915 and all following meetings were held every two weeks. The ICWSA began with 60 members, all women, and their numbers steadily increased. In their first meeting, Mrs. Gleeson, an involved member, designed a badge for the group which featured a Celtic symbol in green, blue, and white. Members wore these badges at meetings and at public events. During their meetings, members supplied the afternoon tea which they drink while reading articles "concerning women's interests". During their meetings Hon. Secretary Mrs. Gwynn and Mrs. Mary Hayden gave speeches on what they had accomplished and what they planned to do in the future. The members of the ICWSA also paired up with other suffrage groups to protest or petition the government.
Suffrage, temperance, and women's rights efforts
In April 1915 the ICWSA paired up with other suffrage groups to petition the sale of alcohol in Ireland. They wanted the government to place limits on how much alcohol you could purchase. In October, the ICWSA held a public meeting in the Mansion House and gave a lecture on “Women teachers and the Vote”. Later that year, in November, they petitioned to the English and Irish prime minister to “demand inclusion of women” in certain bills and give them the right to vote. In December a member, Mrs. Cantwell, held a meeting at their home, where members could bring a friend or guest to participate or observe. Many of the visitors ended up joining the association. Early in 1916 the ICWSA petitioned the Home Office for the return of a female factory inspector to Ireland. The inspector was the only female inspector in Ireland and had been moved to England. The ICWSA claimed that they wanted them to return in order to “safeguard the rights of Irish factory girls”. Their petition was unsuccessful. That year they also printed two pamphlets called “The Irish Citizen” and “An American Priest on Votes for Women” which they handed out at polling booths during the election in Dublin. These pamphlets discussed why Irish women Should be able to vote.
End of the ICWSA
The ICWSA disbanded between 1916 and 1918 due to women getting the right to vote and the possibility of war (The Irish War of Independence).
“Looking back over the past year we are greatly encouraged by what has been accomplished. Looking forward we see far more to be done for when this calamitous war is over we must be prepared for our responsibility and claim our right to help in reconstructing dislocated social conditions.” - Hon. Secretary Mrs. Stephen Gwynn.

Club Atlético Tigre is an Argentine professional football club located in Victoria, Buenos Aires. Tigre currently plays in the Primera División, the top level of the Argentine football league system, having secured promotion as the 2021 Primera Nacional champion. Its name comes from Tigre, the city in which it was founded. Since its foundation in 1902, the club's colors have been blue and red.
Tigre plays its home venues at Estadio José Dellagiovanna (named after its first president), which has a capacity of 26,282 spectators.
History
On 3 August 1902, a group of twelve young men led by José Dellagiovanna, met at their house in Partido de las Conchas (former name of Tigre Partido) with the purpose of establishing a sports club. The name given to the recently formed institution was "Club Atlético Juventud del Tigre", with Dellagiovanna elected as its first president. They played their first football match vs C.A. Las Conchas, won by Juventud del Tigre 3–1. The club wore a blue shirt with red collar, black short and socks.
In 1911, the team registered to the Argentine Football Association to be able to compete in official tournaments. By those times, the institution changed its name to "Club Atlético de Tigre". When dissident Federación Argentina de Football was established in 1912 after the first schism in Argentine football, Tigre affiliated to it. The team began to wear a striped blue and red shirt.
The first title won by the club came in 1912, when Tigre was crowned champion of División Intermedia (the second level by then), earning promotion to Primera División after beating Argentinos de Vélez Sarsfield 4–2 in the final held at Estadio G.E.B.A.
Tigre debuted in Primera División, the top division of Argentine football, on 1 May 1913 against Porteño; the match concluded in a 0–0 draw. The team played its home matches on a field located on Rocha street, near Reconquista River in Rincón de Milberg. Its first field was inaugurated on 2 December 1913. When a new schism came in 1919, Tigre registered to dissident Asociación Amateurs de Football, which lasted until 1927, when both leagues, AAmF and AFA joined.
In 1931, the first professional league of Argentina, Liga Argentina de Football, was created, with Tigre affiliating to it. Under professionalism, Tigre debuted on 31 May 1931 vs San Lorenzo at Estadio Viejo Gasómetro, and Tigre lost 4–2. Nevertheless, in 1934 a reduction in the number of Primera Division teams caused Tigre and Quilmes to be relegated into the Second Division. This meant Tigre left the top division after 21 consecutive seasons.
At the beginning of 1931, Tigre sold striker Bernabé Ferreyra to River Plate for m$n50,000. The transaction was described as "the most expensive pass for a player in the history of world football" by the local media. Ferreyra had played for Tigre during 6 years, with an average of +1 goal per game.
After the selling of Ferreyra, another forward, Juan Marvezzi, arrived to the club in 1937. They would score 116 goals over 173 matches between 1937 and 1943, becoming Tigre's all-time top scorer.
In October 1944, the club received then vice-president of Argentina, colonel Juan Domingo Perón, in front of a crowded stadium. The president of Tigre, Mario Piotti, appointed Perón –a confessed supporter of the club– as "honorary president" of the club.
In 1945, Tigre won its first official title, the Second Division championship, which allowed the club to return to Primera. The club remained in the top level for a few seasons before being relegated again in 1950, along with Rosario Central.
Tigre remained in the second tier until 1953, when the team won its second title, and returned to Primera División again, where the club remained until another relegation in 1958. During that brief stint in the top level, Tigre got its best performance until then, finishing 6th in the 1955 season. It was at that time when Tigre was nicknamed El Matador (The Killer) by El Gráfico journalist Osvaldo Ardizzone.
Tigre returned to Primera División in 1967, after being promoted along with Club Atlético Los Andes in the "Reclasificatorio", a tournament contested by the last six teams of Metropolitano and the four top teams from Primera B. Nevertheless, the club would be relegated again, and in 1971 was sent to Primera C, the third division of Argentine by then.
In 1979, Tigre returned to Primera División, with Juan Carlos Lorenzo as the sports director. A curiosity of that year: while Tigre was on the rise, it sold more tickets than Racing Club, San Lorenzo de Almagro and Independiente. At national level, it finished 4th only behind Boca Juniors, River Plate and Rosario Central. The following season, after poor results, the club returned to the second tier
In 1982, Tigre and San Lorenzo set the attendance record in the second division. More than 70,000 tickets were sold for the match that was played at Estadio Monumental. As of today and by different regulations of AFA, it will hardly be exceeded at any time.
In 1991, the club was relegated into the third division (Primera B Metropolitana). In 1994, Tigre won the Clausura tournament of the Metropolitana, but lost the promotion final to the Apertura champion, Chacarita Juniors. Tigre was finally promoted to the Nacional B (Second tier) the following season, in 1995. However, the club only lasted there one season, and were directly relegated. In 1998, the club was promoted to Nacional B again, and was close to achieving promotion to the Primera Division the following season, but was eliminated in the playoffs.
In 2005, The team became two-time champion of the Primera B Metropolitana by winning both the Apertura and Clausura tournaments, with a record number of points obtained. In both tournaments, the team had only lost one match.
In the club's first season back in the second tier, the 2005–06 season, the club placed 7th in the overall table, one position away from qualifying for the playoffs. In the 2006–07 season, the club placed 5th in the overall table and got itself into the promotion playoffs, which was called the "Torneo Reducido". In the final, Tigre defeated Platense 2–0, which allowed the club to play the promotion playoff final. Tigre beat Nueva Chicago 3–1 over two legs, and would be able to play in the highest division of Argentine football after more than two decades.
In its first tournament back, the 2007–08 season, Tigre finished runner-up of the Apertura tournament. The external factor to this campaign was the massive support; in almost all the matches of the tournament, Tigre sold out its tickets, both in Victoria and away from home. All this left the popular recognition in the football environment that Tigre had been widely the revelation of the tournament, and that Argentine football had recovered a great.
For the 2008 Apertura, Tigre was one goal away from becoming champion, but finished runner-up again. The club finished with a total of 39 points, tied for first place along with San Lorenzo and Boca Juniors, but ends as runner-up after playing a historic triangular final. It must be considered that the AFA modified, in the midst of their dispute, the rules of this tournament. Originally it had established that in the event of a tie for first place, the champion would be decided according to head-to-head results between the teams occupying that place. Tigre defeated San Lorenzo and Boca Juniors, both as visitors, so it was appropriate to award the club the title. However, with the imposed modification, the triangular had to be disputed.
In 2012 Clausura the club was runner-up in the Primera Division again. Tigre started the season thinking about not being in the relegation table, but ended up exceeding the expectations by fighting for the league title until the last date. At the end of that same year, after eliminating Colombian side Millonarios in the semifinals of the 2012 Copa Sudamericana, it reached its first international final in its history, where the club lost to São Paulo in the finals.
Despite having been relegated at the end of the 2018–19 Primera División championship, 2019 was the most successful year in the history of the club as Tigre won its first title in Primera División, the Copa de la Superliga, by beating Boca Juniors 2–0 in the final at Mario Kempes Stadium. Coached by Néstor Gorosito, Tigre's initial line-up was Gonzalo Marinelli; Matías Pérez Acuña, Gerardo Alcoba (c), Néstor Moiraghi, Nicolás Colazo; Sebastián Prediger, Lucas Menossi, Diego Alberto Morales, Walter Montillo, Lucas Janson; Federico González. The goals were scored by González and Janson. Besides, 20,000 supporters of El Matador travelled to Córdoba to attend the match.
That win allowed Tigre to play the Trofeo de Campeones vs Racing Club (winner of the 2018–19 league) at Estadio José María Minella in Mar del Plata. Nevertheless, Racing beat Tigre 2–0.
In 2020, Tigre was the only Argentine team that played the top continental competition, Copa Libertadores, that was not competing in the top division but in Primera B Nacional.
In November 2021, Tigre won the Primera Nacional title (also their first one in the division) after beating Barracas Central 1–0 in the final match. Therefore the Matador will play in the top division of Argentine professional football since the 2022 season.
Kit evolution
During the first years of the club, the shirt was blue with a red collar. On the chest, the legend "Juventud del Tigre" (original club name). For the first game v C.A. Las Conchas, the team wore that shirt. A blue and red striped jersey appeared between 1911 and 1911, being alternated with the traditional blue.
With the affiliation to dissident "Asociación Amateurs de Football", in 1919, the regulation of the use of colors privileged San Lorenzo de Almagro in the use of a striped design. The now traditional blue with a red horizontal stripe began to be worn in the mid 1940s. During the 1960s, the club worn a blue and red hoops jersey that had been worn by Italian club Sampdoria.
Stadium
Throughout its history, Club Atlético Tigre had 3 grounds, although the most popular is the current Estadio Jose Dellagiovanna, located in Victoria, Greater Buenos Aires.
In 1935 the land of Guido Spano was acquired and on 29 December the Foundation Stone was placed where the current Victoria stadium would be built. The land in front of the avenue was acquired with the certain possibility of expanding the number of supporters. Many internal struggles were generated by this determination. Former members, who did not understand at the time the perspective that this change offered to the club, decided to leave the institution. The president at that time was León Bourdieu.
It was inaugurated on 20 September 1936, in a friendly against Boca Juniors. On 27 September 1936, the first official match was played at the stadium, with Club Atlético Independiente beating Tigre 1-0 as part of the First Division league championship organized by the AFA. On 6 December, Tigre had its first victory at the stadium, defeating Ferro Carril Oeste 2–0.

The Festival Western de Saint-Tite is a major annual event held in September, in Saint-Tite, Quebec, Canada.
Voted "Best Outdoor Rodeo in North America" since 1999, Saint-Tite's festival, now in its 52nd edition, attracts around 600,000 visitors every year.
It developed from a rodeo inaugurated in 1967 to promote the leather industry.
It hosts a major rodeo competition, along with other cultural events.
During the two weeks of competition, the entire town shuts down to accommodate spectators.
History
In 1967, a Saint-Tite company specializing in leather work organized a rodeo as a marketing operation on a local sports ground. The event hosts nearly 6,000 visitors and is so successful that it quickly formed several committees to repeat the experience in subsequent years. The active and voluntary participation of citizens is the basis of the event and contributes to the concretization of the company. Efforts are being made to introduce a professional rodeo and equestrian competitions. In 1968, the parade with animal traction made its appearance. Over the years, several activities are added to the festival, always around a Western theme.
In 1972, large wooden stands are inaugurated for the spectators of the rodeo.
Over the years, the city of Saint-Tite, the festival organization, the city's businesses and citizens have gradually changed the look of the infrastructure to make the city look like a Wild West village.
This transformation is visible by the following aspects:
A fountain, near the church, is topped by a sculpture depicting a cowboy riding a wild horse.
A western-style four-sided clock is installed at the main intersection of the city.
Road signs indicating the street names have been modified to make them look western.
The shops often have a permanent exterior decoration to the western style. While some have completely changed the outside of their business, most are content to have stylized the name of their business.
Households can participate each year in a decoration contest from outside their home. While most citizens install fences, poles and colored lights, some create articulated decorations with electric motors or cover their entire terrain with western-style objects.
In 1999, the wooden platforms were demolished to make way for new steel platforms with a capacity of 7,243 places.
The Saint-Tite Western Festival is a non-profit organization whose mission is to produce professional rodeos and activities designed to recreate a country-western atmosphere. While promoting an incomparable atmosphere, the event aims to maximize major socio-economic and tourist benefits within the city of Saint-Tite, the MRC Mékinac and throughout the Mauricie region. All this to obtain a radiation at the international level.
A must-attend country-western event and benchmark in terms of professional rodeo in Eastern North America, the Western Festival of Saint-Tite has carved out a place for itself in its region and its community. Its growth is the result of the work of a large number of passionate men and women.
The Organization's vision is to set the standard for producing rodeos and country-western activities in Eastern North America.
In 2008, the festival attracted 585,581 visitors, including 100,000 for the horse-drawn parade.

Deshawn L. Parker (born January 8, 1971 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is a Thoroughbred horse racing jockey who is a two-time United States Champion. In addition, on May 2, 2016 they became only the thirty-second jockey in the history of North American Thoroughbred racing to win 5,000 races. On June 21, 2022 while racing at Horseshoe Indianapolis, Parker rode their 6,000th career winner, For Mama, becoming one of only 21 jockeys to reach that rarified air.
Career
Deshawn Parker began their professional riding career in 1988. At 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), they are one of the tallest jockeys in racing. In their first five years riding from 1988 through 1992, Deshawn Parker won just 60 races in total. The next year they won 72, more than the previous five combined and continued to improve. In 2002 they broke into the 200 level and in 2008 reached 300 plus wins for the first time and would accomplish that for five straight years including 2011 when they attained 400 wins.
In 2010, Deshawn Parker won 377 races to earn their first national title. It marked the first time an African-American had done so in the sport since James "Soup" Perkins one hundred and fifteen years earlier in 1895. Parker won their second national title in 2011 with 400 wins.  They are also the winningest African-American in history. On May 6, 2012 Parker won six races on a single racecard at Mountaineer Racetrack in New Cumberland, West Virginia where they had made their home base for many years and where they are the all-time leading jockey in wins. In 2012, they were honored by the Jockeys' Guild with its Laffit Pincay Jr. Award and twice has been a finalist for the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award.

Harsil, the Himalayan paradise, is a village, tourist hill station and army area located on the banks of the Bhagirathi River, on the way to Gangotri, a Hindu pilgrimage site in Uttarkashi district of the Indian state of Uttarakhand.
Situated at an altitude of 9,005 ft (2,745 metres.) from sea level, Harsil lies 78 km. from Uttarkashi, and 30 km away from the Gangotri National Park which is spread across 1,553 square km. The hill station is well- known for its natural environment and apple production.
Background
Etymology
According to the local legend, the Harsil got its name from the rivers Bhagirathi and the Jalandhari as once they had an argument over their significance. Lord Vishnu, also known as Hari, was asked to intervene. They turned themselves into a great stone, a shila, and absorbed their anger. Even today, after Hari-shila (or Harsil), the waters of the two rivers have become a little less turbulent.
History
Harsil lies on the old caravan trail between Tibet Autonomous Region and India, where trade & marriages once flourished.
Harsil has been under the Kingdom of Garhwal. In 1815 Anglo-Nepal War, British raj sided with the Kingdom of Garwal and as a reward they were given the eastern half of Garhwal.
In mid 19th century, apples and rajma cultivation was introduced to Harsil by Frederick Wilson, which became Himachal's main cash crops. In 1842, "Frederick Wilson", also called "Frederick “Pahari” Wilson" and "Pahari Wilson", a 25-year-old Englishman, deserted the East India Company's army and fled to remote Harsil where they made fortune by logging deodar trees and selling those to British for the construction of railways. They were nicknamed "Raja of Harsil" by locals, even issued own coins. They were a friend of A.O. Hume and Rudyard Kipling, later's novel The Man Who Would Be King was inspired by the story of Wilson. Journalist Robert Hutchison wrote a book "The Raja of Harsil" on Wilson. A local deity's priest cursed them for destroying the forests and ecology. After they died in 1883, their 3 sons squandered the inheritance and died, their last known descendant, who had joined the Indian Air Force, died in air crash after the World War II. Sunderlal Bahuguna, founder of Chipko Movement, blamed Wilson for Garhwal's ecological destruction. Marco Pallis, Peaks and Lamas (New York, Knopf, 1940) includes an account of a visit to Harsil and environs in the 1930s.
Geography
Harsil Valley has a cluster of around eight villages near the India-China border. Upper reaches of Harsil are connected to Nelang Valley. It is also connected to the Baspa Valley by several passes including the Lamkhaga Pass.
Demography
Over the years, a small number of Jadhs, an ethnic group of the Bhotiyas, have settled here, and speak a language closely resembling Tibetan. There is also a sizeable Tibetan settlement in a close vicinity to ITBP Campus housing a Stupa (Buddhist Burial Mound) and beautifully carved wooden houses.
Military setup
Army area
Harsil army area is a base camp of Garhwal Scouts and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). Since it is close to the disputed India-China Border, it is of military significance. On 6 November 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Harsil to celebrate Diwali with ITBP soldiers.
Defence Institute of Bio-Energy Research
Harsil has a field station of the Defence Institute of Bio-Energy Research (DIBER), earlier known as the Defence Agricultural Research Laboratory (DARL), run by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). DARL, engaged in the research and development of bioenergy as well as the sustainable and eco-friendly high altitude agro-technologies in the Indian Himalayan Region for the use of Indian Military, has developed a range of vegetable varieties suitable for mid to high altitude. Haldwani in April 2008. During the Golden Jubilee year of DRDO, the laboratory was renamed from DARL to Defence Institute of Bio-Energy Research (DIBER) with a new mandate and thrust areas.
DIBER has its origin in an Agriculture Research Unit (ARU) established 1960s at Sitoli, which was renamed to DARL in the 1990s and to DIBER in 2008. Harsil filed research station was established in May 1973.
Tourism
Gangotri pilgrimage
Harsil is part of Chota Char Dham's Gangotri yatra (pilgrimage) route. The idol of the Hindu River Goddess Ganga (Ganges) is brought down from the shrine at Gangotri in the upper Himalayas after Diwali and kept at 'Mukhba' village near Harsil. It remains there throughout the winter when Gangotri is snowbound and inaccessible.
Eco alpine mountain tourism
Government is developing the cluster of 8 villages of Harsil valley, as well as Nelang Valley for the tourism by creating tourist facilities. India's first snow leopard conservation centre is being established in the region. During the summer tourist season, path to Gartang Gali cliff-side hanging stairway is open, along which homestays in the native villages are developed. Natives of the border villages, Sukki, Mukhba, Harsil, Bagori, Dharali, Jhala, Jaspur and Purali are trained as nature conservation and adventure guides for eco-tourism trekking, bird-watching, flora and fauna. Harsil town is being beautified, tourist lights being installed similar to those at Nainital and Mussoorie, telescopes being set up at several places for star gazing.
Transport
Gangotri Char Dham Railway's railhead at Maneri (62 km south on NH-34) is the nearest railway station. Nearest airports are Dehradun Airport (220 km southwest) and Shimla Airport (375 km west).
Harsil is on NH-34 within the Char Dham Highway network. The "Karcham-Harsil Road", nearly 150 km long route, was announced in 2020 which will link Karcham on NH-5 (site of Karcham Wangtoo Hydroelectric Plant) to Harsil, both in Himachal Pradesh. It will cut down present 450 km long distance, which take nearly 16 hours, to just nearly 150 km or 2 to 3 hours. Since Karcham and Harsial are 26 km and 52 km away from the Line of Actual Control (LAC) respectively, the new road will also enable the faster deployment of troop. This new road, to be constructed by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) at a cost between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 crore, is in addition to the 73 previously approved India-China Border Roads (ICBR).

Poecilodryas is a genus of passerine birds in the Australasian robin family Petroicidae.
The genus was erected by the English ornithologist and bird artist John Gould in 1865. The type species was subsequently designated as the buff-sided robin (Poecilodryas cerviniventris). The genus name combines the Ancient Greek poikilos "variegated" with dryad "tree-nymph".
Species
The genus contains four species:
Formerly, some authorities also placed the following species (or subspecies) in the genus Poecilodryas:
Brown-backed whistler (now Pachycephala modesta in the family Pachycephalidae)
Golden monarch (nitidus) (now Carterornis nitida in the family Monarchidae)
Black-throated robin (now Plesiodryas albonotata)
Banded yellow robin (now Gennaeodryas placens)

Dendrocoelum italicum is a cave-adapted freshwater planarian which is endemic to Bus del Budrio cave in the Italian Prealps.
Discovery
This planarian species was discovered by the Italian entomologist Mario Pavan on 18 October 1936 in a subterranean pool below a waterfall in Bus del Budrio cave in northern Italy. The specimens were sent to the Italian biologist Maffo Vialli, who described the species, naming it Dendrocoelum italicum.
Human impact and habitat restoration
During the 1980s, a pipe was installed in the cave, diverting the water that originated the waterfall to a nearby farm. As a consequence, the pool inhabited by D. italicum dried up permanently. The species survived in a very reduced environment formed by a small rivulet and some ponds created by water dripping from the roof of the cave. This critical situation was discovered in 2016 and led to a restoration program to save the species.
On 3 December 2016, all planarians were removed from the rivulet and stored in plastic tanks inside the cave. Afterward, the pipe and its associated structure were removed from the cave, allowing the water to follow its natural curse and restoring the pool. On the next day, the planarians were released in the pool. The ecosystem was monitored until January 2018, when it was concluded that the restoration was successful and the population of D. italicum was stable.

Hellinsia paleaceus is a moth of the family Pterophoridae described by Philipp Christoph Zeller in 1873. It is found in North America, including Florida, Mississippi Maryland, Montana, Texas, California, Nebraska, New Mexico and south-eastern Canada. It has also been recorded from Puerto Rico.
The wingspan is . Adults have been recorded from March to September.
The larvae feed on Vernonia gigantea, Vernonia missurica, Vernonia noveboracensis, Vernonia angustifolia, Vernonia blodgettii and Vernonia cinerea (Cyanthillium cinereum). They feed on the young foliage of their host plant. Young larvae are dingy white, with a tinge of green. Later instars become pale glaucous, often varying, especially in the late fall brood, to dull salmon. Pupation takes place in a pupa with quite variable colour and markings. In the spring brood, it is commonly dull green, with indistinct yellow lateral stripes. In the fall brood, the dorsum is pale yellow or flesh color, with two fine indistinct mediodorsal lines of lilac color. The pupa is quite active and irritable, striking about in all directions when meddled with.

In broadcast programming, a hot switch or hotswitching is where the ending of one television show leads directly into the start of the show in the next time slot without a television commercial break. The concept is used to reduce the chances that people will switch to another TV network during the commercial break and allow the cold open of the new show to attract viewers; sometimes however, this will cause a commercial break right after the opening credits. It can also be called "seamless" broadcasting and is frequently used during television marathons and back-to-back airings of episodes of the same series. The technique is also used by many local network affiliates in the United States to seamlessly transition from a local newscast to a network newscast.
Examples
In December 1992, for the premiere of The Jackie Thomas Show, a hot switch was used where the end of an episode of Roseanne had the Connor family watching the new show on television, and then the new show began. To see if this worked, ABC paid ACNielsen for a minute by minute ratings report, and found that most viewers stayed with the new show for the entire pilot episode.

USS Oklawaha (AO-84) was a acquired by the United States Navy for use during World War II. They had the dangerous but necessary task of providing water to smaller vessels not fitted with water-makers in combat and non-combat areas.
They were laid down on 10 February 1943, as a Maritime Commission type T2-SE-A2 tanker hull under a Maritime Commission contract at Marinship, Sausalito, California. They were launched on 9 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Van W. Rosendahl, and commissioned as USS Oklawaha (AO-84) on 9 March 1944, Commander Walter L. Sorenson in command.
World War II operations
Following conversion and fitting out for carrying potable water, and after shakedown operations off the west coast, Ocklawaha sailed on 19 May 1944 for duty with Service Forces Pacific (ServPac) during the remainder of World War II. They arrived at Eniwetok, Marshall Islands, in June 1944 to provide potable water for and to become a part of the forces being assembled there for the Marianas operations. Following the conquest of Saipan and Guam, they continued to supply fresh water in the forward areas, transporting 12 additional loads from Pearl Harbor and Manus to Eniwetok, Ulithi, Guam, Kossol Passage and Leyte Gulf. During this period, they delivered water to 809 ships, mostly landing vessels actively engaged in amphibious operations against the Japanese.
Ocklawaha returned to San Pedro, California, on 1 June 1945 for overhaul, then deployed again to the Western and South West Pacific areas where they continued their service operations until 29 May 1946. They returned to San Pedro on 15 June, transited the Panama Canal on 28 June, thence proceeded to New York where they decommissioned on 19 July. They were struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and transferred to the Maritime Commission on 23 April 1947.
Transferred to MSTS
Reacquired by the U.S. Navy on 22 May 1948, Ocklawaha was simultaneously transferred to the Marine Transport Lines, Inc. then assigned on 1 October 1949 to the Military Sea Transportation Service manned by a merchant crew. As USNS Oklawaha (T-AO-84) they saw active service in the Far East during the Korean War, then after alternating from active to inactive status for several years was struck from the Naval Register again and transferred to the Maritime Commission on 9 June 1959 for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. They were sold for scrapping, 2 September 1975, to Luria Bros. & Co. Inc. for $390,525.78. Ex-Ocklawah was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet, to River Development Corp., Kearny, N. J. where they arrived 20 September 1975.

The 1832 Sligo cholera outbreak was a severe outbreak of cholera in the port town of Sligo in northwestern Ireland.
The outbreak resulted in an official total of 643 deaths, out of a population of 15,000. However, the official figures are considerably lower, as only Fever Hospital deaths were recorded.
Background
The outbreak was part of a second worldwide pandemic caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae and lasted from 1829 to 1851. The approach of the cholera epidemic was well documented at the time, but how it was spread was a mystery. In the first pandemic, the disease was first noted in India, Moscow, Russia in 1830, Finland and Poland in 1831, and Great Britain in 1831. It struck first at the ports, and Sligo was the second busiest port on the west coast at the time after Limerick. Overall, the outbreak killed at least 50,000 people in Ireland.
Cholera killed those infected within hours, usually less than three, and almost certainly less than twelve. Victims skin often showed a bluish tinge, and diarrhoea led to rapid severe dehydration and death.
Outbreak
The only surviving medical report is by a Dr. Irwin, then attached to the Fever Hospital
The first case of Cholera Asiatica (as it was known then) was noted at Rathcarrick, three miles from the town by a Dr. Coyne on Sunday 29 July. More cases then appeared at Culleenamore, suspected to have been spread by bathers. Dr. Coyne later died of the disease himself.
The Board of Health had the houses of the poor whitewashed and cleaned inside and out. Tar barrels were left burning in the streets in an effort to fumigate the air. Attempts to set up extra medical facilities in the town were resisted by the townspeople, as nobody wanted the infected to be anywhere near them. People armed with clubs and sticks resisted doctors and hospitals being among them. In many cases, doctors themselves were blamed for the outbreak.
The outbreak began in Sligo town on 11 August 1832, with the first official figures for Sligo town being released by Dublin Castle on 18 August. These recorded 63 new cases, 22 deaths and no recoveries. From then until the end of the month the death toll averaged fifty a day. The Fever Hospital was used for the sick, but most of the orderlies fled through fear of the plague or the mob. Mr. Fausset, the Provost of the town, described the grounds of the Fever Hospital covered in corpses and no-one to bury them. They said they felt as if the "end of the world had come".
Carpenters were unable to keep up with the demand for coffins and so mass graves were dug instead.
and local legend suggests that people were buried alive, so great was the haste to dispose of the corpses.
An unofficial quarantine cordon was set up around the town through which no one was allowed to pass, but they were driven back to the town.
Efforts to understand the source of the infection included the flying of kites to see if it had an atmospheric origin. Wells were tested.
At the height of the outbreak the population was reported by the Evening Post to have dropped from 15,000 to 2,000, most having fled to the countryside.
Aftermath
The official number of cases was recorded as 1,230, with 643 deaths, although the real toll is suspected to have been considerably higher as many did not report being ill and there was a widespread reluctance to go to a hospital. It was thought that the actual death toll was more than 1,500 people. The population of the town dropped from 15,000 to 12,000.
Charlotte Blake Thornley's account
Charlotte Blake Thornley, the mother of Bram Stoker was a witness to the cholera outbreak as the family were living on Gaol Street in the town at the time. They survived by fleeing to Ballyshannon having to break the cordon to do so. They wrote a vivid account of the beginning and aftermath of the outbreak.
It is believed that their descriptions of the events at the time were influential on themes and atmosphere of their sons most famous book, Dracula.

The Liberals won a minority government in this election, and Waugh sat with their party on the opposition benches. They were defeated in the 1922 election, losing to John Muirhead of the United Farmers of Manitoba by 135 votes.
Waugh attempted to return to the legislature in the 1927 election, but lost to Muirhead by only 34 votes. They challenged Muirhead again in the 1932 election, and this time lost by 236 votes.
They served as mayor of Carberry from 1938 to 1945. Waugh died in Carberry in 1945.

The Lotus 112 was the proposed 1995 Formula One car of Team Lotus.
Conception
The Lotus 112 was Team Lotus' planned entry to the 1995 Formula One season. It was a stillborn project conceived by chief designer Chris Murphy throughout their final Formula One campaign in 1994. Originally the designation of Type 112 was to be for the model that became the Lotus Elise. However, that car was given type number 111 instead, in homage to the original Lotus Eleven.
As a project little had been confirmed about the car's final specification. It was rumoured that Lotus were intending to include the promising higher-spec Mugen-Honda ZA5D engine, which had shown great promise at its first outing during the 1994 Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Johnny Herbert had qualified their Lotus 109 4th on the grid before being shunted by a late-braking Eddie Irvine at the Rettifilio. However, in an attempt to reduce the costs associated with an exclusive engine deal Lotus may have had to use a Ford (Cosworth) unit.
Team Lotus were also planning to retain their final 1994 driver line-up of Alessandro Zanardi and Mika Salo.
In appearance the 112 was broadly similar to other Chris Murphy designed Lotuses. It did, though, incorporate a new and distinctive arrow nose and an unusual pushrod arrangement on the front suspension. Despite this radical departure, the car's construction retained certain characteristic hallmarks. The tub would have been constructed from the traditional Lotus composite of carbon aluminium honeycomb, with the bodyshell being processed out of carbon fibre. Only a few parts of the 112 were ever fabricated before the project was suspended, along with the scale model for wind tunnel testing which was later to be found in the aeronautical engineering department of City University. Wind tunnel tests were promising, with the car producing a lot more downforce compared to the 109. The 112 also passed the mandated FIA crash tests.
Team Lotus demise and impact on the 112
On 17 January 1995 new owner David Hunt (younger brother of 1976 world champion James) was forced to close down Team Lotus in the face of crippling debt and lack of sponsorship for the forthcoming season.
The Lotus 112 therefore became the last Team Lotus type designation.
David Hunt effectively merged what was left of Team Lotus with Pacific Grand Prix with that team renamed Pacific Team Lotus for 1995. The season was unsuccessful with Pacific also going under at the end of the year.

The al-Madhara'i () were a family of officials from Iraq who served as and virtually monopolized the posts of director of finances (‘āmil) of Egypt and Syria for the Tulunid dynasty, the Abbasid Caliphate, and the Ikhshidid dynasty, between 879 and 946. In this role, they amassed "one of the largest personal fortunes in the medieval Arab east" (Thierry Bianquis).
As its nisba shows, the family hailed from the village of Madharaya near Wasit in lower Iraq. The first member to rise to prominence was Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Madhara'i, who in 879 was named controller of finances by the autonomous ruler of Egypt and Syria, Ahmad ibn Tulun (reigned 868–884), a post they kept until their death in 884. They named their sons Ali and Abu Ali al-Husayn as their representatives in Egypt and Syria respectively. Ali succeeded their father and became vizier under Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun (r. 884–896) and during the brief reign of Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh, along with whom they were murdered in 896. They were in turn succeeded as fiscal director by their son Abu'l-Tayyib Ahmad (died 915), while another son, Abu Bakr Muhammad served as vizier to the penultimate Tulunid ruler, Harun ibn Khumarawayh (r. 896–904).
Following the end of the Tulunid dynasty and the re-imposition of direct Abbasid control over their domains in 904–5, many of the family and its followers were deported to Baghdad, but al-Husayn, who had maintained contacts with the Abbasid court, was appointed in charge of the Egyptian finances. The family now became involved in factional struggles between the leading bureaucratic factions in Baghdad, siding with the opposition to the Banu'l-Furat clan. Its fortunes fluctuated as a result. In 913, al-Husayn was moved once more to Syria, while their nephew Abu Bakr Muhammad took over in Egypt, but both were dismissed in 917. Al-Husayn again served as financial director of Egypt in 919–922, and for a third and final time (along with Syria) from 926 until their death in 929. The last important representative of the family, al-Husayn's nephew Abu Bakr Muhammad, took over the direction of Egyptian finances in 930–933, under the governorship of their friend Takin al-Khazari. In 936 they tried without success to oppose the takeover of Egypt by Muhammad ibn Tughj, and was imprisoned. Released in 939, they played a leading role in the governance of the new Ikhshidid state until their dismissal in 946, after Ibn Tughj's death. They retired into private life, and died in 957.

Lees Football Club is a defunct Cork-based Gaelic Athletic Association club on the southside of Cork city, Ireland. The club was founded in 1886 and was primarily concerned with the game of Gaelic football. The club had a strong association with the Lee Rowing Club and the teams were largely made up of West Cork men working in the city.
By the late 1920s the club was almost defunct and at the 1929 AGM of a rival club, Nils, the chairperson "stressed the fact that Gaelic Football was in a deplorable state in the city at the present time, and teams of long connection with the GAA like Nils and Lees, found it almost impossible to put a single senior team on the field when a couple of years back they could put senior, intermediate and junior teams. There was certainly work for an organiser here to organise Gaelic football in Cork City and help to bring it back to the high position in the GAA which it held some years back."
Lees spent 111 years on top of the Cork SFC Roll of Honour
—including 98 consecutive years—and were only passed by Nemo Rangers in 2002. Their total of 111 years is the fourth best in SFC history behind Commercials Limerick (122 years), Tullamore GAA (115 years) and Ballina Stephenites (115 years).

Trailokyanath Mukhopadhyay or T. N. Mukharji in British Indian Government records (, Troilōkyanātha Mukhōpādhyāẏa) (22 July 1847 – 03 November 1919) was an Indian public servant who served as a curator of the Indian Museum at Calcutta, and was a renowned author who wrote both in English and Bengali. They were in-charge of organizing exhibits for the Calcutta International Exhibition of 1883, the Amsterdam Exhibition in the same year, the 1886 Colonial and Indian Exhibition, and the 1888 Glasgow International Exhibition. Their travels in Europe as part of this was published as a popular travelogue A Visit to Europe (1889).
Life
Trailokyanath was born in the village of Rahuta, near Shyamnagar in the North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. Attending school in Hugli-Chuchura and Bhadreswar but largely self-taught, they became a school teacher in Daroka (Birbhum), Ukhra, Raniganj and in Sahajadpur, Sirajganj. From 1868 they served as a police sub-inspector in Cuttack (1868). Having learned Oriya, they joined Bhagavati Charan Das's Utkal Subhakari as editor. Later meeting Sir William Hunter, the compiler of A Statistical Account of Bengal (which historically included modern Bangladesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa), they joined the Bengal Gazetteer Office as a clerk (1870). They became a chief clerk in the Agriculture Department and rose to become its assistant director, before joining the Government of India revenue department (1881). They helped in organizing the exhibits for the Calcutta International Exhibition of 1883. From 1886 they were a assistant curator of the Indian Museum in Calcutta. In 1896 they retired on a pension.
During India's Great Famine of 1876–78, which had been aggravated by Viceroy Lytton's policy of exporting Indian wheat and other cash crops, Troilokyanath advised the government that it could save many lives by promoting the cultivation of carrots; the policy was adopted in the Raebareli and Sultanpur districts of Uttar Pradesh. F. N. Wright notes: "How wonderfully life was preserved in our upper districts by the extension of carrot cultivation, and how important it is to introduce crops (1) which do not fail under the same conditions as the staple crops of the country, and (2) which give a substantial fodder supply in the cold and dry months. Our chief expectations this direction rest upon (1) lucerne in irrigated tracts, mangelwurzel" — a type of beet grown mainly for animal feed — and "(3) extension of the cultivation of carrots, potatoes and other root crops to districts where they are little known."
Literary career
Trailokyanath Mukhopadhyay was a famous writer, one of the pioneers of secular Bengali literature. One of their most famous works is ডমরু-চরিত (Damru Charit), a collection of humorous and satirical short stories published posthumously in 1923. The stories, set in colonial India, recount the life and times of the antihero Damrudhar, portrayed as a dishonest man who rises from a lowly shop-assistant to a landowner.
Together with Nagendranath Basu, Trailokyanath compiled the first volume of Bangla Bishwakosh, a Bengali-language encyclopedia; Nagendranath completed the remaining 22 volumes.
Some of Trailokyanath Mukhopadhyay's short stories are translations/adaptations of English fictions. These include “Pithe Parbane Chine Bhut “ (adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Brown Hand), “Bhuter Bari” (adaptation of Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton's “The Haunted and the Haunters: or the House and the Brain”) and “Pujar Bhut” (adaptation of Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell's “The Old Nurse's Story).
An English translation of several of their stories is published as Of Ghosts and Other Perils (Arnab Bhattacharya, trans., 2013: Orient Blackswan, 288 pages. ). That book includes Birbala, Lullu, Nayanchand's Business, The Pearl Necklace, Smile on Madan Ghosh's Face, A Story by Damrudhar and Another Story by Damrudhar.

Bo Fuzhun, also Bofuzhun (Chinese language: 勃匐準 Bo-fu-zhun, ruled from 745 CE per Chinese sources) was a ruler of the Turk Shahis.  They are only known in name from Chinese imperial accounts and possibly numismatic sources. The identification of their coinage remains conjectural.
Chinese accounts
Bo Fuzhun appears in the Chinese annals of the Old Book of Tang, which record many dynastic events and ethnological information about the polities of Central and Southern Asia in the 6th-8th century, which were nominally under Chinese suzerainty and part of the Protectorate General to Pacify the West. According to the Old Book of Tang, in 745 CE, Fromo Kesaro, king of the Turk Shahis, sent a request to the Chinese court in order to abdicate in favour of their son Bo Fuzun (勃匐準). These events are again recorded in the Chinese annals Jiu Tangshu and Tang Huiyao.
Coinage
According to Kuwayama the coinage of Bo Fuzhun corresponds to the late Turk Shahi coinage marked "Śrī Vāsudeva", and designed in the style of the coinage of the Sasanian Emperor Khosrow II. These coins follow the design of the coin of Khosrow II (ruled 590-628) issued in their regnal years 26,27,36 and 37. "Vāsudeva" would be a regnal name that they adopted as they obtained the throne of Uddiyana (烏萇國).
Relation with Khingal
There is a possibility that the Khingal of the Arabs, a ruler of the Turk Shahis, is identical with the Bo Fuzhun.

Redmon & Vale was an American country music duo formed in 1997 by Allison Redmon and Tina Vale, both of whom served as vocalists. They met through a common friend, with whom they initially performed as a trio before deciding to work as a duo instead after the trio split up.
The duo released a self-titled studio album and two singles in 1999 on DreamWorks Records. The album included two singles, both of which charted on the Billboard country charts. Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time gave the album a negative review, saying that it "mine[d] the generic, overproduced field of bland pop country." A reviewer for The Technique, the student newspaper for the Georgia Institute of Technology, gave the album a more positive review, noting that the two singers seemed to focus more on harmonies than most other country groups. The album's first single, "If I Had a Nickel (One Thin Dime)" reached No. 65 on the country charts, while the second single, "Squeezin' the Love Outta You", peaked at No. 74. The latter was also recorded by Carolyn Dawn Johnson (who co-wrote it) on their 2004 album Dress Rehearsal.

Shirebrook South is a former railway station in Shirebrook, north eastern Derbyshire, England.
See also
There have been four separate stations with "Shirebrook" in their names:
Shirebrook South which is the subject of this article
Shirebrook North which was actually in Langwith Junction,
Shirebrook Colliery (later renamed Shirebrook Colliery Sidings) for colliery workmen's trains only, and
Shirebrook station which is on the Robin Hood Line.
Shirebrook South, Shirebrook Colliery Sidings and Shirebrook North have been closed for many years. Shirebrook West closed in 1964 but reopened in 1998 as plain "Shirebrook". Shirebrook West was actually on the eastern edge of the village.
Context
The station was built by the GNR as part of their Leen Valley Extension which enabled trains to run from to via Sutton-in-Ashfield, Skegby, Pleasley and Shirebrook South.
History
The Leen Valley Extension started at Kirkby South Junction where it left the Great Central Main Line. It was opened northwards in stages, with passenger services as far as Skegby commencing with some fanfare on 4 April 1898. The line through Pleasley (later renamed "Pleasley East") station opened for mineral traffic as far as Shirebrook Colliery on 26 November 1900. Passenger services were extended north of Skegby to Pleasley and Shirebrook (later renamed "Shirebrook South") on 1 November 1901. The high embankment through the village of Shirebrook which completed the Leen Valley Extension by connecting the GNR's Shirebrook (later "Shirebrook South") and the LD&ECR's Langwith Junction (later "Shirebrook North") was opened on 29 May 1901.
The passenger service then settled down to five trains per day plying between Shirebrook (later Shirebrook South) and Nottingham Victoria, with two extra on Wednesdays and Saturdays. There was no Sunday service. The GCR took the LD&ECR over in 1907, so after that date The Leen Valley extension joined the Great Central at both ends. Nevertheless, until 1925 local passenger trains ran North from Nottingham Victoria and terminated at Shirebrook (later Shirebrook South), despite Shirebrook North being only a mile further on. To modern eyes this appears like running trains along the East Coast Main line from Edinburgh and terminating at Finsbury Park instead of Kings Cross. From 1925 trains started running the last mile to Shirebrook North, but the writing was already on the wall.
The railways in these parts were built primarily to carry coal. Local passenger services were typically loss-making and got in the way of freight traffic. The Shirebrook North - Shirebrook South - Nottingham Victoria service was withdrawn on 14 September 1931.
The line remained open for six purposes:
coal
through freight services
local freight services
diversions if the GCML was overloaded or under repair,
special trains, notably for football matches and enthusiasts, and
Summer excursions.
Shirebrook South closed for local goods on 4 February 1957.
Summer weekend excursions to places such as Skegness continued to call at Shirebrook South up to September 1964, at which point the station became redundant and closed completely.
The GCML closed North of Nottingham in September 1966, so diversions also ended, but a last hurrah was a sleeping car service from Marylebone to Glasgow which passed through Shirebrook South in the wee small hours from 1962 to 1964.
Collieries closed or rationalised production, for example Pleasley Colliery joined underground with Shirebrook Colliery and sent its coal to the surface that way. At one time coal from Shirebrook Colliery could be sent out via the Leen Valley Extension or via what is now the Robin Hood Line, that, too, was rationalised so it only went the latter way.
Through freight dwindled or went by other routes, so fewer trains passed through the Shirebrook South site.
A Stephenson Locomotive Society "Farewell" railtour traversed the line on 4 May 1968.
The line was closed on 27 May 1968 and has since been lifted. Shirebrook South station has been razed to the ground and the massive embankment between Shirebrook South and North has been removed, with striking visual impact.

Rabbi Yitzchok Yosef Zilber (1917–2004) was a Russian, later Israeli-Russian Haredi rabbi and a leader of the Russian baal teshuva movement.
Early life
Rabbi Yitzchok Zilber was born in Kazan, Russia, several months before the Bolshevik Russian Revolution in 1917. Their father, Rabbi Ben Tzion Chaim Zilber (originally Tsiyuni), a respected rabbinic scholar and rabbi of the city of Kazan, refused to send their son to an anti-religious Soviet school and taught them privately at home, teaching them Jewish law and tradition as well as secular knowledge.
By the time young Yitzchok Zilber was 15, they were giving classes in Judaism across the town, despite the fact that this was against the Soviet law.
Their brilliance gained them entrance to the faculty of Mathematics of the University of Kazan despite never having attended public school. Rabbi Zilber married Gita Zeidman, and they had four children – Sarah, Ben Tzion Chaim, Chava, and Fruma Malka.
Life under Communist rule
After World War II, Rabbi Zilber was imprisoned in a gulag for a technical accidental crime (a fellow Jew left some illegal papers by him, and a search revealed them. They did not want to tell to police whom had left the papers by them and so they were consequently imprisoned. Ironically, the owner themselves regretted Rabbi Zilber being imprisoned for them and went to the police to admit their responsibility. As typical to Russia at the time, they happily admitted them to prison as well, leaving Rabbi Zilber there as well). They were forced to do heavy menial labor, but later attested to having never violated the Jewish Sabbath and other Torah commandments. Indeed, they taught Torah to other Jewish prisoners.
Rabbi Zilber received amnesty after Stalin's death in 1953, and returned to Kazan. While not openly violating state rules, in 1960 the KGB started harassing him, making a cover story about the sorry children of a religiously fanatic father who makes them suffer for Jewish laws etc. A large gathering was announced in the school where they taught and in the school where their wife taught. They were barred from their teaching job, and the KGB also attempted to take their children away from him, and promising their wife an apartment and a quiet life if they would agree to a divorce.
When they received an invitation for an interview in the KGB, Yitzchok Zilber fled from Kazan, and after a long journey stayed in Tashkent and was able to move their family there a short time later. The family tried to emigrate to Israel, but was refused for years, until they finally received permission and emigrated in 1972.
Life in Israel
When they arrived in Israel, Rabbi Zilber was shocked to find that the vast majority of Russian-speaking Jews were not observant and for the most part, completely ignorant, of Jewish law and tradition. They undertook to change this situation, and began teaching extensively throughout the country as well as organizing circumcisions, since the Israeli rabbinate was not as yet prepared for such a large number of immigrants who needed to have a circumcision performed.
Rabbi Zilber worked tirelessly to help Russian women receive gittin (bills of divorce) after being abandoned by their husbands. Many of them were "complicated by the fact that the partners of the broken marriage were often living in different countries, and locating them was far from easy". However locating them was often necessary to comply with Jewish law. Often this was meant endless efforts, exquisite inventiveness, and (as they put it in their autobiography) "a large dose of Divine providence". At the end of their autobiography they share a sample from their "impressing collection of unusual stories" that came out of this endeavor.
They were available to everyone who came to seek their advice, which led to their fame in certain circles as "the father of Russian Jewry." Rabbi Zilber taught in Russian organizations such as Dvar Yerushalayim, Torat Haim, the Russian division of Ohr Somayach, Shuvu, and Shvut Ami. In 2000, they established the Toldos Yeshurun organization to provide Jewish education to the secular Russian Jews, which continues their work today, under the guidance of their only son, Rabbi Ben Tzion Zilber.
Rabbi Yitzchok Zilber died in 2004, on the eve of Tisha b'Av (the Ninth of Av), the greatest day of tragedy in Jewish history.
Influence
Rabbi Yitzchok Zilber's books – especially their autobiography To Remain A Jew, their Talks on Torah, a collection of essays on the weekly Torah portion, The Fire will not burn you – are very popular among Russian-speaking Jews and have inspired many to return to their Jewish heritage and become baalei teshuva or learn more about Judaism.
Their extensive teaching and personal guidance has brought thousands of Russian-speaking Jews to observance, and transformed large parts of secular Russian Jews into religious communities. The vast majority of Russian-speaking Rabbis, Torah teachers and Jewish leaders today are either their students or students of their students. Their son is Rabbi Ben Zion Zilber a teacher and adviser to Russian Jews.
Their sons-in-law are Rabbi Avraham Kooperman, teacher in the Mir Yeshiva, Rabbi Chaim Zavdi, a mashgiach ruchani, and Rabbi Yosef Shvinger, director of a State organization governing holy places in the land of Israel.

Kayla Clarke (born 6 August 1991) is an Indigenous Australian swimmer who represented Australia at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in swimming, and has medalled at the 2010 Australian Disability Age Group Nationals, and 2010 International Paralympic Swimming World Championships, 2009 Queensland State Championships, 2009 Queensland Secondary School Titles, and 2009 Global Games. They compete in a number of events, including the 100m freestyle, 100m backstroke, 100m breaststroke, 100m butterfly and 200m individual medley.
Personal
Clarke was born in Silkstone, Queensland. They have an intellectual disability. They attended Ipswich Central High School and Bremer State High School, and was named the 2009–10 Ipswich News YoungStar Sports winner.
Swimming
Clarke started swimming competitively in 2007, and competes in the S14 classification. They were a member of the Woogaroo Swimming Club, and was coached by Tony Keogh, who became their coach in 2008. They have a swimming scholarship with the Queensland Academy of Sport, is involved in the Australian Institute of Sport program, and received in Australian Government Direct Athlete Support (DAS) funds in the 2011–12 financial year. One of their major swimming rivals is fellow Australian swimmer Taylor Corry.
At the 2009 Queensland State Championships, they won five gold medals in their classification races. The Queensland Secondary School Titles that year ended with their winning seven first-place finishes, and they earned five gold medals, a silver medal two bronze medals at the 2009 Global Games.
In 2010, they won eight gold and two silver medals at Australian Disability Age Group Nationals, and competed in the International Paralympic Swimming World Championships, where they finished second with a personal best time of 1:11.13 in the S14 100m backstroke event. They also finished fourth in the 200m freestyle and fifth in the 100m breaststroke.
Clarke became affiliated with the Yeronga Park Club in 2011 in an effort to make the Paralympic Games, and switched coaches, taking on Rick Van Der Zant as their new coach. The 2011 Australian national championships saw them win six golds in seven events, including the 100m freestyle, 100m backstroke, 100m breaststroke, 100m butterfly and 200m individual medley. They competed in the inaugural 2011 Para Pan Pacific Championships, where they finished first in the S14 200m freestyle event, and at the 2011 Can-Am Swimming Open, in which they posted first-place finishes in the 100m backstroke and 200m freestyle events.
Clarke was selected to represent Australia at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the S14 100m backstroke, 200m freestyle and 100m breaststroke events. These were their first Paralympic Games, and they were the only female swimmer from Queensland. Going into the Games, they were ranked second in the world in the 100m backstroke. They trained for the Games in China in order to acclimatise, and participated in a two-week-long national team training camp in Cardiff prior to the start. Support for their Paralympic efforts came from sponsors including TogTastic Racing and Training Swimwear. They made the finals in all three events, but finished outside the medals, being placed fourth in the 200m freestyle and 100m breaststroke, and sixth in the 100m backstroke.
Clarke won five gold and a silver medal at the 2014 Pan Pacific Para-swimming Championships in Pasadena, California. After the Championships, they underwent shoulder surgery.

In cryptography, a verifiable random function (VRF) is a public-key pseudorandom function that provides proofs that its outputs were calculated correctly. The owner of the secret key can compute the function value as well as an associated proof for any input value. Everyone else, using the proof and the associated public key (or verification key), can check that this value was indeed calculated correctly, yet this information cannot be used to find the secret key.
A verifiable random function can be viewed as a public-key analogue of a keyed cryptographic hash and as a cryptographic commitment to an exponentially large number of seemingly random bits. The concept of a verifiable random function is closely related to that of a verifiable unpredictable function (VUF), whose outputs are hard to predict but do not necessarily seem random.
The concept of a VRF was introduced by Micali, Rabin, and Vadhan in 1999. Since then, verifiable random functions have found widespread use in cryptocurrencies, as well as in proposals for protocol design and cybersecurity.
Constructions
In 1999, Micali, Rabin, and Vadhan introduced the concept of a VRF and proposed the first such one. The original construction was rather inefficient: it first produces a verifiable unpredictable function, then uses a hard-core bit to transform it into a VRF; moreover, the inputs have to be mapped to primes in a complicated manner: namely, by using a prime sequence generator that generates primes with overwhelming probability using a probabilistic primality test. The verifiable unpredictable function thus proposed, which is provably secure if a variant of the RSA problem is hard, is defined as follows: The public key PK is , where m is the product of two random primes, r is a number randomly selected from , coins is a randomly selected set of bits, and Q a function selected randomly from all polynomials of degree over the field . The secret key is . Given an input x and a secret key SK, the VUF uses the prime sequence generator to pick a corresponding prime (the generator requires auxiliary inputs Q and coins), and then computes and outputs , which is easily done by knowledge of .
In 2005, an efficient and practical verifiable random function was proposed by Dodis and Yampolskiy. When the input is from a small domain (the authors then extend it to a larger domain), the function can be defined as follows:
where e(·,·) is a bilinear map. To verify whether was computed correctly or not, one can check
if and . To extend this to a larger domain, the authors use a tree construction and a universal hash function. This is secure if it is hard to break the "q-Diffie-Helman inversion assumption", which states that no algorithm given can compute , and the "q-decisional bilinear Diffie-Helman inversion assumption", which states that it is impossible for an efficient algorithm given as input to distinguish from random, in the group .
In 2015, Hofheinz and Jager constructed a VRF which is provably secure given any member of the "(n − 1)-linear assumption family", which includes the decision linear assumption. This is the first such VRF constructed that does not depend on a "Q-type complexity assumption".
In 2019, Bitansky showed that VRFs exist if non-interactive witness-indistinguishable proofs (that is, weaker versions of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for NP problems that only hide the witness that the prover uses), non-interactive cryptographic commitments, and single-key constrained pseudorandom functions (that is, pseudorandom functions that only allow the user to evaluate the function with a preset constrained subset of possible inputs) also do.
In 2020, Esgin et al. proposed a post-quantum secure VRF based on lattice-based cryptography.
Uses and applications
VRFs provide deterministic pre-commitments for low entropy inputs which must be resistant to brute-force pre-image attacks. VRFs can be used for defense against offline enumeration attacks (such as dictionary attacks) on data stored in hash-based data structures.
In protocol design
VRFs have been used to make:
Resettable zero-knowledge proofs (i.e. one that remains zero-knowledge even if a malicious verifier is allowed to reset the honest prover and query it again) with three rounds in the bare model
Non-interactive lottery systems
Verifiable transaction escrow schemes
Updatable zero-knowledge databases
E-cash
VRFs can also be used to implement random oracles.
In Internet security
DNSSEC is a system that prevents attackers from tampering with Domain Name System messages, but it also suffers from the vulnerability of zone enumeration. The proposed NSEC5 system, which uses VRFs, provably prevents this type of attack.
In cryptocurrency
Cardano and Polkadot implement VRFs for block production.
The Internet Computer cryptocurrency uses a VRF to produce a decentralized random beacon whose output is unpredictable to anyone until they become available to everyone. More precisely, its protocol allows clients to agree on a VRF (i.e. a commitment to a deterministic pseudorandom sequence) and to produce one new output thereof every round by using threshold signatures and distributed key generation.
Algorand uses VRFs to perform cryptographic sortition. In this platform, every block produces a new random selection seed, and a user secretly checks whether they were selected to participate in the consensus protocol by evaluating a VRF with their secret participation key and the selection seed. (This also produces a proof, which the user can send to anyone to show that they have been selected to participate.) Thusly, accounts are selected to propose blocks for a given round. In this manner, VRFs prevent users from gaining staking advantages by registering multiple accounts. The particular VRF that Algorand uses is based on elliptic-curve cryptography, specifically Curve25519; proposed by Sharon Goldberg, Moni Naor, Dimitris Papadopoulos, Leonid Reyzin, and Jan Včelák, the function is currently undergoing standardization as an IETF Internet Draft. Algorand's own implementation of this function has been open-source since October 2018.
VRFs based on elliptic curve cryptography have been implemented in the programming language Solidity.
In May 2020, Chainlink announced that it launched Chainlink VRF, a service that uses verifiable random functions to generate verifiable randomness on-chain. To use Chainlink VRF, a smart contract supplies a seed (which should be unpredictable to the oracles to whom it is provided), and the seed in turn is used to generate a random number that is sent back to the contract; this is published on-chain along with a proof and verified using the oracle's public key and the application's seed. Each oracle, when generating randomness, uses its own secret key.
In July 2021, Harmony, a cryptocurrency project that bridges between blockchains, and Oraichain, a cryptocurrency project involving artificial intelligence, announced that they had introduced VRFs.
In February 2022, Switchboard, a decentralized oracle protocol, announced the very first verifiable random function (VRF) on the Solana blockchain. The Switchboard VRF is inspired and modelled after Algorand's VRF.

The Re-Engineering Assessment Practices in Scottish Higher Education project, or REAP, is one of six projects funded under the Scottish Funding Council's E-learning Transformation Programme. The project is piloting improved models of assessment across three universities - the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow Caledonian University and the University of Glasgow.
Project vision
In the REAP project, assessment is defined broadly to include tutor, peer and self-assessment processes. The goal is to develop new models of assessment geared to fostering lifelong learning skills. The vision is that, over the course of an undergraduate degree, students should develop their own capacity to self-assess, reflect on, and take an active role in managing their own learning. New technologies can help support the development of learner self-regulation (See Self-regulated learning).
Educational research
Assessment is a key driver of student learning (See Student-centred learning); it determines both how and what students study. Yet, research shows that prevailing modes of assessment often promote high teacher workloads rather than enhanced student learning. There is a need to rethink institutional assessment systems - away from a model where teachers transmit marks, to one where students develop, over the course of a degree, their own ability to self-assess and self-correct.
The educational basis for the REAP project is recent research on assessment. Black and William (1998) carried out a meta-analysis of research on formative assessment, over a 10-year period, across the schools and They sectors. They showed that where assessments focused on generating feedback and encouraging its use the learning gains were 'among the largest ever reported for educational interventions'. Other researchers have shown how formative assessment and feedback might support the development of learner self-regulation (Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick 2006). Still others have shown how assessment might be used to engage students in active learning over the course of their studies (Gibbs and Simpson, 2004) or might simultaneously enhance both immediate and lifelong learning needs (Boud, 2000). Despite these recent publications, this research has had little impact on They practice. The current project will address this gap by drawing on current thinking and on the potential available through new technologies (Nicol & Milligan, 2006).
Project activities
The REAP project involves the re-engineering of assessment practices in large enrolment first year classes across a range of departments/disciplines. A portfolio of technologies will be piloted to support assessment re-engineering including virtual learning environments (VLEs), e-Portfolios (See electronic portfolio), personal response systems, computer simulations and new communication tools.

Ancient Forest/Chun T'oh Whudujut Provincial Park and Protected Area is a provincial park and protected area located in the regional district of Fraser-Fort George in British Columbia. The park was established on 19 May 2016 to protect a portion of the North American inland temperate rainforest, the only inland temperate rainforest in the world.
Description
The park is located just off BC Highway 16 about east of Prince George. The park is about southwest of Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Provincial Park and Protected Area and directly borders Slim Creek Provincial Park. The park contains a number of trees estimated to be over 1000 years old.
History
The park is located within the traditional territory of the Lheidli T'enneh Nation who have inhabited the area since time immemorial.
In 2018, the provincial government and Lheidli T'enneh Nation signed a memorandum of understanding to work together on the planning and management of the park.
On 6 July 2020, the Lheidli T'enneh Nation announced that both the provincial and federal government are contributing funds toward an $8.7 million development project to improve park facilities and build an interpretative centre sharing Lheidli T'enneh culture with visitors.

Strategic Route 5 - West Anglia was the designation given by Network Rail, from 2004 to 2009, to a grouping of railway lines in the East of England that encompassed the West Anglia Main Line and its various branch lines. The route provided key services to Cambridge and Stansted Airport as well as supporting suburban services in North London and rural services in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.
In 2010, Network Rail restructured its route categorisation. Routes 5 and 7 were merged into Strategic Route D: East Anglia.
Strategic route sections
The Route was divided into a number of separate Strategic Route Sections (SRS's) that were defined based on route use, infrastructure and historical lines.
Railway planning
As part of Network Rail's Strategic Business Plan a Route Plan for each route, including Route 5, was published annually. The Route 5 plans for 2008 and 2009 are made available online.
Together with Route 7 - Great Eastern and Route 6 - North London Line and Thameside, the route was included in the Greater Anglia Route Utilisation Strategy.
Proposed developments
The Greater Anglia RUS includes a number of proposals for the future development of the route.
In the medium term, 2009–14, this includes minor infrastructure works and additional rolling stock to allow main line peak-service trains to be extended to 12-car formation. A number of developments are also intended for the West Coast Main Line depending on the status of future development at Stansted Airport. Enhancements to the power supply of the route are intended for completion by 2012 to interface with those carried out on Route 6 and Route 7.

The Fazl mosque (English: The Grace Mosque) also known as The London mosque, is the first purpose-built mosque in London, England. It was opened on 23 October 1926 in Southfields, Wandsworth. At a cost of £6,223, the construction of the place and the purchase of the land on which it stands, was financed by the donations of Muslims with support from the British Muslim convert Khalid Sheldrake. Between 1984 and 2019 the Fazl Mosque was the residence of the caliphs of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, and therefore its de facto international headquarters. The administrative headquarters now lies at the site of the Islamabad, Tilford.
History
The design of the Place is credited to Thomas Mawson. The plans form part of the Mawson archive held by the Cumbria Archive Service.
The foundation stone was laid in 1924 by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad, the second Caliph, who was visiting London as the representative of Islam at The Conference of Living Religions that was being held at the Imperial Institute in South Kensington. The foundation ceremony of the mosque was attended by 200 guests. Building of the place began in September 1925 and was completed 10 months later. It was named the Fazl Mosque by the caliph.
The Place was due to be formally opened by Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia who, however, was stopped from doing so by the Foreign Secretary of the King of Saudi Arabia only a few hours before the ceremony was to start. The planned inauguration, nevertheless, went ahead and Khan Bahadur Sheikh Abdul Qadir, ex-Minister of Punjab Legislative Council, formally opened the mosque on 4 October 1926. Around 600 distinguished guests representing numerous countries, as well as local MPs and other dignitaries attended the ceremony and the function was well reported in the press.
The Place accommodates 150 worshippers and is also known as the London Mosque. Its first Imam was Maulana Abdul Rahim Dard and its first muezzin (caller to prayer) was Mr Bilal Nuttall. Since 1926 the London Mosque has had eleven Imams. The current incumbent is Ata'ul Mujeeb Rashid who has served as Imam since 1983.
Caliph's residence
In 1984 the Government of Pakistan promulgated Ordinance XX which prohibited Ahmadis from any public expression of the Islamic faith, rendering the caliph unable to perform their duties as the leader of the Community. In response Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth caliph, left Pakistan and migrated to London, provisionally moving the Ahmadiyya headquarters from Rabwah, Pakistan to the Fazl Mosque in London.
Within the mosque complex, a separate building consisting of a hall, offices, and a small apartment on the top floor for the Imam of the mosque was built beside the mosque earlier in 1967. Upon their migration, this apartment became the home of the caliph and following their death in 2003, the home of Mirza Masroor Ahmad, the fifth and current caliph. It remained the permanent residence of the caliph until 2019 when they relocated to Islamabad, Tilford.
Influence
In addition to the usual flow of MPs, mayors, councillors, scholars and students, The London Mosque has hosted a number of distinguished visitors from far and wide. The founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, visited the mosque several times and made their famous speech in its grounds when they decided to return to India to represent the Muslims in the sub-continent. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Faisal Bin Abdul-Aziz also visited the mosque in 1935 as did their predecessor, King Saud.
Sir Chaudhry Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, the first Foreign Minister of Pakistan, a President of the International Court of Justice and President of the United Nations General Assembly, lived at the premises for many years. In July 2011 Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex of the UK also visited the mosque in their capacity as a Patron of ‘The London Gardens Society' and thus took the opportunity to inspect the gardens of the Fazl Mosque, which have won numerous awards over the past few years. The Earl was also able to view a small exhibition about the history of the mosque. In October 2017 Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, visited the mosque where they met the fifth caliph, Mirza Masroor Ahmad to discuss the continued persecution of religious minorities in various parts of the world.
In 1955 the second Caliph of the Ahmadiyya movement returned to the mosque when they visited Europe for further medical treatment after they were physically attacked in Rabwah, Pakistan. In London they also held a conference of all missionaries stationed in Europe. The third Caliph also visited the mosque on various occasions.
Expansion
As the range and frequency of activities in the mosque progressively increased there was need for more space. This increase saw the construction of the multi-purpose Mahmood Hall, as well as the Nusrat Hall, in the grounds of the mosque. From Sunday school classes and school visits, to question and answer sessions and international meetings, The London Mosque has been and continues to be a hive of activity promoting education and religious awareness.
From the premises of the mosque, the fourth Caliph was also able to launch the community's satellite TV channel Muslim Television Ahmadiyya International (MTA) in 1994 through which they could transmit televised messages globally to the community and have their sermons heard throughout the world.
With the expansion of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, the capacity of The London Mosque has become insufficient and further premises in Surrey and Morden were acquired for the Baitul Futuh Mosque. However, the historic significance and role of The London Mosque continues to ensure its special and indeed unique position for both the global Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and Britain.
Ahmadiyya Community
The Ahmadiyya Community began in 1889, under its founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Ahmad began the community upon allegedly having visions of the prophet Muhammad and thus proclaimed themselves as a reformer of Islam. In 1920, after missionary work in London, the Ahmadiyya Community and its leader at the time, Hazrat Khalifa Masih II, decided London was a prime location for Islam to be represented. The Ahmadiyya women of India raised the money for which a one and one-quarter acre orchard land was bought for the construction of the Fazl Mosque.
In order to seek legitimacy, the opening of the Fazl mosque was set to be inaugurated by Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia, however directly preceding the opening, the Prince reported they were unable to make it. The absence of the prince was a piece of a larger struggle for the legitimacy and inclusion for the Ahmadiyya Community within the Muslim Ummah.
Design
The exterior of the Fazl Mosque consists of a green dome, with the apex of the dome standing 10m high. The dome rests on a square base, with four cupolas on each corner of the building. The mosque is a blend of classic Mughal architecture and British contemporary styles. The mosque's use of modern construction and modern materials created a separation from orientalist architecture, a style of architecture seen in other early mosques in London such as the Shah Jahan Mosque. The blend of formal features mixed with contemporary styles led the mosque to be recognized as a grade II listed building.
T.H Mawson
Thomas Mawson along with their firm T.H Mawson and sons designed the Fazl Mosque. They had studied the architectural style of mosques during the reconstruction of Thessaloniki, a Greek port city. T.H Mawson at the time of the Fazl Mosque's contractions was considered to be a leading figure in landscape design. Mawson has been credited with designs of other grade II listed buildings such as the Pavilion of Bell Vue Park.

Peter Kennedy (born 10 September 1973) was a Northern Irish football defender or midfielder. In 1995/96, they were named as the Ulster Footballer of the Year. After their first spell in Northern Ireland they had a successful spell in English football, initially joining Notts County in August 1996 where they scored once against Newcastle Town in the FA Cup, before moving onto Watford a season later, where they led the Hornets to promotion to Division One as their highest goalscorer. They scored two goals in quick succession in the derby with Luton Town, a hat-trick against Southend United, and a splendid long-range effort against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup. The following season was arguably the highlight of their career as they helped Watford gain promotion to the Premier League in 1999. In the Premier League, they scored Watford's first goal of the season, a penalty against Wimbledon. They left Watford at the end of the 2000/01 campaign and spent three seasons at Wigan, spending a period on loan at Derby County where they scored once against Ipswich Town. Their final English club was Peterborough United, after which they returned to Northern Ireland. At the end of the 2007–08 season Peter did not have their contract renewed by Portadown and left the club. They began training with Ballymena United FC but decided to retire from their footballing career to focus on becoming an accountant. After a year Peter came out of retirement and made a return to football by signing for Donegal Celtic FC who play in the IFA Championship.
They have three children: Annie, Olivia and Peter. They were born in Lisburn.  They are the uncle of Kerry Beattie who is also a footballer.

Prison rape or jail rape refers to sexual assault of people while they are incarcerated. The phrase is commonly used to describe rape of inmates by other inmates, or to describe rape of inmates by staff.
China
In February 2021, BBC News reported eyewitness accounts of systematic rape of Uyghur women in the Xinjiang internment camps.
Multiple women who were formerly detained in the Xinjiang internment camps have publicly made accusations of systemic sexual abuse, including rape. Sayragul Sauytbay, a teacher who was forced to work in the camps, told the BBC that employees of the camp in which they were detained conducted rapes en masse, saying that camp guards "picked the girls and young women they wanted and took them away". They also told the BBC of an organized gang rape, in which a woman around age 21 was forced to make a confession in front of a crowd of 100 other women detained in the camps, before being raped by multiple police officers in front of the assembled crowd. Tursunay Ziawudun, a woman who was detained in the camps for a period of nine months, told the BBC that women were removed from their cells "every night" to be raped by Chinese men, and that they were subjected to three separate instances of gang rape while detained. Qelbinur Sedik, an Uzbek woman from Xinjiang, has stated that Chinese police sexually abused detainees during electric shock tortures, saying that "there were four kinds of electric shock... the chair, the glove, the helmet, and anal rape with a stick".
Iran
Sexual violence against political prisoners is prevalent in Iran. It is allegedly ignored or even facilitated by authorities.
Reports issued to the United Nations allege that rape has been used by interrogators in Iran for decades. During the 1980s, following the Iranian Islamic Revolution, the rape of female political prisoners was so prevalent that it prompted Hussein-Ali Montazeri, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini's then-deputy, to write the following to Khomeini in a letter dated 7 October 1986: "Did you know that young women are raped in some of the prisons of the Islamic Republic?" Two prominent members of Iran's human rights community, the feminist lawyer and journalist Shadi Sadr and the blogger and activist Mojtaba Saminejad published essays online from inside Iran saying prison rape has a long history in the Islamic Republic.
In the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, opposition groups reported thousands were arrested and tortured in prisons around the country, with former inmates alleging mass rape of men, women and children by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, in prisons such as Kahrizak and Evin.
Following the 2009 presidential election, Iranian presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said several protesters held behind bars in Evin Prison had been savagely raped, according to a confidential letter to former president and cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Karroubi said this was a "fragment" of the evidence they had and that if the denials did not stop, they would release even more.
On 9 August 2009, in a letter to the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, Mehdi Karroubi demanded investigation of Iranian prisons for possible torture and, in particular, sexual harassment of men and women. On 19 August, they wrote to parliament speaker Ali Larijani, asking to meet with him, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the state prosecutor to "personally present my documents and evidence over the cases of sexual abuse in some prisons specially Kahrizak."

Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both released reports of widespread rape and abuse of prisoners in Turkey spanning multiple decades. Kurdish prisoners have also been specifically targeted for rape and other forms of sexual violence.
Middle East
Rape is regularly used in prisons across the wider Middle East. Sexual abuse of detained women, children and men is rampant in the UAE, Saudi and Bahraini prisons.
United States
In the United States, the overwhelming majority of prison rape cases involve men who are raped by other men. This is due in part to the fact that in the United States the vast majority of incarcerated people are men. Sexual contact with inmates by prison staff is illegal, regardless of supposed consent.
Public awareness of common prison rape is a relatively recent development, and estimates of its prevalence have varied widely over the past several decades. In 1974, Carl Weiss and David James Friar wrote that 46 million Americans would one day be incarcerated; of that number, they held that 10 million would be raped.
According to a US Department of Justice report from 2013, an estimated 5.0% of people incarcerated in state and federal prison, and 3.2% of those in jail, reported at least one incident of sexual victimization in the prior 12 months. However, advocates dispute the accuracy of the numbers due to under-reporting of sexual assaults in prison, especially among incarcerated youths.
In terms of individuals' risk over their entire incarceration, estimates from the 1980s and 1990s range widely. A 1992 estimate from the Federal Bureau of Prisons suggested that between 9 and 20% of inmates had been sexually assaulted. Similarly, studies from 1982 and 1996, concluded that the rate was somewhere between 12% and 14%. In New York State maximum security prisons, a 1986 study put the proportion at around 23%. By contrast, Christine Saum's 1994 survey of 101 inmates determined that 5 had been sexually assaulted.
The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 was the first United States federal law passed specifically dealing with the sexual assault of prisoners. The bill was signed into law on 4 September 2003.

The James Franck Institute of the University of Chicago conducts interdisciplinary research in physics, chemistry and materials science. Scientists at the institute include those interested in condensed matter physics, physical chemistry, materials chemistry, atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics, geophysics, and biophysics.
Founded in 1945 by university President Robert Maynard Hutchins as the Institute for the Study of Metals, it was renamed for Nobel Prize winning physicist James Franck in 1967. It had its beginnings in the Metallurgical Laboratory, the World War II project that initiated the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, using the metal uranium. The Institute's founding director was Cyril Stanley Smith, former head of metallurgy at Los Alamos and the institute made early advances in pseudopotential theory and study of the Fermi surface. The Institute was an early pioneer in interdisciplinary research in wide-ranging subjects: as it was organized like a "benevolent anarchy", a large percent of its early papers did not even deal with metals but other aspects of chemistry and physics.

FFP standards refer to the filtering half mask classification by EN 149, a European standard of testing and marking requirements for filtering half masks. FFP standard masks (where FFP stands for filtering facepiece) cover the nose, mouth and chin and may have inhalation and/or exhalation valves.
EN 149 defines three classes of such particle half masks, called FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3, according to their filtering efficiency. It also classifies masks into "single shift use only" (not re-usable, marked NR) or "re-usable (more than one shift)" (marked R), while an additional marking letter D indicates that a mask has passed an optional clogging test using dolomite dust. Such mechanical filter respirators protect against the inhalation of particulates such as dust particles, droplets, and aerosols.
Almost identical tests (but different markings) are used in Australia, New Zealand, Korea and Brazil. Similar standards are used in the United States, China and Japan. For example, EN 149 FFP2 masks have similar performance requirements to N95 masks in the United States and KN95 filters of China, and EN 149 FFP3 masks have similar performance requirements to N99 masks in the United States. However EN 149 test requirements differ somewhat from the U.S./Chinese/Japanese standards: EN 149 requires an additional paraffin oil (paraffinum perliquidum) aerosol test and it tests at a range of different flow rates and defines several associated and permissible pressure drop levels.
Classification
The EN 149 standard defines performance requirements for three classes of particle-filtering half masks: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. The protection provided by an FFP2 (or FFP3) mask includes the protection provided by a mask of the lower-numbered classes.
A mask conforming to the standard must have its class written on it, along with the name of the standard and its year of publication, as well as any applicable option codes, e.g. “EN 149:2001 FFP1 NR D”. Some manufacturers use in addition the colour of the elastic band to identify the mask class, however, the EN 149 standard does not specify any such colour coding and different manufacturers have used different colour schemes.
FFP1 mask
It is the least filtering mask of the three.
Aerosol filtration percentage: 80% minimum.
Internal leak rate: maximum 22%.
It is mainly used as a dust mask (for example for DIY jobs). Dust can cause lung diseases, such as silicosis, anthracosis, siderosis and asbestosis (in particular dust from silica, coal, iron ore, zinc, aluminium or cement are common particulate risks).
FFP2 mask
Aerosol filtration percentage: 94% minimum.
Internal leak rate: maximum 8%.
This mask offers protection in various areas such as the glass industry, foundry, construction, pharmaceutical industry and agriculture. It effectively stops powdered chemicals. This mask can also serve as protection against respiratory viruses such as avian influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with the coronavirus (SARS), as well as against the bacteria of pneumonic plague and tuberculosis. It is similar to the US-standard N95 respirator.
FFP3 mask
Aerosol filtration percentage: 99% minimum.
Internal leak rate: maximum 2%
The FFP3 mask is the most filtering of the FFP masks. It protects against very fine particles such as asbestos and ceramic. It does not protect against gases and in particular oxides of nitrogen.
Requirements
EN 149 defines laboratories tests, field tests and certain requirements to ensure the conformity of the masks. The following points are analyzed:
Packaging
Materials: resistance to manipulation
Practical performance test
Leakage: total leakage inwards and penetration of the filter material
There are some European organizations that issue an examination certificate confirming conformity and specifying the characteristics of the products:
INRS then APAVE in France
INSPEC in Great Britain
FACHAUSSCHUSS in Germany
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance in Germany
CIOP-PIB in Poland
2009 version
With the publication of the 2009 version of the standard, the designation of the respiratory protection mask is now "particulate filtering half mask". The abbreviation NR or R is added after FFP1, FFP2, FFP3:
NR (not reusable): if the use of the filtering half-face mask is limited to one working day. It is not reusable.
R (reusable): if the filtering half-face mask can be used for more than one working day, so it is reusable.
Additional suffixes include:
Anti-clogging NR masks (D). When the half mask has passed the dolomite dust test, a letter D can be added to indicate that the service life may exceed 8 h. Example: FFP3 NR D.
Valve. The presence of a valve can be indicated by the letter V.
Particulate type. The letters S or L respectively specify the filtration of solid dust (NaCl-only) or liquid mist (paraffin oil). Example: FFP3 SLV.
Masks manufactured before the new standard was taken into account may still have the old marking.
Marking
FFP respirators are a type of personal protective equipment (PPE). Here is the notice that should appear on every mask :
Manufacturer's name
Mask
CE number of the certification body (only FFP3) + EN 149: 2009 + the mask class (FFP1, FFP2 or FFP3) + acronym (NR or R) (Note: in case of FFP1 the conformity assessment procedures are done by the manufacturer itself as per Annex IV (Module A)
The marking must comply with European Union Directive 89/686 / EEC on PPE. If any of these entries are missing, the mask will be considered non-compliant.
Medical use
EN 149 tests the ability of masks to protect the wearers against inhaling liquid and dry aerosols. It makes no statement about, and does not specifically test the suitability of such masks for, infection control against airborne transmission of pathogens through respiratory droplets. Nevertheless, FFP2 and FFP3 masks are commonly used for this purpose in medical practice. An NHS study published in 2021 claimed switching to FFP3 "may have cut ward-based infection to zero".
Similar standards
Several regions use standards based on nearly identical tests and thresholds as those in EN 149, but with different markings:
Russia (GOST R 12.4.191-2011): identical.
South Korea (KMOEL - 2017–64): considered identical to pre-2009 version. FFP1 is called "2nd grade" or KF80, FFP2 "1st grade" or KF94, and FFP3 "special grade" or KF99.
Australia and New Zealand (AS/NZ 1716:2012): similar grades with a different test agent. Grades are written simply "P".
Brazil (ABNT/NBR 13698:2011): identical to pre-2009 version. Grades are written as "PFF".
Other regions use similar tests that (in parts) resemble more closely the 42 CFR 84 requirements in the United States:
Japan (JMHLW-Notification 214, 2018): similar grades with a different coding scheme for NR/R and S/L types. Written with a two-letter prefix D/R and S/L that maps to NR/R and S/L respectively. Leakage requirement not present.
Taiwan (CNS 14755): D1/D2/D3 grades for 80/95/99 efficiency. No requirements for inward leakage.

Oyster Creek Nuclear Power Station was a single unit 636 MWe boiling water reactor power plant in the United States. The plant is located on an site adjacent to Oyster Creek in the Forked River section of Lacey Township in Ocean County, New Jersey. At the time of its closure, the facility was owned by Exelon Corporation and, along with unit 1 at Nine Mile Point Nuclear Generating Station, was the oldest operating commercial nuclear power plant in the United States. The plant first started commercial operation on December 23, 1969, and is licensed to operate until April 9, 2029, but Oyster Creek was permanently shut down in September 2018. The plant got its cooling water from Barnegat Bay, a brackish estuary that empties into the Atlantic Ocean through the Barnegat Inlet.
At the time of shutdown, Oyster Creek was one of four licensed nuclear power reactors in New Jersey. The others are the two units at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant, and the one unit at Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station. As of January 1, 2005, New Jersey ranked 9th among the 31 states with nuclear capacity for total MWe generated. In 2003, nuclear power generated over one half of the electricity in the state.
In 1999, GPU agreed to sell the Oyster Creek Nuclear Plant to AmerGen Energy for $10 million. AmerGen was later purchased by Exelon in 2003. Exelon fully integrated AmerGen's former assets, including Oyster Creek, in early 2009.
The reactor was shut down on September 17, 2018.
In September 2019, Ocean Wind, a proposed 1,100 MWe offshore wind farm, with the approval of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, secured the capacity interconnection rights to bring the power generated by the wind farm on-shore at Oyster Creek. It can use the existing power infrastructure of the plant, after some upgrades, to connect to the regional transmission grid.
In January 2021, Holtec suggested that a "new generation" nuclear plant might be built at the location.
Design
Oyster Creek was a single unit 636 MWe boiling water reactor power plant which first came online on December 23, 1969; it was one of the oldest operating nuclear power plants in the United States until it permanently ceased operation on September 17, 2018. The plant was located east of Philadelphia and south of New York City.
Cooling water for the plant was drawn from Barnegat Bay, a brackish estuary that empties into the Atlantic Ocean through the Barnegat Inlet. Rankine cycle condenser cooling was used, with a coolant flow rate of per day. The average temperature increase was 10.4 °F (5.8 °C).
Oyster Creek was originally licensed for 40 years, but in April 2009 its license was extended for another 20 years by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. "Based on the Atomic Energy Act, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issues licenses for commercial power reactors to operate for up to 40 years and allows these licenses to be renewed for up to another 20 years. This original 40-year term for reactor licenses was based on economic and antitrust considerations – not on limitations of nuclear technology. Due to this selected period, however, some structures and components may have been engineered on the basis of an expected 40-year service life."
License extension
In July 2005, Exelon submitted an application to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year extension of the existing 40-year license for Oyster Creek, which was due to expire in 2009. According to a 2006 survey commissioned by the operators, relicensing of the power plant was supported by the majority of citizens living in areas surrounding the plant, and by local elected officials. However, some local opposition to re-licensing was evident at public hearings on the issue. On May 31, 2007, several Ocean County residents attended the Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB) hearing in the county administration building. At that meeting, several of the local residents were opposed to re-licensing of the nuclear power plant.
The ASLB's decision on May 31, 2007 hearing led to a full public hearing on the issue of the monitoring of corrosion in the plant's drywell liner. The hearing was scheduled for September 24, 2007 in the county seat Toms River. In 2008, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board twice rejected citizens' contentions concerning Oyster Creek. The majority of the three-judge panel ruled in favor of the plant, deciding "that the group's motion did not follow the proper guidelines for late-filed contentions and failed to link an alleged inadequacy to a significant safety issue."
In May 2007, the state Attorney General's Office, on behalf of the state Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), petitioned the federal Third Circuit Court of Appeals to compel the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to consider the potential for a terrorist attack as part of the criteria for Oyster Creek's licensing renewal process. In July 2007, the NJDEP faulted both Exelon and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for relying on environmental studies that were up to 30 years old at the time of Exelon's relicensing application. The NJDEP refused to make a "positive consistency determination" for Oyster Creek, as required by the federal Coastal Zone Management Act. The positive determination is required for all applicants seeking to relicense an existing facility.
On April 8, 2009 the plant was granted a license extension to operate until April 9, 2029. This came a week after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 3–1 against an appeal by anti-nuclear groups.
As of June 2009, five environmental and citizen groups were appealing the decision in the federal court. Richard Webster, attorney for the groups, claims the NRC did not have sufficient information to determine whether the plant can operate safely for the next 20 years.
“This has been the most extensive license renewal review to date, including the first adjudicatory hearing of a license renewal application,” said Eric Leeds, NRC's director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. “The staff's licensing and inspection scrutiny, along with the independent contributions of the ACRS, the ASLB and various citizen groups, should give the people of New Jersey added confidence that Oyster Creek will remain safe during its continued operation.”
Closure and decommissioning
In December 2010, Exelon reported that Oyster Creek would close in 2019, 10 years earlier than planned so that cooling towers will not have to be installed to meet new environmental standards. In February 2018 the closure date was adjusted to October 2018. The reactor was ultimately shut down on September 17, 2018, and its fuel was removed by September 25, 2018.
Work will now begin on dismantlement and long-term decommissioning. Oyster Creek was sold to Holtec International in July 2019 after clearing regulatory approval, and a Holtec and SNC-Lavalin joint venture called Comprehensive Decommissioning International will be responsible for decommissioning the plant. About 200 of Oyster Creek's employees will remain at the plant to carry out decommissioning work with Holtec.
Environment
As a part of Exelon Corporation, Oyster Creek followed the corporation's environmental policy.
In August 2009, workers found and stopped two small leaks of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen with a decay half-life of about 12 years. An NRC investigation of the leak found that the levels were too low to be a danger to public health. The leaks originated from two buried pipes that had not been properly insulated when they were last worked on in 1991. A second leak was discovered in August 2009, from a pipe leading into an electrical turbine building. Tritium levels found in this leak were measured at 10 microcuries per liter of water, higher than the 5 to 6 microcuries per liter found in the earlier leak. Tritium-contaminated groundwater remained on site and had not spread to any public water supplies.
In May 2010, the New Jersey DEP announced that water from the leak had spread to a nearby aquifer, though it stated there "was no imminent danger" to water supplies. At the current rate of migration, the water will reach the closest public wells within 10 to 15 years. The DEP stated there are several ways to address the problem, such as pumping out the tainted water, or injecting fresh water to force the tainted water backwards. A spokesperson for Oyster Creek said they are working with the state on the issue, and have seen contamination levels steadily dropping, sometimes by "as much as 90%". Tritium causes less concern than other radioactive substances such as strontium, caesium and iodine. It does not bio-accumulate inside human tissue.
Safety
Employees at the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant averaged less radiation exposure from 2005 through 2008 than workers at any other nuclear power plant of similar design in the United States.
In early May 2011, fuel supplier General Electric notified the operators of the Oyster Creek and Nine Mile Point nuclear plants regarding safety calculation errors. General Electric had made mathematical errors which could have resulted in nuclear fuel getting hotter than operators expected, reducing the plants' margin of safety. Plant operators were able to make corrections.
Hurricane Sandy
On October 30, 2012, during Hurricane Sandy, the nuclear power plant's intake structure was flooded with six and a half feet of water as a result of the storm surge from the hurricane, with no damage sustained, and at the same time the plant was already down for maintenance and lost its electrical power from the grid, so operators called an alert that escalated the plant a step up from the lowest emergency level, and turned to backup generators to keep cooling the reactor.
In following months, local residents continued to voice their worries despite a statement by Gordon K. Hunegs of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that during Hurricane Sandy "the plant was always safe."
Seismic risk
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Oyster Creek was 1 in 71,429, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.
Surrounding population
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.
The 2010 U.S. population within of Oyster Creek was 133,609, an increase of 35.8 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 4,482,261, an increase of 10.4 percent since 2000. Cities within include Atlantic City ( to city center), Toms River ( to city center), Lakewood ( to city center), Asbury Park ( to city center), and Cherry Hill ( to city center).

The pugnose minnow (Opsopoeodus emiliae) is a species of cyprinid fish found in the eastern North America. There are two recognized subspecies with the subspecies from Florida recognized as race peninsularis.
Subspecies
Opsopoeodus emiliae emiliae O. P. Hay, 1881 (Pugnose minnow)
Opsopoeodus emiliae peninsularis (C. R. Gilbert & R. M. Bailey, 1972)
Description
The pugnose minnow has an average lifespan of 3 years. The pugnose minnow eats mostly insects but will occasionally eat algae by accident. If insects are not present, pugnose minnows can be found eating the eggs from other fish or small aquatic crustaceans like brine shrimp.
The pugnose minnow is a small silver fish with an average length of 1-2 inches with some reaching 2.5 inches in length; the minnow has a forked tail, short pectoral fins, and a small rounded snout. The distinctive characteristic is the lateral line running from the tail all the way to the mouth. The pugnose minnow has a greatly superior mouth, indicating that they feed above them in the water column. The dorsal fin has 9 dorsal spines and is translucent, as well as the caudal fin. The base of the caudal fin has a black spot that becomes pronounced in males when they are ready to mate; breeding males can also have tubercles that are used for fighting to show dominance and to be accepted by a female.
Habitat
The pugnose minnow is a freshwater fish that is native to Canada and the United States, mostly along the Eastern sides of these countries. It can be found in clear waters but also slow, turbid waters with plenty of debris to hide under. In the United States it is found in many different types of water, some stay in the clear water in which they were hatched but some may swim further from where they hatched to an environment with much more silt and clay.
Reproduction
Pugnose minnows reproduce in late spring to early summer under debris that can be found in their habitat, especially under rocks or logs. Males will clear out the area under the rock and defend it from other males by using the tubercles found on their snout. The female has to be led to the potential male's site and will investigate it as the male nudges them repeatedly with their dorsal fin to stimulate egg spawning. Female pugnose minnows lay adhesive eggs that will stick to the underside of the rock; the eggs will be laid either individually or in strings, with approximately 120 eggs per clutch. Males and females will repeat this process over the next 6 or 7 days. After all the eggs have been laid, the female has nothing else to do with the offspring; the males will guard the eggs until they hatch, which is around 6 days, depending on the weather.

The Seal of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (), or the Founding Seal (), was the national seal of People's Republic of China from 1949 to 1959. It is not in use anymore, and is kept in the National Museum of China.
The seal was designed by . Earlier in 1949, Zhang Yuecheng would carve the seals for Zhou Enlai and Zhu De, and the seal of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Zhang Yuecheng was recommended by to design "The Seal of the Central Government of the People's Republic of China". Zhang then submitted four different designs with four different typefaces for the print of the seal, these were made in Clerical script, the Song, Han seal, and Qin seal. After these designs were finalised, Chairman Mao Zedong selected the design with Song.
Design
The Seal of the People's Government of the People's Republic of China is cast from brass, with a little ammonium added. The seal has a square base, and a cylindrical handle on the top. The height of the seal base is 2.5 centimetres, and the handle is 10.9 centimetres tall, totalling 13.4 centimetres in height. Its base is 4.5 centimetres wide and 4.5 centimetres long, the perimeter is 18 centimetres. There are no obvious patterns or symbols engraved on the seal other than the face, however there is a slight concave on the handle for better grip. Its inscription 「中華人民共和國中央人民政府之印」 meaning The Seal of the People's Government of the People's Republic of China is written in Song, styled from right to left and from top to bottom.
History
11 June 1949 Zhou Enlai asked Chen Shutong to find a seal maker, regarding the making of seals for the government. Together with , Chen Shutong decided to recommended as the official seal maker.
Few days later, Zhou Enlai gathered Zhang and some experts to discuss and decide the design of the National Seal.
27 September 1949 after several months of discussion, four potential seal designs were picked. The four designs mainly differ in font, there was the Clerical script, the Song, Han seal, and the Qin seal.
1 October 1949 The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was established and was set as the cabinet. Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China controlled all the seal used to pass laws, commands, and other authorities proclaimed by the president or the cabinet, including the National Seal.
27 October 1949 The Song seal design was approved by Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, immediately after the national seal's bill was paid and the making started.
31 October 1949 The National Seal was finished and handed to the government.
September 1949 The cabinet was changed from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and together all the seals are transferred to the new cabinet.
May 1959 The National Seal was declared obsolete by the General Office of the State Council and was sent to the National Museum of China

Dizbad-e Olya (, also known as Dīzbād-e Bālā or Dizbad) is a village in Zeberkhan Rural District, Zeberkhan District, Nishapur County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.
Geography
Dizbad-e Olya is located at an altitude of 2020 metres in the southern area of the Binalud Mountains 97 kilometres southwest of the city of Mashhad and 71 kilometres northwest of Neyshabur. The highest point in the area is Mount Qajqor at 2881 m above sea level. The area of Dizbad-e Olya also borders the two neighbouring villages of Qasemabad and Hesar.
Demographics
Economy
History
The historical background of Dizbad dates back to the year 714 AD. The name has changed many times throughout history. The oldest known name of Dizbad is Aspiduz (), which includes the Persian words for horse and fort. In the ninth century it was known as Qasr al-Rih () due to the Arab invasion. The origin of this name is due to the three forts that once served as defence system, they signalled by smoke signals when enemies tried to invade. Only ruins of these forts remain. In later times, Dizbad was known as Chehel Ashkub ().
Due to its long history and cultural background, the identity of the people in this area has undergone many changes. One of the most impactful events that caused this cultural change was the opening of the Naser Khosrow School in 1939. The establishment of this school encouraged families to send their children to school, which had a positive effect and resulted in a growing number of children from the village graduating from school.

Jaguar was a three-stage sounding rocket developed by the United States Air Force in the early 1960s. Designed for air launch to allow soundings from remote areas without infrastructure, it was only launched twice before the project was abandoned.
Design and development
Jaguar was an air-launched sounding rocket developed by the Air Research and Development Command of the U.S. Air Force, intended for use for high-altitude scientific research into the aurora borealis and radiation trapped in the Van Allen Belts. Derived from a design used by the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, it was a three-stage vehicle, with a first stage of three clustered Recruit rockets, a single Recruit as a second stage, and a third stage with a Baby Sergeant rocket. It was to be launched using a Martin B-57 Canberra medium bomber that was modified to carry the rocket on a side-mounted pylon; this allowed for the rocket to be launched from any location capable of operating a jet aircraft, without the need for installing launch infrastructure in remote areas. To launch, the Canberra would pull into a near-vertical climb, akin to that used for toss bombing, and release the rocket; Jaguar was expected to be capable of launching a payload to an apogee of . An upgraded version using the improved "Yardbird" model of the Recruit was proposed.
Operational history
Following six dummy launch tests starting in January 1958, Jaguar was launched twice; taking place at the White Sands Missile Range under the command of the Air Force Special Weapons Center, the first launch was conducted in late 1960, and the second in early 1961. Following the two launches, the program was abandoned.

Beit Emanuel Progressive Synagogue is a progressive synagogue located in Parktown, Johannesburg. The synagogue was established in 1954 and is one of the largest progressive Jewish congregations in South Africa. Israeli-born, Rabbi Sa'ar Shaked has been Beit Emanuel's congregational rabbi since 2013. It is an affiliate of the South African Union for Progressive Judaism (SAUPJ), which is part of the World Union for Progressive Judaism (WUPJ). Congregational rabbi, Shaked is currently involved in efforts to establish a Rabbinic Academy and Higher Education Institution in Gauteng.
Practice
Jocelyn Hellig, professor of religious studies and one of the best-known interpreters of South African Judaism, described the Progressive community as conservative in religious practice. This was also given as an explanation for the relatively modest presence of Masorti Judaism in the country (Hellig 1987; Shain 2011). In 1993 there were divisions in Johannesburg's Progressive community when Beit Emanuel's congregational rabbi, Ady Asabi declared that it and the Imanu-Shalom congregations would become independent and Masorti synagogues, breaking with the SAUPJ and Progressive Judaism. A court case ensued to retain both of the congregations under the SAUPJ. Beit Emanuel returned to the SAUPJ following an agreement and Shalom became independent and Masorti (Dubb and Shain 1995). Today the synagogue has moved away from the formality of conventional Reform Judaism and instead concentrates on prayers (ancient and modern) that encourage greater congregant participation.

The Sakalava weaver (Ploceus sakalava) sometimes known as the Sakalava fody is a species of bird in the family Ploceidae. It is endemic to Madagascar. The bird is long and weighs .
Taxonomy
The Sakalava weaver was first described by Gustav Hartlaub in 1861, based on a specimen collected by Victor Sganzin during an expedition in 1831–32 on Madagascar. The species epithet sakalava is derived from the Sakalava, whose name means 'people of the long valleys'. The first English name was given to the bird only in 1891 by James Sibree, who named it Sakalava Weaver-bird. Sakalava weaver has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Another English name that is sometimes used is Sakalava Fody. Local names in the Malagasy language include , , , and .
Based on recent DNA-analysis, the genus Ploceus is almost certainly polyphyletic. If all species currently included in the genus would remain and the genus would be made monophyletic, it would have to encompass the entire subfamily Ploceinae. The Ploceinae can be divided into two groups. In the first group, the widowbirds and bishops (genus Euplectes) are sister to a clade in which the genera Foudia and Quelea are the closest relatives and which further includes the Asiatic species of Ploceus, i.e. P. manyar, P. philippinus, P. benghalensis, P. megarhynchus, (and P. hypoxanthus, although untested). Since Georges Cuvier picked P. philippinus as the type species, these five species would logically remain assigned to the genus Ploceus.
Basic to the second group is a clade consisting of both species sofar included in Ploceus that live on Madagascar, P. nelicourvi and P. sakalava, and these are morphologically very distinctive from the remaining species. These two species could in future be assigned to the genus Nelicurvius that was erected by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850, but which was merged with Ploceus later on. This second group further contains the genera Malimbus and Anaplectes, and all remaining Ploceus species.
Distribution
It is found in small flocks. Its natural habitat is the dry lowland forests and scrubland of the north, west and south of Madagascar. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland.
Description
Mco pgoujujijoolxujyn
The adult male has a yellow head and upper breast during the breeding season, with a pale grey belly and light and brown wings with white wing-tips. The male has distinctive red eye-rings and silver bill extending with a 'V' shape into the forehead. The non-breeding male has a dark brown head and pale grey breast, flanked with white.
The female has the appearance more of a house sparrow with pale almost white breast and duller slightly pink bill. The female also has a red eye-ring and sometimes small flashes of red around the eye.

Ecology and behaviour
Like in other true weaver birds, the roofed nest is woven from strips of grass leaf, but the Sakalava weaver also uses strips of palm fond, or thatching and weaving materials collected in villages. The top is woven directly around a branch or it is attached from a short woven stalk. It is shaped like a retort, with a pear-shaped nesting chamber and a long entrance tunnel hanging from the top. The fabric is thin but dense, although less so with the tunnel, that may be slightly transparent and which may also be somewhat wider at both ends.

Ordoño IV, called the Wicked or the Bad (c. 926–Córdoba, c. 962 or 963) was the king of León from 958 until 960, interrupting the reign of Sancho the Fat for a two-year period.
They were the son of Alfonso IV of León and their queen, Onneca Sánchez of Pamplona, and nephew of Ramiro II of León and of García Sánchez I of Pamplona.
In 958, two years into the reign of Sancho I of León, they benefited from a rebellion of the nobility that would succeed in briefly placing them on the throne. The Leonese nobles, as well as the disaffected Galician and Castilian ones, had grown sick of the obese Sancho. They received particular help in this from their brother-in-law, count Fernán González of Castile, whose daughter they married. However, count Fernán was defeated through a Navarrese and Umayyad alliance on Sancho's behalf in 960, and Ordoño was forced out.
Upon losing their throne, Ordoño fled first to Asturias, then Burgos, where they abandoned their wife. This lost them the support of Fernán González, who allied themselves with García Sánchez I of Pamplona. The Castilian count sent Ordoño to Ghalib al-Nasiri, commander of the 'Middle Frontier' in Medinaceli, from whom they were passed on to the court of the caliph of Córdoba. There they submitted and made a plea for aid. The caliph at first offered them help, but this led their rival Sancho likewise to offer their submission, thereby neutralizing any benefit to the caliph helping Ordoño, who died in Cordoba, still dethroned.
During the short period of their reign, they were married, for political reasons, to Urraca, daughter of Fernán González and formerly wife of their cousin Ordoño III of León. After Ordoño IV abandoned her, they would remarry to Sancho II of Pamplona. According to chronicler Sampiro, they bore Ordoño IV two children, but their identity is not known with certainty. Chronicler Ibn Hayyan assigns them a son García, but given that Urraca had a son of that name, the future king García Sánchez II of Pamplona by their third husband, Ibn Hayyan may have mistaken this step-son for a son. Likewise, a minority of modern scholars suggested that Bermudo II of León was the son of Ordoño IV rather than of Ordoño III of León, but a contemporary charter naming Bermudo's grandfather as Ramiro refutes this.

Spyfall is a 2014 card game for 3–8 players designed by Alexandr Ushan and published by Hobby World. A sequel, Spyfall 2, was published in 2017. A superhero themed variant, DC Spyfall, was published in 2018.
Gameplay
A typical game of Spyfall lasts for between 6 and 10 minutes, depending on the time control. Each player receives a card representing the same location, except one player who receives a "spy" card. The spy has to guess the location, while other players have to identify the spy. On their turn, players ask each other questions, trying to lure the spy out without giving them too much information about what the location is. At any time during the game, or at its end when the timer runs out, one player can accuse another of being the spy; if there is a consensus and the spy is identified, the spy loses; otherwise, the spy wins. Additionally, at any time the spy can announce that they are the spy, and try to guess the location. If successful, the spy wins, otherwise the spy loses.
Online version
A free-to-play online version of the game was created by Github user adrianocola. This version of the game is not affiliated with Hobby World.
Awards
Spyfall was a 2016 Årets Spil Best Adult Game Winner. It was also nominated for the 2016 Spiel des Jahres award. Spyfall 2 was the runner-up in the 2017 Best Party Game category for the BoardGameGeek award.
Spycon
In 2019, Ushan created Spycon, a team based variant of Spyfall in which two teams, each with a spy, try and guess the hidden character card of the other team.

Der Fischer Weltalmanach was an almanac, a popular publication of the information issued in Frankfurt on Main, Germany, created at the end of each year since 1959 by a team of Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag. In September 2018, the 60th and last edition was published. Due to reduced demand, and the Internet having cheaper options, no further editions are produced.
Concept
The idea that inspired the creators of the almanac was to find a new form of rapid transmission of information. Inspired by the U.S. The World Almanac and Book of Facts, Gottfried Bermann Fischer, publisher, and Gustav Fochler-Hauke, editor, developed a product that became a bestseller in the German market, reaching, in the first edition print run, about 100 thousand copies, although it is distributed in only 89 then-existing sovereign states. Each year had more pages - 385 pages (1960), 480 (1980), 704 (2000). And each year the price went up - DM 3.30 (1960), DM 9.80 (1980), DM 24.90 (2000), €29.95 (2009).
Contents
Over 50% of the content is devoted to the 195 countries of the world, including facts, figures, and other basic information (language, GDP, the currency structure of the country, society, state, government, political parties and the economy), and a chronicle of the events of the previous year. Facts about Germany, Austria and Switzerland are richer. There is also a chronicle of events and many statistics for each federal country (land) or canton.
The publication contains a chronicle of events of the past year, discussed the major themes of the world, including economic and financial crisis, sea piracy, armed conflicts.

Mōtītī Island is an island in the Bay of Plenty, off the coast of New Zealand's North Island. It is north-east of Papamoa Beach on the mainland and north-east of Tauranga. There were 18 homes occupied by 27 people on the island in the 2006 census.
Geography
A relatively flat island covering some , Mōtītī Island is composed mainly of Miocene volcanic rocks, overlaid with more recent sediments in the south. The principal activity on the island is agriculture, with a developing avocado plantation. Most residents and visitors travel to the island by air.
There is no public infrastructure (e.g. no public wharf) and the whole island is in private ownership. Access is difficult and expensive. Bay of Plenty Regional Council has regional council responsibility for Mōtītī Island. No territorial authority council is responsible for it – therefore residents pay no rates and there are no council services. Day-to-day administration is by the Department of Internal Affairs.
History and culture
Pre-colonial history
On 2 November 1769, during their first voyage, Captain Cook sailed close inshore to Mōtītī Island, where they reported the most extensive complex of fortified villages they had yet seen. In their journal they refer to it as the "Flat Island".
Recent history
On 5 October 2011 the container ship MV Rena ran aground on Astrolabe Reef, seven kilometers north of Mōtītī Island. Oil from the resulting spill, as well as shipping containers and their contents, reached the shore of the island. In October 2013, Mōtītī Island residents rejected an offer by the MV Rena's owners to start a development project for the island, in return for being able to leave the Rena wreckage where it lay. The plan included:
Building a landing point for barges
Creating a one-lane, all-weather road to the airstrip
Installing a new cellphone tower to improve communications
Running an underground cable from the mainland to improve power supply
Putting a permanent beacon on Astrolabe Reef
Building a Rena memorial from the ship's anchor
On 9 October 2011, the 45-foot launch M/V Excalibur ran aground on Mōtītī Island in bad weather. The crew of six were rescued, but the boat was considered a total loss.
Marae
The island has two maraes, belonging to the Ngāti Awa hapū of Te Patuwai and Ngati Maumoana: Te Hinga o te Ra or Te Karioi Marae and Te Hinga o te Ra meeting house; and Te Rua Kopiha Marae and Tamatea ki te Huatahi meeting house.
In October 2020, the Government committed $4,871,246 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade a group of 12 maraes, including Te Rua Kopiha Marae. The funding was expected to create 23 jobs.
Aerodrome
Sunair operates from Motiti Island to Tauranga with Cessna 172 aircraft.

Eleanor Vere Boyle (1825–1916) was an artist of the Victorian era whose work consisted mainly of watercolor illustrations in children's books. These illustrations were strongly influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, being highly detailed and haunting in content. Love and death were popular subject matter of Pre-Raphaelite art and something that can be seen in Eleanor Vere Boyle's work. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, even called their work "great in design." However, even though they were one of the first woman artists to be recognized for their achievements, they did not exhibit or sell work often as it was not acceptable given their family's social status. Thus, they signed their works “EVB” to obscure their identity and quickly became one of the most important female illustrators in the 1860s.
Biography
Eleanor Vere Boyle was born in Scotland on 1 May 1825 to Alexander Gordon of Ellon Castle, Aberdeenshire, descendant of the Duke of Ancaster. They were raised as the youngest of eight children in the Scottish hills above the River Dee. They later moved to England and married Richard Boyle, son of the Earl of Cork and chaplain to Queen Victoria.
Eleanor Vere Boyle's fascination of nature strongly influenced their later work, which primarily consisted of garden books after their husband died. However, during their lifetime, up until they died in 1916, they produced, and was highly acclaimed for, work for children's books. Totaled up, Eleanor had written or illustrated twenty-one books in about a fifty-year time-span. All these works were inspired by many things in which Eleanor was fascinated: nature, but also fate, dreams and flowing water.
Principal works
Them fascinations and their influence were clear in their illustrations they created for the poet Tennyson's May Queen in 1852. Such fascinations were even more evident in their illustrations for Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales in 1872, which was one of the earliest editions illustrated by an English person. It included twelve full color images and many other line drawings. Andersen had a definite dark side to many of their stories. With Eleanor's ability to translate it into visual form with their own slightly sinister taste, this edition was made to be one of the most cohesive between illustration and writing. This cohesiveness set a new standard for the future illustration in Hans Andersen's work. Some of the most highly acclaimed illustrations from this book include: "The Snow Queen," The Wild Swans," "The Ugly Duckling," "The Little Mermaid," "Thumbkinetta," "The Garden of Paradise," "The Fellow Traveller" (which inspired Tolkien's The Hobbit) and "The Angel."
Three years later, Eleanor Vere Boyle created what is considered one of their greatest works. In 1875, Eleanor created a retelling and illustration of the well-known story Beauty and the Beast. This work includes ten full color images.  They are praised most for their unique take on the Beast. While this story has been illustrated many times, Eleanor Vere Boyle's version seems to be the first and only to be reminiscent of a sea-creature with walrus-like tusks and flippers. This is highly different from the usual humanistic portrayal. Eleanor veers away from all normalities of the character, lacking an upright position, human facial features and clothes.
Other notable works by Eleanor Vere Boyle are their illustrations in The Story Without an End and Child's Play, as well as their illustrations and writings in Ros Rosarum Ex Horto Poetarum (1885). The Story Without an End is originally a German story by Friedrich Wilhelm Carove. It was later translated by Sarah Austin to English, and illustrated by Eleanor. On the other hand, Child's Play and Ros Rasarum Ex Horto Poetarum were books by Eleanor herself. In Child's Play, they matched famous nursery rhymes with their illustrations, and in Ros Rosarum Ex Horto Poetarum, Eleanor wrote poetry and created illustrations to accompany the writings. Ros Rosarum Ex Horto Poetarum is translated to "Dew of the Ever-living Rose, Gathered from the Poets' Gardens of Many Lands" in English. It is one of the most highly acclaimed works by scholars and claimed to be culturally important. Being preserved as a historic artifact, it is open to the public domain in the United States and available to read here.
Ros Rosarum Ex Horto Poetarum is not where Eleanor Vere Boyle stopped writing either. Near the end of their career, Eleanor Vere Boyle continued to write, the content focused on nature as they wrote and illustrated garden books. In the last thirty-two years of their life, they wrote and illustrated four: Days and Hours in a Garden (1884), A Garden of Pleasure (1895), Seven Gardens and a Palace (1900), and Garden Colour (1905). The last work released by Eleanor was eight years prior to their death: The Peacocks Pleasaunce (1908), which was a collection of twelve beautiful writings they created, (also known as, belles-lettres) accompanied by eight illustrations.

Peter Ludvig Rudolph Striegler (1816–1876) was one of Denmark's early photographers, specialising in portrait photography.
Trained as a picture-framer, Strieger opened Odense's first daguerreotype studio in 1846. With their experience of gold-plating, they were able to combine photography with ornate framing. Until 1857, they travelled widely around the country until they finally moved to Copenhagen.
In 1860, they introduced carte-de-visite photography to Denmark. The idea of using a photograph instead of a printed visiting card came from France where it was patented by André Adolphe Eugène Disdéri in 1854 with a four-lensed camera which could take from eight to twelve photographs on the same glass negative. As the prints could be collected in albums, the technique became extremely popular.
In 1861, while court photographer, they were awarded the Ingenio et Arti medal.
They were also one of the early photographers who took portraits of Hans Christian Andersen. In their diary entry for 22 October 1861, Andersen writes: "Stood for Siegler until 11.30 and had a few large and small pictures taken of me."

Welkinweir is a nonprofit arboretum, garden, mansion, and conservation area located at 1368 Prizer Road, East Nantmeal Township, Pennsylvania, United States, near Pottstown. It is part of the Hopewell Big Woods. It is open to the public daily without charge.
Welkinweir was the home of Everett and Grace Rodebaugh, founding members of the conservation-minded Green Valleys Association, who bought the site in the 1930s and spent decades improving it. Their house was built in 1940, building upon a much smaller house, built in two sections c. 1750 and c. 1830. The architect Fridtjof Tobiessen designed the 1940 mansion. The property was placed into a conservation easement in 1976, donated to the association in 1997, and is now its headquarters and educational center. In 2001, the estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Its arboretum includes cherry, dogwood, dwarf evergreens, franklinia, magnolia, Japanese maple, swamp and sugar maple, and sweetgum, as well as azaleas and rhododendrons.

The Kill A Watt (a pun on kilowatt) is an electricity usage monitor manufactured by Prodigit Electronics and sold by P3 International. It measures the energy used by devices plugged directly into the meter, as opposed to in-home energy use displays, which display the energy used by an entire household. The LCD shows voltage; current; true, reactive, and apparent power; power factor (for sinusoidal waveform); energy consumed in kWh; and hours connected. Some models display estimated cost.
Having a NEMA 5-15 plug and receptacle, and rated for 115 VAC (maximum 125 VAC), the Kill A Watt is sold for the North American market. The unit is manufactured by the Taiwanese company Prodigit, which also makes 230 VAC models of similar appearance and functionality for European Schuko, U.K. BS 1363 and Australian AS 3112 receptacles, and a model compatible with 100 Vacs for the Japanese market (2022-04, marketed there as the Watt Checker [ワットチェッカー] Plus by other companies). The basic models support current up to 15 A, power up to 1,875 W (the 230 VAC equivalents also allow up to 15 A, corresponding to 3,750 W).
The device can give an indication of the standby power used by appliances.
Models
There are several models of Kill A Watt meters:
P4400
This is the original, most basic version, based on the Prodigit 2000M. From the time it is plugged in, it measures:
Voltage (Volts)
Current (Amperes)
Power (Watts)
Energy Used (Kilowatt-hours)
Frequency (Hertz)
Apparent power (Volt-amperes)
Power factor
Elapsed time
The power setting displays instantaneous power, and the kilowatt-hour setting displays energy consumed since last reset. When electricity is disconnected, the P4400's measurements and meters are reset.
P4460 Kill A Watt EZ
This is an enhanced version, based on the Prodigit 2022, which includes a backup battery to store measurements even when disconnected from electricity. It has the same capabilities as the P4400, and can be programmed with electricity cost information, which enables it to display the cost of the electricity consumed since reset. From this, it can calculate cost per hour, day, week, month, or year.
P4320 Kill A Watt PS
This model, based on the Prodigit 2024, is integrated into an eight-outlet power strip. Unlike the other models, it does not display frequency or apparent power. It protects against surges and EMI, has a configurable overcurrent shutdown limit, and also measures earth leakage current; one version acts as an earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB). It switches power on or off at an AC zero crossing, minimizing current surges and interference.
Variations
Although identical externally, there have been several different versions of the Kill A Watt and Prodigit equivalents, all essentially of the same design, but with different PCB layout, packaging, and components.
User modifications
One shortcoming of the Kill-a-Watt range of devices is that they do not have the ability to store, transmit or transfer the readings, thus limiting their usage for any ongoing monitoring purposes. To counter this shortcoming, a couple of openly available modifications have been published on the Web, to enable these devices send data wirelessly to a receiver.
A circuit diagram has been drawn up.
Tweet-a-watt
The Tweet-a-watt is a hacked version of the standard Kill-A-Watt Plug in Power Meter. By piggybacking on the device's on-board LM2902N op-amp chip, the creator was able to get readings for voltage and current and transmit to a computer, which then sent this to Twitter via handle @tweetawatt. At the time it gained quite a lot of interest on the Web, but interest waned after some time. The last tweet from this handle was in March 2010.
WattMote
Following the usefulness of the Tweet-a-Watt, designs for the WattMote were released on the Web by another hobbyist, Felix Rusu at LowPowerLab. The modifications use a customized clone of the Arduino chip known as the Moteino, making this version much cheaper, and requires much less soldering than the original design. Further optimizations on the design were done by Mike Tranchemontage, their designs featured a more robust power supply unit to the moteino chip, avoid problems capacitors which discharged too slowly with the original design.
Standby power
Most plug-in wattmeters are not useful for measuring standby power, also called vampire power if the device in standby is not doing anything useful such as being prepared to wake under timer control. Many meters only have a resolution of 1W when reading power; the Kill-a-Watts read down to 0.1W, but this is still too coarse for measuring low standby power. Modification to read standby power has been described and discussed in detail (with oscilloscope waveforms and measurements). Essentially, the meter's shunt resistor, used to generate a voltage proportional to load current, is replaced by a much larger value, typically 100 times larger, with protective diodes. Readings of the modified meter have to be divided by the resistance factor (e.g. 100), and maximum measurable power is reduced by the same factor.

"The Call of the Simpsons" is the seventh episode of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 18, 1990. It was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wesley Archer. Albert Brooks made their first of nine guest appearances on The Simpsons franchise in this episode as the voice of Cowboy Bob.
In this episode, Homer purchases an RV and the Simpsons vacation in the wilderness. After the RV accidentally plummets from a cliff, the Simpsons find themselves stranded in a forest. While Bart and Homer try hiking back to civilization, Homer gets covered in mud and is mistaken for Bigfoot by a naturalist. News of the Bigfoot encounter spreads quickly and soon hunters converge to capture Homer. Meanwhile, Maggie is separated from their family and cared for by bears.
Plot
Jealous of Ned Flanders' new motor home, Homer visits Bob's RV Round-up to buy one. Because of their poor credit rating, they only qualifies for a smaller, dilapidated RV, which they are conned into purchasing. Homer takes their family on an excursion, driving on remote back roads. After Homer ignores Marge's suggestion to drive back to the main road, the Simpsons find themselves teetering over a precipice. They escape the RV before it plummets over the cliff and explodes, leaving them stranded in the wilderness with no food or supplies.
After Homer builds a crude lean-to shelter, they and Bart leave to find help, unaware Maggie is tagging along. Marge and Lisa stay behind and build a fire and sturdier shelter despite knowing nothing about camping. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is adopted by a family of bears. Homer and Bart lose their clothes after falling into a raging river and plunging over a waterfall. They hide their exposed bodies with leaves and mud. After a frigid night's sleep, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive. When the bees attack him, they evade them by jumping into a mud pit. Homer is mistaken for Bigfoot after a nature photographer takes a picture of them covered in mud. Soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts after a tabloid offers a $5000 reward for capturing the creature alive.
After Marge and Lisa are rescued by park rangers, Marge tells the media the monster in question is their husband, leading to tabloid headlines such as "I married Bigfoot". Cold, hungry, and exhausted, Homer and Bart stumble upon the bears' cave and retrieve Maggie. Homer is captured and taken to a lab for testing. They return home after scientists agree that they are "either a below-average human being or a brilliant beast". While watching news coverage of their ordeal, Homer worries their co-workers will mock them until Marge consoles them by calling them "my brilliant beast."
Production
The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wesley Archer. A plot twist that involved Homer being carried away to an eagle nest and being raised as a baby eagle was suggested for this episode by executive producer James L. Brooks, but they ended up going with Maggie being raised by bears instead. The sequence with Marge and Lisa by the bonfire was originally longer and included a conversation between the two about boys, but it was cut from the episode. In the original script, Homer and Bart were not talking in the scene where they concealed their private parts with mud and moss, but Sam Simon thought it would be "too funny to leave as a stage direction" and they added dialogue to the scene.
Albert Brooks guest starred in the episode as the voice of Cowboy Bob. They were not sure whether they wanted to be identified with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. The episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on Fox at the time it was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.
Reception
In its original American broadcast on February 18, 1990, "The Call of the Simpsons" finished third that day, with a Nielsen rating of 14.6 and a 22 percent audience share. The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1990 in the category "Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special". IGN named Albert Brooks' guest performance in this episode, along with their four other appearances on The Simpsons, the best guest appearance in the show's history.
"The Call of the Simpsons" received mixed reviews from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, both criticized and praised the episode saying: "This episode is a bit less than the sum of its parts. The early stuff at the RV Round-Up is much better than the main camping story, although there's some nice Marge-Lisa bonding, and who could resist Maggie and the bears?" In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated the episode a (of 5), adding "the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep. This type of gag would be very different today, if done at all."
Jon Bonné at MSNBC called the episode "a perfect example of the first season's bizarre and fruitful balance between edgy humor and softly-drawn neuroses" and said "it was this combination that made Groening's shorts for the Ullman show so compelling, and ultimately what made it possible for The Simpsons to break the molds of network television". Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that "while [the episode] doesn't offer the continuous highs of the best Simpsons, it's a generally solid show" and added that "the episode uses a wackier tone than usual for this era, but it works, and the program is consistently fun".

The 1997 World Women's Snooker Championship was a women's snooker tournament held in 1997.
Tournament summary
The tournament started as the 1996 World Championship, but due to delays in the scheduling of the later rounds, it became the 1997 Championship. It was promoted by Barry Hearn who had been promoting the Women's world championship since 1990. The defending champion was Karen Corr. There were 52 players who entered the tournament. Allison Fisher who had won the title seven times, most recently in 1994, did not enter as they have moved to the United States where they had embarked on a successful pool career. 1984 amateur champion and five-times runner-up Stacey Hillyard had retired from competition and so was another non-participant. The original schedule was for the quarter-finals onwards to be held in India, as they had been in 1994 and 1995, from 16 to 19 September 1996, but eventually the final rounds took place in Llanelli, with the semi-finals and final not happening until well into 1997.
This was the last women's world snooker championship to be held before the World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association amalgamated with the WPBSA later in 1997.
Rounds 1 to 4
The tournament started as the 1996 World Championship. The first four rounds took place at Raunds Cue Sports Club, Northamptonshire, to decide the eight players that would go on to contest the quarter-finals onwards, which were expected to be played in Bombay in mid-September 1996. Defending champion Karen Corr won their first match without losing a but won only on the final black in the deciding frame of their match against Lynette Horsburgh. Second seed Kelly Fisher and 1995 runner-up Kim Shaw both won both of their matches 4–0. Mary Talbot, ranked 26th, was a surprising quarter-finalist, beating 7th seed Sarah Smith and 12th ranked player Helen Audus. The highest break in the main qualifying was a 77 by Ann-Marie Farren. A plate competition was held for players who did not qualify to the quarter finals and was won by Horsburgh, who made a break of 100 in the first round of the plate competition.
Quarter-finals
Following postponements of the final stages and a lack of response from promoter Barry Hearn's partner in India, it was decided to hold the quarter-finals at the Terry Griffiths Matchroom, Llanelli, and they took place in November 1996. Corr whitewashed 1984 professional champion Mandy Fisher 4–0. Banks saw off 1987 champion Farren 4–2, and Lisa Quick beat Shaw 4–1. Fisher's match with Talbot was delayed due to Talbot's illness, with Fisher winning 4–1. Meanwhile, Hearn requested the termination of their contract with the WLBSA to promote the event in future.
Semi-finals and Final
The semi-finals and final were eventually scheduled to be held in Llanelli in mid-1997, following a continued lack of communication from Hearn's partner in India. Corr made the highest break of the competition, 87, and three other breaks over 30 in overcoming Banks 5–0. Quick won the first frame against Fisher, but no more, losing 1–5. The final between Corr and Fisher was closely contested until 3–3 but then Corr won three frames in a row to take their third world title. The tournament finished some eleven months after the start of the qualifying matches, and was the end of promoter Hearn's relationship with women's snooker that stretched back to 1990.
This was the last world championship to be held before the amalgamation of the World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association with the WPBSA a few months later. The intention was that major finals for women should be played at the same venues as the men's events, for example the women's world championship final being held at the Crucible Theatre during the World Snooker Championship.

Johan Cornelius Krieger (1683–1755) was a Danish architect and landscape architect, who from the 1720s served as both the country's chief architect, and head of the royal gardens.
Krieger oversaw the construction of Fredensborg Palace and its gardens, as well as an expansion of Frydenlund Manor. They also designed or redeveloped the gardens of Frederiksberg Palace (now Frederiksberg Park), Clausholm Castle, Rosenborg Castle, Hirschholm Palace, and Odense Palace. Following the Copenhagen Fire of 1728, they were involved in the plan to reconstruct the city using brick-faced houses, establishing by March 1729 a brick works and, in partnership with Vice Admiral Ulrich Kaas, a lime kiln and a sawmill in Christianshavn
They were an exponent of the baroque architecture and was influenced by the French formal garden style of André Le Nôtre.
Personal life
On 8 March 1712, they married Anna Matthisen (1692–1760). They died on 21 September 1755 in Copenhagen.

The Arsenal Air 100 is a French single seat competition sailplane produced in the 1940s. It sold in small numbers but set several records, still holding the world absolute solo glider endurance record of 56 h 15 m.
Design and development
The successful German Jacobs Weihe sailplane of 1938 strongly influenced several wartime and postwar designs such as the Italian CVV-6 Canguro and the British Slingsby Gull 4 and Sky. The Arsenal 100 was also Weihe based, with the intention of improving on that design. Work began before the war within a small design group named the Groupe de l'Air, led by Raymond Jarlaud.
The wings of the two aircraft are similar in design and construction. Both have spans of 18.0 m (59 ft 1 in) and are straight tapered with rounded wing tips, although the Air's taper ratio (wing root chord to tip chord) is higher, resulting a slightly greater aspect ratio. Some later Air 100s have squared-off tips terminated in streamlined "salmons". Both wings use the Göttingen 549 airfoil inboard of the tips, though the Air's roots have a thickened version. They are wooden single spar structures, plywood covered ahead of the spar and fabric covered behind. The Air 100 has slotted ailerons to improve roll rates and, inboard, has Schempp-Hirth parallel-rule airbrakes mounted immediately aft of the main spar; the Weihe's DFS style brakes had never been very effective, largely because their design placed them further aft on the wing where space did not allow them to open fully.
The tail units of the two types are also similar, with ply covered fixed surfaces and fabric covered control surfaces. The Air 100 has a broader chord fin and there are detailed differences in shape, but both place a broad, curved rudder on a hinge roughly in line with the elevator trailing edge. There are significant differences in the fuselages, though both are rounded, ply covered structures. The Weihe has a relatively slender rear fuselage, achieved by placing the wing high on a pylon behind the cockpit. In order to improve the aerodynamics of the wing-fuselage junction the Air's designers deepened the fuselage and mounted the wing at shoulder height. The prototype had no dihedral but this is used on production aircraft. The cockpit canopy is higher, more curved and with fewer frames on the post-war design. Originally the Air 100 landed on a skid and tail bumper but on production aircraft there is a fixed monowheel under mid-chord, with the rear part of the skid removed.
The Air 100 flew for the first time on 10 June 1947. The production aircraft that followed the two prototypes were 43 kg (95 ) heavier empty.
Operational history
The Air 100 made its debut in competition gliding when the two prototypes, recently completed at the Châtillon Air Arsenal and after only 3 h flight testing, flew in the American National Championships held at Wichita Falls, Kansas in July 1947. They came in fifth and eighth.
In 1948, Donald Pollard flew from Elmira, NY to Asbury Park, NJ to win the Barringer Trophy in their Air 100.
The type's most enduring achievement was made in 1952 when it set a new solo world duration record of 56 h 15 min. The pilot was Charles Atger. The record was set on 2–4 April at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, ridge sailing an Air 100 over the Chaine des Alpilles in the northern Mistral wind. Thirty months later another pilot, Bertrand Dauvin (21), in a different sailplane, was killed attempting to improve on Atger's record; the crash was attributed to pilot exhaustion and the FAI rejected further duration record claims for gliders. Thus Atger's record still stands and they were alive to celebrate its 40th anniversary.
A new women's out and return world distance record was set on 12 May 1953 by Marcelle Choisnet with a 290 km (180 mi) flight from Beynes via Romilly-sur-Seine. They also set a declared goal women's record of 510 km (317 mi) in May 1954 in an Air 102.
The Airs set other records and were competing successfully in France throughout the early 1950s. Some remained active much longer: three Air 100s and two Air 102s remained on the European civil aircraft registers in 2010, though one of the latter was dismantled.

Davitt Moroney (born 23 December 1950) is a British-born and educated musicologist, harpsichordist and organist. Their parents were of Irish and Italian extraction – their father was an executive with the Anglo-Dutch Unilever conglomerate. From 1968 onward, they undertook their undergraduate and graduate studies in musicology at King's College London, the faculty of which was headed by Thurston Dart, a great influence on the world of early music. Moroney later pursued advanced harpsichord studies with Kenneth Gilbert and Gustav Leonhardt. Moroney also holds performance and teaching diplomas (1974) from the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music. After earning their PhD in musicology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1980 with a thesis on the music of Thomas Tallis and William Byrd, they returned to Paris and worked mainly as a freelance performer until returning to the United States to serve on the faculty at UC Berkeley in 2001.
They have given the first modern performances of much repertoire; the Livre de tablature de Clavescin by Marc Roger Normand Couperin of Turin, whose works they identified in 1997, the complete organ works of Louis Couperin and a newly discovered autograph manuscript of harpsichord music by Henry Purcell.
They have recorded Bach, Biber, Couperin, and others. They won the 2000 Gramophone Early Music award for their recording of the complete keyboard music of William Byrd (see also: My Ladye Nevells Booke and The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book), published on Hyperion Records, which they performed on harpsichord, chamber organ, church organ, clavichord, and muselar.
They have published critical editions of the work of various baroque composers, including a keyboard edition (and their own recording) of Johann Sebastian Bach's The Art of Fugue that contains their own completion of the final unfinished fugue. They have also rediscovered the 40 and 60 part mass Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno by Alessandro Striggio, lost since the 17th century, of which they conducted what they believed to be the first performance since the 16th century on 17 July 2007 at the BBC Proms in London.
Until 2001, they were also director of Éditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre, the French-Australian music publishing company which sold its LP business to Decca Classics in 1970.

Rudolph Weaver (April 17, 1880 – November 10, 1944) was an American architect, university professor and administrator renowned for various buildings that they designed in Florida, Idaho and Washington, many of which are academic.
Early life, work and education
Weaver was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the son of Henry Weaver and their wife, Sara Jane Barnhart. Before college they worked as a bookbinder, printer and steelworker. They attended Pennsylvania State College for the year 1902-03 and then went to Drexel Institute where they received a diploma in architecture in 1905. They continued their study of architecture at Columbia University from 1906 to 1907, and at the atelier of Henry Hornbostel of the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects in 1907. They later received a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from Drexel in 1919.
Career history and works
Illinois
From 1909 to 1911, Weaver was an instructor in architecture at the University of Illinois.
Washington
From 1911 to 1923, they were the first chairperson of the architecture department at what is now Washington State University in Pullman, Washington, and was the first architect for the institution. They designed seven buildings, including:
Idaho
From 1923 to 1925 they held the same positions at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho, where they did the campus plan and in 1923 designed the Science Building, now Life Sciences South.
Florida
From 1925 until their death in 1944 they were founding dean of University of Florida's College of Architecture. During that time they were also the architect for the Florida Board of Control, which governed the state's three institutions of higher education and the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind. As board architect, Weaver succeeded William Augustus Edwards, the first architect to the board, and continued designing buildings in the Collegiate Gothic style begun by Edwards. Among the buildings they designed are:
Gainesville
The following buildings in the University of Florida Campus Historic District:

Their designs were followed so closely that even the FSCW stone relief at one entrance was not changed to use the new initials: FSU.Sellers, Robin Jeanne, Femina Perfecta: The Genesis of Florida State University, 1995, Tallahassee, FSU Foundation, pp. 267-268.
Gilchrist Hall, 1926
Landis Hall, 1939
Longmire Alumni Building, 1938
Marriage
On August 22, 1922, Rudolph Weaver married Alice Rossing Walden.
Death
Rudolph Weaver died in Gainesville in 1944 and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery. Their wife, Alice, died on July 26, 1960, and was buried next to him.
Honors
Rudolph Weaver Hall at the University of Florida was named for him, but is now called Fine Arts Building A and houses the UF Architecture & Fine Arts Library. There is also a Weaver Residence Hall, which some UF sites say was named for him, while others say it was named for their wife, Martha. Since their wife was named Alice'' and survived him, it appears that the first version is correct.

The Grand Lodge of Kentucky is one of two state organizations that supervise Masonic lodges in the state of Kentucky. It was established in 1800.
The Grand Lodge of Virginia (GLVA) established Lexington Lodge #25, the first Masonic lodge west of the Alleghany Mountains, in what is now Lexington, Kentucky, on November 17, 1788. GLVA established other lodges in Frankfort, Georgetown, Paris, and Shelbyville. The process to separate from the GLVA started on September 8, 1800, and was completed to form the Grand Lodge of Kentucky on October 16, 1800; the first Grand Master was William Murray. Half of the original Grand Officers were from the Lexington Lodge, which was renumbered to Lexington #1. Members of Lexington Lodge #1 would include Henry Clay.
By the 1820s, the 55 Lodges in Kentucky had a combined membership of 1800. However, the tide of Anti-Masonry caused a reduction to only 1300 members in 37 lodges by 1840. Membership in the 20th century was 100,675 in 479 lodges in 1961, and 83,000 in 457 lodges by the end of June 1989. By 2012, membership had fallen below 48,000. According to the 2020 edition of List of Lodges Masonic, membership had further fallen to 33,536 in that year, with only 351 active lodges.
A Grand Hall for the Grand Lodge was completed in Lexington on October 26, 1826, after plans for it started in 1813 and begun in 1824. While being built, the Grand Lodge was blessed to meet with fellow Freemason Marquis de Lafayette in 1825. Also among the notable events of the building was use as a hospital during a cholera outbreak in 1833, as well as the only two Indian Masons received in Lexington. After three years of discussion, the headquarters of the Grand Lodge were moved to Louisville in 1833. After the Grand Hall was destroyed by fire on 1837. When a new Grand Hall was built on the site of the original on September 1, 1841, the Grand Lodge returned to Lexington until 1858, when it returned to Louisville, where the headquarters remains to this day.
After the Anti-Masonic movement petered out, the Grand Lodge founded several institutions. In 1841 the Masonic University was started in La Grange, but it closed in 1881. The Grand Lodge later founded an Old Masons' Home in Shelbyville in 1901, and a Masonic widow and Orphans Home in Louisville in 1867, due to the number of widows and orphans caused by the American Civil War. World War I and the ensuing Spanish influenza outbreak caused overcrowding, and a larger orphan's home was constructed at the present-day location (the Saint Matthews area of Louisville), with residents moving to it in 1926. The largest concentration of orphans at the home was 632 in 1930. The last orphan left in 1989, resulting in the home being solely for senior care. Both now accept residents who do not have Masonic connections. The Home is the oldest Masonic foundation in North America.

A leviton, named after Leonid Levitov, is a collective excitation of a single electron within a metal. It has been mostly studied in two-dimensional electron gases alongside quantum point contacts. The main feature is that the excitation produces an electron pulse without the creation of electron holes. The time-dependence of the pulse is described by a Lorentzian distribution created by a pulsed electric potential.
Levitons have also been described in graphene.

Phylloscartes is a genus of small birds in the family Tyrannidae. They are found in wooded habitats of Central and South America. They mainly feed on small arthropods, and most commonly take part in mixed species flocks. The mottled-cheeked tyrannulet is among the commonest birds in its range, but several other species are rare and threatened. Their plumage is predominantly green, yellow, white and grey, and many have contrasting facial patterns and wing-bars. They have thin, pointed bills, and relatively long tails. Most frequently cock their tail, perch relatively horizontally and are very active.
The genus Pogonotriccus has usually been merged into Phylloscartes. In 2004 John Fitzpatrick in the Handbook of the Birds of the World chose to treat Pogonotriccus as a separate genus based on the slight differences in behaviour of the birds in the two genera. Frank Gill and David Donsker then also recognised Pogonotriccus in the list of bird species that they maintain on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee. The evidence for splitting the genus is weak: a 2009 molecular phylogenetic study that included one species from Pogonotriccus and three from Phylloscartes, found that the genetic differences were small.
Species
The genus contains 16 species:
Conservation
Four species in this genus are endangered according to the IUCN. These are: Phylloscartes roquettei, Phylloscartes beckeri, Phylloscartes ceciliae and Phylloscartes lanyoni.

The Way of St Andrews (Spanish: El Camino de San Andreas, French: Chemin de Saint-Andrews, German: der Weg von Saint Andrews, Italian: il cammino di Saint Andrews) is a Christian pilgrimage to St Andrews Cathedral in Fife, on the east coast of Scotland, UK, where the relics of the apostle, Saint Andrew, were once kept. A group started a revival in 2012 introducing new routes.
Historic pilgrimage to St Andrews
A gloss in the Annals of Ulster indicates that sometime in the mid-sixth century, Cainnech of Aghaboe built a small cell at Cennrigmonaid, an old name for St. Andrews. A church was likely founded around the beginning of the 8th century, probably by Óengus I mac Fergusa. Túathalán (died c. 747) was an 8th-century abbot of Kinrimund monastery.  They are known only from their obituary in the Annals of Ulster. Túathalán is the first cleric associated with a church establishment there. Archaeological excavations have shown that from as early as the eighth century, a ferry crossing to Earlsferry, near Elie in Fife was in existence, serving pilgrims on their way to the shrine of Saint Andrew.
Around 877, Causantín mac Cináeda built a new church for the Culdees at Kilrymont.
By the early twelfth century, the town of St Andrews was struggling to cope with the increasing numbers.
At this stage the king, Alexander I of Scotland, recognized the need for a larger church and a system to manage the flow of visiting pilgrims, and gave royal encouragement and funds to Robert, the newly elected bishop. Soon started the building of a great new cathedral complex approached by four main streets from the west, probably an accidental imitation of the shape of the scallop shell, the universal badge of pilgrimage. This cathedral, dominated by the tower to St Rule, became one of the largest buildings in Europe.
Alexander's successor, King David I of Scotland, continued to back the rebuilding of St Andrews and, furthermore, promised royal protection to pilgrims. Numbers steadily increased, mainly from two routes. From the south-east, pilgrims arrived mainly from the continent at North Berwick where they took the ferry to the south coast of Fife arriving at Earlsferry. They travelled the last 15 miles on foot to St Andrews along a track the width of "a donkey with two panniers". From the south, pilgrims arrived at modern South Queensferry and were ferried across the Firth of Forth before proceeding to St Andrews, a journey of around fifty miles.
Pilgrimage began to fall off as wars wracked Scotland and, even more so, with the coming of the Scottish Reformation. In 1559, the Protestant reformer John Knox preached a sermon in St Andrews, urging the pillage and destruction of the cathedral. The relics were removed to safety, but the interior of the cathedral was sacked, and the building was abandoned, to be replaced by a parish church, ending the tradition of pilgrimage. The cathedral was allowed to fall into ruin, and much of its stone was removed for use elsewhere in the proceeding years.
Revival of the pilgrimage tradition
The Way of St Andrews has seen renewed interest, with a recent revival campaign led by lay volunteers from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh.
St Margaret's Way, named after the Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland, was blessed and inaugurated in July 2012 during High Mass in Edinburgh's Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, and, afterwards, the pilgrims congregated round Eduardo Paolozzi's sculpture, "The Big Foot", an allegory for pilgrimage. There were about fifty pilgrims. The pilgrimage finished at St Andrews with an open-air procession and High Mass in the ruins of the cathedral and was covered by the BBC with interviews given by a cardinal and a Presbyterian minister.

2-(Dicyanomethylene)croconate is a divalent anion with chemical formula or ((N≡C−)2C=)(C5O4)2−. It is one of the pseudo-oxocarbon anions, as it can be described as a derivative of the croconate oxocarbon anion through the replacement of one oxygen atom by a dicyanomethylene group =C(−C≡N)2.
The anion was synthesized and characterized by A. Fatiadi in 1980, by hydrolysis of croconate violet treated with potassium hydroxide. It gives an orange solution in water.

Their first works were for Televisión Española of Navarra, Navarra-Canal 4, and Canal Satélite Digital.
Between 2011 and 2013 Cintora participated as a political analyst on several television shows in Spain, such as The debate de la 1 on TVE (Televisión Española) (2012-2013), La noche del Canal 24 horas on TVE (2012-2013), El programa de Ana Rosa (2011-2013) and El gran debate (2012-2013) on Telecinco, De hoy a mañana (2012-2013) and El cascabel (2013) on 13TV, Alto y claro in Telemadrid and La vuelta al mundo (2009-2011) on Veo7, and Una mirada al mundo (2012) on Discovery MAX.

Some of the characters that the journalist signed for television, such as Miguel Ángel Revilla, Sor Lucía Caram and Pedro J. Ramírez also participated. The foreword is by Iñaki Gabilondo, who describes the author in this way: 'Jesús Cintora, a young journalist of Soria whom I met on Cadena SER. Their personality and flair were obvious. Their informality, their brazenness and expressive simplicity fits like a glove with the newly released demands of transparency, freshness and audacity'.

The Catholic Church in Suriname is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, and is under the spiritual leadership of the Bishop of Rome, Pope Francis.
There are 117,261 Catholics in Suriname, 21.6% of the population, far lower than most of South America. The Church in Suriname consists of only one diocese, the Diocese of Paramaribo. There are 22 priests in the Diocese, with a ratio of about 5,030 Catholics per priest. There are 31 Catholic parishes in the diocese. The seat of the Diocese of Paramaribo is The Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul in Paramaribo. The current bishop of Paramaribo is Karel Choennie.
History
The first missionaries to come to Suriname were the Franciscans in 1683, but the harshness of the climate did not favor the arrival of other priests, so that up to 1786 the country was totally abandoned by the Catholic missions. Since 1786 some secular priests opened a missionary center, but soon had to flee to the opposition of the ministers of other Christian denominations. When in 1816 the territory passed into the hands of the Dutch, was guaranteed freedom of worship. This was the real starting point of Catholic evangelization of what today is called Suriname. In 1817 was erected the Apostolic Prefecture of Dutch Guyana, which became apostolic vicariate in 1842 and the mission was entrusted in a special way to the Redemptorists. On 7 May 1958 the apostolic vicariate was elevated to the rank of diocese, then Diocese of Paramaribo.
Ecclesiastical Organization
Today in the country there is only one Catholic ecclesiastical district, the Diocese of Paramaribo, suffragan of the Archdiocese of Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago.
The local episcopate is Antilles Episcopal Conference's officio member.
Apostolic Nunciature
The Apostolic Nunciature of Suriname was established on 16 February 1994.
Nuncios
Eugenio Sbarbaro (July 13, 1994 – April 26, 2000 appointed apostolic nuncio in Serbia and Montenegro)
Emil Paul Tscherrig (January 20, 2001 – May 22, 2004 appointed apostolic nuncio in Korea)
Thomas Edward Gullickson (December 15, 2004 – May 21, 2011 appointed apostolic nuncio in Ukraine)

Nikki Jenkins (born 1976) is a retired New Zealand artistic gymnast. Aged 14, they won gold at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, and they remain the youngest New Zealander to have won a gold medal at Commonwealth or Olympic Games.
Jenkins won the gold medal in the women's vault at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. They had been considered an outsider at the event who was not expected to have a high placing. Consequently they became the youngest New Zealander to win a gold medal at either the Commonwealth or Olympic Games.
Following the Games, Jenkins had increased demands from the media and expectations from the public. They were invited to a prestigious event in Russia and after that they prepared for the 1991 World Championships, where they intended to gain an individual qualification for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Unfortunately they contracted measles before the 1991 event and this meant that they could not compete. Moreover all the competitors were required to be inoculated and this caused some suspicion amongst a few nations. This brought unwanted attention on New Zealand and Jenkins. Jenkins was unable to qualify for the Barcelona Olympics and continued with gymnastics, but their dream had come to an end and they eventually quit.
They opted to study physical education at the University of Otago. Sources differ whether they have been teaching physical education at schools in Auckland, or whether they live in Australia and is involved in performing arts.

Chief Medallist of the Royal Mint was a senior position at the British Royal Mint responsible for the overseeing of medal production. Historically the position was created in 1828 as a compromise to allow Italian engraver Benedetto Pistrucci to be more involved in the mint's engraving process without becoming the Mint's chief engraver. Being a foreign born Italian, appointment of Pistrucci to the prestigious role of Chief Engraver would have proved too scandalous and therefore despite performing the duties of chief engraver they were awarded the title of Chief Medallist. The role of Chief Engraver previously held by Thomas Wyon was awarded to their cousin William Wyon who along with Pistrucci were required to share the wages of both the Chief Engraver and second engraver, much to their disliking. In their role of Chief Medallist, Pistrucci was left feeling bitter at the injustice against him, producing little work of note apart from their Waterloo Medal.

Cerconota trochistis is a moth of the family Depressariidae. It is found in French Guiana.
The wingspan is 23–28 mm. The forewings are light fuscous with the extreme costal edge whitish-ochreous, near the base dark fuscous. There are three dark fuscous costal spots, the first at one-fourth is small, the second in the middle is subtriangular and the third about three-fourths is elongated. An irregular patch of rather dark fuscous suffusion or irroration is found towards the dorsum and the disc anteriorly, sometimes almost obsolete. The first discal stigma is usually obscured in this, the plical and second discal dark fuscous. There is a very indistinctly indicated darker fuscous line from the second costal spot to three-fourths of the dorsum, strongly curved outwards in the disc, as well as a waved interrupted cloudy dark fuscous or blackish line from the third costal spot to the dorsum before the tornus, the median third curved outwards but sinuate in the middle. A marginal series of large cloudy dark fuscous dots is found around the apex and termen, confluent into a small spot beneath the apex. The hindwings are grey.

Günter Lenz (born 25 July 1938) is a German jazz bassist and composer.
Activities
Lenz was born in Frankfurt am Main. They first taught themselves guitar and studied with Carlo Bohländer, playing jazz in the clubs of the U.S. Army from 1954 onwards. During national service in 1959/1960 they switched to the bass. In 1961 Albert Mangelsdorff picked them up as member of the Albert Mangelsdorff Quintet. Since then Lenz has also become a member of the "hr-jazz ensemble," for which they arranged and composed too. In 1965 they worked in the quintet of Krzysztof Komeda, taking part in the recording of the album Astigmatic. In 1968 they played with Joachim Kühn and Aldo Romano in a band led by Barney Wilen at the Berlin Jazz Days. With The German All Stars they toured internationally in 1969 and 1971. They played with the George Russell Sextet, and also with a band led by Leon Thomas. This allowed them to collect big band experience. During the 1970s they were a member of the Kurt Edelhagen Big Band (1972) and of Peter Herbolzheimer Rhythm Combination & Brass (Scenes (Live At Ronnie Scott's Club). Chet Baker, Coleman Hawkins, Oliver Nelson and Benny Bailey engaged them for their concert tours and record productions, as well as German musicians such as Eugen Cicero, Horst Jankowski and Volker Kriegel. 1972 Günter Lenz played with Lightning Hopkins.
In the mid-1970s, Lenz joined with the drummer Peter Giger in "Clarinet Contrast", an avantgarde band around the clarinetists Perry Robinson, Theo Jörgensmann, Bernd Konrad and Michel Pilz. As a member of the Manfred Schoof Quintet they recorded for ECM/Japo.
In the late 1970s they founded their combo Günter Lenz Springtime, an international jazz-fusion band with members as Bob Degen, Claus Stötter, Frank St. Peter, Johannes Faber, Leszek Zadlo and Joe Nay.
Lenz recorded as part of the Berlin Contemporary Jazz Orchestra. In 1991 they recorded "Life at the Montreux Music Festival" in trio-formation with Uli Lenz and Allen Blairman
Lenz also created orchestral arrangements for Plácido Domingo. From 2001 to 2006 they taught as a bass professor at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart.

Charles Rozanski (born March 11, 1955) is a German-American retailer and columnist, known as the President and CEO of the Denver, Colorado-based Mile High Comics Inc., and a columnist for the Comics Buyer's Guide.
Early life
Rozanski was born March 11, 1955 in Goldbach, Bavaria, West Germany, and later moved to the United States with their mother and stepfather, an American Army officer.
Career
Mile High Comics
In 1969, when Rozanski was 13, they began working out of their parents' Colorado basement, selling back issues of comic books by running mail order ads in the magazine Rocket's Blast Comicollector. The following year, they began promoting comics as the youngest seller ever to exhibit at the Colorado Springs Antiques Market. In 1971, they founded the Colorado Springs Comics Club. The following year, they attended their first national comics convention, Multicon in Oklahoma City, where they sold $1,800 USD in comics in three days. It was this point that they realized comics retailing could be a career. They opened their first store in Boulder, Colorado in 1974 with $800 in cash and 10,000 comics. By 1977, they had expanded to four stores in the greater Denver area. In December of that year, they purchased the Edgar Church Collection, the largest and highest-quality Golden Age comics collection ever discovered. The cache had been preserved due to the unvarying 60 degree temperature and minimal humidity, and consisted of 16,000 comic books dating from 1937 to 1955, including the first Superman comic and the first Marvel Comic. The purchase of the Church Collection helped Mile High Comics expand its influence nationally, and helped bring a geometric rise to the price of rare comic books, which became a legitimate investment. Rozanski once sold a batch of comics from the Church Collection and used the profits to put a down payment on a 22,000 square-foot warehouse.
In 1979 Rozanski purchased Richard Alf Comics' mail order division, with which they gained systems and methods for greatly expanding their mail order sales. To that end, they created Alternate Realities Distributing, Inc., a wholesale distributor run by Rozanski's wife Nanette. The Rozanskis eventually sold Alternate Realities to Bud Plant in 1987.
In 1980, Rozanski purchased a double-page ad in mainstream Marvel comics, listing prices for back issues they had for sale. This ad, which was the first of its kind, was a departure from the general practice of the time for its inclusion of prices, which Rozanski explains was a way to educate non-collectors as to the value of their collections. The ad affirmed that back issues were a valid commodity for the collector's market, and led not only to a boom to Mile High Comics, but to the entire back issue market.
In 1991 Rozanski and Mile High Comics opened the first comics mega-store in Denver, which measured 11,000 square feet. The company eventually expanded to eight stores, and has grown to become one of the most successful comics specialty shops in the United States.
Writing
In 2002 Rozanski began writing the column "Tales from the Database" for the Comics Buyer's Guide.
Appearances
Rozanski drives all over the U.S. to local comics shops in order to stock Mile High's back issue inventory.  They are also a frequent attendee at comic book conventions across the country.
Rozanski was one of five people whose journey to and experiences at the San Diego Comic Con were depicted in the 2011 Morgan Spurlock documentary Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope. In the film, Rozanski seeks to sell a copy of Red Raven #1 for $500,000 in order to pay off their debts. Although they do not sell the comic book, their booth at the convention generates more profit than the previous year's, allowing Mile High Comics to move into a new 65,000 square foot warehouse.
Awards and recognition
Rozanski is widely recognized as an industry leader, and in 2003 they were awarded the Defender of Liberty Award by the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund for their long-standing dedication to the protection of free speech.
Personal life
Rozanski and their wife, Nanette, live in Boulder, Colorado with their four daughters, Rowan, Aleta, Tanith, and Elsbeth.

However, on October 7, 2020, Showtime reversed the renewal and canceled the series, stating that "the [COVID-19 pandemic] has continued to challenge schedules across the board, and although we have made every effort to reunite the cast and crew for a second season, that has become untenable."

Besides competing in the North American Soccer League, the Cosmos traveled all over the world playing against world-class teams in Asia, South America, Central America, Africa and Europe. On November 16, 1983, the Cosmos released Kapp and several other teammates because of salary constraints and downsizing of the club. In December 1983, Kapp signed with the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL).

According to Saoud Al Tamimi, Roads Projects Department Manager at Ashghal, the project resulted in a 60% reduction in time spent traveling in the district and helped integrate the roads into the national expressway network. Overall, 91 km of shared pedestrian and cycling paths, 1,937 light poles, 7,100 parking bays and over 20 km of road was constructed.
The most vital road constructed as part of the road and infrastructure project was Bani Hajer Interchange, which links westward Dukhan with Bani Hajer and Al Rayyan City. Four overpasses, two loops and two link bridges are included on this highway, the most heavily trafficked being the Bani Hajer Underpass which connects Bani Hajer's Al Shahama Street to Al Rayyan Al Jadeed Street in Al Rayyan City.

A deep plan building is a building in which the horizontal distance from the external wall is many times greater than the floor to floor height. Deep plan buildings make more efficient use of site area. They also cost less to build per unit floor area because of their smaller wall to floor area ratio.
Deep plan buildings introduce complications for light and ventilation penetration that are relatively easily solved for single story buildings (for example using sawtooth roofs) but usually necessitate artificial lighting and air conditioning or ventilation if over one story.

Michele Irmiter Elliott OBE is an author, psychologist, teacher and the founder and director of child protection charity Kidscape. They have chaired World Health Organization and Home Office working groups and is a Winston Churchill fellow.
Early life
Elliott was born on 7 January 1946 to James Irmiter and Ivy (née Dashwood). They graduated from Dixie Hollins High School in 1964. They attended the University of South Florida and the University of Florida, gaining a BA in Science and Education and a Masters's degree in Psychology They began working with families and children in 1968 in London.
Work

Kidscape
Elliott founded Kidscape in 1984 to help children stay safe from sexual abuse and from bullying.
Elliott has been a high-profile figure and Kidscape was named Charity of the Year in 2000. Writing in The Guardian, David Brindle suggested the award was "an undoubted reflection of the vibrancy of Michele Elliott".
Female child sexual abuse offenders
Elliott, who had previously written books about male abuse of children, has undertaken pioneering work in investigating and raising awareness of the problem and extent of child sexual abuse committed by women, and the topic of female paedophilia, publishing the book Female Sexual Abuse of Children The Last Taboo in 1992. The book was well received by professionals and survivors' organisations. Mike Lew described it as "an important and challenging work", helping "to forge a new understanding of the issues". Doody's annual stated it was "an extremely valuable book for all professionals, and it greatly increases the current state of knowledge, or lack of that knowledge, that can have a profound influence on the survivor's development and recovery".
Elliott's work in exposing the issue of child sexual abuse committed by women has also resulted in hostility from feminists.
While compiling Female Sexual Abuse of Children, Elliott organised a conference in London concerning sexual abuse by women. After publishing the book, Elliott was subject to a "deluge" of hate mail from feminists.

Gaetano Latilla (12 January 1711 – 15 January 1788) was an Italian opera composer, the most important of the period immediately preceding Niccolò Piccinni (his nephew).
Latilla was born in Bari, and studied at the Loreto Conservatory in Naples. They began writing comic operas for the Teatro dei Fiorentini in Naples in 1732, and is best known for their settings of Gismondo (Rome, 1737) and Madama Ciana (Rome, 1738). These two works, along with two by Rinaldo da Capua, formed the core of the traveling Italian comic opera repertory of the 1740s and early 1750s. They also wrote some opere serie, the first of which was a setting of Demofoonte (Venice, 1738).
They died in Naples.

Barangaroo railway station is a future underground rapid transit station for the inner-city Barangaroo precinct in Sydney, Australia. The proposal, announced in 2015, forms part of Transport for NSW's Sydney Metro City & Southwest scheme and would make Barangaroo the first stop for southbound metro trains in the central business district (CBD).
While plans for a harbour rail tunnel have been government policy for more than a decade, neither the 2005 Metropolitan Rail Expansion (MREP) and 2012 Sydney's Rail Future strategies envisaged the new line stopping at Barangaroo. The various metro rail proposals of 2008–10, which involved lines running west from the CBD towards Rozelle and the northern suburbs, would have included a station between Wynyard and Barangaroo. These proposals were shelved in 2010, however. The government also considered a light rail line from Central to Barangaroo via Sussex Street and Hickson Road, but nothing came of this proposal.
With the first buildings at Barangaroo opening in 2015 and no mass transit construction imminent, Transport for NSW instead began work on the Wynyard Walk: a pedestrian tunnel to connect Wynyard station and the new precinct. The walkway was opened in September 2016.
In 2015, Premier Mike Baird announced the government's intention to divert the second harbour rail crossing via Barangaroo to allow a station to be built there. On 10 November 2018 NSW Transport announced that a 180-year-old timber boat was met with during excavation works for the Metro station, regarded as 'the oldest boat of its kind ever found in NSW'. Wood samples revealed it is made from Sydney Blue Gum, Stringybark and Spotted Gum.
Starting from October 2019, excavation and tunnelling work has begun at the Barangaroo station precinct and under the Sydney Harbour. This station is scheduled to open in 2024, as part of the Sydney Metro City & Southwest.

The Elsa () is a river in the Italian region of Tuscany. It flows northward to empty into the left bank of the Arno. From its source at Molli, Sovicelle, the flow of the river is low until its reaches its major tributaries at Vene di Onci and Caldane. The mouth of the river divides Frazione Marcignana of Empoli and Isola, San Miniato. The basin of the Elsa has been continuously inhabited since at least the time of the Etruscan civilization.
The Elsa River Basin is located between Montagnola Senese and the rolling hills of Chianti, roughly corresponding to the eponymous valley Val d'Elsa. Catchments are predominantly fan shaped. It encompasses a number of comune (municipalities) in the provinces of Florence and Siena.

Scrambling is a syntactic phenomenon wherein sentences can be formulated using a variety of different word orders without any change in meaning. Scrambling often results in a discontinuity since the scrambled expression can end up at a distance from its head. Scrambling does not occur in English, but it is frequent in languages with freer word order, such as German, Russian, Persian and Turkic languages. The term was coined by Haj Ross in their 1967 dissertation and is widely used in present work, particularly with the generative tradition.
Examples
The following examples from German illustrate typical instances of scrambling:
{|cellspacing="10"
||b.||dass||der Mann||die Bohnen||der Frau||gab
|-
||c.||dass||der Frau||der Mann||die Bohnen||gab
|-
||d.||dass||der Frau||die Bohnen||der Mann||gab
|-
||e.||dass||die Bohnen||der Mann||der Frau||gab
|-
||f.||dass||die Bohnen||der Frau||der Mann||gab
|}
These examples illustrate typical cases of scrambling in the midfield of a subordinate clause in German. All six clauses are acceptable, whereby the actual order that appears is determined by pragmatic considerations such as emphasis. If one takes the first clause (clause a) as the basic order, then scrambling has occurred in clauses b–f. The three constituents der Mann, der Frau, and die Bohnen have been scrambled.
Scrambling in German is associated with the midfield, i.e. the part of the sentence that appears between the finite verb and a non-finite verb in main clauses and between the subordinator (= subordinating conjunction) and the finite verb in an embedded clause (= subordinate clause). There is a clear tendency for definite pronouns to appear to the left in the midfield. In this regard, definite pronouns are frequent candidates to undergo scrambling:
The canonical position of the object in German is to the right of the subject. In this regard, the object pronouns mich in the first example and uns in the second example have been scrambled to the left, so that the clauses now have OS (object-subject) order. The second example is unlike the first example insofar as it, due to the presence of the auxiliary verb wird 'will', necessitates an analysis in terms of a discontinuity.
Standard instances of scrambling in German occur in the midfield, as stated above. There are, however, many non-canonical orderings, whose displaced constituents do not appear in the midfield. One can argue that such examples also involve scrambling:
The past participle erwähnt has been topicalized in this sentence, but its object, the pronoun das, appears on the other side of the finite verb. There is no midfield involved in this case, which means the non-canonical position in which das appears in relation to its governor erwähnt cannot be addressed in terms of midfield scrambling. The position of das also cannot be addressed in terms of extraposition, since extraposed constituents are relatively heavy, much heavier than das, which is a very light definite pronoun. Given these facts, one can argue that a scrambling discontinuity is present. The definite pronoun das has been scrambled rightward out from under its governor erwähnt. Hence, the example suggests that the scrambling mechanism is quite flexible.
Scrambling is like extraposition (but unlike topicalization and wh-fronting) in a relevant respect; it is clause-bound. That is, one cannot scramble a constituent out of one clause into another:
The first example has canonical word order; scrambling has not occurred. The second example illustrates what happens when one attempts to scramble the definite pronoun das out of the embedded clause into the main clause. The sentence becomes strongly unacceptable. Extraposition is similar. When one attempts to extrapose a constituent out of one clause into another, the result is unacceptable.
Scrambling within a constituent
Classical Latin and Ancient Greek were known for a more extreme type of scrambling known as hyperbaton, defined as a "violent displacement of words". This involves the scrambling (extraposition) of individual words out of their syntactic constituents. Perhaps the most well-known example is magnā cum laude "with great praise" (lit. "great with praise"). This was possible in Latin and Greek because of case-marking: For example, both magnā and laude are in the ablative case.
Hyperbaton is found in a number of prose writers, e.g. Cicero:
Hic optimus illīs temporibus est patrōnus habitus
(word-for-word) they (the) best in those times was lawyer considered
(meaning) 'He was considered the best lawyer in those times.'
Much more extreme hyperbaton occurred in poetry, often with criss-crossing constituents. An example from Ovid is
Grandia per multōs tenuantur flūmina rīvōs.
(word-for-word) great into many are channeled rivers brooks.
(meaning) 'Great rivers are channeled into many brooks.'
An interlinear gloss is as follows:
The two nouns (subject and object) are placed side-by-side, with both corresponding adjectives extraposed on the opposite side of the verb, in a non-embedding fashion.
Even more extreme cases are noted in the poetry of Horace, e.g.
Glossed interlinearly, the lines are as follows:
Because of the case, gender and number marking on the various nouns, adjectives and determiners, a careful reader can connect the discontinuous and interlocking phrases Quis ... gracilis ... puer, multā ... in rōsā, liquidīs ... odōribus in a way that would be impossible in English.
Theoretical analyses
The theoretical analysis of scrambling can vary a lot depending on the theory of sentence structure that one adopts. Constituency-based theories (phrase structure theories) that prefer strictly binary branching structures are likely to address most cases of scrambling in terms of movement (or copying). One or more constituents is assumed to move out of its base position into a derived position. Many other theories of sentence structure, for instance those that allow n-ary branching structures (such as all dependency grammars), see many (but not all!) instances of scrambling involving just shifting; a discontinuity is not involved. The varying analyses are illustrated here using trees. The first tree illustrates the movement analysis of the example above in a theory that assumes strictly binary branching structures. The German subordinate clause weil mich die anderen oft einladen is used, which translates as 'because the others often invite me':
The abbreviation "Sub" stands for "subordinator" (= subordinating conjunction), and "S" stands for "subordinator phrase" (= embedded clause). The tree on the left shows a discontinuity (= crossing lines) and the tree on the right illustrates how a movement analysis deals with the discontinuity. The pronoun mich is generated in a position immediately to the right of the subject; it then moves leftward to reach its surface position. The binary branching structures necessitate this analysis in terms of a discontinuity and movement.
A theory of syntax that rejects the subject-predicate division of traditional grammar (Sentence → NP+VP) and assumes relatively flat structures (that lack a finite VP constituent) will acknowledge no discontinuity in this example. Instead, a shifting analysis addresses many instances of scrambling. The following trees illustrate the shifting-type analysis in a dependency-based grammar. The clause from above is again used (weil mich die anderen oft einladen 'because the others often invite me'):
The tree on the left shows the object in its canonical position to the right of the subject, and the tree on the right shows the object in the derived position to the left of the subject. The important thing to acknowledge about the two trees is that there are no crossing lines. In other words, there is no discontinuity. The absence of a discontinuity is due to the flat structure assumed (which, again, lacks a finite VP constituent). The point, then, is that the relative flatness/layeredness of the structures that one assumes influences significantly the theoretical analysis of scrambling.
The example just examined can be, as just shown, accommodated without acknowledging a discontinuity (if a flat structure is assumed). There are many other cases of scrambling, however, where the analysis must acknowledge a discontinuity, almost regardless of whether relatively flat structures are assumed or not. This fact means that scrambling is generally acknowledged as one of the primary discontinuity types (in addition to topicalization, wh-fronting, and extraposition).

Skaay was a blind, crippled storyteller of the Haida village of Ttanuu born c. 1827 at Qquuna. Skaay could neither read nor write, but their stories of Haida mythology have survived in the form of written transcriptions taken down by John Swanton with the aide of Henry Moody over the winter of 1900. These transcriptions of myths are unique in the literature, both for their fidelity (due to Swanton) to the precise wordings of the mythteller, and for the survival of the pre-translation originals.
The stories Skaay chose to dictate are the Qquuna Cycle, the longest poem recorded in Haida, Qquuna Qiighawaay, the oral history of Skaay's family, and Raven Travelling, Skaay's original take on the well-worn tale (see Raven Tales).
Skaay appears three times in church records: first, in 1884 when they were baptized "Robert McKay"; second, on 13 March 1892, again a baptism, where their name is entered simply as "Sky"; third, in January 1894 when they register a marriage to "Esther" and was baptized once more, this time as "John Sky". In Haida, 'Skaay' refers to a type of mollusk. The Haida were divided into two social groups, or moieties, called Raven and Eagle. Skaay belonged to the Eagle side or moiety.

John Patrick Savage (May 28, 1932 – May 13, 2003) was a Welsh-born Canadian physician and politician. Savage was the 23rd premier of Nova Scotia between 1993 and 1997. They were born in Wales, and educated in both the United Kingdom and Ireland. They immigrated to Canada in 1967 and was a noted family physician in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. They became the mayor of Dartmouth in 1985, and won re-election twice. They then became the leader of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in 1992 and stepped down as mayor. In 1993, they defeated the incumbent provincial government and became premier. Savage was a controversial premier, bringing in many reforms in taxation, regional government, and government hiring practices. They resigned as premier in 1997 due to their low approval ratings in public polls. They died of cancer at the age of 70 in 2003. They were the father of Mike Savage, current mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality.
Early life
Born in Newport, Wales, they were the son of an Irish Roman Catholic doctor father and a Welsh Baptist housewife mother. They attended school at Prior Park College, Bath, before attending Queen's University of Belfast to become a physician.
Nova Scotia
They were generally unhappy with the United Kingdom's government-run healthcare system known as the National Health Service. When they saw an advertisement for doctors in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, Savage decided to pack up their family and move across the ocean to continue their medical practice in 1967. They made a name for themselves as the "hippie doctor" in the 1970s, due to their beard and progressive health stances. By setting up a detox centre — and a free clinic in the economically disadvantaged and mostly black community of North Preston — they assured their reputation as a left-winger.
They started their political life running for federal office in the Halifax area in the 1970s. They were defeated twice as a federal Liberal Party candidate. In 1985, they ran successfully to become the mayor of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, where they lived. While mayor, they received a reputation as a left-wing free spender. They were re-elected as mayor in both 1988 and 1991.
Premier of Nova Scotia
The Nova Scotia Liberal Party had its annual general meeting in Dartmouth on February 29, 1992. Savage attended a session of the meeting to bring greetings from the City of Dartmouth, in their capacity as its mayor, but didn't realize that the party's rank and file were about to oust their long-time leader, Vince McLean. They were approached to run for the Liberal leadership and took a leave of absence from their mayoral duties. The election was held by computerized telephone balloting, and they won on the second ballot in June 1992.
On May 25, 1993, Savage defeated sitting Premier Donald Cameron and the governing Progressive Conservatives in the 1993 provincial election, winning 40 of the legislature's 52 seats.
During their term as premier, and saddled with huge operating debts left by the previous government and declining equalization payments from the federal government of Jean Chrétien, they became a tough fiscal conservative, balancing the provincial budget in 1996 for the first time since 1978.
In doing so, they cut social spending drastically and cut the wages of thousands of civil servants. Other programs, such as constructing a toll highway, municipal amalgamations by creating the Cape Breton Regional Municipality and the Halifax Regional Municipality, and the implementation of the Harmonized Sales Tax were initiated under their watch.
Their government also led the country in the creation of tougher anti-smoking legislation, consolidation of school boards and local health authorities, creation of the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, the establishment of one of the most modern emergency health services in North America along with province-wide emergency field communications systems, and they waged a tough and ultimately successful fight against an entrenched patronage system in the provincial Department of Transportation and Public Works, as well as within their own political party.
Savage's detractors labelled them as inexperienced and stubborn. Faced with increasing discontent from within their own party over some of their anti-patronage policies, and after surviving a July 1995 leadership review vote, they resigned as premier in 1997. In its editorial page on March 22, 1997, The Globe and Mail, after citing their list of reforms, called them "the best premier in a generation," and berated both Liberal party members and the public for forcing them to resign.
Later life and death
After Savage resigned, they and their wife Margaret traveled to Africa to perform missionary work. They worked in The Gambia, providing HIV/AIDS education to youth. In 2001, they acknowledged they had stomach cancer, which spread throughout their body until their death on May 13, 2003. Just three days before their death, they were made an officer of the Order of Canada. They died in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, about six weeks after their wife's death, also from cancer. Savage and their wife had seven children, with their son Mike Savage following in their father's footsteps and becoming the mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality in 2012.

Sebnitz () is a railway station in the town of Sebnitz, Saxony, Germany. The station lies on the Bautzen–Bad Schandau railway and the Rumburk–Sebnitz railway.
The station is served by Städtebahn Sachsen and DB Regio.
The line into the Czech Republic, to Dolní Poustevna was closed in 1945. In 2012 it was announced that funding had been agreed for the rebuilding and reopening of the line. The new line was opened on 5 July 2014. This work included rebuilding the junction and some hundred metres of track and signalling to the border, from where the track has already been rebuilt.

Hydroflotation is a surgical technique used as intraoperative prophylaxis to prevent postoperative adhesion formation inside body cavities, by use of certain solutions. The instilled solution keeps organs in a body cavity afloat and separate from each other. This technique is very frequently used in pelvic and abdominal surgeries.
Solutions used
Some of the solutions that are used include 32% Dextran (outdated and known anaphylactic), normal saline, Ringer's lactate with or without heparin (5000 IU in 200 ml) and Adept (4% icodextrin). Normal saline and Ringer's lactate are absorbed within 24 hours, while icodextrin resides for about 5–7 days, the critical time when adhesion formation takes place and it has therefore replaced most crystalloids used for this purpose.

Trading Spaces is an hour-long American television reality program that originally aired from 2000 to 2008 on the cable channels TLC and Discovery Home. The format of the show was based on the BBC TV series Changing Rooms. The first iteration ran for eight seasons. A revival began airing on April 7, 2018, with several team members of the original run returning.
Premise
In each episode, two sets of neighbors redecorated one room in each other's home. Each two-person team had two (later, three) days, a budget of US$1,000, (later $2,000) and the services of a designer. Both teams in early seasons shared one carpenter, while later on, each team had a carpenter. Although the producers generally allowed the teams to go over budget slightly, there was one instance when a designer went $150 over budget and the producers forced them to return a rug they bought for the project.
The teams have no say over what happens in their own homes, but they are able to give input into what happens in the home they are redecorating. The teams are not allowed to enter their own home for the duration of the show, and the transformed rooms are revealed only at the end of the final day.
Ty Pennington, one of the show's original carpenters, later hosted Extreme Makeover: Home Edition on ABC.
Production and changes
The first season featured original host Alex McLeod and some designers who never returned to the show, such as Dez Ryan and Roderick Shade, and was produced by Knoxville, Tennessee–based RVIR Media. After the first 40 episodes, McLeod left to pursue other television opportunities. Beginning with the second season in 2001, Paige Davis took over as host, with the new production company Banyan Productions of Philadelphia. Early-season episodes were traditionally videotaped in and around the production company's home base, as can be seen in this episode's titles (where the city or state and the street are listed).
Beginning in the show's fifth season, homeowners chose up to three rooms for their neighbors to re-decorate, and the rooms were selected randomly, with some rooms having increased budgets of $2000 or $3000. Midway through this season, Davis was dismissed, and the show went to a hostless format for several seasons and episodes often featured two carpenters. This change allowed the two homes to be farther apart, with the most extreme case featuring homes in New York and Oklahoma in the same episode.
On November 13, 2007, it was announced that Davis would be returning as the host of Trading Spaces beginning in January 2008. The first episode with Davis as host aired on January 26, 2008. The show also changed production companies, from Banyan Productions to A. Smith & Co. Productions. On February 6, 2009, Davis announced that Trading Spaces was not picked up for a ninth season.
On March 28, 2017, TLC announced that it had ordered an eight-episode revival of Trading Spaces from Endemol Shine North America's Authentic Entertainment. Host Paige Davis returned, joined by a number of cast members from the original era of the series, as well as new carpenters Brett Tutor and Joanie Dodd (billed as Joanie Sprague), new designers John Gidding, Kahi Lee, Sabrina Soto, and one-off crossovers from Nate Berkus and Jeremiah Brent (fellow TLC series Nate & Jeremiah by Design) and Clinton Kelly (former fellow TLC series What Not to Wear). A reunion special hosted by Lisa Joyner was also planned to accompany the April 7, 2018 premiere, featuring appearances by other former cast members. The format remains relatively unchanged from the previous seasons, although the spending budget was increased to $2,000. There is also brand integration with the online retailers Overstock.com and Wayfair; one of the retailers provides a "pop-up store" with home décor products during each episode, where a homeowner may pick an item for incorporation into their respective room.
The two-hour premiere (which included part one of the reunion special and the season premiere episode) was seen by 2.8 million viewers, making it TLC's highest-rated Saturday primetime program since 2010. On May 30, 2018, TLC renewed Trading Spaces for a tenth season, with a premiere date set for March 16, 2019, and twelve episodes produced. On November 10, 2019, host Paige Davis stated that there were not currently plans for an eleventh season.

Spin-offs
Trading Spaces: Family
The first spin-off, entitled Trading Spaces: Family, also aired on TLC (2003–2005). It allowed larger teams of three or four, including children considered too young to participate in the original Trading Spaces program. The same designers and carpenters (one per episode, shared by the two teams) worked with host Joe Farrell.
Trading Spaces: Boys vs. Girls
Another spin-off, Trading Spaces: Boys vs. Girls aired as a part of Discovery Kids along with airing on the network's Saturday morning block on NBC). Unlike the original, this version used the same two designers and two carpenters for each episode. In addition, there is no budget limit, and the rooms are rebuilt into theme rooms, making the show look more like Monster House. Reruns aired on The Hub until June 2011.
Trading Spaces: Home Free
A spun off series produced for TLC in 2004. In this spin-off the winning couple received their home mortgage-free.
Trading Spaces: 100 Grand
This was a special episode where the budget was increased to $50,000 per team (while keeping the standard time limit). Designer Doug Wilson and carpenter Amy Wynn Pastor completely remodeled and equipped a kitchen, while designer Laurie Smith and carpenter Ty Pennington completely remodeled and furnished a living room. Approximately two minutes of footage from this episode is included in the Trading Spaces: We're Back online series.
The Best Of Trading Spaces
In January 2011, TLC's sister channel OWN debuted The Best Of Trading Spaces, which revisits some of the traded spaces from the series. Paige Davis hosts the new segments, including interviews with the people who traded spaces in each episode and what has been changed in the spaces since the original episode aired.
Training Spaces
Initially commissioned as part of the series relaunch, Training Spaces is a "GO ORIGINAL" online series, available through TLC on demand, the TLC website, and the TLCgo app which serves as a bootcamp for carpenters and designers, hosted by Paige Davis.
Season 1 (April 7, 2018): The theme of Season 1 is "3 new designers, 2 new carpenters, 1 epic bootcamp". Episode 1 features Tutor and Sprague being mentored by Pennington and Oosterhouse, while Episodes 2-6 feature Soto, Gidding and Lee being mentored by one of the veteran designers in each episode (Yip, Wilson, Santo-Tomás, Smith, Gorder).
Season 2 (March 11, 2019): The theme of Season 2 is "6 contestants, 1 winner", as six designers compete to be a design assistant for veteran designer Frank Bielec in the upcoming season of Trading Spaces. In six of the seven episodes, one of the other veteran designers (Pennington, Smith, Oosterhouse, Wilson, Soto, Santo-Tomás) joins Bielec in challenging the contestants.
Trading Spaces: We're Back
Also as part of the relaunch, TLC commissioned this online series of nine mini episodes featuring Davis and most of the returning series veterans reflecting on some of the best, worst and most memorable moments from the original run.

The Christ Heart Church (Japanese: 基督心宗教団) is a new religious movement that was formed in 1927. Its founder, Kawai Shinsui (川合信水, 1867-1962), reinterpreted the faith through the lenses of Confucian and Buddhist traditions by claiming that Christianity offers a more complete path of self-cultivation and advocates traditional Buddhist disciplines of meditation to achieve a Christian satori (enlightenment). Zen meditation and kyōkenjutsu (強健術) became important means of development in the Christ Heart Church.
In sharp contrast to Protestant missionary policy, the Christ Heart Church allow its members to maintain the traditional Buddhist altar in the home. They also see no conflict between Christian faith and ancestor veneration. Members are encouraged to show 'proper respect' toward traditional customs, and the church supports participation in Buddhist ancestral rites with non-Christian family members.

Rethymno (, , also Rethimno, Rethymnon, Réthymnon, and Rhíthymnos) is a city in Greece on the island of Crete. It is the capital of Rethymno regional unit, and has a population of more than 30,000 inhabitants (near 40,000 for the municipal unit). It is a former Latin Catholic bishopric as Retimo(–Ario) and former Latin titular see.
Rethymno was originally built during the Minoan civilization (ancient Rhithymna and Arsinoe). The city was prominent enough to mint its own coins and maintain urban growth. One of these coins is today depicted as the crest of the town: two dolphins in a circle.
History
This region as a whole is rich with ancient history, most notably through the Minoan civilisation centred at Knossos east of Rethymno. Rethymno itself began a period of growth when the Venetian conquerors of the island decided to put an intermediate commercial station between Heraklion and Chania, acquiring its own bishop and nobility in the process. Today's old town (palia poli) was almost entirely built by the Republic of Venice. It is one of the best-preserved old towns in Crete.
From circa 1250 the city was the seat of the Latin Diocese of Retimo, which was renamed Retimo–Ario after the absorption in 1551 of the Diocese of Ario and as suppressed only after the Turkish conquest.
The town still maintains its old aristocratic appearance, with its buildings dating from the 16th century, arched doorways, stone staircases, Byzantine and Hellenic-Roman remains, the small Venetian harbour and narrow streets. The Venetian Loggia houses the information office of the Ministry of Culture and Sports. A Wine Festival is held there annually at the beginning of July. Another festival, in memory of the destruction of the Arkadi Monastery, is held on 7–8 November.
The city's Venetian-era citadel, the Fortezza of Rethymno, is one of the best-preserved castles in Crete. Other monuments include the Neratze mosque (the Municipal Odeon arts centre), the Great Gate ( or "Porta Guora"), the Piazza Rimondi and the Loggia.
The town was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1646 during the Cretan War (1645–69) and they ruled it for almost three centuries. The town, called Resmo in Turkish, was the centre of a sanjak (administrative part of a province) during Ottoman rule.
During the Battle of Crete (20–30 May 1941), the Battle of Rethymno was fought between German paratroopers and the Second Australian Imperial Force and Hellenic Army. Although initially unsuccessful, the Germans won the battle after receiving reinforcements from Maleme in the Northwestern part of the island.
Today the city's main income is from tourism, many new facilities having been built in the past 20 years. Agriculture is also notable, especially for olive oil and other Mediterranean products.
Municipality
The municipality of Rethymno was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
Arkadi
Lappa
Nikiforos Fokas
Rethymno
Population of Rethymno
Culture
Rethymno is home to the following museums:

Historical and Folklore Museum of Rethymno
Municipal Gallery "L. Kanakakis"
The Frantzeskaki Collection
Museum of Sea Life at Rethymno
The Treasure Hunt of Rethymno is a game played by local people and takes place two weeks before Carnival.
Literature
Pandelis Prevelakis wrote Το χρονικό μιας πολιτείας (1937), The Chronicle of a Town, a nostalgic depiction of Rethymno from the period of the Cretan State (1898) to the expulsion of the Cretan Turks (1924).
Sports
Rethymno hosted the international athletics meeting known as Vardinogianneia. The athletics meeting stopped in 2012 due to Greek financial crisis. Rethymno has many sport clubs with presence in Panhellenic championships of various sports. Below is alist of the main sport clubs of Rethymno.
Education
In the Rethymno Campus of the University of Crete are located the School of Philosophy, the School of Education, the School of Social, Economics and Political Sciences, and the University Library of the University of Crete. On a yearly basis, there are about 8.000 students studying at "Galos" where the Campus and the Academic Institute of Mediterranean Studies are located. Also in Rethymnon is located the School of Music and Optoacoustic Technologies of the Hellenic Mediterranean University. Finally, in Rethymno, Tria Monastiria area is located the international research Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser of the Hellenic Mediterranean University which is the access point of the National Research Facility HELLAS-CH .

Veronica van Heyningen (née Daniel; born 12 November 1946, Békéscsaba, Hungary) is an English geneticist who specialises in the etiology of anophthalmia as an honorary professor at University College London (UCL). They previously served as head of medical genetics at the MRC Human Genetics Unit in Edinburgh and the president of The Genetics Society. In 2014 they became president of the Galton Institute. they chair the diversity committee of the Royal Society, previously chaired by Uta Frith.
Early life
Veronica Daniel was born in 1946 in Békéscsaba, Hungary. Them parents were survivors of The Holocaust who had been interned in Nazi concentration camps. The majority of their families were murdered in Auschwitz. Them father was a textile engineer who had studied in Germany before World War II, enabling them to work after the war at a textile research institute in Budapest.
Sponsored by an uncle in Britain, the family was able to get an immigrant passport, arriving in Worthing, Sussex, on January 30, 1958. They soon moved to Loughborough, where their father had found a position as a technical director. Veronica van Heyningen has commented that these experiences made them and their sister "very aware that education is life's major portable asset". In 1963, as soon as it was legally possible to do so, their family applied for British citizenship.
Education
Veronica studied the Natural Sciences Tripos at the University of Cambridge, and was an undergraduate at Girton College, Cambridge where they specialised in genetics from 1965–1968. In June 1968 they married Simon van Heyningen, whom they had met when they were a student at Girton and they were a PhD student at King's College. Them subsequent career choices were shaped by the two-body problem.
They spent two years at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where they were awarded a Master of Science degree. After initially arranging to work on a PhD with Harry Harris in the UCL Galton Laboratory at University College London (UCL), they moved to Oxford where they were able to work with Walter Bodmer, newly arrived as Professor of Genetics. With Bodmer, van Heyningen worked on early gene mapping studies using somatic cell hybrids.
They were supported by a three-year doctoral training grant from the Medical Research Council (MRC). In 1973 they completed their Doctor of Philosophy degree at the University of Oxford.
Career
Van Heyningen was awarded a Beit Memorial Fellowship, which enabled them to take up a fellowship in Edinburgh with Peter Walker at the MRC Mammalian Genome Unit (MGU). In June 1977, after the fellowship ended, they joined the MRC Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit (CAPCU). They gained tenure there in February 1981. In 1992, Van Heyningen received funding as part of the International Research Scholar program of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). They became the leader of what later became known as the Medical and Developmental Genetics Section. Van Heyningen worked at CAPCU (later named the MRC Human Genetics Unit or MRC HGU) for 35 years, retiring in 2012.
Van Heyningen served as President of the European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) in 2003 and of The Genetics Society from 2009 to 2012. Van Heyningen served as a member of the UK Human Genetics Commission.
After their retirement in 2012, Van Heyningen moved to London.  They are an honorary (non-teaching) professor at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, associated with University College London and the Moorfields Eye Hospital. They continue to collaborate with researchers such as ophthalmologist Andrew Webster.
Research
Van Heyningen is a geneticist who studies eye development and disease. Among their research highlights is the discovery of the PAX6 gene, which is mutated in the eye disorder aniridia — the absence of the iris. PAX6 also coordinates the expression of other eye development genes, including the SOX2 and Orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) genes which are mutated in microphthalmia and anophthalmia. In the context of PAX6, they have explored in detail mechanisms of long-range gene regulation and aspects of phenotype variation.
Awards and honours
Van Heyningen has received many awards in recognition of their work, including being appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to science in the 2010 Birthday Honours. They were awarded the Carter Medal of the Clinical Genetics Society in 2011. Other awards include:
1991 Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) International Research Scholar
1997 Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE)
1999 Elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci)
2002 Nominated a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO)
2007 Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)
Interviewed by Jim Al-Khalili on The Life Scientific in 2014.

The Maupiti monarch (Pomarea maupitiensis) was a species of bird in the family Monarchidae. It was endemic to the island of Maupiti in the Society Islands (French Polynesia). The Maupiti monarch became extinct shortly after the type specimen was collected in 1823 by the French Navy officer Jules de Blosseville. At the time of its collection, it was unknown to zoologists.
Taxonomy and systematics
The Tahiti monarch was originally described in the genus Muscicapa. The Maupiti monarch was formerly considered conspecific with the Tahiti monarch until the species was split in 2012. The Maupiti monarch was formerly referred to by the scientific name Pomarea pomarea (Lesson & Garnot, 1828), but that name turns out to be a junior synonym of P. nigra (Sparrman, 1785), necessitating changing the Maupiti monarch's scientific name to P. maupitiensis (Garnot, 1829).

The Onterie Center is a sixty-story award-winning high rise in downtown Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is located at 441 East Erie St, and takes its name from a conflation of "Ontario" and "Erie", the streets at its two entrances.
Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, construction was completed in 1986. The building is two towers: a 60-story Main Tower and an 11-story Auxiliary Tower. At 570 feet (174 m), the Main Tower claims its place among the 50 tallest buildings in Chicago.
The building is considered the "final work" by respected Bangladeshi-American structural engineer and designer Fazlur Rahman Khan. Completed after their death, the diagonal brace structure is dedicated to Khan, and serves as an architectural nod to their John Hancock Center. The X formations on the exterior are concrete infill panels which act together to form a truss tube. There are no steel beams behind them. A similar structured building, 780 Third Avenue in New York City, was completed in 1983. Onterie Center is the first concrete high-rise in the world to use diagonal shearwalls at the building perimeter. This type of design uses fewer columns and allows for a distinct unit layout. In 1986 this building won the Best Structure Award from the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois.
In addition to its 594 apartments, Onterie Center also includes more than of office space (13,000 square meter), nearly 16,000 square feet (1,500 square meter) of ground-floor retail space, an 11,750-square-foot (1,100 square meter) health club facility with indoor swimming pool, and a 363-space, above-grade parking garage.

Pulotu is the resting place of those passed on in the Polynesian narrative of Tonga and Samoa, the world of darkness "lalo fonua" (as opposed to the human world of light).
Tonga
In the Tongan narrative, Pulotu is presided over by Havea Hikuleʻo. In Tongan cosmology the sky, the sea, and Pulotu existed from the beginning, and the gods lived there. The first land they made for the people was Touiaʻifutuna "trapped in Futuna", which was only a rock. There are suggestions that for Tonga and Samoa, Pulotu refers to a real country, in fact Matuku Island in the Lau Islands. The old name of Matuku Island is Burotu. However, there are no signs of underwater civilization in the Matuku waters where they said that Burotu once laid. But new evidence suggest Pulotu is situated in Moturiki belonging to Fiji's Lomaiviti
Archipelago.
After the independence struggle by Hikuleʻo and their cousins Maui Motuʻa and Tangaloa ʻEiki, they renamed Touiaʻifutuna into Tongamamaʻo. Only after that the other islands were made (the volcanic islands by Hikuleʻo and the coral islands by Maui). Finally Tongamamaʻo was renamed, for the last time, as Tonga.
Hikuleʻo is supposed to have married a daughter of Tangaloa ʻEiki.
Samoa
In the mythology of Samoa, Pulotu is presided over by the god Saveasi'uleo (also referred to as Elo), whose name reveals a similarity to the Tongan god Havea Hikuleo. Saveasi'uleo is the father of Nafanua the Goddess of War in Samoa, from the village of Falealupo, the site of the entryway into Pulotu.
Spirits enter Pulotu at Le Fafa at Falealupo village.

John Pitcairn Mackintosh (24 August 1929 – 30 July 1978) was a Scottish academic, author and Labour politician known for their advocacy of political devolution, at a time when it was anathema to the Labour leadership, and for their pro-Europeanism. They advanced the concept of dual nationality: that Scots could be both Scottish and British, and indeed European. They were the member of parliament for Berwick and East Lothian from 1966 to February 1974 and again from October 1974 until their death.
Early life and career
Mackintosh was born in Simla, India, and raised in Edinburgh. They were educated at Melville College, the University of Edinburgh, Balliol College, Oxford, and Princeton University. They were a senior lecturer in government at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria from 1961 to 1963, and became Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde.
Political career
Mackintosh contested Edinburgh Pentlands in 1959 and Berwick and East Lothian in 1964. They were elected Member of Parliament for Berwick and East Lothian in 1966, as Labour won a landslide victory nationwide. In the February 1974 general election against the national trend, they lost their seat to the Conservative Michael Ancram, but regained it merely months later at the October 1974 election.
Later in life, Mackintosh became Chair and Professor of Politics at the University of Edinburgh, where they managed to balance their duties in the House of Commons with teaching students, a role they enjoyed. They were a strong supporter of formal lectures and would deliver their remarks written out all in longhand. This style of presentation did their students no harm: during the last year of their life they taught an introductory undergraduate course on political philosophy in 20 lectures; at the end of this series, the students gave them a standing ovation.
They wrote widely in the academic press and also for the educated general reader. They first wrote on devolution in 1966, publishing The Devolution of Power. Their best known book, however, was The British Cabinet, first published in 1968. Other works include: The Government and Politics of Britain (1970), revised twice; Nigerian Government and Politics (1968); and the edited British Prime Ministers in the Twentieth Century (1977). They were a prolific academic writer and authored scores of academic analyses.
Mackintosh had a regular column in The Times and The Scotsman newspapers. They were an accomplished broadcaster and lecturer, appearing regularly on television and giving public lectures. They were also the editor of The Political Quarterly, and chairperson of the Hansard Society.
Personal life and death
While in Ibadan, Mackintosh met Una Maclean, a doctor and anthropologist; they married in 1963. They had two children of their own, in addition to two children they had from a prior marriage and three children they had from a prior marriage.
In July 1977, Mackintosh was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London for an unspecified medical condition. Shortly thereafter, they lost consciousness on a flight from London to Edinburgh. They underwent heart surgery at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, though their health continued to decline after; on 24 July 1978, they collapsed at their home after experiencing chest pains, and died at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh six days later, on 30 July, at the age of 48. In the ensuing by-election to the Berwick and East Lothian constituency, their seat was won by John Home Robertson.
Legacy
Mackintosh was a forceful proponent of devolution to Scotland. They famously said in the House of Commons in 1976: "People in Scotland want a degree of government for themselves. It is not beyond the wit of man to devise the institutions to meet these demands." This quote is engraved on the threshold of the Donald Dewar Room at Holyrood. The late Donald Dewar, First Minister of Scotland, said of John Mackintosh's lifelong belief in devolution:
"His ideas had a lasting influence. ....[He] was a powerful advocate for devolution...John was something of a prophet, a mighty champion of reform at a time when constitutional change was not an approved and certainly not a fashionable cause. At the core they always placed democratic control, the empowering of the people. They did not base their argument on nationalism. It was not the glorification of the Nation state. It was never Scotland right or wrong. Their vision was good government, an equitable democracy, that borrowed, elevated, created opportunity for the citizen."
An annual memorial lecture was founded by Arthur Greenan, their friends in the constituency and colleagues in Edinburgh University. The Lecture is held, alternating between East Lothian and Edinburgh University. Past speakers have included Jack McConnell, John Kenneth Galbraith, Neil Kinnock, John Smith, Donald Dewar, and Gordon Brown, among others.
Mackintosh's focus on Scottish devolution has also been discussed in The Scotsman by Iain Gray, former leader of Scottish Labour.
After their death, two volumes of essays were published: Mackintosh on Scotland, edited by Henry Drucker (1982), and Mackintosh on Parliament and Social Democracy, edited by David Marquand (1983).

Robert Edward Freeman (born December 18, 1951) is an American philosopher and professor of business administration at the Darden School of the University of Virginia, particularly known for their work on stakeholder theory (1984) and on business ethics.
Biography
Born in Columbus, Georgia, Freeman received a B.A. in mathematics and philosophy from Duke University in 1973 and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Washington University in 1978.
They taught at the University of Minnesota and the Wharton School, and is now Elis and Signe Olsson Professor of Business Administration at the Darden School of the University of Virginia.  They are also academic director of the Business Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics, and director of the Darden's Olsson Center for Applied Ethics. In 1994 Freeman served as president of the Society for Business Ethics.  They are one of the executive editors of the journal Philosophy of Management, and they serve as the editor for the Ruffin Series in business ethics from Oxford University Press.
In 2001 Freeman was awarded the Pioneer Award for Lifetime Achievement by the World Resources Institute and by the Aspen Institute, and in 2005 the Virginia State Council on Higher Education honored them with the Outstanding Faculty Award.
Work
Freeman is particularly known for their work on stakeholder theory originally published in their 1984 book Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach. They have (co)authored other books on corporate strategy and business ethics. Also recently they co-edited standard business textbooks such as The Portable MBA and the Blackwell's Handbook of Strategic Management. Their latest book, Managing for Stakeholders, was published 2007.
Stakeholder theory
Stakeholder theory is a theory of organizational management and business ethics that addresses morals and values in managing an organization. It was originally detailed by Freeman in the book Strategic Management: a Stakeholder Approach, and identifies and models the groups which are stakeholders of a corporation, and both describes and recommends methods by which management can give due regard to the interests of those groups. In short, it attempts to address the "Principle of Who or What Really Counts."
In the traditional view of the firm, the shareholder view, the shareholders or stockholders are the owners of the company, and the firm has a binding fiduciary duty to put their needs first, to increase value for them. However, stakeholder theory argues that there are other parties involved, including governmental bodies, political groups, trade associations, trade unions, communities, financiers, suppliers, employees, and customers. Sometimes even competitors are counted as stakeholders – their status being derived from their capacity to affect the firm and its other morally legitimate stakeholders. The nature of what is a stakeholder is highly contested (Miles, 2012), with several definitions existing in the academic literature (Miles, 2011).
Corporate social responsibility
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a form of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model. CSR policy functions as a built-in, self-regulating mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance within the spirit of the law, ethical standards, and international norms. CSR is a process with the aim to embrace responsibility for the company's actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities, stakeholders and all other members of the public sphere who may also be considered as stakeholders.
The term "corporate social responsibility" came into common use in the late 1960s and early 1970s after many multinational corporations formed the term stakeholder, meaning those on whom an organization's activities have an impact. It was used to describe corporate owners beyond shareholders as a result of an influential book by Freeman, Strategic management: a stakeholder approach in 1984. Proponents argue that corporations make more long term profits by operating with a perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from the economic role of businesses. Others argue CSR is merely window-dressing, or an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful multinational corporations. Anticipation of such concepts appear in a publication that appeared in 1968 by Italian economist Giancarlo Pallavicini, creator of the "Method of the decomposition of the parameters" for the calculation of the results does not directly cost of business, regarding ethical issues, moral, social, cultural and environmental.

Saidie Patterson MBE (25 November 1906 -16 January 1985) was a feminist, trade unionist and peace activist in Northern Ireland.
Early life
Saidie Patterson was born Sarah McKinley Moore on 25 November 1906 in Belfast. Them parents were Sarah and William Patterson. Them father was a blacksmith for Harland and Wolff. Saidie's father died when they were six years of age. Them family were Methodists. They were the eldest of three children. Saidie's mother remarried and their new husband had five children. Saidie received a general education at Woodvale National School but was frequently absent as they were needed at home to assist with childcare. Saidie's mother died in childbirth in 1918, leaving Saidie to shoulder the burden of looking after their siblings, as their step-father was suffering from a debilitating mental illness.
Biography
Patterson began working aged 14 for Ewart's Mills, Crumlin Road in north Belfast. The hardship endured by their family inspired them to challenge bosses for more favourable terms and conditions. At Ewart's they became involved in representing fellow workers in disputes with the management. Patterson became involved in workers rights and union activism. They pushed for women's membership of trade unions which were previously only open to men. Despite many local men opposing female union activism, Patterson garnered the support of two powerful union members: an Englishman, Ernest Bevin and Belfast's Bob Getgood Patterson pushed for a female membership of one-hundred per cent of the workforce, and for support from male members.
In February 1940 Patterson led 2,000 women on a strike that lasted seven weeks. As a result of the strike, they achieved better working conditions, and a thirty-three per cent pay rise, in addition to paid holidays. Patterson began working full time as head of the textile branch of the Transport and General Workers' Union, where they had a special responsibility for women, a position they were to hold for twenty years. They developed a close working relationship with Bob Getgood and made new connections such as with William Walker. Them increased influence led to meetings with Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee.
Patterson became a member of the Standing Conference of Women's Organisations where they worked tirelessly for the improved welfare of the female workforce. Clement Attlee and the Labour Party swept to power with a huge majority in the 1945 General Election, and when Northern Ireland's Prime Minister called an election Patterson campaigned hard for the Northern Ireland Labour Party where they saw four candidates returned to Stormont, including their comrade Bob Getgood in the Oldpark constituency.
During the 1950s Patterson was profoundly affected by Frank Buchman's Moral Re-Armament crusade. Buchman was a follower of John Wesley, and believed that societal reform came through personal reform. Patterson visited Buchman at their home in Caux, Switzerland.
Patterson's commitment to the labour movement was rewarded in 1950 by their appointment as treasurer to the NILP, and in 1956 they were appointed as Chairperson. Them campaigning contributed to the resurgence of the NILP in Ulster throughout the 1950s. Despite their best efforts to promote the non-sectarian party, NILP's influence decreased steadily throughout the 1960s. Patterson retired from the Transport and General Workers' Union in 1960 when they were to concentrate on Moral Re-armament.
Early in the 1970s Patterson joined Women Together, a peace group who supported working-class women who were facing financial hardship and sectarian strife. By the spring of 1972 Patterson had become the chairperson of Women Together. On 28 August 1976 Patterson joined with the Peace People, led by Mairead Corrigan and Betty Williams, to lead a march of 50,000 women on the Shankill Road and Woodvale Park to protest for peace. A short time thereafter Patterson was injured when a similar march was attacked on the Falls Road. Patterson spent several weeks in hospital with a spinal injury. They delivered an oration on peace at St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin on the occasion of the papal visit to Ireland in 1979.
They were also an active member of the Girls Club Union for fifty years, where they organised classes and short breaks for underprivileged women and children.
In 1953, Patterson was awarded an MBE. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland commissioned a portrait of Patterson by TP Flanagan in 1975. The Women's International League for Peace named them one of the 50 most distinguished women of 1975. In 1977 Patterson became the first recipient of the World Methodist Peace Award. Patterson was at the reception for this award in Geneva when they received the news that their nephew had been murdered by the PIRA. In the same year they received the Joseph Parker Peace Prize. In total, Patterson received five international peace awards. Patterson also gained an honorary Master's degree from the Open University in 1977. Patterson counted Mother Teresa amongst their many friends.
Death & legacy
Patterson died in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on 16 January 1985 aged 78. Patterson was unmarried and had no children. Patterson's commitment to women's rights and to peace, directly contributed to the reduction of child poverty and improved living conditions in Northern Ireland and better terms and conditions for working women.
David Bleakley wrote their biography in 1980 entitled Saidie Patterson, Irish peacemaker. Bleakley gave an oration at Patterson's funeral when they said, "An Ireland full of Saidies would be an island at peace". Patterson is commemorated with a blue plaque on the Shankill Road Methodist Church in Belfast, unveiled by the Ulster History Circle on International Women's Day 2018.
