As a result of this incident, Uber has stopped all self-driving vehicle tests in San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Toronto and the greater Phoenix area. "Our hearts go out to the victim's family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident," said Uber in a statement. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi echoed the sentiment on Twitter, saying that the authorities were trying to figure out what happened.
Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona. We're thinking of the victim's family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened. https://t.co/cwTCVJjEuz — dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) March 19, 2018
The trend towards self-driving cars seems inescapable. While most states still require a human driver behind the wheel, not all do. Arizona, for example, allows truly driverless cars. California has also agreed to let companies test self-driving vehicles without anyone behind the wheel starting in April.
This incident is likely to increase public scrutiny over self-driving cars. A recent survey by the American Automobile Association (AAA) shows that 63 percent of Americans are afraid of getting in them (a drop from last year's 78 percent), while only 13 percent said they would feel safer when sharing the road with autonomous vehicles.
Yet, it's far too early to say that self-driving cars are inherently more dangerous than cars with human drivers. In 2016, there were a total of 193 pedestrian fatalities in the state of Arizona, and of that, 135 took place in Maricopa County, which is home to both Tempe and Phoenix. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, there were a total of 5,987 pedestrian fatalities in 2016 nationwide. And yes, all of those involved vehicles with human drivers.
"On average there's a fatality about once every 100 million miles in the US, so while this incident is not statistically determinative, it is uncomfortably soon in the history of automated driving," said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina, told Engadget. In short, the number of self-driving cars on the road is relatively small, making it harder to determine how dangerous they are in comparison.
"This would have happened sooner or later," Edmond Awad, a post-doctoral associate at MIT Media Lab told Engadget. "It could certainly deter customers, and it could provoke politicians to enact restrictions. And it could slow down the process of self-driving car research."
Where the problem lies, Awad says, is that there seems to be a general misconception that self-driving cars can't make mistakes. "What should be done first of all, is for manufacturers to communicate that their cars are not perfect. They're being perfected. If everyone keeps saying they'll never make a mistake, they're going to lose the public's trust."
This isn't the first time an accident involving a self-driving car has occurred though. In 2016, a Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer, killing its driver -- even though it was in autopilot mode. The driver apparently ignored safety warnings and it seems that the car misidentified the truck. In the end, the fault lied with the truck driver, who was charged with a right-of-way traffic violation.
This recent incident adds new fuel to the ongoing concern over the so-called "Trolley dilemma:" Would a self-driving car have the ethics necessary to make a decision between two potentially fatal outcomes? Germany recently adopted a set of guidelines for self-driving cars that would compel manufacturers to design vehicles so that they would hit the person they would "hurt less."
Two years ago, Awad created the Moral Machine, a website that generates random moral dilemmas to ask the user what a self-driving car should do in two possible outcomes, both resulting in death.
While Awad wouldn't reveal the details of his findings just yet, he did say that answers from Eastern countries differ wildly from those from Western countries, suggesting that car manufacturers might want to consider cultural differences when implementing these guidelines.
Recently, Awad and his MIT colleagues ran another study around semi-autonomous vehicles, asking participants who was to blame in two different scenarios: one where the car was on autopilot and the human could override it, or where the human was driving and the car could override where necessary. Would people blame the human behind the wheel, or the manufacturer of the car? And in Awad's research results, most people blamed the human behind the wheel.
In the end, what's really important is that we know what exactly happened in the Uber accident. "We have no understanding of how this car is acting," said Awad. "An explanation would be very important. Was it a problem with the car itself? Was it something not part of the car, that's beyond the machine's capability? We need to help people understand what happened."
Smith echoed the sentiment, stating that Uber needs to completely transparent here. "This incident will test whether Uber has become a trustworthy company," he said. "They need to be scrupulously honest, and welcome outside supervision of this investigation immediately. They shouldn't touch their systems without credible observers."
The bigger question for autonomous cars and the safety of pedestrians in the future will largely depend on how the government responds. We already know that revised federal guidelines are coming this summer, but this recent tragedy could require a more immediate response. We reached out to both the NTSB and Azdot (the body that oversees self-driving cars in Arizona) about this, but have yet to hear back at this time.
For now, we're still not clear on what the actual cause of the accident was. "At this time we don't know enough about the incident to identify what part of the self-driving technology failed but quite likely the pedestrian was in a very unexpected location and the sensor technology did not adapt the model of its environment quickly enough," Bart Selman, a computer science professor at Cornell University, said in a statement to press.
"In fact, self-driving technology cannot completely eliminate all accidents and the goal remains to show that the technology will greatly reduce the overall number of driving fatalities," he added. "I firmly believe that this goal remains achievable in part because the automatic sensing system of the car can track many more events more accurately and reliable than a human driver. Still, an accident like this calls for a re-evaluation of how to introduce and further develop the self-driving technology so that people will come to recognize and accept it as feasible and very safe."
Yet, regardless of statistics, this accident will certainly harm the faith in self-driving cars in the immediate aftermath. And no amount of legislative change will help the family of the person who died. "We should be concerned about automated driving," said Smith. "But we should be terrified about conventional driving."
These pedal-assist bikes aren't new in San Francisco. Uber-owned Jump has been kicking around for a while. Unlike Jump bikes, however, Ford's electric GoBikes have removable batteries, so Motivate can swap them in and out on the streets, rather than taking the bikes away for charging, depleting the stock available on the roads. Eventually, though, Motivate imagines bikes will charge via their docking stations.
There are currently 262 Ford GoBike stations across the San Francisco Bay Area, with some 2,600 bikes total. Come the end of the year Motivate envisions more than 540 stations with 7,000 bikes, which would make it the second-largest bike-sharing program in North America. If they roll out the electric bikes to New York's Citi Bikes initiative though -- which seems likely given the city's current focus on creating an e-bike framework -- it might not be too long before it takes the top spot.
A man from Wigan who died after becoming trapped underneath a bus outside Chester Zoo has been named locally as Wayne Lannon.
Police say they were called to the attraction just after 12.30pm today to reports that a man was wedged underneath a double-decker.
Wayne Lannon
A source said the man had been called to carry out repairs on the vehicle, which had taken a school group to the venue.
They said the jack gave way while he was examining it and he suffered crush injuries.
Paramedics attended the zoo's coach park but the man was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.
A Cheshire Police spokesman confirmed the man was 46 years old and from Wigan.
An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident is currently under way Cheshire Police spokesman
She said: “An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident is currently under way and the Health And Safety Executive has been informed.”
The emergency services erected a screen around the bus as a result of the incident. The man's next of kin have been informed.
Tonight, tributes were paid online to Mr Lannon, 46, from Beech Hill.
Ryan Liptrot wrote on Facebook: “Rest in Peace Wayne a status I never thought I would be writing, a great gent a guy that was class with everyone and it was a pleasure to call you my friend.”
Sharon Jones said: “RIP Wayne. You were one in a million and we will never forget you.”
The bus is understood to have been empty at the time.
The zoo's chief executive Mark Pilgrim spoke of his “real sadness” following the tragedy.
He said first aid teams and zoo staff helped the emergency services and he expressed his sympathies to the man's family.

PHOENIX (AP) - Arizona policymakers have yet to agree how to increase teacher pay or education funding ahead of a first-ever statewide walkout this week, prompting calls from Democrats and even one Republican to generate new tax revenue in the conservative state.
Republicans who control the state Legislature have yet to fully back Gov. Doug Ducey's plan for a 20 percent teacher raise, which would cost $650 million by 2020. Many have shared concerns about the rosy revenue projections Ducey is using to cover the increase.
Teachers have protested for weeks and took a vote on whether to launch the first statewide strike after Ducey unveiled his plan, saying they're concerned it doesn't increase funding for classrooms and students.
With Ducey and legislative leaders meeting behind closed doors to negotiate a deal, Republican state Rep. Noel Campbell offered a plan for a sales tax increase. He said the three-year boost of 1 percent would generate $1 billion annually.
Campbell said he's concerned the governor's proposal is too optimistic and believed the hike would bring in money to support all-day kindergarten, technical training and lower in-state tuition at public universities.
Most lawmakers agree higher pay and school funding is a good idea - the issue is how to fund them, he said. The governor and many Republicans have taken pledges against tax hikes.
"There's no way that we're going to get an income tax increase through this body, it's not gonna happen," he said. "You have to make a choice here. Do you want to have a perfect bill that doesn't pass or do you want to have a good bill that might have some chance?"
The relative novelty of a Republican calling for a sales tax increase contrasts with Democrats warning against any such hike. They raised concerns about rural towns that already have 10 percent sales tax rates.
"Another increase would unfairly put the burden on the poor and working class, who pay an inordinately larger share of their income on sales tax," Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs said.
Instead, Democrats called for funding from new revenue streams, such as taxing new products or reversing income tax cuts on wealthy residents.
New dollars are necessary to meet a key demand: $1 billion to return school funding to levels seen before the Great Recession, said Joe Thomas, president of the Arizona Educators Association, the largest teacher membership group.
Ducey spokesman Daniel Scarpinato said the governor's plan goes a long way toward addressing classroom funding concerns. It includes $371 million phased in over five years that districts can decide where to direct - that money could be used for support staff raises or other needs, Scarpinato said.
"The only way to get back to 2008 levels is to continue driving up the dollars we put into education," he said. "This is a big, sustained step toward the overall goal."
The political dealing comes as some of the state's largest school districts plan to close Thursday and Friday due to striking teachers, who are among the lowest-paid in the U.S.
Over a dozen of Colorado school districts, including the 10 largest, also will shut down both days because of teacher protests. The two states are part of a movement that started in West Virginia, where a strike garnered a raise, and spread to Oklahoma, Kentucky and beyond.
In the run-up to Arizona's statewide strike, parents and community members have been supportive, said Melissa Girmscheid, a science teacher at Centennial High School in suburban Phoenix.
They're giving gift cards for support staffers who may not be paid, and some teens are volunteering to watch teachers' children so they can go to a rally Thursday, she said.
"We've had a lot of parents who've stepped up to the plate," Girmscheid said.
Thomas, with the teachers association, said teachers were pushed to the drastic step.
"Every educator wishes this didn't have to happen," Thomas said. "But nothing has worked. Phone calls, emails, letters, many rallies, days at the Capitol where we go down and bring 100 people. Nothing has worked. We have been absolutely ignored, and they're not going to be able to ignore us Thursday."

Whether you are planning to stay in your home for several years, or if you are selling in the near future, it is important to spend your money on home improvement projects that will bring you the best return on your investment (ROI). That said, here are five home improvements projects to consider for this year:
Upgrade the Kitchen: One of the smartest rooms to invest in is your kitchen. While new appliances and updated cupboards and counter tops improve the value of your kitchen, do not forget about a smart, well-designed workspace. If you are renovating the kitchen, be sure to invest in a professional layout and efficient design. According to Realtor.com, a minor kitchen remodel averages over 80 percent on your ROI, and a major kitchen remodel averages over 65 percent.
Spruce Up the Bathrooms: Just a few improvements to a bathroom can go a long way. For example, install new fixtures, replace the mirror, and add a fresh coat of paint. Top off the new look with decorative plush towels and accessories.
Enhance Your Curb Appeal: There are several things you can do to enhance your curb appeal — add potted plants, put in a new walkway, paint and fix shutters, and repair cracks in the driveway. Additionally, replacing your front door with an updated, more attractive style is always a great idea. It can help with energy costs, and also keep your home more secure. Plus, front door replacements consistently have a high return on investment.
Consider hiring a professional if a task is out of your scope of expertise, especially for more complicated and dangerous projects. Recommended Stories For You
Replace Outdated Plumbing: Believe or not, an appraiser takes plumbing into consideration when assigning value to a home. So, if you have old, rusty iron pipes, you may want to consider updating the plumbing. Nowadays, re-piping is usually done with plastic tubing, which is extremely reliable and can be replaced more efficiently and easier than in years past.
Add More Attic Insulation: While it might not be the most glamorous project, adding fiberglass attic insulation actually pays for itself and delivers a small profit whenever you decide to sell. Often times, adding more insulation scores the highest return on investment of all home improvements.
Keep in mind that many home improvements fall under the "Do it Yourself" category, but some do not! So, consider hiring a professional if a task is out of your scope of expertise, especially for more complicated and dangerous projects.

Some restaurants hope to take advantage of ‘brunch bill'
MATT CHAPMAN
Staff Writer
The Lincolnton City Council and the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners have each adopted a “brunch bill” ordinance in the past two weeks to permit the sale of alcohol beginning at 10 a.m. on Sundays.
The city council voted 3-1 in favor of the change two weeks ago and the commissioners followed suit last week with a unanimous vote. Elected officials on both boards advocated for the ordinance as a way to spur economic activity, while for the most part dismissing the religious objections to the legislation.
“All I've heard since I ran for office is that we need some good restaurants and that we need to get these old buildings renovated,” Councilman Dr. Martin Eaddy said. “I don't see how we can say that we want to attract good restaurants and then vote anti-restaurant. I don't see how we can say that we want to be a destination community and then vote to make Lincolnton less attractive than other communities. I don't see how we can say that we're pro-business and then vote to deny the profit margin that might keep businesses open…I don't see this as a religious issue. I see this as an economic issue and possibly one of the most important votes we will make to bring Lincolnton forward over the next decade.”
Senate Bill 155, which was signed into law by Gov. Roy Cooper in June, applies not only to on-premises consumption at restaurants, but also the off-premises sale of alcohol by retail stores. Prior to its passage, the sale of alcohol in North Carolina was prohibited before noon on Sundays.
The “brunch bill” is expected to boost sales in the hospitality industry across the state for communities that opt-in to the new legislation. Country clubs, like the Verdict Ridge Golf and Country Club in Denver, are known for their Sunday brunch services, which will now include popular mixed drinks like mimosas and Bloody Marys.
“This has been presented as the bill to save the mimosa and that was the general concept,” Verdict Ridge general manager Scott Knox said. “I think it's something that's going to be good for the county when you see that other surrounding counties have already made the decision to pass the bill because they've determined that the positive outweighs the negative from a business standpoint. I think this says that Lincoln County is willing to do what it takes to promote businesses within the community and that keeps dollars in the county. It keeps people from leaving the county to dine somewhere else when they've got the opportunity right here at home and I think that's a smart decision on their part.”
The North Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association estimates that allowing alcohol sales on Sunday mornings will result in a $25,000 increase in sales revenue annually per operation. Chillfire Bar and Grill, a Denver steakhouse, is one of a handful of area restaurants with Sunday morning brunch hours already established that will likely see an increase in revenue due to the time change.
“I think most people have a misconception about what this legislation is actually going to allow our guests to do,” Chillfire general manager Thomas Jones said. “It's not like everybody is lining up at 10 a.m. to start drinking. What it is is basically that they're holding off until noon, and not that having alcohol is the most important thing to a morning brunch, but we have a lot of guests that want a mimosa or Bloody Mary just like any other person would any other day of the week. The amount of reservations we receive increases after noon and this bill will give us the opportunity to offer a full brunch menu throughout our service.”
While some restaurants will certainly adjust their hours to benefit from the new law, not all will do so. Court Street Grille in downtown Lincolnton is currently closed on Sundays and that's something that won't change despite the legislation, according to owner Osama Yousef. Yousef said he is of the opinion that Sundays should be spent with family and he keeps his restaurant closed to ensure a rest day for his staff.
The “brunch bill” ordinances adopted by the city and county in recent weeks were each effective immediately.
Despite its amiable spirit of inclusion, Agnès Varda's pop paean to sisterhood, “One Sings, the Other Doesn't,” proved divisive from the night it opened the 1977 New York Film Festival.
One feminist critic, Molly Haskell, wrote that, were she given to blurbs, she'd have called it “the film we have been waiting for!” Another, Amy Taubin, found the movie insufficiently radical. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby compared it to Soviet-style propaganda; The New Yorker's Pauline Kael imagined that the film could have been made by “a big American advertising agency.” Some critics thought “One Sings” paid too much attention to men. Others thought that the male characters were unfairly consigned to the periphery. Reviews complained about the songs or objected to the melodrama.
To her credit Ms. Varda, who described her work as a “feminist musical,” anticipated a few of these criticisms, telling a Times reporter that she had been attacked by French feminists for “being too nuanced, not anti-men enough.” But you can be the judge. “One Sings,” long without an American distributor and unavailable on disc, gets a one-week run in a new 2K digital restoration, starting June 1 at BAMcinématek. (It can also be streamed, unrestored, via Mubi.)
The movie's first scene has an extroverted teenager, Pauline (Valérie Mairesse), pondering a gallery wall covered with photographs of depressed-looking women, most of them nude, and then boldly interrogating the male photographer. Despite a tragedy that occurs soon after (or perhaps because of it), Ms. Varda's portrait of womanhood appears as a corrective to the glum gallery show. “One Sings” is so utopian that it might have taken its title from her earlier feature, “Le Bonheur” (“Happiness”).

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. envoy for Iraq is urging political leaders in this "crucial" post-election period to swiftly form an inclusive new government that works across sectarian and ethnic divides.
Jan Kubis told the Security Council on Wednesday that it's essentially the new government "works as one" to pursue political, economic and social reforms.
He urged Iraq's "political elites to draw the necessary conclusions" from this month's electoral turnout, the lowest since Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003. He cited "the need for improved representation, justice for all, democratic accountability, and good governance void of corruption, sectarian quota system, nepotism and patronage."
U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley also called this "a key moment in Iraqi history," saying the next government will make important decisions "that will set Iraq's course for decades to come."

A yellow warning of snow and ice has been issued for the North West of England for Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon, with Blackpool, the Fylde coast and the Preston area likely to be affected.
The Met Office includes those areas likely to experience the severe, wintery weather as Blackburn with Darwen, Blackpool, Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Halton, Lancashire, Merseyside and Warrington valid from 9pm on through to 3pm on Tuesday.
A man police identified as Minassian's father was in court. When asked if he had a statement to offer to the victims' families, he simply replied "I'm sorry."
Little is known about Minassian, but the Canadian Armed Forces said he served a brief stint as a recruit from late August to late October 2017.
A source with the military told The Canadian Press that Minassian did not receive any weapons training and was assessed as a below-average recruit. The source noted that there were no red flags to suggest something like the van incident Minassian is accused in was coming.
Toronto police homicide Det. Sgt. Graham Gibson offered few details about Minassian's activities before his alleged attack, but said the van involved was rented from just north of the city shortly before the incident.
Gibson also made note of a largely incoherent, widely circulated Facebook post on Minassian's account.
The post openly praises Elliot Rodger, a man who killed six people and then himself at the University of California in 2014. The post also references involuntary celibacy, colloquially referred to as "incel."
"The accused is alleged to have posted a cryptic message on Facebook minutes before he began driving the rented van," Gibson said at a news conference. "It's something that we'll take into account."
Ontario's Chief Coroner Dirk Huyer said investigators had yet to formally identify those killed, citing the complexity of the investigation and the size of the crime scene, which spans nearly a kilometre along one of Toronto's busiest streets.
"We're always balancing the need to know and the desire to know quickly to ensure that we have 100 per cent accuracy," he said. "That takes time and that time can be very frustrating."
But identities began to emerge from other quarters.
Tennis Canada said long-time volunteer Anne Marie D'Amico was among those killed. She worked at Invesco Canada, a U.S.-based investment firm with offices close to the crime scene.
D'Amico was a cheerful and familiar presence at the Rogers Cup tournament, where she started volunteering at age 12, said Gavin Ziv, Tennis Canada's vice-president of national events.
"She was a really friendly, warm person...always caring for other people ahead of herself," he said.
Seneca College said another one of the victims was a female student, but didn't offer further details.
A South Korean news agency said two unnamed Korean nationals were also among those killed. And Jordan's state-run Petra news agency said one of that country's citizens, Munair Najjar, who was in Toronto visiting relatives, also died in the attack.
Throughout the day, tributes poured in from politicians at home and farther afield.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who noted there's no evidence to suggest there was a "national security element" to the incident, called the attack "senseless" and "horrific."
"The entire community of Toronto has shown strength and determination in the face of this tragedy," Trudeau said. "All Canadians stand united with Toronto today."
Toronto Mayor John Tory said the city will recover.
"Toronto was a great city yesterday, it is a great city today and it will be a great city tomorrow," he said. "The people who call this city home are shaken right now but we are not broken and we will not be broken."
Tory said the city is establishing a fund the victims and their families. Dubbed #TorontoStrong, it builds upon a previous crowd-funding effort that had already raised nearly $100,000.
Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders said the force is continuing to investigate, adding hotlines have been established for collecting public tips and offering support to those who need it.
"Community safety is not just a matter of saving lives, it's a matter of well-being," he said. "I don't want people walking away thinking, 'I need help but I can't afford it,' or 'I need help but I wasn't part of this investigation.'"
For at least one of the mourners, the safety of the city he now calls home had not been compromised by Monday's events.
"This was a one-off situation," said Andrew, who calls the Yonge and Finch area home. "I wouldn't feel unsafe. This is Toronto, this is Canada. We love each other here."

VAUGHAN, Ont. — Swiss Chalet Rotisserie & Grill will accept voice orders through the Google Assistant App.
The restaurant chain owned by Cara Operations Ltd. says the voice order feature allows customers to place an order for pickup or delivery through the app.
Users need to open the app and say "Ok Google, order from Swiss Chalet," which will prompt them to select from menu options or reorder their last meal.
Swiss Chalet's announcement comes as the company has been making a concerted effort to integrate technology into its operations.
There was more to Peter's crise than his worry about Patsy or growing distaste for his surreptitious assignment. He was 25, almost 26. Impatiently, he reflected that his life didn't make sense to him, a feeling that had gnawed at him for a long while. What was he doing here? He began a second novel, called “Partisans.” The protagonist is a journalist working undercover in Paris on an investigative story about an elusive Communist. The journalist's name is Barney Sand — initials B.S. Listening to the sound of his own voice, Sand broods that it “belonged to a man in mirrors whose face seemed more foolish every day.” Waiting to undertake the next move in his mission, Sand thinks: “To wait, to wait, as it now seemed to him he had waited all his life: for graduation from school, for enlistment in the Army, for combat that never came, for the war to end, for college to end, for promotion in two jobs he did not want, for a love that did not exist — waiting for a raison d'être which never arrived because he could not recognize it.”
My grandparents were wealthy. Like the etiolated hero of “Partisans,” my uncle believed that his privileged background and private schooling had stunted his personal growth. To use today's psycho-parlance, Peter didn't like himself very much. Before he married and went off to Paris, he was often in one sort of trouble or another without really knowing why. He dodged a court-martial while in the Navy. He blew up his own engagement party — insulting Patsy's mother and making out with a bridesmaid. To paraphrase St. Augustine on his own bad-boy phase, Peter became to himself a place of unhappiness in which he could not bear to be, but he could not escape himself. Time and again he would bring himself to the lip of a crisis and, meaning to leap over, leap in.
But at this juncture he acted wisely. Quitting the C.I.A., Peter took his wife and newborn son, my cousin Lucas, back home. He settled in Sagaponack, on Long Island, still and always a footloose man but more focused. In midlife he produced two fine novels, “At Play in the Fields of the Lord” and “Far Tortuga,” and a glorious spate of nonfiction about the natural world. His best nonfiction works are “Under the Mountain Wall,” “The Tree Where Man Was Born” and especially “The Snow Leopard,” which appeared in 1978. Matthiessen is the only writer to win National Book Awards in both nonfiction, for “The Snow Leopard,” and fiction, for his 2008 novel, “Shadow Country.”

If he were alive, he might voice one regret about his sterling career. His time in Paris kept bobbing to the surface, both the good part about The Paris Review, as the magazine's stature among intellectuals increased, and the negative part about his role in the C.I.A. Well before the C.I.A. story became public, Peter had acknowledged the connection to Plimpton and Humes, and after the revelation he tried to placate other friends for having been less than candid. He protested that he was young and had no politics to speak of, other than a vague, Ivy League sense of patriotism. “People tend to forget,” he wrote in his memoir notes, “that 60 years ago, at the start of the Cold War, the C.I.A. had not yet earned the evil repute it has today, and I look back on my own brief participation with more chagrin than shame.” He also wrote, “I was no good at this low work and hated the deception that went with it, which I found nerve-racking and disagreeable and made worse by the fact that it all seemed petty and pointless as well as an idiotic waste of public money.”

Putting on a pained smile, Peter would observe that by introducing him to socialists the C.I.A. had educated him in the wrong direction. My uncle, don't forget, became a champion of left-wing causes. He wrote books in support of the farmworkers leader Cesar Chavez and the Native American activist Leonard Peltier, and he regularly chastised big corporations and the government for harming the environment. The occasionally shrill vein in his writing cost him both money and credibility.
Still, the links between Peter Matthiessen, The Paris Review and the C.I.A. have been catnip for magazine writers and more than one author. Most recently, “Finks: How the C.I.A. Tricked the World's Best Writers,” by Joel Whitney, held up Peter as a nefarious prototype. I skimmed the book on Amazon when it came out. It's a hash. Loyalty and literary scruple prohibited me from buying it.
I worry that as Peter's wonderful body of work fades from memory, younger readers might learn of him primarily through his Paris period, when he was reckless and secretive, before he discovered his true path. Will they pick up his books anyway? I imagine my uncle as I last saw him: in a sea-spattered shirt, eschewing the salon and the stirrings of social media, shaking his head in that pronounced way he had, the lion in his 80s and yet “I am still beset by ankle-biters.”
Peter concluded, Zen Buddhist that he was, with a sort of koan about his time in Paris: “Ever try to wipe wet rice off a wood table? More than a half century has passed and the table is still sticky.”
Cuba has opened its first wholesale market, lending a hand to some non-state businesses in an economy dominated by government-run enterprises.
State-run newspaper Granma said the market is part of an ongoing effort to "reorganize" commerce on the communist island. The market will sell beans, beer, sugar, cigars and other goods for 20 to 30 percent less than the products cost at state-owned retail stores throughout the country.
Since 2010, the government has authorized about 500,000 people to operate private businesses, and many of them have long sought access to a legal wholesale marketplace where they can pay below retail for the materials they use for their own products or resell to the public.
For most, their wait is not over. The government says the single market known as the Mercabal is only open to 35 worker-owned cooperatives in Havana, at least for now. Other officially licensed private workers might have access later.
The state-run economy accounts for 70 to 80 percent of the Cuban economy.
What we eat can influence more than our waistlines. It turns out, our diets also help determine what we smell like.
A recent study found that women preferred the body odor of men who ate a lot of fruits and vegetables. Whereas men who ate a lot of carbohydrates gave off a smell that was less appealing.
Skeptical? At first, I was, too. I thought this line of inquiry must have been dreamed up by the produce industry. (Makes a good marketing campaign, right?!)
But it's legit. "We've known for a while that odor is an important component of attractiveness, especially for women," says Ian Stephen of Macquarie University in Australia. He studies evolution, genetics and psychology and is an author of the study.
From an evolutionary perspective, scientists say our sweat can help signal our health status, and could possibly play a role in helping attract a mate.
So, how did scientists evaluate the link between diet and the attractiveness of body odor?
They began by recruiting a bunch of healthy, young men. They assessed the men's skin using an instrument called a spectrophotometer. When people eat a lot of colorful veggies, their skin takes on the hue of carotenoids, the plant pigments that are responsible for bright red, yellow and orange foods.
"The carotenoids get deposited in our skin," explains Stephen. The spectrophotometer "flashes a light onto your skin and measures the color reflected back," says Stephen. The results are "a good indicator of how much fruits and vegetables we're eating," he says.
Stephen and his colleagues also had the men in the study compete food frequency questionnaires, so they could determine the men's overall patterns of eating. Then, men were given clean T-shirts and asked to do some exercise.
Afterwards, women in the study were asked to sniff the sweat. (Note: The methodology was much more scientific and precise than my breezy explanation, but you get the picture!) "We asked the women to rate how much they liked it, how floral, how fruity," and a bunch of other descriptors, explains Stephen.
It's a small study, but the results were pretty consistent. "Women basically found that men who ate more vegetables smelled nicer," Stephen told us.
Men who ate a lot of meat did not produce a sweat that was any more — or less — attractive to women. But meat did tend to make men's odor more intense.
"This is not the first study to show that diet influences body odor," says George Preti, an adjunct professor in the dermatology department at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia.
A study published in 2006 found that women preferred the odor of men who ate a non-meat diet, "characterized by increased intakes of eggs, cheese, soy, fruit and vegetables."
But Preti points out that the relationship between diet and body odor is indirect.
Some people think if they eat a garlic or onion — or a piece of meat — they will smell like that food. "But that's not what happens," Preti says. Your breath might smell like the food you eat, but not your sweat.
Body odor is created when the bacteria on our skin metabolize the compounds that come out of our sweat glands.
"The sweat doesn't come out smelly," Preti explains, "It must be metabolized by the bacteria that live on the surface of the skin."
Now, of course, at a time when good hygiene and deodorant use are commonplace, is the smell of our sweat a big concern?
I put that question to the happy-hour crowd at a bar down the street from the NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C.
"I'm pretty OK with my smell," Stefan Ruffini told me. That evening he was ordering a burger on a bun and a side of fries, along with a beer. When I told him about the findings of the study, he laughed it off.
"I've got a girlfriend, so I don't worry about these things!"he said.
The study did not assess diet and odor attractiveness among same-sex couples.
"As a lesbian, I haven't smelled a man in several years," Stacy Carroll, who was also at happy hour, told me. "I eat a lot of produce, I have a girlfriend, so it's working out!"
Carroll says people who eat a lot of fruits and vegetables are more likely to be interested in their health --"feeling good, looking fit" — than their smell.
“Fast and Furious” is headed to the small screen, courtesy of Netflix.
The streaming service announced Monday it has handed a straight-to-series order to an animated show based on the popular franchise.
Here is the show's logline: Teenager Tony Toretto follows in the footsteps of his cousin Dom when he and his friends are recruited by a government agency to infiltrate an elite racing league serving as a front for a nefarious crime organization bent on world domination.
Tim Hedrick (DreamWorks Voltron Legendary Defender) and Bret Haaland (All Hail King Julien) will serve as executive producers and showrunners. The show is also executive produced by Vin Diesel, Neal Moritz and Chris Morgan who also serve as producers on the live-action franchise.
“We are thrilled to take our fantastic partnership with DreamWorks Animation to the next level with new opportunities from the vast library of Universal Pictures,” said Melissa Cobb, Vice President of Kids and Family. “The Fast & Furious franchise is a global phenomenon beloved by audiences of all ages, and we can't wait to get started on the new animated series that will capture the action, heart, humor and global appeal of the feature films.”
“We are excited to extend and expand our successful relationship with Netflix by not only delivering more high-quality DreamWorks programming, but connecting fans of Universal films with fascinating new stories,” said Margie Cohn, President of DreamWorks Animation Television. “Our new home at Universal marks an exciting new chapter for storytelling at our studio, and Fast & Furious is only the beginning.”

The rings have the red-garnet-coloured Toronto FC emblem in a black circle on the front, framed with the words MLS Cup on top and Champions below.
The player's name and number — complete with diamond — are on one side. The Philip F. Anschutz Trophy and team motto "All for One" adorns the other.
The team's 20-5-9 regular-season record and MLS record 69 points are inscribed on the inside of the ring. There are three stones stamped into the bottom of the ring to mark the three trophies won: the MLS Cup, Canadian Championship and Supporters' Shield.
Baron says it takes 10-12 weeks to make the rings. The process starts with a 3-D modelling program, which becomes a wax model that is cast.
The MLSE order called for 795 rings, with the exact bling varying over five different tiers.
"Every (MLSE) staff member is getting one," said Manning, who already has an MLS championship ring from 2009 with Real Salt Lake and a USL ring from 1999 with the Minnesota Thunder plus an NFC Conference champions ring in 2004 with the Philadelphia Eagles.
That includes the soccer team's "go-to babysitters" and BMO Field security.
"When we say all for one, it does mean everybody," said Manning
The staff rings are slated to be handed out Thursday.
The TFC boss declined to say how much the player rings cost.
"But I'll tell you that we as a company invested a lot of money not only for the players but our staff," he said.
Suffice to say you could probably buy a modest economy car with the cost of the deluxe players' ring.
The TFC players were quick to show off the new bling on social media. Striker Jozy Altidore posted a photo of himself wearing the massive rink on his little finger.
"I would pinky swear, but my pinky ring is too big," he wrote.
Italian forward Sebastian Giovinco posted a close-up of his ring-wearing hand with the caption "The Lord of the Ring."
"Got a Ring!!!" tweeted defender Chris Mavinga, with several shots of his new jewelry.
Baron Championship Rings is a family affair, founded some 30 years ago. Richard Baron started with a Toronto jewelry store that did class and other rings but the business expanded into championship rings about 10 years ago.
Baron and Jostens, based out of Minneapolis, are the big players in championship bling. Jostens did the rings for the Houston Astros, Seattle Sounders, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots and Chicago Cubs to celebrate their recent titles and have partnered with the reigning NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles.
By the Bling
A look at the Toronto FC player championship rings:
— Each one has an approximate 3.30 carat weight.
— The ring includes 132 round brilliant diamonds, 42 princess-cut black diamonds, 2 custom-made black onyx stones (for the T logo), and a red garnet stone (with Toronto encrusted in it).
— The ring is 10-karat white gold ring with a 14-karat yellow gold star at the top.
— All rings weighs about 80 to 85 grams (depending on finger size), measuring 30 by 34 millimetres.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany's biggest Islamic association says it won't take part in what is being billed as a Muslim "peace march" against terrorism over the weekend.
The Turkish-Islamic Union says the demonstration in Germany's western city of Cologne would send a wrong signal.
A group calling itself "Not With Us" says it expects several thousand people to come to the Saturday march.
The union said in a statement Wednesday that holding such a march suggests it's only up to Muslims to tackle international terrorism.
It also said Muslims observing the Ramadan-month fast couldn't be expected to march for hours in the summer sun with expected temperatures of 25 degrees Celsius (77 Fahrenheit).
The union instead plans on Friday to hold prayers for peace and against terrorism in mosques throughout Germany.

German airline Lufthansa says it's agreed to an arbitrator's proposal for a new wage agreement for its 5,400 pilots, signaling an end to a lengthy and bitter dispute.
The airline, Germany's largest, said Wednesday it agreed to a four-stage 8.7 percent total wage increase, and a one-off 30 million euro ($31.7 million) payment that would translate to some 5,000 to 6,000 euros per employee.
The new agreement will be in place until the end of 2019.
The Cockpit union had been staging strikes sporadically since April 2014, costing Lufthansa multiple millions, before the two sides agreed to arbitration on December.
Cockpit, which had no immediate comment, had sought raises of 3.66 percent a year going back 5? years.

Death tolls in Pak Sufi shrine attack rises to 22
Press Trust of India, Karachi, Oct 6 2017, 19:55 IST
A Pakistani soldier stands guard after a suicide attack at a shrine in Pakistan. Reuters file photo.
The death toll in the suicide attack at a prominent Shia shrine in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province has risen to 22, officials said today.
A suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest when he was stopped by a police officer guarding the Dargah Fatehpur, according to Deputy Commissioner Asadullah Kakar.
The attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, took place when there was a heavy rush of devotees who had gathered at the shrine in the village of Jhal Masgi, located about 400 km from Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province.
Devotees gather at the shrine of the revered Sufi saint every Thursday to participate in a sufi dance called 'dhamaal' and prayers.
At least 22 people, including three children, were killed and more than 30 others injured in the bombing, Geo TV quoted a senior police official as saying.
Officials said the death toll rose after an under- treatment victim succumbed to his injuries at the Chandka hospital in Larkana.
Investigations are under way and police have collected evidence from the site of the blast, the official said.
He said the bravery of police officials and security guards at the entrance of the shrine ensured that the suicide bomber could not harm the people who had amassed inside.
The Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility for the attack in a brief statement carried by its propaganda 'Amaq' news agency.
This was also the second attack on the Pir Rakhel Shah shrine since 2005. In March, 2005, at least 35 people were killed when a suicide bomber exploded himself at the shrine.
Balochistan Home Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti said the shrine was holding its annual Urs and hundreds of devotees from all over the country had come to pay their respects.
Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the attack and vowed that his government will act against militants with full might.
Yesterday's attack is the second major strike at a shrine in Balochistan where in November 2016, at least 52 people were killed and 102 injured in a blast at the shrine of Shah Norani in Khuzdar district.
Lake Lanier Crappie
by Dan Saknini
www.laniercrappieanglers.net
Water temperatures are in the low seventies, with high sixties early in the mornings farther north. Fishing conditions are good. The fish are pulling out to deeper docks with structure. Keep in mind that the lake level is about 6″ above full pool, so homeowners have moved docks in, and brush piles that are typically located inside the docks are now on the outside edges of the docks. It is an added bonus if you find a good sized brush pile outside the dock, especially if it is not in direct sunlight.
In this case, stay thirty to forty feet away from the dock and cast your jig to the other side of the brush. Jig it slowly over the brush toward the boat. You may want to experiment and let it fall a little into the brush. This time of the year, four pound high visibility line is very critical. One twenty fourth ounce soft body jigs and hair jigs are working well.
Also, the bigger fish are moving onto stand-alone brush piles in the backs of creeks. Those brush piles are in twenty to twenty-five feet of water, topping out at ten to fifteen feet below the surface. As always, the more brush piles you hit and the more docks you fish, the better your chances of boating more fish. If a spot isn't working, move on. Four to eight mid to large sized fish is about average per stop. So if your hits are yielding only smaller fish, move on to explore other docks or brush piles.
Stay safe on the water and wear your life jacket!
Lanier Stripers
by Capt Clay Cunningham
Finally, we are getting some nice weather after several months of cold and wind here on Lanier. The water temperature is in the low 70s and climbing each day. The water has been very clear on the south end and slightly stained on the north end.
Now that June is here, look for the stripers to progressively move deeper as the water temperature rises. At the beginning of the month, look for them to be 5 to 20 feet deep. You may still see some topwater action, so be sure to have a Sebile Magic Swimmer ready to cast. Day in and day out, it is hard to beat the Magic Swimmer. All the colors in the Magic Swimmer work. Early in the morning, the Magic Swimmer in white liner is hard to beat. A Storm Chug Bug in white or chrome and blue is also a good choice. Cast these lures on 10 or 12-pound Trilene Big Game on a spinning rod. A good setup is a 7′ medium action Fenwick spinning rod paired with a Penn Conflict 3000 spinning reel.
As the fish move deeper, look for the downline bite to take over. Spool up a Penn Squall Linecounter reel with 15-pound Trilene Big Game on a Shakespeare medium light action striper rod. Tie on a Capt. Mack 2 ounce swivel sinker, a four foot leader of 15-pound 100% Trilene Flourocarbon and a 1/0 Gamakatsu Octopus hook. Herring from the local tackle shops will be the key bait. Look for the stripers on your electronics before you drop baits. You can use traditional 2D sonar or down imaging to see these fish. Great electronics like the Humminbird units is a must. You can see your bait swim around the sinker.
Overall, June is usually a great month on Lanier for stripers. The spawn will be over and the striper's metabolism is wide open. See you on the water.
Lanier Stripers
by Steve Smith
With water temperatures beginning to heat up in May, the stripers have moved from the backs and mid-creeks to the mouths of creeks foraging for bait on main lake points and in pockets, all with access to deeper water via ledges or traditional drop offs. They are positioning themselves close to the deeper cooler waters for the traditional June bite.
June's techniques would be bringing out our deep-water arsenal which consists of downlines and power reeling Ben Parker spoons. Our bait of choice for downlining is various sizes of gizzard shad from dollar bill size to mongos. Be sure to drop the bait to just above where you are marking fish in the clearings between the trees lines. If you drop the bait over the trees, be prepared to act quickly as a hooked striper will head right for the trees and say goodbye to your catch. We are not ruling out blueback herring just yet, because in the cooler early mornings we can take advantage of pulling them higher up in the water column on weighted freelines 100 to 125 feet back between .5 to 1.0 mph. As the sun hits the water the stripers will head out to the deeper water.
While we mention bait a lot, we really need to mention bait care. The type and quantity of bait you want to use determines the type and size of your bait tank. Your bait tank should be either round or have round-corners, but should not be square, as you want to have the bait constantly moving in one direction. You can determine the size of the bait tank for blueback herring by using the ratio of two bluebacks per gallon of water, times the number of gallons you can have in your bait tank. A twenty-gallon tank could only hold 40 blueback herring.
Another point to mention about bait care is the mixing of the different baits. You should use a separate bait tank for gizzard shad because they put out a tremendous amount of ammonia which can hurt blueback herring by contaminating the bait water. And lastly, you should be using some form of aeration with blueback herring like oxygen at a 1/32 setting on your regulator. Keep the lid of the bait tank partially open to allow the CO2 gases emitted to escape so that the bait can take the oxygen more freely.
Tip of the month: You want lively bait, not bait that's alive. Consider changing your bait frequently, especially with blueback herring. When you bring your line in to check for bait, replace it. Go to my website at TeamLanier.com for more tips. 404-273-3481
Rejecting accusations he is a sexist, Phil Neville said Monday he has the character and status to be a role model after taking on the "ultimate job" as coach of England's women's national soccer team.
The decision to hire the former Manchester United defender brought scrutiny last week because of his lack of coaching experience and his Twitter postings six years ago that were deemed sexist and misogynistic.
"My character stands up to any accusation that has been leveled at me," Neville said after being presented in his new role. "I've lived my life right. I think I have a lot of respect within the game."
Questioned for the first time about the tweets, which he sent in 2011 and '12 when still a player at Everton, Neville said "they aren't right today and they weren't then."
In one of the Twitter posts from 2012, Neville said he thought women would be "busy preparing breakfast/getting kids ready/making beds" instead of watching cricket like men.
The previous year, he said women "always wanted equality until it comes to paying the bills," while another tweet read: "Relax, I'm back chilled- just battered the wife!!! Feel better now!"
Neville defended that tweet by saying he was referring to games of table tennis and basketball he had with his wife on holiday, but accepted he was "disappointed" that he used wording that related to domestic violence.
"That tweet wasn't sent out as a joke to domestic violence," Neville said.
The 41-year-old Neville has taken charge of the No. 3-ranked international team in the women's game, having only had brief spells as an assistant coach with the England under-21 men's team, Man United and Valencia since retiring as a player in 2013.
He believes that is enough.
"I've coached the best players in the men's game at the top level and I believe that the players I'll be coaching in the England women's team are top, top-class players at the elite level," Neville said. "For us to get from third to first in the world, I think they'll need a coach with that type of experience.
"I cannot be more qualified for this job ... The principles that I see in women's football and men's football are very similar. The gap is closing."
Neville said he isn't using the job as a "stepping stone" to other positions in the game.
"This, for me, is the ultimate job," Neville said. "It doesn't get any better than managing your country."

The director of the Secret Service is stepping down. Joseph Clancy informed his colleagues of his decision to retire, effective March 4, saying that "for personal reasons, it is time." Clancy, 61, says he wants to spend more time with his family.
Clancy was brought back to the Secret Service as director by former President Obama in 2014 after a string of security lapses and misconduct by agents and officers.
He had left the agency for a job in the private sector in 2011 after serving as the head of Obama's protective detail.
Obama asked Clancy to return to the Service as acting director after then-Director Julia Pierson was asked to resign. Clancy took over an agency in turmoil, with reports of carousing agents and security breaches, the most embarrassing when an Iraq War veteran scaled the White House fence and made it into the White House itself before being stopped.
In his letter to Secret Service staff, Clancy said he can assure them that "better days are ahead for this Agency with new leadership at the Director's position," and that he could not be "more impressed, more grateful and more proud of all of you."
The Secret Service has some 7,000 employees, and is charged with investigating counterfeiting as well as protecting the president, vice president, their families, former presidents and other dignitaries.
President Trump, who Clancy said has been "very supportive" of the agency, will be able to name a replacement.
Emergency crews responded to a house fire Friday morning in which one person was found badly injured in the backyard of the home.
It happened on Harry Drive near Wooddale Boulevard in Baton Rouge around 8:15 a.m.
The Baton Rouge Fire Department reported a man was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Firefighters say he climbed through a window to escape the flames. They added his injuries were so bad that he couldn't tell them what happened. The man received cuts from the glass in the window and suffered from smoke inhalation.
Firemen searched the home for other possible victims, but later reported the man found in the yard was the only person home at the time of the fire.
The cause of the fire is currently undetermined and is under investigation. The home received heavy fire and smoke damage.
The Baton Rouge Police Department and State Fire Marshal's Office are also on the scene.

(CBS Local) — Paleontologists say that “the Force” is strong with a newly discovered fossil in Idaho. The 245 million-year-old remnants of a prehistoric horseshoe crab have been named after the infamous Star Wars character, Darth Vader.
Researchers from New Mexico and Colorado named the four-inch-long fossil Vaderlimulus tricki after noting how much the crab looked like the helmet of the sci-fi villain.
“Vaderlimulus… has unusual body proportions that give it an odd appearance,” study author Allan Lerner of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science said in a press release.
The out-of-this-world fossil reportedly comes from the Mesozoic Era, when the landmass that's now present-day Idaho actually had a coastline. While many crab fossils discovered are much older than the Vaderlimulus — some at least 470 million-years-old — scientists believe this Vader-shaped creature belongs to the Austrolimulidae family of crab, which is now extinct.

The Star Wars-themed name isn't the first time scientists have reached into a galaxy far, far away for inspiration. Other creatures named for the movie's characters include the Trigonopterus chewbacca (a tiny weevil discovered in New Guinea) and the Tetramorium jedi (an ant that lives in the rainforest of Madagascar).

The United States military has dropped almost 50,000 bombs on Syria and Iraq over the last two years. Most of that has been against ISIS targets in the desert regions between the two countries, but some, including President Trump's airport bombings last week, were against the Assad regime itself.
There are also hundreds of American special forces in Syria supporting rebel groups against ISIS, assisting with airstrikes, taking out potential suicide car bombers, and even conducting their own combat raids. The same kind of forces are serving the same kind of functions against ISIS in Iraq as well, although we have almost ten times as many troops still there leftover from the now 14-year old Iraq War.
If what we're doing in Syria and Iraq is not a war, then nothing is. No, it's not a large-scale ground war, but as technology improves those become all but unnecessary and anachronistic anyway.
Yet some conservatives seek to distance our operations in Syria from the dreaded W word.
There's a fundamental misunderstanding they seem to have about the usefulness of a surgical strike, with warning beforehand, intended to damage infrastructure and equipment rather than take human lives. Those kinds of moves are intended to prevent war, not wage it.
I am reminded of the infamous Bush defense of the 2008 bank bailouts:
Lee, who used to write for this site as well and is a friend, argues that she is specifically referring to the recent airport strikes against the Assad regime as not being a war.
@authoridad you're wrong. If you read my piece you'll see I am specifically referring to the Syrian strike under this admin. @RedState — SarahLee (@sarailola) April 11, 2017
In a sense she's right. But in a more important sense, she's ignoring the forest for a single tree.
Yes, Trump's bombing of the Assad regime is a different type of thing from the tens of thousands of other bombings we've done in his country. Yes, it was ordered by a different president. But it's still part of the same war. We're just fighting on two sides of it now instead of mostly just one.
Yesterday, US-led coalition launched 20 strikes in Syria consisting of 28 engagements vs ISIS targets. Today US adds strikes on Assad regime — Tim Mak (@timkmak) April 7, 2017
President Trump has not declared war on Syria, and President Obama never declared war on ISIS, who Syria is also fighting. But make no mistake - we are at war in Syria and have been for several years. Just because we're not at war with Syria's government in an ongoing formal way, as we more closely are with ISIS, doesn't mean war isn't occurring. We must be honest about these facts if we are to debate the matter properly going forward.
Lincolnshire Police has warned convicted drink-drivers that they will be named and shamed ahead of a county-wide campaign over the festive period.
The force's ‘Think Don't Drink' campaign will start on Monday 18 December and run into the New Year and will see those convicted of the offence named by the county's officers.
The identities of people found to be driving under the influence of drugs will also be released.
The aim is to make people think twice before getting behind the wheel.
Inspector Ewan Gell from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: “Drink-driving is still a problem in Lincolnshire but we are very good at catching offenders. I sincerely hope we don't have to name a single person over these two weeks. Driving under the influence can be deadly, claims and ruins lives but is easily avoidable.
“Do not consume a drop if you are driving and be wary the morning after as you could still be over the limit. If we pull you over the consequences could be a losing your licence, a criminal record or even a prison sentence.”
Lincolnshire Police has made more than 1,000 arrests for drink-driving in the last year and more than 150 arrests for driving under the influence of drugs.
Over the same period 706 people were charged for drink-driving and 51 for drug-driving during.
A recent study by the Press Association found that the force charges more offenders than anywhere else in the UK.
John Siddle from the Lincolnshire Road Safety Partnership said: “Drink drivers cannot turn back the clock however, almost all those arrested wish they could.
“They stand to lose so much when they make that decision to get behind the wheel – their livelihood, life, other people's lives and possibly their liberty if they are sent to prison.
“The knock-on effects of that will be loss of job, possible loss of home (who pays the mortgage) car insurance increase, possibly a re-sit of the driving test. Despite this some people still choose to drink or drug drive, so I welcome Lincolnshire police's decision to name those charged with driving whilst impaired, through drink or drugs, which adds to the list of deterrents already in place.”
The police are asking concerned citizens to call 101 or 999 in an emergency if they suspect someone is about to drive under the influence.
CRANBERRY TOWNSHIP, Pa. (AP) — Sidney Crosby has faced the Washington Capitals three times in the playoffs. All three times the Pittsburgh captain has led his team to victory. And all three times the Penguins used the win as the springboard to a raucous mid-June parade with the Stanley Cup in tow.
Still, Crosby sounded like a cautious investor on Tuesday when asked if Pittsburgh has a mental advantage over rival Alexander Ovechkin and the Capitals heading into yet another postseason showdown in the Eastern Conference semifinals starting later this week.
Past performance, the two-time MVP stressed, does not guarantee future results.
"I think it depends on what you do in the series and how you play," Crosby said. "I don't think it plays a huge role. I guess to answer your question, no."
A mantra Crosby's teammates repeated over and over they prepared for yet another showdown in a rivalry that somehow manages to be both compelling and one-sided. Pittsburgh is 9-1 all-time in the postseason against Washington regardless of who is in the black-and-gold sweaters and who is in red, white and blue.
Not that Ovechkin is intimidated. The Capitals star said he "can't wait" to get another shot at the Penguins after spearheading Washington's first-round win over Columbus in six games. That's fine by Pittsburgh, which has played Lucy to Washington's Charlie Brown for more than a quarter century, dangling a potentially deep playoff run in front of the Capitals only to pull it back at the last minute.
The Penguins, however, remain wary. Just because they always beat Washington doesn't mean they're going to always beat Washington. The teams split their four meetings during the regular season, with the Capitals wrapping up their third straight Metropolitan Division title with a 3-1 win in Pittsburgh on April Fool's Day.
Of course, none of it matters once the puck drops in Game 1.
"It's a new year," Pittsburgh defenseman Kris Letang said. "The series is going to play out differently. The game is going to be won differently. You don't know how it is going to go. The only thing I know is it's a good rivalry, two really good teams, two teams that have a lot of punch offensively. It's going to be fun to be a part of."
Particularly for Letang. He missed all of Pittsburgh's run to a second straight Stanley Cup last spring while recovering from neck surgery, though he was able to make his way to the arena for Game 7 of the conference semifinals, when Marc-Andre Fleury stopped all 29 shots he faced and the Penguins escaped with a 2-0 victory to finish a series in which both teams scored 20 goals and won on opposing ice at least twice.
Though there are a handful of new faces on both sides, the principals remain the same. Ovechkin and Crosby. Evgeni Malkin and Nicklas Backstrom. Letang and Braden Holtby. Two weeks of taut, tense hockey in the offing.
"I think it's the same old dangerous team," Letang said. "Like, don't get me wrong, those series went the distance, they went to overtime. It was a tough matchup that could have gone either way. They cause the same problems to our team. They cause problems on the power play. They have a lot of skill. They make a lot of plays."
Yet the Penguins have always found a way to make at least one more, though they may be at less than 100 percent when things get going. Malkin and forward Carl Hagelin both missed practice on Tuesday. Malkin is dealing with a lower-body injury while Hagelin has an upper-body issue after colliding with Philadelphia's Claude Giroux in Pittsburgh's clinching victory over the Flyers in Game 6.
That could provide more playing time for players like Riley Sheahan — who filled in capably on the second line for Malkin in Game 6 — and rookie Zach Aston-Reese. The 23-year-old was in high school the first time Crosby and Ovechkin met in the playoffs in 2009 — when the Penguins blitzed the Capitals in Game 7 of the conference semifinals on their way to the Cup.
This time, Aston-Reese's view will be markedly different. He noticed an uptick in intensity from the regular season when the Penguins fended off the Flyers. Now, the dial goes up to 11 and stays there.
"I expect every game to be almost like a Game 7," Aston-Reese said.
That's because it almost always is.

A former Newtown resident who operated a law practice in Bridgeport pleaded guilty Wednesday, May 30, to stealing more than $1 million.
Thomas Murtha, 62, now of Birmingham, Mich., entered a guilty plea to one count of wire fraud at federal court in Hartford.
John H. Durham, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, said Murtha operated a law practice under the name Maher & Murtha LLC in Bridgeport. Beginning in approximately November 2011, Murtha stole at least $1.3 million from more than 20 individuals, including law clients, friends and family members. More than $516,000 of the stolen funds were for the benefit of an individual with mental health issues. As part of the scheme, Murtha submitted false or forged documents to victims, according to Durham. Murtha also incurred charges on credit cards in the names of others without their knowledge or permission.
The investigation revealed that Murtha used some of the stolen funds in connection with the purchase of a $725,000 house in Michigan.
In September 2016, Murtha resigned from the bar after three grievance complaints were filed against him. He was arrested on a federal criminal complaint on April 5, 2017, and a grand jury returned a multi-count indictment against him on Aug. 16, 2017.
Murtha is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Michael P. Shea on Sept. 11. He faces a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years.
Murtha has agreed to pay total restitution of at least $1,364,119.15, and to forfeit his interests in the house in Michigan and a 2.11-carat diamond engagement ring that the government has seized.
Murtha is free on a $10,000 bond pending sentencing.
This matter is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Greenwich Police Department, with the assistance of the Connecticut Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jennifer R. Laraia and David T. Huang.
MANILA — The camp of former Makati City Mayor Elenita Binay has opposed the appeal of state prosecutors on the Sandiganbayan Fifth Division's dismissal of the P21.7-million graft case against her.
In a 27-page opposition dated Dec. 28, Binay asked the anti-graft court to deny the Nov. 10 motion for reconsideration filed by the Ombudsman's Office of the Special Prosecutor for “utter lack of merit.”
She said the court's Oct. 28 decision to grant her demurrer to the evidence was, in effect, an acquittal that could not be reversed without putting her in double jeopardy. Her motion stated that the prosecutors' bid for the court to go over the evidence for a second time would violate her rights.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the same time, Binay asked the court to consider censuring the prosecution for “gross ignorance” of the law.
The court, in its Oct. 28 decision, said that prosecutors had failed to establish the supposed conspiracy to rig the bidding for the purchase of furniture for the city hall in favor of Asia Concept International, Inc.
Binay's motion argued that the case did not fall within the exception to the general rule on the finality of acquittals. The prosecution, it stated, did not allege that the court acted with grave abuse of discretion or that the decision was a void judgement.
“A review of alleged errors in judgment arising from misappreciation of facts and the evidence adduced cannot be made without trampling upon the right of the accused against double jeopardy which is firmly established in Philippine jurisdiction,” the pleading read.
Binay also slammed the appeal as an example of “prosecutorial misconduct” because it was “defective both in form and substance.”
She asked the court to “consider the applicability” of the Supreme Court's action in the 2001 case of Argel v. Pascua. In this case, the high court fined a Vigan City judge for recalling her earlier decision to acquit a murder defendant even as such rulings were supposed to be final.
“It is thus submitted that Argel, is authority for the proposition that a revision of acquittal, final upon promulgation, could be a ground for administrative liability,” Binay's motion read.
This case was one of the three graft cases won by Binay in connection with the alleged irregularities in the purchase of city hall furniture from 1999 to 2000.
Like the Fifth Division, the Second Division on Apr. 7, 2011 dismissed a P58.04-million graft case on demurrer. The Fourth Division, meanwhile, acquitted Binay on Nov. 17 this year after her P13.25-million graft case went through a full-blown trial.
One more related case is still pending with the Fifth Division, which handles the case covering a P72.06-million contract in 1999.
Binay also faces four graft and malversation cases pending before the Third Division over the purchase of P45-million worth of hospital beds and sterilizers for the city-run Ospital ng Makati in 2000 and 2001. SFM

MARION, N.C. (AP) - Mudslides triggered by the soggy remnants of Alberto forced evacuations below a dam early Wednesday and closed a highway in western North Carolina as the center of the storm lashed the nation's midsection hundreds of miles away.
About 2,000 people were evacuated for several hours after emergency managers said the Lake Tahoma dam was in danger of "imminent failure." Heavy rain triggered landslides at the dam and along Interstate 40, which was closed near Asheville.
Engineers inspected the dam further in daylight and McDowell County officials announced in a public alert just after 10 a.m. Wednesday the dam was safe and people could return to their homes.
The evacuation was ordered because engineers wanted to play it safe until they could do more inspections after sunrise, McDowell County Emergency Management deputy director Adrienne Jones told The Associated Press.
Several schools were closed in western North Carolina because of flooding.
The center of a depression that had been Alberto was about 400 miles (640 kilometers) west near Hopkinsville, Kentucky, where Sherry Key had a fitful night of sleep because of high winds and heavy rains.
"I have dogs and they're terribly afraid of storms, so they were on top me all night," said Key, an airport office manager.
Radar showed rain extended as far south as the Gulf Coast, where the storm came ashore at the Florida Panhandle on Monday, to the Great Lakes region.
Forecasters warned the leftovers of the Atlantic hurricane season's first named storm were still capable of causing treacherous flooding as heavy precipitation spreads deeper into the nation's midsection. Flash flood watches and warnings were in effect for parts of several states from Alabama through Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, the Carolinas and Virginia and West Virginia.
The weather service at the Greenville-Spartanburg airport in South Carolina said the rainfall of 1.76 inches (4.4 centimeters) on Tuesday broke a record dating to 1976.
In the mountains of western North Carolina, Jones said about 200 residents spent the night in three shelters, set up in Marion, Old Fort and Glenwood. She said five minor injuries have been reported during water rescues as creeks and streams overflowed their banks and rock slides closed roads.
The big, messy storm caused more than 25,000 power outages in Alabama, many of which were caused by trees rooted in soggy soil falling across utility lines.
"We've had a lot of rain, but we got lucky. It was a constant rain but not a heavy rain," said Regina Myers, emergency management director in Walker County northwest of Birmingham.
Alberto was more of a rainstorm than a wind threat, but the National Weather Service said at least one tornado had been confirmed.
The weather service said its meteorologists confirmed a weak tornado with maximum winds of 85 mph (147 kph) hit an area around Cameron, South Carolina, on Monday afternoon. No one was hurt.

HUDDERSFIELD, England — Huddersfield says head coach David Wagner has signed a contract extension to stay at the Premier League club for three more years.
Wagner, his assistant Christophe Buhler and first-team coach Andrew Hughes all signed new deals that will keep them at the club until 2021.
The trio all had 12 months left on their previous contracts, and Wagner had been linked with bigger clubs after an impressive debut season in the Premier League.
However, the German-American said "the decision to extend my stay at this club was not a difficult one."
The long Memorial Day weekend was a busy one for farmers finishing planting and for those desperately trying to catch up after being in the areas that have had too much rain.
While planting has been frantic, prices have been trading at the contract highs on all three major commodities.
Although some Midwestern farmers finished planting in the middle of May, many northeast Ohio farmers have struggled to get anything planted between rain drops. They watched the USDA Planting Progress reports with disbelief, as U.S. farmers have kept pace with history even if some locals have not.
We have seen it all — farmers who are done planting, those three-quarters done, but fighting to finish, and those who have consistently gotten the most rain and need more time. We saw sprinkles over the weekend, but no planting-ending rains.
Tuesday morning finds us with a lot of tired farmers, but with most finished or nearly so.
The Monday holiday has delayed USDA Planting Progress reports, but traders estimate that the corn was 90 to 95 percent planted by Sunday night.
While the planting has been going on, traders have put on a contra-seasonal rally in the markets. That is, prices have gone up even as planting statistics support the idea of another huge crop.
Corn futures
Fueled partly by dry weather in the second-crop corn in Brazil and hot weather in U.S. wheat country, December corn futures and July Chicago wheat futures have made new contract highs.
November soybeans are back to the high, just a quarter cent below the 10.60 high of April 2 on last Thursday.
The funds, the large speculators in the market, are now 200,000 contract long corn, according to the latest Commitment of Traders report. This comes as our crop is in the ground and experiencing perfect growing conditions with high temperatures and moist soil. The Brazilian crop is now seen to be under 80 mmt., a number that has been dropping for the last month.
The corn news has helped December corn futures to a 4.29 1/2 high on last Thursday, the 24th. We are currently trading 4.24 3/4. These are prices we did not expect to see, especially with the planting progress.
You may anticipate that the markets will now start to talk about another record corn production year. It remains to be seen if the foreign news will be enough to overcome that production fundamental.
Soybean markets
The Brazilians are also the focus of the soybean markets. Another trucker strike has continued through the weekend, stopping the flow of livestock products to market. The main issue was said to be the rising price of diesel fuel, but is now moving on to other things.
Meanwhile, the Commitment of Traders report shows the funds long almost 100,000 contracts of soybeans. This news has helped the November soybean contract back to the high. We saw 10.60 on the 2nd of April, 10.59 on April 10, and now 10.59 3/4 on Thursday, May 24. In between we saw a low of 10.02 just back on May 17.
Wheat
The hard wheat crop has been stressed by 100-degree temperatures over the Northern Plains, which has also been too dry. Temperatures are lower after the weekend, but the heat has pushed maturity of the wheat without helping it fill out.
Beneficial rains are expected in Kansas in the middle of this week, and that will help, even though they are close to harvest. The north is still dry, causing Minneapolis futures to be more than 80 cents premium to Kansas City futures.
The Kansas City hard red winter wheat is trading 20 cents and more over the Chicago soft red winter wheat that we grow.

As days get warmer and summer approaches, many natural events are inevitable. Birds nest, bullfrogs bellow, and bats patrol our backyards at night.
Another certainty is that insects become a dominant life form. Most are harmless, but a few can make life miserable.
Flies
Today, let's focus on flies. Flies are classified into the Order Diptera (from the Greek “di,” meaning two, and “ptera,” meaning wings). Virtually all flies have two functional wings.
According to Erica McAlister, author of the recent book, The Secret Life of Flies (2017, Firefly Books, $29.95), entomologists have named approximately 160,000 species of flies.
Some experts suggest there could be as many as 800,000 species. And McAlister should know; she is curator of Diptera at the Natural History Museum in London.
McAlister's love affair with flies began as a child. She would find dead animals in the garden and be intrigued, “by these wiggling, feeding machines” (that most of us would call maggots).
McAlister's affection for flies seems to color her view of all nature. She points out that mammals (5,400 species) and birds (10,000 species) get a disproportionate amount of scientific, financial, and popular attention simply because they are larger and more charismatic.
The world of flies is huge and most of us know little about it. For example, if I ask you to name five species of flies, I suspect most of you would be stuck after the ubiquitous “housefly.”
If you name dragonfly, damselfly or mayfly, you would strike out. All have four wings, so none is a true fly.
And yet, I'm sure many of you are on foul-mouthed speaking terms with a variety of dipterans.
Horse flies
On farms, horse flies are huge and equipped with razor sharp mouthparts. Though their favorite victims are farm animals, when they land on us, they slice and dice a patch of skin and sop up blood before we can even feel the bite's searing pain.
In the woods, smaller deer flies play a similar, equally painful role.
Black flies
In the north woods, black flies make up for what they lack in size with pure numbers.
Many years ago my wife and I drove more than 150 miles to camp in northern Michigan. Before we even pitched a tent, thousands, maybe tens of thousands of blood-sucking black flies descended upon us.
We jumped back in the van and drove immediately back home.
Mosquitoes
And then there are mosquitoes. Yes, mosquitoes are flies. And they transmit human diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, West Nile virus, encephalitis and Zika, to name a few.
As many as a million humans die each year from diseases transmitted by flies. These nasty flies, however, are the exception.
Most flies are harmless and many are beneficial.
Benefits
In fact, McAlister argues that without flies, life would be other-worldly. Many flies pollinate flowers, and if flies did not pollinate the plant Theobroma cacao, there would be no chocolate. That alone is a reason to love flies.
Fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, have been the backbone of modern genetics for 100 years. Work with these tiny flies has given the medical community important insights into human diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
And, in 2000, the fruit fly was the first animal to have its genome sequenced.
Flies also have a tremendous impact on the natural world. Many flies control pests. Hoverfly larva, for example, eat aphids. And myriad birds eat flies.
They are especially critical food sources for nestlings. Without flies, many songbird populations might crash. And many flies serve as natural garbage composters by eating feces and dead flesh.
I suspect most people would find a world without flies entirely uninhabitable.
The Secret Life of Flies is a fascinating read, but it's not for everyone. Some parts are just plain gross (check the index and learn about botflies). But the many color photographs add immeasurably to the book's appeal.
Curious naturalists of all ages will find The Secret Life of Flies quotable and entirely irresistible.
Grab those hockey sticks, lace up them skates and brush up on some hockey skills: the puck drops for the 7th annual Julia's Hope Cup and Carnival at Chippawa Park in Welland on Feb. 17.
Organizer Paul Turner said the pond-hockey tournament was created in memory of his daughter Julia Turner, who died in 2011 of cancer. It also raised money for The Hope Centre, a place Julia was passionate about as it combats homelessness.
Since the inaugural event, Turner said the tournament has grown to include more activities. Today, he said, it looks more like a winter carnival as it includes food, kids' games, a silent auction, and plenty of fun activities.
The mini-tournament for kids six to 12 years old is back this year too. He said they wanted to give young kids the opportunity to get involved, too. Similar to the larger tournament, the winners of the kids' tournament will receive a trophy – a miniaturized Stanley Cup lookalike.
“We really want to let the community know that it's a fun time for everyone,” Turner said.
For the first time, it's being held on Family Day weekend. Although some people go away for the weekend, Turner said there are also people who stay in the area and are seeking something to do.
He said this is a great way to beat the “dark days of February.”
Last year's weather was mild, turning the event into a ball hockey tournament instead, but he said he's feeling good about this year's forecast, hoping the colder weather will hold out. Still, 2017's event raised $20,000 for The Hope Centre and saw about 1,000 people come out.
Pledge sheets and sign up forms are available now at The Hope Centre, M.T. Bellies, Enviro-Niagara Heating and Air Conditioning, FE Coyne Insurance and Notre Dame College School.
The main tournament begins on Feb. 17 at 11:30 a.m. The cost to play is $100 per person or $50 for students. Before that, the mini-tournament starts at 10 a.m. Registration costs for that is $25. Pledge sheets are available for both and players should start arriving an hour before the games. Players are assigned to teams at random.
Turner said anyone interested in volunteering can get in touch with him at paulturnernd@hotmail.com.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Revenues for the $6 billion payday loan industry will shrivel under a new U.S. rule restricting lenders' ability to profit from high-interest, short-term loans, and much of the business could move to small banks, according to the country's consumer financial watchdog.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released a regulation on Thursday requiring lenders to determine if borrowers can repay their debts and capping the number of loans lenders can make to a borrower.
The long-anticipated rule still must survive two major challenges before becoming effective in 2019. Republican lawmakers, who often say CFPB regulations are too onerous, want to nullify it in Congress, and the industry has already threatened lawsuits.
Mostly low-income earners use what are known as payday loans - small-dollar advances typically repaid on the borrower's next payday - for emergency expenses. The lenders generally do not evaluate credit reports for loan eligibility.
Under the new rule, the industry's revenue will plummet by two-thirds, the CFPB estimated.
The current business model relies on borrowers needing to refinance or roll over existing loans. They pay fees and additional interest that increase lenders' profits, CFPB Director Richard Cordray said on a call with reporters.
“Lenders actually prefer customers who will re-borrow repeatedly," he said.
People trapped in that debt cycle can end up paying the equivalent of 300 percent interest, the bureau found in a study it conducted during five years of writing the rule.
The rule will devastate an industry serving nearly 30 million customers annually, said Ed D'Alessio, executive director of the Financial Service Centers of America, an industry trade group.
"Taking away their access to this line of credit means many more Americans will be left with no choice but to turn to the unregulated loan industry, overseas and elsewhere, while others will simply bounce checks and suffer under the burden of greater debt," he said.
BRINGING BANKS INTO THE MIX
The agency narrowed the final version of the regulation to focus on short-term borrowings, instead of also including longer-term and installment debt. It exempted many community banks and credit unions from having to ensure borrowers can repay loans, as well.
Both moves could make it easier for financial institutions to fill gaps left by payday lenders who close shop under the new rule.
"Banks and credit unions have shown a willingness to serve these customers with small installment loans, and they can do it at prices that are six times lower than payday loans," said Nick Bourke, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts' consumer finance project.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Thursday lifted restrictions that kept banks from making small-dollar loans, which will further aid in the transition.
The leading bank lobby group, the American Bankers Association, applauded the CFPB and OCC, and the trade group representing independent banks, Independent Community Bankers of America, said the exemption provides flexibility to make sustainable loans to customers in need.
But the Community Bankers Association representing retail institutions said only the smallest banks qualify for the exemption, which applies to lenders making 2,500 or fewer short-term loans per year and deriving no more than 10 percent of revenue from those loans.
"The CFPB whiffed at an opportunity to provide assistance to the millions of Americans experiencing financial hardship,” CBA President Richard Hunt said.

The United Auto Workers accused Nissan Motor Co. of illegally tracking and rating employees by their union sentiments for years at a Mississippi assembly plant where workers voted down representation last month.
In an amended complaint filed Sept. 19 with the National Labor Relations Board, the union alleges the automaker “continues to maintain an employee surveillance, data collection and rating system that records employee union activity and rates workers according to their perceived support for or opposition to the UAW.” Nissan representatives didn't immediately comment on the claims.
In the complaint, which Bloomberg News obtained through Freedom of Information Act request, the UAW asks the NLRB to subpoena the automaker and investigate its claims.
The allegations follow an NLRB-supervised election held Aug. 3 and 4, where more than 3,500 employees at the plant voted by an almost 2-to-1 margin against joining the union.
The UAW blamed the result on intimidation, which it has alleged to the NLRB included threatening to close the plant, questioning employees and infringing on the union's access to voters.
The UAW submitted a partially redacted document to the NLRB that it said is evidence of Nissan's rating system.
The union said the document lists names and employee numbers along with comments such as “has talked with solicitors at the gate before a shift” and “has been seen hanging with pro-union technicians.”
Nissan's plant in Canton, Miss., builds Altima sedans, Titan and Frontier pickups, Murano sport utility vehicles and NV commercial vans.

In a statement to 9News, the family said it sends “thanks and appreciation for the supportive messages and prayers for her recovery coming from across Louisiana and around the country.” The family added that “she believes the extraordinary outpouring of prayer has much to do with her progress.”
Blanco's alma mater, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, announced Monday the former governor will be the guest speaker at Friday's Fall 2017 Commencement ceremony. She earned a bachelor's degree in business education from the university in 1964, according to a post from UL Lafayette's website.
On Sunday, Blanco announced the return of a rare form of eye cancer she faced six years ago. In open letter published in several Louisiana newspapers, she said the ocular melanoma has now spread to her liver.

A team of researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have developed an innovative new method for detecting buried land mines, and it combines two unconventional tools: lasers and fluorescent bacteria.
Civilians around the world are continually impacted by live land mines left over from wartime. Detecting the land mines is difficult and removing them is obviously dangerous. And every year, between 15,000 and 20,000 people are hurt or killed by the devices. As many as 110 million buried land mines have been laid in more than 70 countries since the 1960s, according to the United Nations. Millions are still buried and unexploded.
Over the past few years, a number of creative methods have emerged for detecting and detonating land mines, including Massoud Hassani's windblown device and drone-based system called Mine Kafon.
The new Hebrew University method is inspired by the fact that soils collect trace amounts of explosive vapors that leak out of land mines. Detecting the vapors helps detect the land mine.
The researchers genetically engineered bacteria to give off a fluorescent signals when contacted by the explosive vapors. They then packed the bacteria into small beads and sprinkled them across the top layer of a test site that had land mines buried underneath. From a safe distance, they scanned the site with a laser and successfully detected the location of the land mines. A paper detailing the study was published last week in the journal Nature Biotechnology.
“Our field data show that engineered biosensors may be useful in a land mine detection system,” said Shimshon Belkin, who was in charge of engineering the bacteria.
However, he pointed out there were a few more obstacles ahead: “For this to be possible, several challenges need to be overcome, such as enhancing the sensitivity and stability of the sensor bacteria, improving scanning speeds to cover large areas, and making the scanning apparatus more compact so it can be used on board a light unmanned aircraft or drone.”
Democrats introduced a proposal Wednesday that would create a new personal income tax bracket for top wage earners, cut back on deductions for those nearing retirement age, and generate nearly $70 million in revenue.
The move comes as budget negotiations have reached an impasse, with Republicans demanding a change to the prevailing wage, a set wage for state construction projects and claiming Democrats are demanding rather than negotiating.
Sponsored by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst and Senate Majority Leader Margaret Rose Henry, House Bill 240 would increase existing personal income tax (PIT) brackets by varying amounts, increase the standard deduction and eliminate itemized deductions. It also would create a new tax bracket for individuals earning more than $150,000 of taxable income each year.
The bill, according to a Democratic caucus release, is nearly identical to the one Gov. John Carney announced in March, with the new bracket added.

“We have less than three weeks to draft and pass a balanced budget that provides a quality education for our children, keeps our communities safe, ensures access to healthcare and protects the services that many Delaware residents need,” said Longhurst, D-Bear. “For decades, people making just above $60,000 have paid the same rate as a person earning three, four or even 10 times as much. Working families are grappling with the high costs of everyday expenses from child care to transportation. We need to do what we can to take the financial burden off of their backs.
“This bill represents a structural change to Delaware's financial situation. Personal income tax is one of the most predictable and stable forms of revenue, so it needs to be part of our long-term solution to our budget shortfall. With budget cuts that could have serious effects on the services we provide, we cannot afford to kick the can down the road.
“I'm sure legislators and residents on both sides will have thoughts on the percentages and amounts. By filing this bill, we are starting the conversation on how we can lift the burden off of middle-class Delawareans by asking top earners to do just a little more to help keep our state a great place to work and raise a family.”
HB 240, which would take effect on Jan. 1, 2018, is estimated to generate $68.1 million in new revenue for fiscal 2018 and $211.5 million for fiscal 2019.
“We've cut positions, raised the health care burden on employees, reduced open space funding, and taken literally hundreds of other steps to control discretionary spending,” said Henry, D-Wilmington South. “And yet it still costs more to run government than it did several years ago. That means we're going to need more revenue to do it, plain and simple.
“Everyone in this building, if you gave them truth serum, would concede that Delaware is the most tax-friendly state in the region by a large margin,” she added. “Moreover, our wealthiest residents have been getting an incredible deal – a deal that's about to get even sweeter if we move forward with repealing the Estate Tax. When a Delawarean who is earning $600,000 a year pays the same tax rate as someone paying $60,000, we think it's appropriate to ask them to do a little bit more to help preserve the programs that make our state so great.”
Under HB 240, existing PIT brackets would increase by amounts varying between 0.15% and 0.4%. The current upper bracket, taxable income above $60,000, would increase from 6.6% to 6.8%. The new bracket, for income greater than $150,000, would be set at 6.95%.
By increasing the standard deduction – a dollar amount taxpayers who don't itemize deductions can subtract from their income before income tax is applied – many people whose taxable income is lower would pay less in state taxes. The standard deduction would increase from $3,250 to $5,000 for single and married taxpayers filing separately and from $6,500 to $10,000 for taxpayers filing joint returns.
The bill would also raise the eligibility age for the $12,500 exclusion from income of pensions and other retirement income from 60 to 65 during a five-year period.
HB 240 is expected to be filed Thursday.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Queen Latifah will get the royal treatment at the upcoming American Black Film Festival Honors.
The Oscar-nominated actress is set to receive the Entertainment Icon award at this year's ceremony, to be held in Los Angeles on Friday. The star of “Star” on Fox says she is honored to receive the award.
“It means so much to me coming from fellow entertainers and my peers.”
Queen Latifah got her start as a rapper almost three decades ago. Besides her Oscar nod for “Chicago,” she's also been nominated twice in Emmy acting categories and won a Golden Globe.
The American Black Film Festival Honors will air on BET and Centric at 8 p.m. EST on Feb. 22. Other honorees include Terrence Howard. Actress Regina Hall will host the event.
"We really want to work with our owners to accelerate the pace of renovations and the quality of the restaurant image in Canada," Swartz said.
"We're really encouraged by the initial results that we've had, both quantitative and qualitative, in testing with our guests."
RBI's previously announced $700-million renovation plan to spruce up its restaurants is one of the factors in its feud with GWNFA, which claims to represent more than? half of all the franchisees.
The franchisees say that the company has effectively changed the rent and royalty structure by saddling franchisees with increasing costs and requiring them to renovate stores at their own expense.
The dissident franchisee group was quick to point out it believed the plan was ill-conceived and would cost individual restaurant owners about $450,000.
During the conference call, however, Swartz said "we have managed to increase average franchise profitability in Canada by a significant amount since we first acquired Tim Hortons."
The company, which keeps its books in U.S. dollars, earned US$147.8 million or 59 cents per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31. That compared with a profit of $50.2 million or 21 cents per diluted share a year ago. Revenue totalled $1.25 billion, up from $1 billion in the same quarter last year.
On an adjusted basis, Restaurant Brands, which also owns Burger King and Popeyes, says it earned 66 cents per share for the quarter, up from 36 cents per share a year ago.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 56 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters

A police officer from Jodhpur was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on charges of demanding a bribe and outraging the modesty of a woman.
The incident came to light after Jodhpur police arrested a man in possession of around 1 kg of opium. The wife of the arrested man started doing rounds of the police station and officials to get her husband out of police custody.
When her persistent requests failed, she bumped into a police official —Kamaldan Charan, who promised the release of her husband but on a condition. He demanded an amount of Rs 2 lakh from her in cash.
The woman could only arrange Rs 1 lakh but the policeman was unfazed from her plight and offered her a proposition to ‘sleep' with him in order to suffice the remaining Rs 1 lakh.
Both the parties came into an agreement and decided to meet at the woman's place. But this little information was passed on to the ACB officials who later nabbed the policeman red handed with a cheque of Rs 1 lakh.

In late 2017, reports surfaced that FBI agent Peter Strzok and Department of Justice lawyer Lisa Page, who were romantically involved, had exchanged text messages during the 2016 Presidential campaign that called President Trump “an idiot,” a revelation that had gotten Strzok bounced by Special Counsel Robert Mueller when he was made aware of the text in July 2017 (Page had ended her tenure with Mueller earlier).
While Strzok, who had been deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division but has since been reassigned to human resources, and Page also texted mean things about other presidential hopefuls, like Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, it didn't take long for conspiracy theorists to begin speculating that there was an anti-Trump conspiracy at the FBI. After a review of the thousands of texts that Strzok and Page sent to each other, the Wall Street Journal (owned by Fox News' parent company News Corp.) has concluded the text messages do not point to any sort of anti-Trump bias.
Texts critical of Mr. Trump represent a fraction of the roughly 7,000 messages, which stretch across 384 pages and show no evidence of a conspiracy against Mr. Trump. Rather, a broader look shows an unvarnished and complex picture of the lives of an FBI agent and lawyer who found themselves at the center of highly charged probes.
The texts reviewed cover a period of time from August 2015 until December 2016 and pick back up in May and June of 2017. In addition, the Justice Department Inspector General is currently reviewing a batch of texts that covers the time between December 2016 and May 2017.
The texts do paint a picture of a couple in the middle of an extramarital affair with their brief work on Mueller's team leading to the end of the relationship, but that's probably just what the Deep State wants us to think.

Prince Charles is "so pleased" to have become a grandfather for the third time.
The 69-year-old royal became a third-time granddad when his son Prince William and daughter-in-law Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, welcomed their son - who is yet to have a name - into the world on Monday (23.04.18), and he has now expressed his "joy" at the news.
The news was revealed in a joint statement from Charles and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, which was tweeted from the Clarence House Twitter account.
It read: The Prince of Wales has released a statement following the birth of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's third child.
LEGAZPI, Philippines (AP) — A significant amount of ash has fallen on towns near the Philippines' most active volcano after energetic eruptions of lava from the crater.
Mount Mayon in northeastern Albay province has been erupting more than two weeks, and 84,000 people who fled the danger zone are staying in schools and other crowded shelters.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said one large lava eruption lasted more than an hour and a half late Monday. The ash plume reached 1.5 kilometers (.9 miles) above the crater and caused significant ashfall in the towns of Camalig and Guinobatan.
Mayon has been belching red-hot lava fountains, huge columns of ash and molten rocks into the sky and plunging communities into darkness with falling ash since Jan. 14. It has remained at alert level four on a scale of five, indicating a more violent eruption could be imminent.
Scientists have warned that despite the repeated eruptions of lava, Mayon is still swollen with magma below the surface and could erupt explosively.
No injuries have been reported in the current eruption, but authorities have struggled to keep people out of the danger zone 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the crater. They are worried the eruption may last months, disrupting the lives and livelihoods of people in Mayon's shadow.
Provincial leaders say disaster funds are running low and have said supplies like facemasks will be depleted if the eruption lasts.
The government has raised the possibility of creating a permanent "no man's land" around Mayon, a sensitive and complicated proposal that would affect tens and thousands of people living in the fertile farmlands nearby. One possibility is expanding a national park around the base of the volcano, where trees could grow and become a buffer against volcanic flows endangering villages and towns.
Mayon has erupted about 50 times in the last 500 years, sometimes violently. In 2013, an ash eruption killed five climbers who had ventured near the summit despite warnings.
The Philippines has about 22 active volcanoes. The explosion of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 was one of the biggest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century, killing hundreds.

So ends Chapter 2.
The woman appeals that finding. (Unlike in criminal cases, where acquitted defendants cannot be retried, in Title IX cases, accusers may appeal.) Michigan State reopens the case.
The university sends an email to Mumphery at an address he no longer looks at. He knows nothing of the appeal. This time, Michigan State holds him responsible for relationship violence and sexual misconduct.
So ends Chapter 3.
Now we turn to the consequences. In May 2017, The Detroit Free Press reports that Mumphery, a receiver for the Houston Texans and a graduate student at Michigan State, was expelled by the university because of a sexual assault. Two days later, after practice, the Texans' coach calls him into the office: Keith, this case is a problem and we're letting you go. Mumphery drives home to Vienna, Ga., which has a diner, fast-food joints, a single motel behind the gas station and a streetlight. He wonders what has become of his life.
Accusations of sexual assault offer perilous waters in which to swim as a reporter, an investigator, a lawyer. Sexually charged texts and a photograph, which exist in this case, can establish flirtation but do not speak to consent — the woman claims in her own lawsuit and in police reports that she was very drunk and had consumed well in excess of a dozen shots of vodka before Mumphery arrived. She insisted she could not agree to have sex. Mumphery disputes that the woman was drunk. A police report states that surveillance videos show her walking “with a steady gait” and with no trouble keeping her balance. Mumphery says that she opposed his use of a condom and that they did not have sex. The woman says she has been traumatized.
What is clear is that the consequences for Mumphery of this broken process are perilously close to that of a criminal conviction. Mumphery is boxed in a societal cell. He has not gotten a tryout with another N.F.L. team, and at 25 he sees his prime earning years as an athlete slipping by. He was an honor roll student and class president with a 1240 SAT score at his high school, and with this mark on his record, he is unlikely to gain admittance to another graduate program.
BOULEVARD, Calif. (AP) — Seventy-seven people who entered the United States illegally were found packed inside a sweltering truck near the Mexico border, and the driver was charged with transporting people for financial gain, authorities said.
Five children were among those found Monday evening in the cargo area of a brown truck painted to resemble a United Parcel Service vehicle, authorities said.
The California Highway Patrol pulled the truck over because it had no tags and was weaving on Old Highway 80 in Boulevard, a tiny desert community in San Diego County about five miles from the border.
A U.S. Border Patrol agent passing by on patrol stopped and asked the CHP officer if he would like assistance, the Union-Tribune said, citing a criminal complaint.
When the agent approached, he saw the truck was riding low. The agent "could smell body odor mixed with a distinct type of pungent soap which is commonly used in Mexico," according to the criminal complaint filed Tuesday.
The records say the driver gave permission for the agent to open the truck.
Inside, he saw people sweating and standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the hot cargo area, the complaint said, noting they were from Mexico and some acknowledged they had entered the U.S. illegally.
The driver, Shawn Lee Seiler, said he was a U.S. citizen, "stated that he is an alien smuggler" and expected to be paid $100 per immigrant, according to the complaint.
Seiler had been told he would be carrying 50 people in the truck to San Diego and was surprised to learn there were 77, the documents state.
Seiler and two men who previously had been deported to Mexico were charged Tuesday in San Diego federal court with transporting of "certain aliens" for financial gain. The two men also were charged with being deportees who were in the country illegally.
Messages left for Seiler's court-appointed attorney, Nancy Bryn Rosenfeld, were not immediately returned Wednesday.
A similar scene greeted authorities last week in Texas when Border Patrol agents found 76 immigrants, including 13 children, lying on the floor or crouched against the walls in a tractor-trailer rig.
The immigrants from Mexico and Central America were found when the semitrailer rig was stopped at a border checkpoint about 35 miles north of Laredo.
Smuggling organizations "view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety," Gabriel Acosta, assistant chief patrol agent for the Laredo Border Patrol sector, said Monday.

Alabama's 6th District Representative, Gary Palmer, was injured but safe after a shooter attacked a congressional baseball team practice in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday morning.
According to national media outlets, a lone shooter attacked the GOP team, shooting House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and members of the security detail and local police force. At least five people were hospitalized and others had minor injuries on the scene. The suspect, James Hodgkinson, has been reported dead.
Palmer released a statement this afternoon that he was about 20 yards from Hodgkinson when he began shooting near the third baseline. Palmer injured his leg while seeking cover, but was not injured by the shooter.
"My thoughts and prayers are with Congressman Steve Scalise and the others injured in this senseless tragedy. I am thankful for the bravery shown by the capitol police who were present and the quick action by the Alexandria, Va. Police Department in their response, which undoubtedly saved many innocent lives today,” Palmer said in an email statement.
The baseball team was practicing for the annual charity Congressional Baseball Game, which Palmer said was planned to honor victims of the recent terror attacks in London.
Chris Coleman believes Kazenga LuaLua can add another dimension to Sunderland's attack after a promising cameo against Birmingham City.
Coleman saw LuaLua as the ‘one positive' from Tuesday's 3-1 defeat and, while the 27-year-old is still searching for match fitness, Coleman believes his ‘blistering pace' can make the difference for the Black Cats.
The former Brighton man has spent most of his career playing in the wide areas, but the Black Cats boss believes he can free him up by playing him alongside another striker.
Coleman said: “People look at LuaLua as a winger, but I see him playing through the middle.
“We have wingers in the squad, with Aiden McGeady and Callum McManaman, if we decide to go down that route.
“He's got that 10 yards where his blistering pace and power comes in, and he has an incredible shot on him.
“But we have to get him up that end of the pitch, hence why we want him through the middle really.
“Sometimes when you play players like that out wide, because they have defensive duties to carry out, you lose a bit of what they offer going forward.
“If we're going to play with three centre-backs, I want to play two strikers and he will be one of them.
“Let's get him up that end of the pitch, into the penalty box, and make things happen. We need to get him up to match tempo and he will do that by getting more minutes on the pitch.”
Coleman also signed striker Ashley Fletcher on loan from Middlesbrough and the 22-year-old could make his full debut against Ipswich this afternoon.
Fellow deadline-day signings Ovie Ejaria and Lee Camp are also expected to start.
ALISO VIEJO – No. 14 El Toro showed off its offensive versatility in a 41-24 victory over No. 24 Aliso Niguel on Friday in a Sea View League game.
The Chargers are known mostly for their prolific passing offense, but demonstrated the ability to run the ball and control the clock. Steven Castaneda and Julian Bruce rushed for 95 and 90 yards, respectively, on a combined 26 carries.
“Any time you can run the football it's a benefit to you,” El Toro coach Mike Mayoral said.
Cooper Jones threw the ball well as well. The senior quarterback completed 15 of 20 passes for 265 yards and three touchdowns.
Cooper Jones is happy with his team's win over Aliso and is excited about next week's game against Capo. @ocvarsity @ETHSChargers pic.twitter.com/9ZZixhUT1K — Michael Huntley (@mikehuntley63) October 7, 2017
“That's who Cooper is. He's an outstanding young man,” Mayoral said. “He's got great character and he plays like a 6-foot-8 guy. He's really special.”
The turning point in the game was late in the third quarter. After an interception by Jake Landry, Jones threw a 90-yard touchdown pass to Shane Mclaughlin to extend the El Toro lead to 10.
“The ball was a little bit underthrown but Shane Mclaughlin made a great play and scored for me. It was nice,” Jones said.
Jones threw two other touchdown passes, both to Austin Derrico. The trio of Mclaughlin, Derrico and Noah Aguilar caught 13 passes for 227 yards.
“My job is to get the ball in their hands. I personally believe I have the best playmakers in the county,” Jones said. “It's my job to get it in their hands and they do the rest.”
Aliso Niguel (4-3, 0-1) moved the ball well but had three turnovers. Receiver Tyler Jones caught 12 passes for 120 yards and a touchdown.
“He's a good football player so he was definitely on our mind,” Mayoral said. “We added a little something this week to try to slow him down. Overall we kept in check which was our gameplan.”
Aliso quarterback Kyle Robertson threw for 180 yards and two touchdowns. He also rushed for 82 yards and a touchdown.
El Toro (4-3, 1-0) plays No. 12 Capistrano Valley next week in what will potentially decide the Sea View League championship.
“I'm sure in both of our minds it's a league championship game,” Jones said. “We have to execute a lot better than we did tonight. I think we will come out with a ‘W' if we play a hard game.”
Sunderland-born Jack Martin followed his brother Patrick, the 2015 champion, in winning the North Eastern Counties Cross Country Senor Championship at Redcar Racecourse on Saturday.
The former Sunderland Harrier took the race by the scruff of its neck to win by 31 seconds.
But he admitted that his win was not as easy as it looked: “I found it quite hard as I could not get into a rhythm due to the twisting nature of the course.”
The Stockport Harrier recorded 36.42 to beat Gateshead's Calum Johnson (37.13) and Morpeth's Carl Avery (37.22).
His victory was significant, as Jack and Patrick became only the second brothers to win the title in its 112 year history.
Elswick Harriers' George and Bill Boak were successful from 1949, George winning in that year and Bill winning the title from 1950 to 1957.
The Sunderland women's team won their first ever team medals in finishing third behind winners Jarrow and Hebburn and Morpeth.
They were led home on the pancake flat bone-dry course by sterling performances from Alice Smith in eighth (31.57), Vicky Haswell 11th (32.38), Nicola Woodward 17th (33.19) and Vikki Cotton 52nd (36.52).
The race was won by Sale's Sonia Samuels (28.07) from Morpeth's Emma Holt (28.55) and Jane Hodgson (29.07).
There was also medals for the Sunderland Under17/20 Women's team who took the silver medals through back-to-form Jess Fox in sixth (23.37), Sarah Knight 12th (24.49) and Eve Quinn 19th (25.22).
Sunderland's Sophie Burnett (Birtley), the early leader, eventually finished second (22.33) to Darlington's India Pentland (22.12), who also led her club to the team title, four points ahead of Sunderland.
The Sunderland Under-20 Men's team were also on podium in taking third place. They had Mark Smith in fifth (27.00), Chris Bell 12th (28.03) and Sean Mackie 15th (28.43),.
Houghton Harriers youngsters delivered a first class championship by winning a hatful of medals in the Under-15 age groups.
It was Henry Johnson that got the ball rolling by winning an exciting Under-15 Boys' race. Third last year and winner of the Under-13 title in 2015, he ran a perfect race, making his move at the halfway point to win by eight seconds (12.55). Clubmate Will Bellamy took the runners-up position when he got the better of Middlesbrough Mandale's Archie Lowe (13.09) in the home straight.
Closing the scoring for Houghton in the team race was Chris Coulson who finished 21st (14.42). And in a very tight team contest, Middlesbrough Mandale beat Houghton by just three points with Gateshead a further four points back.
The Girls' Under-15 race also so Houghton in fine form with Lydia James taking the bronze medal (15.37) and with Anna Pigford ninth (15.55) and Nicole Phillips 10th (15.58) another team gold was in the bag.
Amy Leonard just missed out on a medal for Houghton in finishing 12th in 16.08.

It may be some time before we hear the full story from the Toronto police constable who apprehended the suspect in Monday's van attack that left 10 people dead and several others injured.
But many are rightfully praising the policeman's actions, and at the same time comparing them to the actions taken in other situations that have had significantly different outcomes.
This begs the question: Why didn't the police officer, now identified as Const. Ken Lam, shoot the suspect? The suspect appeared to be wielding a weapon as he walked toward Lam, and at one point even pleaded with the police officer to shoot him.
As a former police officer and someone who studies police issues —including use of force — this situation is a case study on how things can go very right.
My initial reaction to the videos of the van driver's arrest was that the police officer was professional and acting within his own assessment of the situation. This is critical.
Canada's Criminal Code provides the legal authority for the use of force, but it does not tell an officer what to do in each situation. Likewise, police use-of-force models provide a framework for training and assistance in decision-making. But like the Criminal Code, they don't provide a legal basis or a rationale for the use of force in any particular situation.
Deadly force a possibility
When faced with the threat of death or grievous bodily harm, a police officer is authorized to use force to protect themselves or others, up to and including deadly force. With this authority comes significant responsibility.
Just because you're authorized to use deadly force doesn't mean you always should. There are many times when police officers could legally use deadly force, but don't.
Most of these situations do not show up in the news that evening. These situations mostly pass by unnoticed and unreported. This case made international headlines due to the nature of the crimes being investigated, and the presence of video footage of the arrest.
What went right this time?
First, you had a clearly well-trained police officer who was acting in a professional manner. This is what we expect from our police.
The suspect had everything going for him in order to survive his arrest. It took place in bright sunlight, but without the sun shining in the officer's eyes. The suspect was silhouetted against a white van, which likely provided a clearer outline of the object in the suspect's hands.
The suspect did not take a typical shooting stance, but stood upright with his shoulders back. He was not aiming an object, but pointing it from the shoulder.
From the video, it appears the suspect was yelling for the police officer to shoot him. He dropped his arm to his side and brought it back up again as if pointing a weapon at the police officer. Again, if he was not a typical shooting stance.
Constable de-escalated
This officer clearly had de-escalation in mind. He recognized his car siren was on and went back to turn it off. This shows that he did not have tunnel vision or hearing. With the siren off, clearer communications were possible.
With a good visual of the subject, the actions of the suspect, his calls to be shot and the artificial manner in which he was standing and threatening, the police officer clearly made a decision that the use of deadly force, while authorized, was not immediately needed.
I do not know what the police officer was thinking, but what came to my mind was an attempt by the suspect of a “suicide by cop.” This is a situation where a suspect tries to goad the police into using deadly force.
This by itself does not negate the risk to police and others. There are occasions when the use of deadly force is appropriate even when it is a purposeful attempt to have someone else kill them. Some suspects do follow through on their threats in order to goad police into the use of force. But not this time.
Risk assessment for police officers
The use-of-force models used by police include a risk assessment that asks the officer to take into account the following:
Situational Factors — These include the environment, the number of suspects, the perception of the suspect's abilities, knowledge of the suspect's background, time and distance from the suspect and threat cues given by the suspect.
Tactical Considerations — Is there cover, is backup available?
Subject Behaviour — Are they threatening and how are they threatening?
Officer's Perceptions — Their own assessment of the situation and their abilities to handle it.
This risk assessment, however, does not provide “the answer” to an officer regarding shoot or don't shoot, or any other use of force.
What it does provide is a framework for decision-making. This is all part of professional police training.
I faced a situation early in my service with the RCMP when I had a male in the sights of my pistol. It was a tense situation, and I felt that the use of deadly force was likely. But my training, in a fraction of a second, took me through an assessment of the situation.
I held my fire because I could not see the weapon that was being threatened, and I was behind cover. I held on until the suspect gave up. He was unarmed.
Decision to shoot not easily made
I have also worked with officers who had the misfortune to have had to resort to deadly force to save their own lives. It is not a decision that is easily made — and it's one that can be very personal to the officer in the situation.
Their own perception, their own confidence, their training, their reaction to the situation — all have an impact on the outcome.
The courts have sided with police in this decision-making process, ruling that the courts must take into account the reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers they find themselves.
So in this case, we had a trained officer, acting calmly and professionally, with a clear view of the suspect and the object in his hand, indications of an attempt at “suicide by cop,” de-escalation techniques used and a quick surrender. It all led to a successful arrest without the use of deadly force.
One small change in the circumstances, and the outcome could have been very different.
Police do not use deadly force because of the crime the suspect is alleged to have committed, but only due to the threat posed. This police officer made a heroic call. Const. Lam risked his own life to preserve another's, even when that person was the suspect in a horrendous act that took so many innocent lives.

Latency cut for cable linking Australia, NZ and the US
A survey of around 15,000 kilometres of seabed has found a faster route for the Southern Cross NEXT cable project, which will connect Sydney, Auckland, and Los Angeles.
Southern Cross Cables today announced that the survey had been completed for the third route on its subsea network, with a new plan to lay cable in waters off the Wallis and Fortuna islands cutting the expected latency of the cable.
The existing Southern Cross Cable Network provides 20 terabits per second capacity; the US$350 million Southern Cross NEXT project will deliver an additional 60Tbps. The new cable is expected to be operational by late 2019.
In addition to connecting Australia, New Zealand and the US, a number of Pacific nations, including Fiji, Samoa, Tokelau and Kiribati, are expected to be hooked up to NEXT. Including the four Pacific nations, Southern Cross has received written intent from eight customers.
“The route we have chosen will deliver the fastest connection between the shores of Australia, New Zealand and US – and we're also connecting up several Pacific Island nations as well,” said Southern Cross Cable Network CEO Anthony Briscoe.
The company said that a request for proposal for a cable vendor is currently underway; vendor selection is expected to be completed by the end of 2017.
The survey, conducted by EGS, also discovered a shipwreck off the coast of Sydney, Southern Cross said.
The Southern Cross Cable Network is 50 per cent owned by Spark NZ, with Optus' parent company Singtel holding a 40 per cent stake and Verizon Business 10 per cent.
Earlier this year Southern Cross introduced new service offerings based on software-defined networking (SDN).
In April, a consortium that brings together AARNet, Google, Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel, SubPartners and Telstra announced they had signed an agreement with Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) to build the INDIGO cable system.
That cable system — formerly known as APX West and Central — will connect Singapore, Australia and Indonesia. Construction of the cable is expected to be completed by mid-2019.
Novices can find beauty techniques overwhelming. A beauty regimen can seem overwhelming, but the truth is that with just a little knowledge, it's not hard at all. The article below will give you some fantastic tips to get you started, and you'll be on the path to beauty in no time!
No matter what kind of skin you have, you should wash your skin with a mild soap a few times a day. Make sure you remove all makeup before you begin a cleaning regimen. Leaving on makeup will clog up your pores and cause skin problems.
Make your shampoo and conditioner last longer. If you are using an expensive shampoo or conditioner that is thick, you can stretch out the amount of use you get out of it by watering it down. Be careful not to add too much water because this can ruin it.
For smooth, streak-free results, exfoliate your skin before applying self-tanner. Dead, dry skin can cause self-tanner to absorb unevenly. This can result in streaks, splotches and areas of color that are darker than they should be. You can eliminate this problem by exfoliating your skin before you apply self-tanner. By removing dead skin cells, exfoliating can help ensure that yourself tanner absorbs evenly and gives you a beautiful, streak-free glow.
Do you want clear, clean, healthy skin? Exfoliation is essential! Exfoliate your skin regularly to remove all the junk, chemicals, and dirt you expose yourself to every day. The internet has lots of great recipes for exfoliaters that clean your skin naturally and without costing you an arm and a leg, check it out!
For beautiful nails, put top coat on top of your nail polish every time. Topcoat will not only keep your nails looking shiny, it will extend the length of time between polishing. Avoid substituting clear nail polish for topcoat as it is not the same product, and will not provide the same benefit.
Give yourself a quick facial at home by filling a bowl with hot water, and then steaming your face over it with a towel draped over your head. This will open your pores and help to eliminate black heads. Follow with a cold water rinse to close the pores and continue your makeup routine.
Many women like to use concealer under their foundation. If you've run out of concealer, or can't find it, look inside the cap of your foundation. Liquid and lotion foundations tend to collect and thicken inside the cap and will work well in a pinch as an emergency concealer.
It does not matter how tired or pressed for time you may be, you should never skip your cleansing rituals. Drier skin benefits from thick, creamy cleansers, whereas oily skin benefits most from cleansing balms, washes, or bars. All skin types can be dulled by buildup of makeup, sweat, and dead skin cells.
Use hydrogen peroxide to cure yellowed nails. Nothing is beautiful about yellowing nails. To fix this problem, soak cotton in peroxide and then wipe each nail for several strokes. Let it sit on your nails for a few minutes. Rinse your nails, and admire the lack of yellow coloring.
Get your sleep to keep yourself looking beautiful. Do not underestimate the power of scarce sleep to age your face, and your body. You need from six to eight hours of sleep a night to rejuvenate your body, skin, and brain. All are important elements in your overall personal health.
To get super shiny hair, try giving your hair some deep conditioning! After washing your hair, squeeze out all excess water and apply a healthy dollop of conditioner to your hair, focusing on your hairline, the nape of the hair, and the ends. Apply a shower cap and let the conditioner soak in 10 minutes before you rinse it out. You'll have gorgeous silky hair when it dries!
To give more definition to your eyes apply mascara. If you only have a few minutes, you can apply mascara to highlight your eyes, and look like you have spent more time than you really have getting ready. Adding eye color will only take a few moments, and really completes your look.
To extend the life of your lip gloss, apply a lip liner first. Be sure to match your lip shade with the lip liner. By taking this step first you're glossed will be sure to stay on much longer.
There is a very fine yet very important line between vanity and taking care of yourself. It is important that you stay on the correct side of this line. Beauty should be a small part of your daily routine and if it is becoming an obsession then you should try to rethink your priorities.
If you hate the problems of clumpy and matted eyelashes, try using an eyelash curler. This will make the eyelashes thick and full without using any products. When using the curler, start at the roots and only use on lashes that are clean. Over time your lashes will become fuller, thicker, and beautiful.
Be sure to apply moisturizer to your face before you apply your foundation. It will stop your makeup from streaking and give you a more natural look once your makeup is applied. Be sure to go below your jaw line so you do not have the dreaded makeup lines that occur.
In our modern world, time can be a precious necessity that many do not have. However, you do not have to sacrifice your beauty for tardiness. There are a myriad of simple make up and hair tips and tricks that you can try for a refreshed and natural beautiful look. Try simple steps to achieve the look that you crave.
So whether you are looking for a new idea for your hair, nails, skin, or makeup, following the advice in this article will, undoubtedly, offer insight into a world of new possibilities. Remember these tips and tricks whenever you want to freshen up your look and feel better about your appearance.
Dzvukamanja, who has scored eight times in 14 matches for the log leaders, is part of Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambwa's squad in camp for the regional tournament.
Zimbabwe, who are the defending champions will join Cosafa campaign in the quarter-finals where they will face the winners from Group B on Sunday in Polokwane.
However, Chidzambwa elected to pick a strong squad with the Warriors' internationals dotted all over the globe all being called up for this tournament.
Dzvukamanja will have to battle for a place with the likes of captain Knowledge Musona, Khama Billiat, Tino Kadewere and Evans Rusike.
The Madamburo forward is not fazed by this challenge and hopes to gain a lot of experience by training with some of these Europe-based stars.
“Obviously I'm happy to be called up into the Cosafa squad which also includes some of our top international players,” Dzvukamanja told the Daily News.
“I'm sure I'm going to learn one or two things from these guys; they are all top players. My hope is to make it in the final squad that will travel to South Africa for the tournament but the coaches will have the final decision. But it's every player's dream to represent their country in such a big regional tournament.”
Dzvukamanja and Ngezi have started the 2018 season like a house on fire and are unbeaten in 14 matches.
Tonderai Ndiraya's side currently enjoy a three-point lead over second-placed defending champions FC Platinum.
Dzvukamanja's goals have been one of the main reasons why Madamburo look destined to land their first domestic title ever since their promotion into the top flight in the 2016 season.
“There is still a long way to go before the season comes to an end and I think I should score more goals this year. If I rest on my laurels and be satisfied with the eight goals I have scored already that will not be good.” DailyNews

JOHNSON CITY, TN (WJHL) – A local group of motorcycle riders called the Dog Tag Brigade, along with Tetrick Funeral Home and Cremation Services, cut the ribbon on two parking spots that have been designated to those soldiers and veterans who were combat wounded and have received a Purple Heart.
This campaign was started by the group asking area businesses to donate parking spots where they can place the signs.
“We wanted to pay respect and honor to the veterans who have given so much to this country,” Tyler Tetrick, vice president of Tetrick Funeral Home and Cremation Services, said. “Without their sacrifice and their service to our country, we wouldn't have the safety and security that we do. With today being Flag Day, we thought it was an appropriate day to do it.”
Special honorees at the ceremony were Mr. Rick Storey, a U.S. Army Vietnam veteran and recipient of the Purple Heart Medal. Mr. Jerry Barnett, a U.S. Army veteran during the Vietnam era and Mr. Billy Gillenwater, a 20 year Navy veteran. Both Barnett and Gillenwater are associates at the funeral home.
Tetrick said it's important to remember our veterans and all of the sacrifice they made for the freedoms we have today.
“We owe our veterans so much. Without our veterans we would not have the freedoms, the luxuries that we do,” he said.
The campaign is funded by the club and through donations from private citizens and area businesses.
If you would like to make a donation you can visit their website dogtagbrigade.com or send an email to veteranhelpdtb@gmail.com.

MADRID (AP) - Spain has extradited to the United States a Russian citizen who is suspected of being one of the world's most notorious spammers.
Pyotr Levashov, a 37-year-old from St. Petersburg, was arrested in April while vacationing with his family in Barcelona.
U.S. authorities had asked for him to be detained on charges of fraud and unauthorized interception of electronic communications. He was arraigned late Friday in a federal courthouse in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where a grand jury indicted him last year. Levashov pleaded not guilty and remains in detention.
A statement from Spain's National Police said officers handed Levashov over to U.S. marshals on Friday. The extradition was approved in October by Spain's National Court, which rejected a counter-extradition request from Russia.
The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Authorities in the U.S. say they have linked Levashov to a series of powerful botnets, or networks of hijacked computers, that were capable of pumping out billions of spam emails. An indictment unsealed last year said he commanded the sprawling Kelihos botnet, which at times allegedly involved more than 100,000 compromised computers that sent phony emails advertising counterfeit drugs, harvested users' logins and installed malware that intercepted bank account passwords.
On a typical day, the network would generate and distribute more than 2,500 spam emails, according to the indictment.
Levashov's lawyers have alleged the case is politically motivated and that the U.S. wants him for reasons beyond his alleged cybercrimes. They had argued that he should be tried in Spain instead, and pointed to evidence showing that he gained access to Russian state secrets while studying in St. Petersburg.
Levashov's U.S.-based lawyer, Igor Litvak, didn't return emails or calls seeking comment Friday.

Differences in years of Remington 700s? Thinking of getting another 700 in 30-06. Maybe back up, maybe a project. Though I am to cheap to dump alot of money. Timney trigger for an older one. Maybe bed it.
Is there a difference in years? My 75 bolt is so smooth. Safety is loud. Not sure if Timney is better.
I don't care about looks. I want one that I don't care about scratches. My other one is my Grandpa's.
Lots of talk of quality going down hill. Things get cheaper. But I also realize metalurgy and technology advances too.
I just saw 68 for sale, and was thinking about it.
Is there a sweet spot in years? Thanks.

Never let anyone tell you that sports aren't the place for protest. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico, gold medalist and NFL wide receiver Tommie Smith and Bronze medalist and fellow Olympic Project for Human Rights member John Carlos raised their fists in defiance of white supremacy and in solidarity with Black liberation movements back in the United States during a time of civil upheaval over the systematic denial of rights to African Americans.
But people seem to forget that, so to counteract the widespread amnesia that seems to follow the national discourse surrounding civil rights and equity movements, R&B singer John Legend and actor/activist Jesse Williams are teaming up to produce a documentary entitled With Drawn Arms to remind us all not just about Smith and Carlos' protest, but what it meant that they would use the biggest stage in world sports to take a stand for their rights and those of their people — and the consequences they faced for doing so. Smith and Carlos were both suspended from the American team for their raised fists, and threatened by bigots back home. Sound familiar?
In an interview with Deadline, Legend revealed his motivation behind choosing this story to produce. “In this current climate, we are once again being charged to stand up to bigotry, fear, and hate. We are inspired by this story and honored to be a creative partner on this film.”
Williams echoed that sentiment, saying, “Tommie Smith is more than an iconic poster or risky act of defiance that inspires people the world over. He is a living man, whose incredible journey is worthy of examination. I couldn't be more excited to join forces with this team of filmmakers, to share his reality and challenge our notions of heroism in the process.”
With Drawn Arms, co-directed by conceptual artist Glenn Kaino and former Prince collaborator Afshin Shahidi, is slated to be released next October 16 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the act by Smith.
DENVER (AP) — A lacy, cloud-like pattern drifting across a Denver-area radar screen turned out to be a 70-mile-wide (110-kilometer) wave of butterflies, forecasters say.
Paul Schlatter of the National Weather Service said he first thought flocks of birds were making the pattern he saw on the radar Tuesday,but the cloud was headed northwest with the wind, and migrating birds would be southbound in October.
He asked birdwatchers on social media what it might be, and by Wednesday had his answer: People reported seeing a loosely spaced net of painted lady butterflies drifting with the wind across the area.
Schlatter said the colors on the radar image are a result of the butterflies' shape and direction, not their own colors.
Midwestern radar stations occasionally pick up butterflies, but Schlatter believes it's a first for Denver.
An unusually large number of painted ladies, which are sometimes mistaken for monarch butterflies, has descended on Colorado's Front Range in recent weeks, feeding on flowers and sometimes flying together in what seem like clouds.
Sarah Garrett, a lepidopterist at the Butterfly Pavilion in Westminster, Colorado, said people from as far away as the Dakotas have called to report seeing the butterflies, whose population typically surges with plentiful flowers.
Research on the painted ladies in North America is limited, but scientists believe they migrate to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico in the fall. In Europe, studies using radio tracking have shown they migrate south from Europe to Africa in the fall and return in the spring. Studies also show that monarch butterflies often use wind to their advantage and glide on currents for periods of time, Garrett said.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are higher Tuesday morning as investors applaud strong first-quarter results from companies including machinery maker Caterpillar, appliance maker Whirlpool and Fifth Third Bancorp. Smaller companies made big gains in an optimistic sign for the U.S. economy. Bond yields continue to rise and the 10-year Treasury note reached 3 percent for the first time in more than four years. Alphabet, Google's parent company, slid after it reported greater revenue but also an increase in spending.
KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index gained 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,675 as of 9:55 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,492. The Nasdaq composite added 13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,141. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 8 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,570.
MACHINE POWER: Caterpillar said the strong global economy helped its sales of construction and energy industry machinery and it raised its forecasts for the year. It also said prices rose and its stock jumped 3.3 percent to $159. Appliance maker Whirlpool also surpassed expectations and rose 5 percent to $157.80. Aircraft maker United Technologies rallied 1.5 percent to $125.29 after its report and competitor Boeing gained 1.7 percent to $344.59. Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies picked up 2.4 percent to $90.15.
MISPRINT: Alphabet slid 2.6 percent to $1,045.78 after the company said ad revenue climbed, but expenses also rose. Google's parent company benefited from strong digital ad sales as well as an accounting change.
Drugmaker Biogen reported weaker sales than analysts expected and its stock gave up 2.3 percent to $253.34 while scientific equipment maker Waters said sales to industrial customers decreased. The stock plunged 7.9 percent to $193.
BONDS: Bond prices kept slipping. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3 percent before it slipped to 2.99 percent. It finished at 2.98 percent on Monday.
The yield on the 10-year note is a benchmark for many kinds of interest rates including mortgages, and it's been climbing because investors expect greater economic growth and faster inflation. It hadn't reached 3 percent since early January of 2014.
Since the global financial crisis in 2008-09, a combination of low inflation expectations and a bond-buying program by the Federal Reserve have helped keep bond yields low, but they have climbed this year as inflation has picked up and the Fed raised interest rates. With the Fed no longer buying bonds and investors expecting greater inflation, analysts say higher yields could make bonds more attractive.
CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 109.13 yen from 108.65 yen. The euro rose to $1.2230 from $1.2205.
ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude oil gained 19 cents to $68.83 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 7 cents to $74.78 per barrel in London.
OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX lost 0.3 percent while the French CAC 40 dipped 0.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.9 percent, helped by the weaker yen. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.4 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.4 percent.

An American citizen detained for a drug offense escaped Monday from an overcrowded and under-staffed prison on the Indonesian resort island of Bali.
Head of Kerobokan prison Tonny Nainggolan said Christian Beasley, 32, was believed to have escaped at around 4 a.m. by sawing through a ceiling and then jumping over a 6-meter (20-foot) high wall behind the prison.
Beasley was arrested in August at a post office in the Kuta tourist area of Bali with a package containing 5.7 grams of hashish.
Nainggolan said another American inmate, Paul Anthony Hoffam, 57, who was serving a 20-month jail since July for robbery, was captured while trying to escape.
An investigation was underway to find out possible involvement of prison guards in the incident, said Surung Pasaribu of the local Law and Human Rights Ministry. He also said there is a shortage of guards for the prison, which was built to accommodate about 300 people but has nearly 1,600 inmates.
It was the second escape from the prison in Bali's capital, Denpasar, since June when four foreign inmates from Australia, Bulgaria, India and Malaysia escaped through a drainage tunnel.
Two of them, Bulgarian Dimitar Nikolov Iliev and Indian Sayed Mohammed Said were recaptured in East Timor days later and were returned to Bali. Two others, Shaun Edward Davidson of Australia and Malaysian Tee Koko King bin Tee Kim Sai are still at large.
Jailbreaks are common in Indonesia, where prisons are overcrowded by people convicted of drug crimes as part of the government's anti-drugs crusade.
In May, more than 440 prisoners escaped from an overcrowded prison on Sumatra island when they were let out perform Friday Muslim prayers. In July 2013, about 240 prisoners, including several convicted terrorists, escaped during a deadly riot at a prison in another part of Sumatra.
Post-Irma, Some Still Without Internet in Florida
The power's back on in Florida. So why is the internet still out for some people, more than two weeks after Hurricane Irma struck? When power fails, so do home and business internet connections. When Hurricane Irma hit Florida on Sept. 10, 6.7 million customers lost electricity, or nearly two-thirds of the state. Nine days later, all but 1 percent of the state -- 100,000 -- had the power back on.
With internet service, it's less clear where things stand. The Federal Communications Commission, which tracks home phone, internet and TV outages, published its last update more than a week ago, on Sept. 18, when there were still close to 900,000 customers without service from cable providers.
Major internet providers such as Comcast, Charter and Cox now say 98 percent to 99 percent of their affected customers have had service restored. (AT&T cites similar figures for its overall network.) But it's not clear how many actual people still lack service.
In Houston, Hurricane Harvey caused widespread flooding that led to power losses and interrupted home phone, TV or internet service for at least 284,000, according to FCC numbers. As of Sept. 5, the last FCC report, almost 154,000 customers remained without service. AT&T says Texas is operating normally, Comcast says Houston has been back to normal for several weeks, Charter and CenturyLink say a small number of customers are still affected.
Why Outages Drag On
Many homes will get internet back once power is restored. But that's not true for everyone.
Even if a home's power is back on, there could still be problems with the underlying cable network or central facilities. Sometimes equipment in a home or street is damaged and needs to be repaired or replaced. (Mobile service tends to bounce back faster. Cell towers are more easily fixable and carriers can use each other's networks to get texts and calls through.)
On top of that, there are a variety of challenges associated with conducting repairs in a disaster zone. "We are not allowed to enter disaster areas until power is restored, then we move in," said Todd Smith, a spokesman for cable company Cox.
Sometimes the damage isn't at all obvious. "There are also occasionally situations where power and (network equipment) in one area may be fine, but the network that feeds it could be damaged further down the line," Smith said.
Lines of Communication
For some customers, though, a major frustration has been trying to figure out just when their service is coming back.
Laura Sagar, a real estate agent in hard-hit Naples, Florida, said her power was restored the evening of Tuesday, Sept. 19, after being out for 10 days. Internet service didn't flip back on until Sept. 25. She said she saw Comcast came to fix a downed line only after a neighbor called to report a problem.
The local power company "communicated often, frequently," she said. "Comcast, zippity doo dah."
Comcast said it has thousands of technicians in Florida working on restoring service, including some from out of state. It said it sent customers emails and told them to check a Comcast app for information.
But Sagar said she expected public announcements and didn't see an email. When she called, the company told her service would be restored within 10 days; it was back near the end of that period.
Information Please
The FCC collects voluntary feedback from home phone and cable companies about outages after disasters and makes that information public in daily reports. But in the aftermath of Irma, it ceased those reports while almost a million people still lacked internet service.
Stopping the public updates on Irma was "unconscionable," said David Simpson, a former FCC public-safety official. The result, he said, was consumers and communities left in the dark, "with no insight into the scope of the problem on any given day since the 18th."
The agency says it stopped its disaster-reporting system for Irma at the request of another agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. The daily outage reports are meant to "provide situational awareness in the immediate aftermath of a disaster." The agency started daily reports on Hurricane Maria, which has wreaked chaos in Puerto Rico and left the island without power or working phone or internet, three days later.
Simpson was likewise critical of the reports from individual internet providers like Comcast and Charter, noting that they aren't anywhere near detailed enough. Those reports don't let people know if there are particularly hard-hit areas -- say, where half of homes are still without internet or a working home phone.
"If you know repairs are going to take a month, you would take steps to buy a satellite dish or increase wireless coverage," he said. "Without information, consumers and communities can't make those rational decisions on what to do."

A UCF football player may have to choose between continuing to play college football and building his brand on YouTube.
Sophomore kicker Donald De La Haye said in a video he may have to decide whether to remain with the Knights football team or pursue his passion as a YouTube personality after meeting with the school's compliance office last week. He could be violating NCAA rules by receiving money from the advertising revenue off his YouTube videos that chronicle his life as a college student and as a college football player.
De La Haye has nearly 56,000 subscribers on YouTube and his latest video detailing his battle to keep his channel going had 113,042 views as of Wednesday afternoon. YouTube pays video creators a percentage of the ad revenue profits.
De La Haye, who could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, discussed his dilemma in his most recent YouTube video posted on Monday.
"Some people upstairs aren't happy with my videos and they like I'm in violation of NCAA rules and whatnot," De La Haye said in the video. "I don't understand but who am I to say what is in the rulebook and what is not."
The school released a vague statement Wednesday, leaving it unclear whether De La Haye can continue publishing his videos.
"UCF athletics is committed to rule compliance," the statement read. "Our compliance staff strives to make sure our student-athletes are informed about all pertinent NCAA bylaws."
A person with knowledge of the situation said that De La Haye was not told in last week's meeting that he has to discontinue making the video. The person was told the meeting was the first in a series of discussions that the player will have with the compliance office. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details of the meeting with De La Haye have not been publicly released.
The NCAA referred all comments to UCF, saying that it has not received a waiver from the school in regards to the matter.
NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes from profiting from their likeness or status as student-athletes because it violates amateur guidelines. NCAA bylaw 12.4.4 regarding self-employment states a student-athlete may establish his or her own business, provided the student-athlete's name, photograph, appearance or athletics reputation are not used to promote the business.
De La Haye, a marketing major, said in that video posted Monday that he created the channel as a way to further his career. He went on to say it is means to make a little extra money, money the Costa Rica native said his family needs.
"Basically, I'm not allowed to make any money off my YouTube videos," he said. "So I'm working hard — basically like a job filming, editing, creating ideas — and I'm not allowed to make any money. And if I do bad things will happen."
De La Haye, who seems to have a huge personality in the videos he creates, begins the video discussing his dilemma and an impending meeting with a school compliance worker in between taking bites of a hamburger. With a use of a time lapse element, later in the 10:39 video he discusses the meeting with the compliance worker and he says he is disappointed with the decision he believes he must now make.
"I feel like they are making me pick between my passion and what I love to do, make videos, entertain and be creative and my other passion playing football," said De La Haye, a kickoff specialist who appeared all 13 of the Knights games last season. "I've really got some decisions to make and not a lot of time to make those decisions."

TAIPEI, Taiwan--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 24, 2018--CyberLink Corp. (5203.TW), today announces the release of the CyberLink AI Style Plugin. The plugin works with CyberLink's award-winning video editing software, PowerDirector 16, using artificial intelligence and deep learning to recreate artistic styles from the world's most renowned artists, such as Van Gogh and Monet, and transform any original video into the artist's style by using the strokes and color tones of a specific work of art.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424005080/en/
(Graphic: Business Wire)
CyberLink's AI Style Plugin is the world's first video editing tool for PC that automatically transforms any footage into a live painting emulating the style of a famous artist. This unique solution runs locally on an edge computing environment and doesn't need a fast internet connection to a cloud-based server. The plugin runs locally on systems with nVidia graphic cards supporting CUDA 3.0 or newer versions (e.g., nVidia GTX 650/ GT 640M). The tool can process full-length videos and output up to 4K cinematic resolution.
“Through the power of artificial intelligence and deep learning, we have been able to train our AI engine to possess an almost human-like understanding of the artistic process,” said Dr. Jau Huang, CEO of CyberLink. “With the CyberLink AI Style Plugin we've leveraged this research to deliver a quality, cutting-edge product for our PowerDirector users, helping them expand their creative horizons to places that were once unimaginable.”
Recently, the film “ Loving Vincent ” became the first fully painted feature-length film. Its creators took a traditional approach to transferring Van Gogh's style to video, taking 125 full-time professionally trained oil painters to produce close to 65,000 original paintings over six years, which merged to make the film. The entire process came at a cost of $5.5 million. With CyberLink's AI Style Plugin and Style Packs, PowerDirector users can recreate the pioneering style found in “Loving Vincent” for a fraction of the cost, time and effort.
While regular video editing filters simply overlay a general style on top of a clip, CyberLink's AI Style Plugin uses deep learning to produce work that demonstrates a much greater understanding of the thought processes behind how the human artists create their masterpieces – right down to brush strokes and color tones. Signature works can be found in Style Packs dedicated to specific artists and artistic styles. The first release concentrates on 10 popular pieces each by Van Gogh and Impressionist painters Monet and Manet.
Availability The CyberLink AI Style Plugin is available today from the CyberLink Online Store with the purchase of either the Van Gogh or Impressionist AI Style Pack – Vol. 1 AI Style Packs.
Requirements The CyberLink AI Style Plugin is supported in PowerDirector 16 (requires the latest update), users can get the free update patch from CyberLink Software Update Center. The plugin runs on nVidia CUDA 3.0 graphic cards (e.g., GTX 650/ GT 640M or above), check CyberLink FAQ for detailed system requirements.

RB D'Andre Swift. While playing behind seniors Nick Chubb and Sony Michel, Swift was Georgia's third-leading rusher with 618 yards and fourth on the team with 17 catches (more than Chubb and Michel combined) for 153 yards. He led the team with 88 yards rushing and a touchdown in an SEC championship game win over Auburn.
KENUCKY
RB A.J. Rose. The Wildcats hope Rose can complement two-time, 1,000-yard rusher Benny Snell in the backfield next season. Rose, a redshirt sophomore, rushed just 15 times for 37 yards last season but showed big-play potential with 134 yards and three touchdowns in the spring game.
LSU
WR Justin Jefferson. The younger brother of former LSU QB Jordan Jefferson and DB Rickey Jefferson caught a 94-yard touchdown pass during the spring game and may have played himself into a bigger role next fall.
OLE MISS
LB Detric Bing-Dukes. Linebacker has been a big problem for Ole Miss the past few seasons and the Rebels are still searching for solutions. Coaches praised Bing-Dukes as a leader throughout the spring. The 6-foot-1, 254-pound senior had 24 tackles last season and will need to be much more productive next fall.
MISSISSIPPI ST
WR Austin Williams. The 6-foot-3, 205-pound Williams caught four passes for 61 yards and a touchdown during Mississippi State's spring game, capping off an impressive stretch of practices. The redshirt freshman could provide an immediate upgrade for the Bulldogs, who sometimes struggled to gain big chunks of yards through the air last season.
MISSOURI
WR Nate Brown. The senior has battled injuries since emerging as one of Missouri's top receiving threats as a sophomore during the 2015 season. However, the 6-foot-3, 210-pound Brown was healthy during the spring and showed the potential to become a top target for quarterback Drew Lock this fall.
SOUTH CAROLINA
RB Ty'son Williams. The North Carolina transfer debuted for South Carolina last fall, but often struggled to find running room. Still, he finished second on the team with 471 yards. The 6-foot Williams had a strong spring, an encouraging sign that he'll be able to improve on those numbers this fall.
TENNESSEE
DE Kyle Phillips. The former five-star recruit heads into his senior season with only three career sacks. Injuries limited him early in his career. He played all 12 games last season and made seven starts but had just 4 1/2 tackles for loss and two sacks. But there's reason to believe the son of Tennessee State athletic director Teresa Phillips could deliver a breakthrough in his final season of eligibility with Tennessee's switch to a 3-4 scheme under new coach and former Alabama defensive co-ordinator Jeremy Pruitt.
TEXAS A&M
TE Jace Sternberger. The junior college transfer had eight catches for 147 yards and two touchdowns in the spring game. That kind of production would be a welcome change for the Aggies, who didn't get much production from the tight end spot last year.
VANDBERBILT
RBs Ke'Shawn Vaughn and Jamauri Wakefield. The Commodores and coach Derek Mason have to replace the school's all-time leading rusher in Ralph Webb. Luckily, he has some intriguing candidates for the job at what might be the deepest area on the team. Vaughn sat out last season as a transfer from Illinois, while Wakefield now is a sophomore.

Atlanta attorney Mawuli Davis, one of several who have volunteered to represent Basil Eleby, tells me that one of the greatest challenges is the way their client “has been demonized, unfortunately, by the State”. Eleby is charged with setting the massive fire on March 30, 2017. It resulted in the collapse of a portion of I-85. Work continues to repair the bridge. Attorney Gary Spencer, also on the team representing Eleby says, “the fire did not start by one man”.
If convicted, Eleby faces 25 years in prison and a fine of $50,000. Critics believe that Eleby is a “scapegoat”. They believe that the state should share in the blame for the fire because of the materials that were stored underneath the bridge. The Georgia Department of Transportation says that spools of high-density polyethylene conduit were stored inside a fence under the bridge.
The team representing Eleby is asking anyone that knows anything surrounding the events of the fire and ultimate bridge collapse, to call 1-800-237-6872 or to log on to www.basileleby.org to report information. Eleby's arraignment is set for Tuesday morning in Fulton County court. Participants with The Community Coalition in Support of Basil Eleby are asking the community to attend the hearing in a show of support for Eleby.
Success at the 2017 Canadian Championship will definitely be relative for the St. Catharines Boxing Club.
With Daniel Ryan, 19, and younger brother Gerard, 16, about to make their third trip to nationals and cousin James Hughes, also 16, going to the Canadian championships for the first time, how could it not be a family affair?
Inexperience hurt Daniel Ryan in his first appearances at nationals three years ago. He finished one and out, losing his only fight after opening the competition with the bye.
“I didn't throw enough punches,” he said. “It was my first experience fighting three-minute rounds.”
The five-year club member fared much better on the return trip. After opening with a victory, the elder Ryan lost his second flight by a close, split decision that required a countback.
“I just could have pushed it a little more,” he said. “I might have moved on to the finals.”
This year he won all four of his fights at the Ontario championships, including two by knockouts, to once again clinch a berth to nationals in the 165-lb. Division.
“I feel pretty good about my chances in Quebec,” he said. “I felt really good, really untouchable at the provincials.”
“I was just getting ‘that feeling' back, and I think I can do that and do it again.”
The Jamie Janzen Plumbing and Heating employee attributed his success at the provincial qualifier to “finding a really good rhythm in my training.”
“I was in good shape,” he said. “Everything was going well. My warmup felt good, I felt good in the ring, I felt outside the ring.”
Daniel Ryan, who estimates that he was won “about two thirds” of his 53 fights, will be one of three boxers representing Ontario in the division in Quebec City.
Mississauga's Kingsley Alexander automatically qualified as the reigning national champion. Also going will be the bronze medallist at provincials.
Gerard Ryan has compiled a 43-10 record in six years with the St. Catharines club, and he is the most successful of the three local fighters who are going to nationals.
His goal of coming home with the gold medal in the youth 141-lb. Division only sounds immodest to people who don't know about his Canadian championship in 2015 and the silver medal he settled for last year.
He was able to skip the Ontario qualifier thanks to a top-two finish at last year's national championships, also held in Quebec City.
For Gerard Ryan, that sets the stage for bouts against boxers who might get a boost from the experience of recent fights at qualifiers in their respective provinces.
He concedes that could give his competition an advantage, “but I'll also be fresher.”
Hughes, a Grade 11 student at Saint Francis Catholic Secondary School, qualified to compete in the 152-lb. youth class at the event taking place April 24-30 in Quebec City despite losing his lone fight at provincials. While the decisive loss to Windsor's Hunter Lee in the Ontario final dropped Hughes' record to 14-3, the two-year club veteran nonetheless had his ticket to nationals punched on the strength of a second-place showing.
“Gold and silver go to nationals, I lost in the final,” said Hughes, who received a bye into the bout against Lee.
Though coming off a loss in his last fight, Hughes said he feels more confident heading into the Canadian championships than he did on the eve of provincials.
“Better than Ontarios, I've been training harder.”
In addition to focusing on developing his fighting style, Hughes devoted time in the gym between fights on cardio training.

Transcript for Comey: Trump called me to discuss Moscow trip mentioned in 'Steele dossier'
Well as feed publishes the entire. Steel dossier as you all had feared it would happen and that's when you get. Your first phone call from president yes that's right so the following week he as you said that the media publishing tire thing. And President Trump called me in my office at the FBI. And he was very upset about. The leak of this material. And wanted to express his concern about it and I explained to him that it wasn't. It wasn't government material and in prepared for private parties. FBI and paid for the FBI and commissioned it. And it was all over Washington. And as you remember sir as we told you the media has this and his close to reporting it so we shouldn't think of it as a leak of of classmen information wasn't classified. And it there wasn't government information. And any launched into. I didn't ask about. This is with the process but he launched into an explanation as to how. I should know that wasn't true. And that he remembered now talking to friends who have been Wear them. That he never stayed overnight at the hotel just change clothes there went to the miss universe pageant and this is true but this is what he said. And then went right back without staying overnight. And then he said another reason you know it's not true is on the German phone there's no way I'd let people PR each other around me. And that caught me so much by surprise actually let out an audible laugh. And 'cause it was just one of those I was startled by it. And in a river thinking well should I say. That desires to any activity sir doesn't require an overnight stay and given that it was allegedly the presidential suite. At the Ritz Carlton I would imagine you could be a safe distance from the activity always things are bounce around my head. But instead of saying it is just led me to think the world go crazy I'm the director of the FBI. And I'm standing in my window. Looking out on the dark in Pennsylvania Avenue.

And it's just never thinking. Everything's gone Matt. And then having finished his explanation which hadn't asked for he hung up and it went to find my chief of staff to tellem the world brokers. And in fact he did stay overnight in Moscow. I don't know but but again. Eight I don't know those facts but he told me he did not.

Herbie Mays is 3M proud, and it shows — in the 3M shirt he wears; in the 3M ring he earned after three decades at the company's plant in suburban Cincinnati; in the way he shows off a card from a 3M supervisor, praising Mays as "a GREAT employee."
But it's all nostalgia.
Mays' last day at 3M was in March. Bent on cutting costs and refocusing its portfolio, the company decided to close the plant that made bandages, knee braces and other health care supplies and move work to its plant in Mexico.
At 62, Mays is unemployed and wants to work, though on the face of it he has plenty of opportunities: Barely 10 miles from Mays' ranch-style brick home in this blue-collar city, GE Aviation has been expanding — and hiring.
In the state-of-the-art laboratory in a World War II-era building the size of 27 football fields, workers use breakthrough technology to build jet engines that run on less fuel at higher temperatures. Bright flashes flare out as GE workers run tests with a robotic arm that can withstand 2,000 degrees (1,090 Celsius).
The open jobs there are among 30,000 manufacturing positions available positions open across Ohio. But Mays, like many of Ohio's unemployed, lacks the in-demand skills.
"If you don't keep up with the times," he said, "you're out of luck."
This is the paradox of American manufacturing jobs in 2017. Donald Trump won the presidency in great measure because he pledged to stop American jobs and manufacturing from going overseas, winning Rust Belt votes from Mays and other blue-collar voters.
It's true that many jobs have gone overseas, to lower-wage workers.
But at the same time, American manufacturers have actually added nearly a million jobs in the past seven years. Labor statistics show nearly 390,000 such jobs open.
The problem? Many of these are not the same jobs that for decades sustained the working class. More and more factory jobs now demand education, technical know-how or specialized skills. And many of the workers set adrift from low-tech factories lack such qualifications.
Factories will need to fill 2 million jobs over the next decade, according to a forecast by Deloitte Consulting and the American Manufacturing Institute. Workers are needed to run, operate and troubleshoot computer-directed machinery, including robots, and to maintain complex websites
Last year, software developer was the second-most-common job advertised by manufacturing companies, behind only sales, according to data provided by Burning Glass Technologies, a company that analyzes labor market data.
Yet the United States for now remains a follower, not a leader, of the trend. Workers in many European and Asian countries are more likely to be working with robots than U.S. workers, studies show. In such countries as Japan and Denmark, robotics and advanced automation have created solid jobs while increasing efficiencies for manufacturers.
Trump continues to make promises about adding U.S. manufacturing jobs. In blue-collar Youngstown, Ohio, he talked about passing by big factories whose jobs "have left Ohio" on his way to a July 25 rally, then told people not to sell their homes because the jobs are "coming back. They're all coming back."
But Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican and a former U.S. trade representative, conceded in an interview: "We're not going to see the kind of manufacturing renaissance that we all want in this country unless we focus on skills training."
Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, in a visit to a Detroit factory in June, acknowledged the need to address the skills gap by developing advanced computing skills. And when Trump visited Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in June, he touted the value of training while doing.
"Apprenticeships teach striving Americans the skills they need to operate incredible machines," Trump said. "This is not the old days. This is new and computerized and complicated."
Of the 146 million jobs in the United States, only about 0.35 percent were filled by active apprentices in 2016. Filling millions of open jobs through apprenticeships would require a substantial increase in government resources. So far, the Trump administration has called for more funding but hasn't made any progress securing the funding from Congress.
Apprenticeships are much more common at some European companies, notably German firms. At Germany-based Stihl Inc.'s plant in Virginia Beach, Virginia, for example, A.J. Scherman is learning to be a "mechatronics technician." Mechatronic combines electrical and mechanical engineering as well as computer skills.
Stihl makes chain saws, leaf blowers and weed trimmers at the factory. Once he's completed his final year in Stihl's four-year apprenticeship program, Scherman will read diagnostic software on computer screens attached to each robot to repair and upgrade them. If necessary, he'll hook up a laptop to program changes.
Scherman, 37, is also earning a college degree as part of the apprenticeship. Thanks to financial aid from Stihl, he'll finish with zero debt.
Skip Johnson, Stihl's apprenticeship coordinator, said it's critically important to bring bright students into the plant, where they can see that the grime and dust they associate with factories are giving way to clean operations using futuristic technology.
"They just come in here, and they're wide-eyed," Johnson said.
U.S. manufacturing workers, excluding managers, make an average of $44,000 a year, according to government data. That's just 2.8 percent higher, adjusted for inflation, than a decade ago after years of shifting of jobs overseas or to nonunion states. And it compares with a much higher 8 percent gain for the labor force as a whole over the past decade.
But a typical mechatronics engineer with a four-year degree can earn $97,000 a year; a typical software developer makes just over $100,000.
Festo Didactic, the education arm of Germany-based Festo, last year launched two-year mechatronics apprenticeship programs in Ohio with Sinclair Community College, and is already expanding its U.S. apprenticeship offerings. At Festo's plant in Mason, workers monitor a robotic distribution system that self-adjusts its work flow to prevent backups.
"This kind of factory has nothing to do with the factory we knew in the 1960s or 1980 or even 2000," said Yannick Schilly, who heads global supply for Festo's North American business.
But there's not much demand locally these days for the kind of repetitive tasks done in those factories by workers such as Herbie Mays.
He acknowledged that there are "plenty of jobs out here.
"What you have to do is get training or education."

This is part of the first installment of Future of Work, an Associated Press series that will explore how workplaces across the U.S. and the world are being transformed by technology and global pressures. As more employers move, shrink or revamp their work sites, many employees are struggling to adapt. At the same time, workers with in-demand skills or knowledge are benefiting. Advanced training, education or know-how is becoming a required ticket to the 21st-century workplace.
OAKLAND, Calif. — Golden State forward Andre Iguodala will be out for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night as he recovers from a bone bruise in his left knee that cost him the final four games of the Western Conference finals.
The Warriors said Iguodala, who was injured in Game 3 against the Rockets on May 20, was evaluated Tuesday and is making progress but still has the bruise and inflammation of the nerve surrounding his knee. Coach Steve Kerr has said Iguodala wouldn't play until he can run without pain. He will be re-evaluated ahead of Sunday's Game 2.
Kevin Love's status for Cleveland remained unclear as he went through the concussion protocol after he was injured in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals against Boston. He wasn't scheduled to attend media day Wednesday at Oracle Arena, where the Warriors host the series opener.

A few years ago TiVo rolled out SkipMode for its DVRs that would allow viewers to jump past ads (on certain prime-time programs) with the press of a button. This year, for Super Bowl LII it's flipping the technology around with GameSkip that works favor of people who watch the game just to see all of those (incredibly expensive) advertisements. Sure, you can usually see the best ones on YouTube either before the game or immediately after they are, but for dedicated fans of everything except Eagles vs. Patriots, it could be an easy way to catch up.
NEW YORK — Serena Williams has launched a fashion collection soon after participating in her first major tennis tournament in 16 months, dressed in a black "warrior princess" catsuit, no less.
But don't look for her French Open outfit among the athleisure, office and evening clothes on her new namesake website , the only place her duds are available.
Following collaborations with HSN and Nike, Williams' "Serena" line includes an "S'' motif and comfortable price points.
The letter adorns bralettes and high briefs, along with a T-shirt with the name of her childhood home, Compton.
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Kelan Martin scored 26 points and Butler rolled past DePaul 80-57 on Saturday.
Martin, the second-leading scorer in the Big East, had 19 points in the first half when the Bulldogs (17-7, 7-4 Big East) took a 10-point lead with Martin hitting a 3-pointer to cap the first 20 minutes.
Martin added another 3-pointer to open the second half and the lead remained in double figures, reaching a high of 25 with 1:43 left on a 3-pointer by Campbell Donovan.
Paul Jorgensen had three of Butler's 10 3-pointers in scoring 13 points and Kamar Baldwin added 10 points for the Bulldogs, who have a four-game winning streak that started with a 79-67 win over the Blue Demons. Martin made 10 of his 11 free-throw attempts.
Marin Maric was the only DePaul (9-13, 2-8) player in double figures with 15.
DePaul committed 23 turnovers, 14 off steals, leading to 27 points.

FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - A California State University, Fresno professor who called Barbara Bush "an amazing racist" and cheered her death will not be punished, the president of the university announced Tuesday.
Randa Jarrar was acting as a private citizen using her personal Twitter account so her remarks didn't violate any California State University or campus policies, Fresno State President Joseph Castro wrote in announcing the results of a review.
"Her comments, although disgraceful, are protected free speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution," Castro wrote. "Our duty as Americans and educators is to promote a free exchange of diverse views, even if we disagree with them."
Jarrar has been on leave this semester and couldn't immediately be reached for comment. An email to her university address was not immediately returned.
The English professor provoked a storm of criticism last week with her tweets following the death of the former first lady.
"Barbara Bush was a generous and smart and amazing racist who, along with her husband, raised a war criminal," Jarrar wrote.
Jarrar also commented that she was "happy the witch is dead."
A Change.org petition to have her fired had garnered 50,000 online signatures as of Tuesday evening.
In response to critics, Jarrar said she was a tenured professor who could not be fired but Castro said the issue wasn't related to her job or tenure.
However, he also condemned her remarks.
"Professor Jarrar's conduct was insensitive, inappropriate and an embarrassment to the university," Castro wrote, adding: "On campus and whenever we are representing the university, I expect all of us to engage in respectful dialogue."
Jarrar grew up in Kuwait and Egypt and moved to the United States after the Gulf War, according to her university faculty page.
She describes herself in her Twitter messages as an Arab-American and a Muslim-American woman.

TORONTO — The Bank of Montreal joined its peers in delivering second-quarter profits that beat expectations as Canada's Big Five banks earned a collective $10.6 billion — up nearly 11 per cent from a year ago.
Canada's biggest banks also handily beat analyst estimates for adjusted profits, brushing off concern about the impact of a cooling real estate market amid tighter mortgage lending guidelines.
"The market is in various stages of worry about the outlook for the mortgage market in particular, but the results themselves seem to indicate that a lot of that worry is misplaced," said Meny Grauman, an analyst with Cormark Securities in Toronto.
BMO was the last of the biggest banks to report its earnings for three-month period ended April 30 on Wednesday.
Its second-quarter net profit of $1.25 billion was relatively flat compared with a year ago, but included a $192-million after-tax restructuring charge primarily related to severance costs. Canada's fourth-largest lender also raised its quarterly dividend to 96 cents per share, up three cents from 93 cents in its previous quarter.
BMO said it earned $2.20 per share on an adjusted basis for the quarter, up from $1.92 per share a year ago. Analysts on average had expected the bank to earn $2.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.
Like its rivals, BMO benefited from strong earnings on both sides of the border. Its Canadian banking arm saw net income rise 11 per cent to $590 million. And although home sales activity across the country in April hit a monthly low not seen in years, due to factors including a new stress test for uninsured mortgages as of Jan. 1 and higher interest rates, BMO's total Canadian residential mortgage portfolio grew by 2.2 per cent to $106.4 billion in the latest quarter.
"BMO's results this quarter demonstrate strong performance and momentum in our U.S. and Canadian (personal and commercial) banking and wealth businesses," said Darryl White, BMO's chief executive officer, in a statement.
The other Big Five banks generated strong earnings at home as well. TD's Canadian retail division net income was up 17 per cent compared with last year. RBC's Canadian personal and small business banking division reported a seven per cent increase in net income, while Scotiabank's domestic banking division saw a five per cent increase and CIBC's Canadian personal and small business banking division reported a 16 per cent increase in net income.
International growth was a bright spot for the Canadian lenders as well, and a big contributor to the $10.6 billion in net income attributable to shareholders amongst them during the quarter.
Tennis star Sania Mirza on Saturday opened about the possibility of her biopic and confirmed that she is in talks with a few filmmakers who want to make a film on her. However, she added that being a private person, she will take time to open up about herself and her life. When asked which Bollywood diva can portray her personality best on screen, she responded that there are so many amazing leading actresses in our country and most of them can do justice to her part.
Indian tennis star Sania Mirza says that being a private person herself, she will take time to open up about her life when a biopic will be made on her. “There are a lot of talks going on about it but there's nothing solid right now. But when there will be, being the private person that I am, it will take me some time to open up a little bit about myself and my life,” Sania told IANS when asked if she is comfortable watching her life journey on the big screen.
Director Rohit Shetty showed his interest on making a film on Sania on Karan Johar's chat show. Talking about it, the Padma Bhushan recipient said: “I've seen and heard a few people say that they would want to make the film but there's nothing concrete right now. We are in talks with them.” And who can portray her personality onscreen? “As far as who's going to play is concerned, I think that will depend on many factors so because there's so many amazing leading actresses in our country and I'm sure most of them can do justice and play the part really well so we'll just have to wait and watch,” said Sania, who is also the proud recipient of Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award.
There were many films made on sports personalities in the past and in present, the very recent is Amole Gupte's biopic on star Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal that features actress Shraddha Kapoor. Sania walked for designer Anushree Reddy on day four of Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) Summer/Resort 2018. The designer unveiled her bridal collection titled – Pink “The Navy Blue of India” at the fashion gala. Talking about how fashionably updated she is, Sania said: “Honestly, I don't understand fashion so much. I definitely like looking good and I've had a really good team around me and they've made my life really easy. I love dressing up and experimenting with fashion but like I said I don't really understand fashion so I'm very grateful to my sister who is one of my stylists and Ami Patel (her stylist) as well as the rest of my team for making me look good.”
Many consider her as one of the best dressed sports personality so does she enjoy such tags? “Well, thank you for the compliment. But I just dress how I feel comfortable,” said Sania. “For me that is the most important thing so that is what I try to do. Obviously dressing well is important but comfort for me is number one,” added the sports star. And does criticism bother her as a person? “Not necessarily always but at some level we are conscious about the fact that there's so many social media websites and there's so much said about what we wear every single day as celebrities so I do read it sometimes but don't always take them to heart both good or bad,” she said.
Islamic State media outlets are reporting that the son of the group's leader has been killed fighting Syrian government forces.
The announcement of the death of the young son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appeared on the group's social media accounts late Tuesday. It included a picture of a young boy carrying a rifle and identified him as Huthaifa al-Badri.
The statement did not specify when he was killed. It said he was an elite fighter who was killed while fighting Syrian and Russia troops at a power station in the central Homs province.
Al-Baghdadi has been reported killed or wounded on a number of occasions but is widely believed to still be alive. IS has been driven from nearly all the territory it once controlled in Syria and Iraq.
The week was in almost all respects the worst of all worlds for Mrs. May and the beleaguered Tories. As the pound sterling sank amid the political chaos and increasingly downbeat economic news, Mrs. May's desperate political weakness risked undermining her credibility as a negotiating partner.
“In the European Union they are looking at this in an incredulous way, wondering how they are managing to go so deep into chaos,” said Ulrike Franke, a policy fellow in Berlin for the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research institute, adding that Britain's political problems would be amusing if they were not so serious.
The continental news media, too, have noticed that the British government is falling apart. Germany's Bild newspaper described Mrs. May as a “laughingstock,” headlining another article: “Brexit-Lady gone by Christmas?”
The more cerebral Süddeutsche Zeitung noted that Mrs. May “was damaged and she will stay so until she fails, gives up or someone dares to come out of the wood,” adding: “This moment may come soon.”
Mrs. May had intended to use her party conference speech to relaunch her leadership after she gambled by calling an early general election in June, and lost both her parliamentary majority and her personal authority.
At the election Mrs. May asked voters to endorse her “strong and stable leadership” and — that slogan having turned speedily into a bad joke — on Friday she offered “calm” leadership as she insisted she was staying in Downing Street.
The mood in her party is anything but calm, however, and on Friday cabinet ministers moved to shore up the prime minister. Those doing so included the environment secretary, Michael Gove, whose track record for loyalty has been spotty to put it mildly. (Mr. Gove was described as a “political serial killer” last year after breaking first with the previous prime minister, David Cameron, a friend, and then with his pro-Brexit ally Boris Johnson.)

The cabinet is divided between those who want a clean break with the European Union — so-called hard Brexit — and those who hope for a softer departure to cushion the economy. When a consensus started to emerge from the cabinet, ahead of a speech last month by Mrs. May in Florence, Mr. Johnson, the foreign secretary, undermined it by outlining his own, more hard-line and upbeat vision of Brexit in a 4,000-word article.

Mrs. May's supporters believe that she can stay in power until March 2019, when Britain quits.
They point out that a leadership contest before then would risk reigniting a public fight over Europe, and would raise pressure to hold a general election, which the Conservatives might lose to a resurgent, left-wing opposition Labour Party.

It would also take weeks out of the tight timetable to negotiate Brexit, and the idea that those talks could be paused to allow the Conservatives to resolve their leadership crisis is dismissed by analysts, including Ms. Franke, who described it as neither legally nor politically plausible.
The Florence speech appeared to give some new momentum to the talks, but so volatile is the situation in London that continental Europeans are wondering how much longer they will be dealing with Mrs. May. Even if survives, they fear she may be unable to deliver on any agreement she strikes.
Joachim Fritz-Vannahme, director of the Europe program at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a research institute based in Germany, believes that the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is sitting back, waiting for the Conservative government to implode.
“Why should they start to shape some better progress in the negotiation, at a crucial moment, when you have May's leadership put into question, and the little blonde pirate buccaneering about?” asked Mr. Fritz-Vannahme, referring, colorfully, to Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Fritz-Vannahme believes that the focus of attention in Berlin is less on helping to broker a deal with Britain than on renewing Germany's ties with France. That is part of a larger push to stabilize the European Union after its own euro and immigration crises and following the shock of Brexit and the growing separatist problems in Catalonia.
In London, the problem for those plotting against Mrs. May is that, so far, they have neither the numbers to force a contest nor a credible alternative candidate. For some, the ideal scenario would be the coronation of a successor by party bigwigs, without a bloody leadership contest. But there is no obvious figure to crown.
Mr. Johnson, for one, would be unlikely to acquiesce in the appointment of a consensus candidate unless the candidate were him. And there seems little chance of that: The foreign secretary has long been unpopular with many of his colleagues in Parliament, and his recent behavior has only made matters worse.

Yet, all the time, the Conservative Party is taking a political battering, and keeping Mrs. May might not work either.
At some point soon, providing she stays in the job, she will have to decide what type of Brexit deal she will seek. But that, unless she is willing to risk significant short-term economic damage that a hard Brexit would almost certainly entail, will involve upsetting her most ardent Brexit supporters.
“Such an outcome will be difficult for hard-line Brexiteers to stomach and will inevitably provoke speculation that Johnson will resign,” wrote Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the risk consultancy Eurasia Group, in an analysis.
“May will also have trouble selling such a deal to about 60 Tory MPs,” he added, referring to Conservative members of Parliament, noting that confronted with a deal of that sort, they might deploy the nuclear option of “calling a vote of confidence in her premiership.”
The Latest on calls for California's public pension fund to stop investing in assault-weapon retailers (all times local):
12:25 p.m.
Critics of a push for the nation's largest public pension fund to divest from retailers of assault weapons are calling it an ineffective strategy and a political ploy.
California Treasurer John Chiang, a Democrat who is running for governor, has asked the California Public Employees' Retirement System board to stop investing in companies that sell assault weapons and devices like bump stocks. The board is taking public testimony Monday.
Jason Perez of the Corona Peace Officers Association says the board has a duty to maximize investments for its retiree members. The fund only has about 70 percent of the money needed to cover payments owed to its 1.8 million members.
Joe Morgan, a teacher, says that while he supports efforts to stop gun violence, divestment isn't the way to achieve it. He says "there's no purpose for this hearing other than politics."

The father of a 27-year-old woman who died in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, is calling on the nation's largest public pension fund to stop investing in companies that sell assault weapons.
Robert Velasco says action by California's public pension board can "send a powerful message" to lawmakers who have failed to act after mass shootings nationwide.
Velasco is one of several relatives of San Bernardino shooting victims who are testifying before the California Public Employees' Retirement System board. The pension fund says four of the five companies it invests in that sell guns have decided to stop selling assault weapons.
Renee Wetzel, whose husband died in the 2015 attack, is imploring the board to "use his memory to make a change."
Also testifying are California alumni of the Florida high school where 17 people were killed last month.

8 a.m.
California State Treasurer John Chiang is calling on the nation's largest public pension fund to stop investing in companies that sell assault-style weapons and devices that allow guns to fire more rapidly.
Chiang will speak Monday at a board meeting of the California Public Employees' Retirement System alongside family members of victims of the 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people.
The wife of a high school teacher who died in Parkland, Florida, sent a letter supporting Chiang's effort. Chiang, a Democrat, is running for governor.
CalPERS has a combined roughly $850 in a million holdings in five companies that sell such guns or devices: Dick's Sporting Goods, Walmart, Kroger, Big 5 Sporting Goods and Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings. The fund's total value is $354 billion.

Fox
A review of tonight's Brooklyn Nine-Nine two-parter coming up just as soon as I win you over with my use of “twas”…
“The Fugitive” will be the last we see of Brooklyn until sometime this spring — give or take a new series tanking so badly that Fox needs to replace it immediately — and while it's a bummer the show is going away right as it's in the midst of one of its funniest stretches ever, I'm glad it goes out on as a high a note as these two episodes.
And one of the smartest decisions made here was to treat these as two completely distinct episodes, only vaguely connected by the manhunt. It's not impossible to make a great hour-long sitcom episode, but it's a lot harder to have jokes continue for that long, and instead we get two wonderful, mostly standalone half-hours that play well together or apart.
“Part 1” is a bit of a throwback to the series' earliest days, when Jake and Amy were constantly competing for bragging rights as the squad's best detective. Those bets mostly went away when they started dating — and also as Jake and Holt warmed to each other enough that they could have a friendly rivalry of their own — but this episode was a satisfying return to that dynamic, with the added layer that this bet was about their relationship, and the question of where they would live now that they've decided to move in together. I hadn't realized just how much I missed this aspect of the show until they brought it back, and everything about the bet was a winner: every disgusting piece of information about Jake's grey towel (“Why won't it burn?” “Because it never fully dries!”), Boyle for once being in a position where he's happily working against his best friend, Jake being smug about all the toys he and Terry got from Homeland Security, and Amy's excitement at realizing Jake has read her Harry Potter books (followed by her understanding that Jake would make Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles references in a sewer). And while Jake doesn't always work well when the show tries to push him into a more emotional place (it's just not one of Andy Samberg's specialties), him ceding the contest to Amy because he wants her to be happy was a genuinely sweet moment (and leavened just enough by him acknowledging that her apartment is way better than his). Plus, it gave us the perfect double meaning of Holt's “I don't care” when Jake tries to rope him into his The Fugitive performance:
Share This Video Facebook Twitter EMAIL
Marshawn Lynch's self-mocking cameo was one of those ideas that I think works better in theory than in practice, even if I enjoyed hearing him say “pizzadilla,” but the rest of the stuff back at the precinct was also a delight, particularly Holt trying to communicate with the non-English-speaking witness as if he would to a baby — by, of course miming the tying of a half-Windsor. (“See how basic this knot is?”) All in all, “Part 1” was a nice example of giving the full ensemble something to do within the context of the same story.
“Part 2,” meanwhile, pivoted into being this year's Pontiac Bandit episode. While the show could easily coast on Samberg and Craig Robinson's chemistry and joy at being in each other's company, the story managed to find a smart twist by turning their usual duet into a trio involving Captain Holt, whose disdain for and mistrust of Doug Judy cast some necessary and amusing skepticism on the too-chummy friendship between cop and crook. Jake and Doug's theme song was, like Stentley's original tunes from a few weeks back, a strong reminder that Andy Samberg + fake songs = comedy gold. And where many of Andre Braugher's biggest laughs of late have come from Holt getting loud (“BOOOOOOOOONE!”), his pained “Why would you bring that up?” when Jake reminds Holt about the time his sister ended an email with “Thx” was a work of minimalist comic art.
Terry and Rosa's story was also technically a continuation of the fugitive story, but mainly a way for the show to address the contradiction that Terry Crews still looks the way he does but is pushing 50. Rosa's secretive gymnastics past is a bit too in line with her secretive ballet past and secretive yoga present to be a surprise, but you can't say it's out of character.
Amy and Gina trying to teach Boyle proper text chain etiquette, meanwhile, was wholly disconnected from the first half-hour (and could have been part of any episode where those three weren't otherwise occupied), and a good example of how Charles' enthusiasm can be such a turn-off at times. Plus, “Oh, it's just my former lover. Hello sister.” is a perfect line in and of itself, but the implication that he greets Gina like this all the time makes it even funnier. I'd be worried about that cliffhanger with Gina and the bus, except 1)This is a comedy that wouldn't kill her off that way, or at all; and 2)As we learned from Todd Mulcahy on Felicity, that kind of accident doesn't have to be fatal:
Again, I'm annoyed we're about to lose one of TV's best comedies for an undetermined period of time. But based on this recent batch, I have no worries about the show's creative health whenever, and wherever, it returns.

A Sunderland special school has scooped an award with an international flavour.
Barbara Priestman Academy has been awarded the British Council's prestigious International School Award in recognition of its work to bring the world into the classroom.
The International School Award celebrates the achievements of schools that provide exceptional learning opportunities in international education.
Fostering an international dimension in the curriculum is at the heart of the British Council's work with schools, so that young people gain the cultural understanding and skills they need for life and work in today's world.
Barbara Priestman's international work includes embedding an international dimension into their teaching and a whole school approach to global issues.
Staff and students at Barbara Priestman spend the summer term studying the chosen country for each year and then celebrate their learning with an International Day when the academy brings in specialist music, dance, art and cultural workshops.
This year, the focus was Japan and the International Day saw pupils taking part in drumming and music workshops, sushi workshops, sumi-e painting, Japanese Peking opera masks, storytelling, karate, learning language, and participating in a Japanese tea ceremony.
This was made possible with the help from the Oriental Museum Durham and Earthsong Music Workshops, London.
Carolyn Dunn, executive headteacher at the Wearside academy, said: “This award clearly recognizes the wonderful cultural work that staff and students are deeply engaged in.
“The international dimension helps our students to appreciate what it means to be British, whilst also developing an awareness and understanding of a range of other cultures, languages, religion and people.”
Sir Ciaran Devane, CEO of the British Council, said: “The school's fantastic international work has rightfully earned it this prestigious award.
“The International School Award is a great chance for schools to demonstrate the important work they're doing to bring the world into their classrooms.
“Embedding an international dimension in children's education ensures that they are truly global citizens and helps prepare them for successful lives and careers in an increasingly global economy.”

Unlucky Dawn Butler was tasked with explaining what Keir Starmer's proposals for “easy movement” of people means this afternoon, and she did not rule out it could entail unlimited number of EU migrants coming to the UK after Brexit. Speaking on the Daily Politics, the Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities seemed unsure what Labour's position on free movement would mean for migration:
“It means that… there has to be movement… well, that is something that he will then develop in terms of detail… we will need movement in people… we will need movement of people but it won't look exactly as it looks now…”
Butler went on to say: “we never talk about caps on numbers.” Asked whether Labour's proposals could mean an unlimited number of EU migrants coming to the UK, Butler said:
“I think to be honest that's part of the negotiations… if we were round the negotiating table we could come back with more detail”
Meanwhile, the Labour manifesto opposes continued free movement. “Easy” movement not quite so easy…
He said the Montreal heat exposure victims were between 50 and 80.
"None of the people we've identified in the last four days had air conditioning at home," Kaiser noted.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted condolences to the relatives of the Quebec victims.
No deaths have been reported in other provinces. In Ontario, a spokeswoman for the coroner's office said it couldn't confirm if there were any heat-related deaths, adding it could take weeks or several months to complete such probes.
Kaiser said one reason Quebec has been reporting so many deaths is because it's part of the province's extreme heat plan, where health officials work in tandem with first responders and emergency rooms to track down potential cases of heat-related illnesses and deaths.
"We go out to the paramedics, we go out to the hospitals and we ask them to make sure to identify any deaths they believe are related to heat and that allows us to intervene more quickly," Kaiser said.
He cited a case in recent days in which a death in a home for the elderly led authorities to move five other people deemed at risk to a facility equipped with air conditioning.
Police and firefighters also continued to go door to door in areas identified as having people considered at high risk: those with chronic illness or mental-health problems, those who live alone and people without air conditioning at home.
Also on Wednesday, the ambulance service that serves a large swath of the Montreal area called on people to refrain from calling unless it is a real emergency.
Urgences-sante said it has been inundated by the volume of calls — 1,200 calls per day in Montreal and nearby Laval over the past four days, which is 30 per cent more than usual on busy days.

LSU football fans ready to grab autographs and take pictures with their favorite Tiger players and coaches at the school's annual Fan Day will have to wait a little while.
Sports information director Michael Bonnette confirmed to WAFB-TV that the event has been moved to the spring, in conjunction with the Tigers' spring football game.
The reason for the move is facilities and logistics. Three of the building typically used to house Fan Day are currently being renovated in some capacity and are unavailable - the Carl Maddox field house, the Maravich Assembly Center and the LSU basketball practice facility.
LSU likewise believes having the event outdoors could be a potential disaster because of rain, especially with the unending downpours South Louisiana has experienced this summer.
Another issue is LSU has designated Sunday as the player's off day this camp. Per NCAA rules, players are not allowed to participate in any football related activities on their off days, which Fan Day would be. LSU also believes moving the event to the spring will bring some positives.
For one, the autograph and picture session won't be as rushed as it typically is in August, because there will be more time to work with. Second, former Tiger football greats and other LSU sports teams can also participate in the event, boosting the star power and fan experience.

Malaysian police arrested a Vietnamese woman suspected of involvement in the murder of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un's half-brother.
Doan Thi Huong, 28, was arrested on Wednesday morning at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 carrying a Vietnam travel document, according to a statement by Malaysian police Inspector General Khalid Bin Abu Bakar. The suspect was positively identified from closed-circuit television footage and was alone at the time, he said.
Earlier on Wednesday, a South Korean lawmaker said that two Asian women had approached Kim Jong Nam in the airport on Monday and later fled in a taxi. South Korean officials believe he was poisoned with either a needle or a spray, Lee Cheol-woo, chairman of the intelligence committee in South Korea's parliament, told reporters after meeting the nation's intelligence chief.
The murder has triggered questions about the stability of Kim's regime as he accelerates plans to build nuclear weapons that threaten the U.S., South Korea and Japan. South Korean analysts and government officials have speculated that Kim was behind the killing of his half-brother, a critic of his leadership who lived outside the country for years.
South Korea believes the deceased man was Kim Jong Nam based on closed-circuit television footage and the photo on his North Korean passport, Lee said. Malaysian authorities released a statement identifying him as Kim Chol, 46, who was born in Pyongyang.
Abdul Samah Mat, the police chief of Selangor state which takes in the airport, said earlier that an autopsy is underway at Kuala Lumpur Hospital. He declined to give further details.
Kim Jong Nam, the eldest son of former dictator Kim Jong Il, fell out of favor with his father after he was caught trying to enter Japan using a fake Dominican Republic passport in 2001, according to Japanese reporter Yoji Gomi, who wrote a book about him. Kim Jong Nam had been critical of Kim Jong-un, reportedly saying in 2012 that he “won't last long” because of his youth and inexperience. The two brothers have different mothers.
Kim Jong-un has had a “standing order” to kill Kim Jong Nam since he took power in 2011, Lee said. There was a previous attempt to kill him in 2012, according to Lee. He added that China had been protecting Kim Jong Nam, who has family members in Beijing and Macau, without saying how he knew that was the case.

The Islamic State group claimed responsibility Monday for the New Year's Eve mass shooting in a packed Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, an attack carried out by a lone gunman who remains at large.

The jihadist group made the claim in a statement on one of its Telegram channels, a method it has used to claim attacks in the past. There was no immediate comment from Turkish officials.

"In continuation of the blessed operations that Islamic State is conducting against the protector of the cross, Turkey, a heroic soldier of the caliphate struck one of the most famous nightclubs where the Christians celebrate their apostate holiday," the statement said.
Hurriyet and Karar newspaper cited unnamed security officials Monday as saying that authorities have determined that the gunman, who killed 39 people and is still at large, comes from a Central Asian nation and is believed to be either from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan.

Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said police have detained eight people in connection with the attack.
The agency said that the eight have been taken into custody by Istanbul anti-terrorism squads and they are being questioned at Istanbul's main police headquarters. The attacker is not among the eight.
Kyrgyzstan's Foreign Ministry says it is looking into media reports that the gunman could be from the Central Asian country.
"We have ordered the consul in Istanbul the check this report that has appeared in the press," ministry spokeswoman Aiymkan Kulukeyeva was quoted as saying Monday by the Interfax news agency. "According to preliminary information, this information is doubtful but we are checking all the same."
Foreigners accounted for 24, or nearly two-thirds of the attack's victims, Turkey's state-run news agency reported. Many were from the Middle East, including Jordan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, although countries from India to Belgium reported their citizens among the casualties. Among those killed was Israeli Leanne Nasser from Tira.

Police had also established similarities with the high-casualty attack at Ataturk Airport in June and was investigating whether the same ISIS cell carried out both attacks.
The gunman, who is still at large, killed a policeman and another man outside the Reina club in the early hours of 2017 before firing at people partying inside.
Only days ago, an online message from a pro-Islamic State group called for attacks by "lone wolves" on "celebrations, gatherings and clubs."

Giving Up? Broadcom Officially Drops Qualcomm Bid
Broadcom is officially withdrawing its $117 billion bid to buy U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm, two days after President Donald Trump blocked the Singapore company's ambitions over national security fears.
Wednesday's move is a formality since the presidential order issued Monday had ensured the deal would be killed in any U.S. regulatory review.
Broadcom Ltd. said Wednesday that it was disappointed with Trump's decision. The company withdrew its proposed candidates for Qualcomm's board, but still plans to move its headquarters to the United States. Broadcom had its headquarters in Irvine, California, until a Singapore-based company bought it in 2015. Qualcomm had rejected Broadcom's unsolicited offer in February before the government stepped in.
Broadcom's attempted takeover came as companies around the world are gearing up to build ultra-fast "5G" mobile networks that could tip the balance of power in technology. The technology is expected to provide speeds needed to fuel the "internet of things" like self-driving cars and connected home appliances.
5G remains in the early stages of development. Companies including Qualcomm and China's Huawei have been investing heavily to stake their claim in the underlying technology.
Broadcom's ambitions sparked U.S. government concerns over which country will dominate the technology, as well as fears over national security.
Earlier this month, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in U.S. companies, cited concerns about the proposed Broadcom-Qualcomm marriage.
If the bid had gone through, Broadcom's penchant for cutting costs such as research spending could have resulted in Qualcomm losing its leadership in telecom technologies, the committee warned.
In addition, lawmakers have expressed concerns in the past about foreign companies gaining a foothold in U.S. telecom infrastructure, which could lead to spying or cybertheft.
Broadcom and Qualcomm are likely to pursue other deals now that Broadcom's offer has been withdrawn. Qualcomm Inc., which is based in San Diego, is attempting to take over rival chipmaker NXP Semiconductors in a $43 billion deal announced in October 2016. Morningstar analyst Brian Colello expects Broadcom to hunt for more deals once it moves to the U.S.

SAN FRANCISCO — The Washington Nationals have put right-handed reliever Shawn Kelley on the 10-day disabled list Tuesday because of ulnar nerve irritation in his pitching elbow.
Kelley, who turns 34 on Thursday, has a history of elbow trouble and has twice come back from Tommy John surgery. He is scheduled to undergo an MRI test on his elbow when the Nationals return to Washington later this week.
"Same as yesterday," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. "Hopefully he gets better soon. He's sore but he feels better."
Kelley felt some irritation in his elbow shortly after relieving starter Gio Gonzalez during the sixth inning of Monday night's 4-2 loss to the Giants.

LAS VEGAS (AP) - Wynn Resorts has hired a law firm to help investigate sexual misconduct allegations against casino mogul Steve Wynn, the company's chairman and CEO.
A statement by Los Angeles-based law firm O'Melveny & Myers LLP says it will assist the Wynn board's special committee of independent directors with the inquiry.
The statement released Friday says investigators will set up a phone and web-based reporting line for current and former Wynn employees to provide information.
The Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 26 that a number of women said Wynn harassed or assaulted them and that one case led to a $7.5 million settlement.
The Las Vegas billionaire has vehemently denied the allegations, which he attributed to a campaign led by his ex-wife.
He also faces investigations by gambling regulators in two states.

NEW YORK (AP) — DeMarcus Cousins will make an early season trip back to Sacramento, while Gordon Hayward will wait almost all season to see Utah again.
Chris Paul's return to his old Clippers home is part of a Martin Luther King Jr. day tripleheader that includes another NBA Finals rematch, while Paul George and Jimmy Butler also learned the dates of their return games Monday when the NBA released its full 2017-18 schedule — which for the first time in history features no teams playing four games in five nights.
The league had unveiled its opening-week national TV games and its five-game Christmas schedule last week. Opening night is Oct. 17, the earliest the regular season has started in 37 years.
Cousins will then return to California's capital city to play for the first time since the Kings traded him to New Orleans last February when the Pelicans visit on Oct. 26 as part of a TNT doubleheader.
From there, it's another five months until Hayward plays in Salt Lake City for the first time since joining the Boston Celtics as a free agent in July. The Celtics visit the Jazz on March 28 for an ESPN game.
Other nights of note:
— George travels back to Indiana on Dec. 13 for the first time since the Pacers surprisingly dealt him to Oklahoma City.
— Butler, another All-Star who went East to West in the summer, takes the Timberwolves into Chicago on Feb. 9.
— The NBA's top two picks go head-to-head for the first time Nov. 15 when Markelle Fultz and Philadelphia visit Lonzo Ball and the Lakers.
— The All-Star Game is Feb. 18 in Los Angeles.
The Christmas schedule, as usual, is headlined by NBA Finals foes Golden State and Cleveland meeting for the first time since the Warriors' five-game victory in June. They will meet again on Jan. 15 on the Cavaliers' home floor.
Later that night, Paul's Houston Rockets play the Clippers at Staples Center for the first time since acquiring the point guard to play alongside James Harden in their backcourt. The opener of the TNT tripleheader features Memphis' return to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day schedule, hosting the Lakers.
The regular season ends April 11.

Samsung Unveils Windows-Based Virtual Reality Headset
Samsung is joining Microsoft's virtual-reality push, announcing an immersive headset that pairs with Windows computers.
The Korean electronics giant unveiled its Samsung HMD Odyssey [pictured here] at a Microsoft event in San Francisco on Tuesday. It will sell for $499.
The device joins Windows-based immersive headsets built by Lenovo, HP, Acer and Dell, and aimed for release later this year.
Microsoft is among the companies seeking a slice of the emerging market for modern head-mounted devices.
High-end headsets, like Facebook-owned Oculus' Rift and the HTC Vive, require powerful Windows PCs to run.
Others, including the Samsung Gear VR and Google's Daydream, are aimed at the wider audience of people who use smartphones.
Microsoft's vision, for now, is tied to the PC, and specifically new features in the Windows operating system designed to make it easier to build and display immersive environments.
The company also has its own hardware, but that hasn't been on display recently.
Microsoft's HoloLens was a trailblazer when it was unveiled in 2015. The headset, whose visor shows computer-generated images projected onto objects in the wearer's environment without obscuring the view of the real world completely, was subsequently offered for sale to developers and businesses.
But the $3,000 device, much costlier than mainstream VR headsets that sell for less than $1,000, has been limited to niche applications. Microsoft hasn't disclosed plans for a new version.
Microsoft also said on Tuesday that it had acquired AltspaceVR, a California virtual-reality software startup that was building social and communications tools until it ran into funding problems earlier this year.

Many of the worst effects of the tax bill President Trump signed in December could take years to emerge. But the damage to the federal tax credit program that finances nearly all affordable housing built in America is already painfully evident. Unless Congress rescues this crucial program, a quarter million fewer affordable units will be built over the next 10 years, deepening an already serious crisis.
The federal low-income housing tax credit, created in 1986, allows companies to reduce their tax liabilities by investing in housing for some of the nation's neediest families and individuals, many of them seniors, veterans and people with disabilities. The program has produced roughly three million rental units since its inception, but has fallen far short of the growing demand for affordable housing.
For example, a 2017 report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies shows that about 11 million families — or about a quarter of all renters in the United States — spend more than half of their incomes on housing. These families often have to choose between making rent and paying for essentials like food, child care and health care, and many are just one financial emergency away from eviction.

The pressure on low-income renters has worsened for other reasons as well. In recent years, higher-income people who once would have bought homes have turned to renting, driving up housing costs for poor and working-class families. The declining value of low-income housing tax credits will make all of this worse. It started last year, when President Trump and congressional Republicans made clear that they intended to dramatically lower the corporate tax rate, giving companies less reason to worry about tax liabilities.

The impact of lowering the corporate tax rate was especially evident in expensive housing markets like San Francisco. As The Times reported last month, city officials had to plug a financial hole left by the devaluation of tax credits, the decline of which has increased the costs of building affordable housing by about $50,000 per unit.
FREMONT, Calif. (AP) — When Moina Shaiq realized even her friends were scared to ask her about her religion for fear of offending her or sounding uneducated, she put an advertisement in a California newspaper: "Questions and answers about being Muslim."
The ad offered ideas for questions: Are women oppressed in Islam? What is the Islamic view of terrorism? How does Islam view other religions?
She set up shop at a coffee house in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Fremont, hoping for good attendance, but brought her laptop to do some work in case no one showed. To her surprise, about 100 people turned out that day last year, and her "Meet a Muslim" program was born.
"It was over overwhelming," said Shaiq, a mother of four and grandmother. "Fremont is so diverse, you will see women in hijab on the streets all the time. I didn't think people here would be interested or even need to know about Muslims."
Shaiq has since spoken about being Muslim and answered questions at dozens of libraries, pizza parlors and coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area. She recently expanded Meet a Muslim to churches, service clubs and private homes, and traveled to Arizona and Atlanta with the program.
She gives the talks once or twice a week on her own time and her own dime to break down stereotypes.
Similar programs emerged after 9/11, when many Muslims felt the need to engage with their fellow Americans to dispel negative perceptions of their faith. They've seen a resurgence with a recent uptick in anti-Muslim crimes.
Earlier this year, for instance, Muslim and former U.S. Marine Mansoor Shams traveled the country with a sign that read "I'm a Muslim and a U.S. Marine, Ask Me Anything." In Cambridge, Massachusetts, Mona Haydar and her husband set up a booth outside a library in 2015 with coffee, doughnuts and a sign that stated "Ask a Muslim." Other such events have taken place on U.S. college campuses.
Shaiq said she started her program to educate people about her faith and culture while addressing people's misconceptions and stereotypes.
She explains the importance of the hijab (head scarf) or niqab (face covering), the differences between Sunnis and Shias (the two main sects of Islam), the rights of women in Islam, and what it's like to be an American Muslim today.
At a recent Rotary club meeting in Fremont, a man asked how she thinks people can combat Muslim extremism.
"This is where you start," Shaiq said. "You understand what the faith is."
Recent anti-Muslim incidents across the U.S. include arson attacks, vandalism, harassment and school bullying. In May, authorities in Portland, Oregon, say a man killed two men and wounded a third after they tried to stop his anti-Muslim tirade.
Shaiq herself has faced threats at her events. One man in Atlanta warned he would "slit her throat" if she said something he didn't like. He listened to the discussion, never asked a question and then left.
"That was scary," Shaiq said.
Muslim leaders consider the incidents part of a deeply alarming trend that came to the forefront in last year's presidential election with far-right activists portraying Islam — and all Muslims — as a threat.
They see echoes of these far-right views in President Donald Trump's efforts to ban entry into the U.S. from six Muslim-majority countries and in his claims of dangers posed by immigrants and Muslim refugees. Trump has said his policies are critical for protecting national security.
Initiatives like Meet a Muslim are important at "this time of heightened fear and xenophobia," said Zainab Arain, who works to monitor and combat Islamophobia with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington, D.C.-based Muslim advocacy group. "An effective way to push back against that, especially at a local level, is to gather people and have them get to know one another."
Some American Muslims, however, have struggled to see the benefit of these efforts when they see community members having the same conversations they had almost 16 years ago.
"It's just not a good use of time. The likelihood of changing a bigot's mind is so low," said Asha Noor, a racial justice activist based in Detroit.
Instead, Noor and other critics say the focus should be on policy change.
For Shaiq, her program is about sharing a message of love, compassion and peace.
Attendance at her talks spikes following news events that include Muslims, and the discussion often gets spirited, even tense and angry.
"I want to proactively educate my fellow Americans that Muslims are humans just like they are," Shaiq said. "They have the same needs as anyone else."
“They know I like Mustangs and Fords, so they called me,” Shane Fowler said.
Fowler was ready to go on the hunt from that first call, but they made him wait three weeks while they cleaned around the Mustang, buried 25 miles away in a warehouse in the tiny town of Branch, Texas—Fowler describes it as, “no red light and one caution light.”
“I had a '77 Mustang Cobra II being painted and the painter called me and told me that friends of his, their dad had died. In cleaning out his warehouse they found an old Mustang.” While digging through “junk,” they also found a 1-ton truck. That's how cluttered the warehouse was.
When he arrived, Fowler found a 1968 Mustang fastback in pieces. The engine and automatic transmission were out of the vehicle, the fenders were laid to one side, and the seats were inside, but they were 1969 Mach 1 buckets. The fold-down rear seat was intact. Most of the parts were on shelves. Shane figured the remanufactured 390ci big-block on an engine stand came out of the Mustang. The fifth digit of the VIN was an X for the extremely rare 390 two-barrel, one of a mere 189 fastbacks built with this engine. (For the record, X-code production, unique to the 1968 model year, was 733, divided between 477 hardtops, 189 fastbacks, and 67 convertibles.)
“The two daughters were there and people were just coming in and out and going through everything and buying anything they wanted,” Fowler said.
The owner had lived in the back of the warehouse, which at one time had been a Corvette restoration shop. Fowler saw five to six Corvettes cut in pieces laying in the woods and inside “a ton of Corvette T-tops and parts, which the Corvette guys wiped out.”
Despite the two-barrel engine, this car shared the same model year (1968), body style (fastback), big-block (a 390), and color (Highland Green) of the famous Steve McQueen Bullitt movie car. Fowler's find had Styled Steel wheels, manual steering, manual drum brakes, and air conditioning, which he said was “a little different way to order a big-block.” In the trunk, Fowler found a space-saver spare, which he knew was not stock for a '68 model. He thought it was a regular 7.35 Mustang spare. He cleaned it up at home and found it was a 7.75, which is a Boss 429 spare—a real gem he sold to offset the price he paid for the car.
Fowler added, “We spent two days digging through parts. I'm sure the headlight buckets were there, but we could not find them. The rest of the parts were there.” The floorpans were rusty, as were the rear quarters and trunk floor, which Fowler says is typical for south Louisiana.
Shane figures this classic Mustang is best suited as a restomod project that would make a great Bullitt build, although the rarity of the X-code would also be very intriguing to return the '68 to stock. What do you all think he should do to the car?

BEIRUT (AP) — Donor nations are raising money for Syria's neighbors to aid in hosting refugees of the country's civil war.
But a leading international rights group and the U.N.'s refugee agency say Lebanese authorities are evicting refugees from towns and camps in the country on questionable legal grounds.
Three years ago, Ahmad Mohsin was forced to relocate his campsite in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley after soldiers raided the community of Syrian refugees where he lived and smashed their belongings.
The message was clear, he says — they were not wanted.
Though Syrian President Bashar Assad appears to have largely suppressed the revolt against him in many parts of neighboring Syria, the U.N. and rights groups say the country is still not safe for refugee return.
According to CNBC, Cupertino is attempting to replicate what it did for music: it wants to create sort of an iTunes for health that would serve as a centralized management system for all your medical info. Apple is reportedly already in talks with various hospitals and health IT industry groups to work out the best way to make its vision a reality. One of those groups is "The Argonaut Project," an initiative promoting the widespread adoption of open standards for health info, while the other is "The Carin Alliance," an organization that wants to give patients control over their own medical data.
It's unclear how far into the project Apple is at this point, but it sounds like the tech titan plans to store all your data on the cloud, since it has already started talking to cloud storage startups. If the company succeeds into making your full medical history available on the iPhone, it will solve what the medical industry calls "interoperability crisis." That's the lack of data-sharing between health providers that could lead to unnecessary mistakes and missed diagnoses that could be fatal for some patients.

More than 11,000 iiNet and Internode customers will be eligible for compensation after being sold NBN plans with unachievable maximum speeds.
The Australian Competition and Commission (ACCC) announced today that the TPG subsidiaries would compensate fibre to the node (FTTN) and fibre to the basement (FTTB) customers that had paid for speeds their lines were not capable of achieving.
Customers will be able to move to lower speed tiers plans and receive a refund or exit their plan and receive a refund.
In December, the ACCC announced that around 8000 TPG customers would be eligible for compensation.
Telstra in November revealed that it would compensate some 42,000 FTTN and FTTB customers. Optus last year pledged to compensate around 8700 NBN customers.
“iiNet and Internode have admitted that between 2015 and mid-2017, they both likely engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct or made false or misleading representations by promoting and offering NBN plans with maximum speeds that could not be delivered,” ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court said in a statement.
Almost two-thirds of iiNet customers with top-tier FTTN plans could not achieve the advertised 100/40Mbps speeds.
More than a third of Internode customers who paid for 100/40Mbps FTTN plans could not achieve the advertised speeds. The ACCC said that more than a quarter of those customers could not even achieve 50/20Mbps.

DALLAS (AP) - Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday called for schools to have more armed personnel and said they should put greater focus on spotting student mental health problems but he proposed only a few small restrictions on guns following a shooting at a high school near Houston that left 10 people dead.
The Republican and staunch gun-rights supporter released a 43-page report following three days of mostly closed-door meetings last week organized with school district officials, shooting survivors and groups on both sides of the gun-control debate, among others.
The recommendations are voluntary and some would require changes to state laws that would need approval from the Legislature, which doesn't come back into session until 2019. School districts wishing to make some of the changes could begin doing so, such as sending staff for free gun training this summer.
The lack of major gun control measures is not surprising in a state that embraces its gun-friendly reputation and has more than 1.2 million people licensed to carry handguns.
The only significant gun-related proposal was a possible "red flag" law, although Abbott gave it a tepid endorsement, asking leaders of the Legislature to "consider the merits." Eight states have red flag laws that allow family, law enforcement and others to file a petition to remove firearms from a potentially dangerous person. Florida, Vermont and Maryland passed such laws after the mass school shooting in Florida in February.
Abbott's report does not appear to depart much from the playbook of the powerful National Rifle Association following school shootings.
Alice Tripp, legislative director for the NRA-affiliated Texas State Rifle Association said Abbott's proposals wouldn't lead to weapons being seized without some protections for gun owners. "Gov. Abbott has pledged due process. He's a gun owner himself," Tripp said.
Abbott is proposing a change to the state law that says guns can't be accessible to children under 17, with exceptions such as hunting or parent supervision. He's encouraging the Legislature to consider making the law also apply to 17-year-olds. Authorities have charged a 17-year-old student, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, with capital murder in the May 18 attack at Santa Fe High School. Pagourtzis is accused of using a shotgun and .38 revolver that belonged to his father.
Abbott also wants a new law that would require gun owners to report a lost or stolen firearm within 10 days.
The report says the state will have access to nearly $70 million through federal funding and state grants for the proposals. The state also expects to compete for an additional $40 million from federal programs, and Abbott says he'll ask state lawmakers for a further $30 million.
"We all share a common bond: And that is we want action to prevent another shooting like what happened at Santa Fe High School," Abbott, who is campaigning for re-election, said during a news conference at Dallas school district headquarters.
Abbott's Democratic opponent for governor, Lupe Valdez, said it's "astounding" how few of the proposals directly address gun violence.
So far, the governor has not been enthusiastic about calls for a special legislative session on gun laws - a sharp contrast to the response in Florida following the February high school shooting there that killed 17 people. Florida lawmakers, who were already in session, passed a gun-control package three weeks later, thanks in part to a lobbying campaign led by student survivors of the attack.
In Texas, any attempts to create a mechanism to seize weapons is likely to be met with skepticism in a Republican-controlled Legislature that has expanded the rights of gun owners in recent years and made it easier and cheaper to be licensed to carry a handgun.
Also unlike the students in Florida, several students at Santa Fe High School have been vocal opponents of increased gun control, including some who were invited to meet with Abbott last week.
Kris Brown, the co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said: "The answer to preventing school shootings isn't some deep-seated secret. It's guns. It's the fact that it's frighteningly easy for dangerous people to get access to a gun, and this proposal does little to stop that."
Texas State Teachers Association President Noel Candelaria said he "strongly objects" to arming more teachers. "Teachers are trained to teach and to nuture, not double up as security guards," Candelaria said.
Abbott's recommendations include measures to "harden" campuses such as creating vestibules where doors must by remotely unlocked before visitors enter, installing metal detectors and having an alarm that would signal there's an active shooter.
Abbott is also recommending an expansion of a program that identifies students at risk of committing violence and provides help for them. He also wants to increase the number of people trained to identify signs of mental illness and increase awareness of a state system that allows people to report people who may be a threat and suspicious activity.

LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — Russian athletes disqualified from the Olympics for life in the Sochi doping scandal will have their appeal verdicts announced on Thursday.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport says it will announce the 39 decisions from the Pyeongchang Olympics at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT) in South Korea.
Some Russians hope to be cleared to compete despite Olympic entries closing last weekend.
The urgent verdicts could be given without the judging panels' detailed reasons being published.
Two CAS panels heard the appeal cases last week in Geneva. They took testimony from Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov and World Anti-Doping Agency investigator Richard McLaren, who did not attend in person.
An International Olympic Committee disciplinary panel disqualified all 39 from the Sochi Games and imposed life bans from the Olympics.

A burglar laughed as a court was told he licked his own faeces from a police cell window after defacing his cell.
Steven Crawford, 24, of no fixed abode, was arrested after he burgled a printing firm, PR2 Print, on Eldon Street, Plungington, Preston, on September 1.
Preston Magistrates' Court heard he stole a cash tin with £325 inside.
He admitted burglary, damaging a police cell, driving offences, and criminal damage to another business in Burnley.
Tracey Yates, prosecuting, said: “ PR2 Print manufactures ties and badges for schools, amongst other things.
“Manager Richard Styles says he received a call at 3.30am from an alarm company alerting him the alarm had been activated.
“He describes the small window into the first floor office had been smashed and money had been taken from a cash tin.
“A blood sample at the point of entry was linked to the defendant.”
The court heard at the police station Crawford, who has 51 convictions for 41 offences, defecated in a cup and smeared it over the wall and window before licking the window.
Defending, Sephton Lee said: “ He tells me he was very upset about his plight when he behaved in that way at the police station.
“Mr Crawford was released from Forest Bank prison in February this year's with a grant of £56. He couldn't claim benefits as he had no ID and lost his birth certificate.
“Since his release he's been basically living on the streets. He's been trapped in a vicious circle.
The court jailed him for 16 weeks and banned him from the road for 33 weeks.
He must pay a £115 surcharge.
James Patterson may have pulled inspiration from a very public disagreement he had with online retailer Amazon for his latest novel. In "The Store," written with Richard DiLallo, two married writers try to expose an online retailer that has taken control of many aspects of everyday life.
Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal talked to Patterson about his new book. They discussed its themes and resemblance to Amazon, a company that Patterson's publisher has fought with over e-book prices, and Patterson's next collaboration, with former President Bill Clinton. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.
Kai Ryssdal: Why this book now? I mean, I'd figure a guy who does books for a living would not be interested in maligning a big, fat bookstore.
James Patterson: I'm not maligning a big, fat bookstore. I'm maligning the idea of monopolies in the country. And in particular, I think it's a problem when it threatens publishing, because I think that books are really important in our lives, especially books that we can't live without. And I think right now the people that are best equipped to put out serious books are publishers. That may evolve over time, but right now publishers are pretty good at finding those books and paying to have them done and making sure that people are aware that they exist.
Ryssdal: I'm going to guess you're not worried about James Patterson, because you're doing fine, but you are a guy who could just get Jeff Bezos on the phone, right? And you could say, "Jeff, look."
Patterson: I don't know. I mean, I could.
Ryssdal: Oh come on, of course you could.
Patterson: He probably would read a letter if I sent one, I don't know. I mean, I don't. I met him once.
Ryssdal: Yeah. How'd it go?
Patterson: It was fine. I mean, what I said at that point was that the traffic at bookstores at that point was down about a third because a lot of people had gone over to e-books. And I said, "The problem with that is that a lot of these people have kids. They're not going into bookstores anymore, and their kids have not made the switch to e-books." And I said, "That's a problem, because there are a lot of households now where Mom or Dad used to go to the bookstore, bring the kids, so they were getting books to the kids." And I said that, you know, he was in a position to change that, even if it meant a lot more kids reading on e-books. And you know, he said at the time, "I'm on it." I don't know that I've seen evidence of that, but you know.
Ryssdal: Well, you and I have talked about this before, your interest in getting kids and people outside traditional sort of mainstream novel readers into books, right? We talked about bookshops, we talked about a bunch of other stuff you've done. Do you take any heart from the fact that Amazon now has actual brick-and-mortar stores in some places?
Patterson: Not particularly, no.
Ryssdal: Tough guy to please.
Patterson: No, it's kind of neutral. I mean that they are replacing independents and, well, Borders.
Ryssdal: Well, yeah.
Patterson: I don't think it's necessarily a big step, or a good step, but it might be. We'll see where it goes.
Ryssdal: Can't let you go without asking you about this thing you got going with Bill Clinton. You're working on a book with him, you said before we turned the microphones on.
Patterson: A novel.
Ryssdal: OK, a novel. Who called who? Did you call him or he called you?
Patterson: We have the same agent. I had met him before. We had a really great meeting, just shooting the breeze. And I think we got along pretty well, and our mutual agent, who is a lawyer in Washington, brought up the idea. And it really sounded exciting to both of us. And I mentioned the last time we were together, the president and I, it was in his place in Chappaqua. And we've had several of these three-, four-, five-hour work sessions, and about two hours in and for whatever reason, it just washed over me, and I'm going, "Damn, I'm sitting here talking to Bill Clinton!" And it's amazing, whether you're Republican or Democrat. And one of the interesting and important things for people to think about a little bit with respect to what's going on now in the world and how we demonize the left, demonize the right, depending on what side we're on. Clinton, now, he's really good friends with the Bushes, both of them, both Bushes. And they will go and they will do good things together. And I think a lot of people in this country, if we could get over this demonizing the other side, you know, let's get in there and once the elections are done, let's go in there and do stuff. There's a lot of stuff that needs to get done.

Sweet news for chocoholics, Nutella have announced the launch of a new chocolate, biscuit snack bar set to launch in stores this September.
Nutella's B-ready bar, which has all the delicious flavours of the popular hazelnut spread, will cost just 56p, and a £1.99 for a pack of six.
Created by Italian chocolate giants Pietro Ferrero, it's been described as Nutella topped with puffed wheat crispies, sealed in a crispy wafer shell.
And if it's market test is anything to go by it's set to be another top selling product for the Ferrero group.
Contains fewer than 120 calories
Levi Boorer, customer development director at Ferrero told talkingretail.com, “Nutella B-ready is a complementary addition to the Ferrero range, offering shoppers more ‘sweet snacking' solutions throughout the day.
“We see B-ready as the ideal mid-morning snack, containing fewer than 120 calories, while other products – like Kinder Bueno – are much more suited to post lunch snacking.
“Our initial UK trial has proved incredibly successful. We ranged at the till in a selection of convenience stores and Nutella B-ready ranked as the fourth best performing sweet snacking line during the period.
“We also found that merchandising the single serve product separately to the multi-pack drove incremental sales. We would recommend that the single serve features alongside popular confectionery lines like Kinder Bueno and the multipack format within the biscuits aisle.”
As the first light of dawn trickles in through the hospital window, 19-year-old Mohammed Ali learns that his two-year-old cousin has died of hunger. But he has to remain strong for his little brother Mohannad, who could be next.
He holds his brother's hand as the five-year-old struggles to breathe, his skin stretched tight over tiny ribs. "I have already lost a cousin to malnutrition today, I can't lose my little brother," he says.
They are among countless Yemenis who are struggling to feed themselves amid a grinding civil war that has pushed the Arab world's poorest nation to the brink of famine. The family lives in a mud hut in northern Yemen, territory controlled by Shiite Houthi rebels, who are at war with government forces and a Saudi-led and U.S.-backed coalition.
The coalition has been waging a fierce air campaign against the rebels since March 2015, trying unsuccessfully to dislodge them from the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country's north. A coalition blockade aimed at preventing the Houthis from re-arming has contributed to a 60-percent spike in food prices, according to an estimate used by international aid groups.
During the best of times, many Yemenis struggled to make ends meet. Now they can barely feed themselves.
Mohammed's father works seasonal farming jobs that pay only a few dollars a day. Mohammed dropped out of school after the war began and scrapes by on occasional construction and farming work. Before the war, they could afford to eat beef or chicken once a week, but now they are lucky to have some fish with lunch. Their diet mainly consists of bread, rice and tea.
Earlier this month, Mohammed and his brother made the hour-long journey, over a bumpy and unsafe road, to the nearest hospital, in the town of Abs. Mohannad's condition, which began with diarrhea, had been worsening for the past two years, but they couldn't afford treatment.
Some 2.2 million children suffer from malnutrition across Yemen, according to the U.N. children's agency, UNICEF. That includes 462,000 who, like Mohannad, are afflicted with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), which makes them especially vulnerable to otherwise preventable illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia.
UNICEF is supporting the treatment of 215,000 children suffering from SAM and has provided vitamin supplements to millions more, said Rajat Madhok, the agency's spokesman in Yemen. But "this lifesaving work remains hindered by the shortage of funding and limited access to areas caught in the fighting," he said.
The war has taken a heavy toll on the country's health facilities. A number of hospitals and clinics have been bombed, while others have had to close their doors because of the fighting. Less than a third of Yemen's 24 million people have access to health facilities, according to UNICEF, which says at least 1,000 Yemeni children die every week from preventable diseases.
Mohammed hopes his brother won't be next.
"I can see that my brother's condition is worsening day after day," he says. "There's nothing I can do."
TORONTO — Barrick Gold Corp. says it does not intend to continue to sell assets to reduce its debt, marking a shift in strategy for the Toronto-based miner.
Barrick chief financial officer Catherine Raw says given the progress it has made, it plans to instead use cash flow from operations and cash on hand to reduce its debt from US$6.4 billion to US$5 billion by the end of the year.
The gold miner had for several years been selling assets to reduce its hefty debt. The change in tactic was announced during its latest round of earnings and discussed on a call with analysts Tuesday.
The miner's first-quarter earnings beat expectations despite falling to US$158 million, down more than 75 per cent from the same period a year ago.

“This is a guy who has been able to bring time management efficiency to a whole other level,” Ghavami said. “When he was with the McGill Redmen, he would finish his hospital rotations and then sleep in the locker room to be on time for the next morning's practice because he had finished so late.”
Chiefs Coach Andy Reid has a personal connection to Duvernay-Tardif's pursuit of medicine — his mother was one of the first women to graduate from the McGill University Faculty of Medicine. When Reid first met Duvernay-Tardif, he immediately threw his support behind the lineman's goal of becoming a doctor.
“During the pre-draft interviews, Coach Reid was like, ‘This is awesome what you're trying to do, and I'm going to help you to the best of my ability,' ” Duvernay-Tardif said.
Two weeks ago, Reid and Duvernay-Tardif began talking about having “M.D.” on the back of his jersey, and an official request has been made with the league. His Chiefs teammates have even started soliciting his medical advice in the locker room, even though Duvernay-Tardif won't begin practicing medicine until his playing days are over.
“A lot of guys ask medical questions, which is funny,” he said. “They'll be like, ‘Hey I have a sore shoulder. What's going on?' ”
There was little time for Duvernay-Tardif to celebrate after his graduation ceremony. While many of his peers were out on the streets of Montreal toasting their hard-earned degrees, he was boarding a flight back to Kansas City. The Chiefs have O.T.A.s and Duvernay-Tardif had to get to practice.
But even though he has a list of accomplishments that includes being one of just a dozen N.F.L. players ever selected from Canada's university football ranks and signing a $41.25 million contract in 2017, it's clear that graduating from medical school is much more meaningful for Duvernay-Tardif than anything that happens on the field.
“This is the first time I've ever been really, really proud of myself,” he said. “This is the first time that I feel like I've made it.”
Mr. Hanley struck bargains with organized labor both when the city was facing deficits and when it was flush.
Under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and especially during the administration of Michael R. Bloomberg, he shifted the basis of contract talks from solely how much the city could afford to how employees could help the city save money.
As a result, Mr. Hanley negotiated major gains in productivity to help pay for wage hikes and other benefits.
He held the view that more could be accomplished at the bargaining table than through arbitration. In 2008, he struck a deal with the city's main police union despite lingering animosity between management and labor exacerbated by their 14 years of failure to reach an agreement through negotiations.
“He was an incredibly dedicated and respected public servant who knew every aspect of the city's bargaining history,” said Robert W. Linn, the current director of labor relations.

Mayor Edward I. Koch promoted Mr. Hanley to first deputy labor commissioner in 1988. He was chosen as commissioner by Mayor David N. Dinkins, reverted to deputy briefly under Mr. Giuliani and was promoted again in 1995. He retired in 2014.
James Francis Hanley was born on Aug. 25, 1948, in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan, to Irish immigrants. His father, Jeremiah, was a truck driver for the city. His mother was the former Eileen Linehan. His parents died when he was a teenager.

After graduating from St. Peter's Boys High School on Staten Island, he earned a bachelor's degree in economics from St. Peter's College (now St. Peter's University) in Jersey City.
During and after college he worked as an apprentice electrician on the World Trade Center and as a social studies teacher at a parochial school in Harlem while studying for a master's degree in labor economics at the New School. He joined the Office of Labor Relations in 1973 as a junior researcher.
In addition to his son Liam, he is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Giacona; two other sons, Matthew and Terence; four grandchildren; a sister, Maureen Gallagher; and a brother, Jeremiah. Another brother, the Rev. Fintan Hanley, died in 1989. Mr. Hanley lived in the Richmondtown section of Staten Island.
In 2002, wrestling with restrictive work rules inherited from the previously independent Board of Education, Mr. Hanley quietly intervened to facilitate a settlement after seven weeks between striking drivers and private school bus companies.
Over the years he won concessions from unions for lower salaries and benefits for newly hired workers, pledges to help find additional workplace savings, and a discounted subway and bus fare to encourage city employees to commute by mass transit.
Mr. Hanley, who stood an imposing 6-foot-5, was jocular and amiable but, when necessary, could be tough.
During contract negotiations with the teachers' union, he once recalled, Ms. Weingarten would call him before 7:30 every morning.
“She can see my office window from her apartment, and every day, the moment I walked in and turned on the light, a few minutes later the phone would ring,” Mr. Hanley told The New York Times in 2007. “It was as if she was waiting there for me.”
When protesting firefighters shouted, “Hanley must go; we want our money,” at his Staten Island home, he went outside to suggest a mantra with better cadence. The demonstrators took his advice and changed their chant to “Hanley must go; we want our dough.”
A motorcycle rider about the age of 30 was critically wounded after he collided with a vehicle standing on the side of the road on northbound Highway 4 at the Rishon LeZion Junction.
The Magen David Adom emergency service gave him medical treatment and evacuated him to Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer.

A soldier shot dead four members of his girlfriend's family in Banteay Meanchey province on Friday after her parents refused to allow him to marry their daughter, police said on Sunday.
Ngan Chantha, deputy provincial police chief, said police were hunting for Reth Reatrey, 28, stationed with the 5th Military Region unit in Svay Chek district's Slakram commune, who is currently on the run. Mr. Chantha did not know the soldier's rank.
Information posted to the National Police website on Saturday called the shootings “revenge” for Mr. Reatrey's marriage wishes being spurned by his girlfriend's family.
According to Mr. Chantha, the “angry” soldier entered the girlfriend's family home in Malai district's Thmei commune at about 3:15 a.m. and “started to shoot” people.
One man, Chuop Sangly, 30, died at the scene. Two women, Me Sovannrady, 32, and Sok Khanna, 55, died in the hospital, according to the National Police website.
A fourth victim, Im Sombol, was taken to a hospital in Thailand, according to the National Police website. Mr. Chantha on Sunday confirmed that Im Sombol had died earlier on Sunday.
The deputy police chief said that the four victims were all members of the family of Mr. Reatrey's girlfriend, but was not able to say how they were related. He was also unable to confirm the girlfriend's name.
Mr. Chantha said the soldier had been rejected by the girlfriend's family. Mr. Reatrey “loves…the daughter, yet the parents won't allow them to be together,” he said.
“We have identified [the suspect] and are looking to arrest him,” he added.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Federal prosecutors allege a Turkish businessman helped illegally route Wisconsin-made outboard engines and boat generators to the Iranian navy.
Forty-year-old Resit Tavan of Istanbul appeared in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee Monday. Tavan was arrested in Romania in June on an international warrant.
Tavan, his Turkish company and a manager there are accused of conspiring to defraud the U.S. and to smuggle American-made products to Iran.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports the indictment alleges they failed to obtain the special licenses needed to get around trade embargoes against Iran in place since 1995. Instead, the defendants allegedly negotiated the export of the engines and generators to Turkey, then re-exported them to Iran.
Tavan's attorney, Nejla Lane, told The Associated Press her client pleaded not guilty and will fight the charges.
@iamcardib #BodakYellow en vivo desde la carroza de La Mega en el Desfile Dominicano 🇩🇴. @majorworldespanol A post shared by Mega 97.9 FM (@mega979nyc) on Aug 13, 2017 at 11:50am PDT
Cardi B stays representing for the Bronx, New York, women in hip-hop, and her cultural roots, so it should come as no surprise that her hit single, “Bodak Yellow,” which is already blowing up internationally, with co-signs from A-List actors like Idris Elba, is getting an international remix of its own — this time in Spanish.
Cardi, who is Dominican and Trinidadian, debuted a Spanish language version of “Bodak Yellow” at the Dominican Day Parade in Manhattan, telling fans that the full version will be out later this week, tweeting, “Drops This Friday Aug 18 Everywhere. #waitonit.” According to Remezcla, the remix features fellow New York-raised Dominican rapper Messiah El Artista. Both artists were on the La Mega 97.9 float when the track was premiered at the parade.
“Bodak Yellow” is currently No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, the highest-charting single by an unaccompanied female rapper since 2014's “Anaconda.” It's no wonder Nicki stans are currently in Cardi's grill regarding her celebratory Instagram posts. As proven by her knockout performance at the BET Awards afterparty show, and her sudden appearance alongside every major rapper in the game, including Drake, the Atlantic-signed sparkplug is showing no signs of slowing down yet.
With the remix of “Bodak” dropping this week, it may just be time to brush up on your Spanish so you can sing along when this inevitably smashes the dance floor at your local Labor Day parties.
On last year's St. Patrick's Day, progressives of Irish ancestry organized the first “Irish Stand” rally at Riverside Church in New York City to protest the xenophobic and racist policies of the Trump administration. The rally represented an energizing shift in Irish American social consciousness back toward an original culture of resistance.
This year's Irish Stand is on March 16. It's a different sort of gathering than typically is held each year—the well-known raucous St. Patrick's Day parades and festivities that include traditional music and dance with the aim of honoring the more than 70 million people worldwide who claim Irish heritage, over 33 million of whom are U.S. residents.
The history of the Irish diaspora is often given short shrift, even among Irish Americans. I've received more than a few odd glances when bringing up the Irish experience of British colonialism on St. Patrick's Day.
The Irish endured centuries of British colonial rule, including land confiscation, the suppression and near eradication of their native language, second-class status imposed through the notorious Penal Laws, and forced migration. Irish historian Tim Pat Coogan contends that the Great Famine, which brought the largest wave of Irish immigrants to the United States, was more akin to genocide than a natural disaster. Between 1845 and 1855, an estimated 1 million Irish perished from starvation and disease, and more than a million others fled through emigration.
In telling the story of Irish America, one must grapple with 19th-century Irish Americans having embraced a white racial identity, as historian Noel Ignatiev notably does in his seminal text, How the Irish Became White. Like other critical whiteness studies scholars, including David Roediger, Ignatiev builds off W.E.B. Du Bois' assertion in Black Reconstruction that Irish Americans identified as white for the “public and psychological wage” it conferred them. In short, Irish Americans sought social advancement through America's white supremacist racial caste system.
Most recently, historian Van Gosse made the connection between Irish America and right-wing politics in his October Newsweek article, “Why Are All the Conservative Loudmouths Irish-American?” Gosse gives historical context to the link between Irish Americans and white supremacy: “From the 1790s on, various famous Irish exiles in America became ardent pro-slavery Democrats.”
What is it really to be Irish American and then to ethically celebrate Irish heritage?
With the election of Donald Trump, the sketch of Irish Americans as primary purveyors of racism and xenophobia, despite the widely documented oppression of their immigrant ancestors, has taken hold substantially. Ireland's Labour Party Sen. Aodhán Ó Ríordáin's impassioned speech rebuking the Irish government's cordial welcoming of the then-newly elected Donald Trump went viral in November 2016. In it, Ó Ríordáin expressed alarm regarding the considerable number of Irish Americans working alongside Trump.
“What we're really conscious of, and what I'm really conscious of, is that quite a number of Irish Americans surround Trump,” Ó Ríordáin said. “These are all people that in my judgment have completely forgotten their family history … We were once the people who came to America as refugees. We were viewed by the British as being terrorists. We were people who suffered sectarian discrimination in the United Kingdom and [in the U.S.], as well.”
Given the seemingly conflicting narratives of Irish America, what is it really to be Irish American and then to ethically celebrate Irish heritage?
It could appear that most Irish Americans have recently and mysteriously forgotten their own ancestral oppression. But the more complex reality is that Irish American identity and political consciousness have always been shaped by intersecting social forces, including colonialism, capitalism, religion, and racial formation, which have produced both cohesion and division.
It is true that the number of prominent Irish Americans espousing Trumpism and its core racist tenets does not signal a dramatic rupture within Irish American political history. What is not exactly true is that Irish Americans have somehow entirely lost sight of their ancestral oppression.
Case in point: Irish American and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, a self-professed Ayn Rand devotee, has been widely criticized for his advocacy of deep cuts to the social safety net. The New York Times columnist Timothy Egan argues in “Paul Ryan's Irish Amnesia” that “… you can't help noticing the deep historic irony that finds a Tea Party favorite and descendant of famine Irish using the same language that English Tories used to justify indifference to an epic tragedy.”
I urge Americans of Irish descent to deepen their understanding of the colonial and oppressive conditions that produced the Irish diaspora.
But there is no irony in Ryan. He is like many other “tough guy” Irish Americans, including Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity of Fox News fame, who perceive themselves as descendants of those Irish who overcame and strove despite the famine. Historical accuracy and human empathy have been supplanted by the most prized American mythology of all—rugged individualism. In Ryan's, O'Reilly's, and Hannity's minds, if they can “make it” despite their ancestors having faced historical discrimination, then it's your fault if you can't. They're not suffering from “Irish Amnesia” as much as “Irish Flattery” or “Irish Selfishness.”
In 2002, leftist activist Tom Hayden attempted to revise Irish America's reactionary, right-wing legacy by proposing an alternative history in his book, Irish on the Inside. Hayden recounts some of the most notable historical instances of Irish American resistance, including stories of the San Patricios and the Molly Maguires. As with most radical leftist history, these stories are often omitted from U.S. history curricula.
In sharp contrast to the dominant image of America's Irish, Edward Said, a Palestinian American intellectual and founder of the academic field of postcolonial studies, lauded Ireland for its “fabulous culture of resistance.”
“I am so grateful to Ireland,” he said in a June 1999 interview in Dublin four years before his death. “You have had many more years of imperialism than we [Palestinians] have had, and you have produced a fabulous culture of resistance and an extraordinary spirit, which I desperately hope we can measure up to by about 10 percent.”
Said's admiration of Irish resilience in response to centuries of British colonialism fills me with melancholy and distress when I consider the pervasive perception of contemporary Irish America.
I urge Americans of Irish descent to collectively revisit and deepen their understanding of the colonial and oppressive conditions that produced the Irish diaspora. I advocate for St. Patrick's Day to become a day of remembrance of Ireland and Irish America's intertwined historical experiences of oppression. Perhaps consider organizing an “Irish Stand” like the one in New York City, an occasion of resistance to colonial and oppressive systems across ethnicities, races, genders, and classes, rather than the typical event with green beer, corned beef and cabbage, and shamrock decorations.
And if you do, you can still have a pint.
An attorney says a Massachusetts judge should not lose his job for a relationship with a social worker that included sexual acts in his chambers.
Attorney David Hoose told the Supreme Judicial Court on Tuesday that Judge Thomas Estes has "sinned but has not sinned so severely that it should cost him his career."
Tammy Cagle has accused Estes of pressuring her into performing oral sex on him in his chambers and her home. Estes denies harassing Cagle and says the relationship was consensual.
Howard Neff is a executive director of the Commission on Judicial Conduct. He called Estes' behavior "egregious."
Neff told the court that an indefinite suspension would allow lawmakers to decide whether to remove Estes from the bench and restore public faith in the administration of justice.
The normally light-hearted mood at Train Car Cigar Bar will be taking on a more serious tone this weekend. Big Spring resident Timothy Underwood was recently given the devastating news that his kidney was failing. Underwood was rushed to the hospital after his wife found him unresponsive in their home. On Nov. 18, 2016, his doctor told him he'd have to start dialysis treatments immediately.
“When we found out about Timothy's kidney, I was working as a traveling trauma nurse,” said Timothy's wife Angela Underwood. “After the shock wore off and we gathered our thoughts, we made a plan for how to handle this. I made the difficult decision to quit my job and stay home to take care of Timothy full-time because our insurance didn't cover home healthcare and it made more financial sense for me to do this.”
Angela went on to explain how her husband is never sick and has never needed any surgeries in his past. The Underwood family was completely caught off guard by the unfortunate news they'd been given, and decided to reach out for help instead of suffering in silence.
The Underwoods contacted former Big Spring resident and event promoter, Barney Dodd, for a little guidance on how to organize a fundraiser.
“I own a promotion company based out of Abilene called BAD Events and I do business regularly in Big Spring,” said Dodd. “I first met them at a local band competition I promoted at The Train Car Cigar Bar and I noticed they were at my event every night. I appreciated that they were there supporting this event so I was happy to offer support in return.”
For the full story, please see Friday's paper.
The event will start at 1 PM ET on next Monday, August 21st, and features a live show called "CNN's Eclipse of the Century" starring astronaut Mark Kelly, along with CNN's Space and Science correspondent Rachel Crane. The really interesting part of this announcement, though, is the breadth of the broadcast. It will use multiple 4K, 360-degree cameras placed along the eclipse's path, from Oregon to South Carolina, allowing viewers to see multiple eclipse events virtually.
Viewers all around the world will be able to tune into this 4K event at CNN.com/eclipse and CNN's mobile apps. Additionally, the livestream will be available in VR with Samsung Gear VR powered by Oculus and Oculus Rift via Oculus Video. Finally, the entire thing will be streamed on CNN's Facebook page thanks to Facebook Live 360.
A year later, Smith is enjoying track and winning shot put and discus events, all the while hoping to reach the next rung of the ladder before she enters high school.
Qualifying for the Class A state meet in a throwing event would be quite an achievement for an eighth-grader, but it's one that Smith, her head coach Cathy Henkels, and her parents Jerome and Marcia Smith, say is par for the course.
“She's a hard worker,” Henkels said. “She has a lot of lofty goals, I think. And she's got a great coach (Erin Elder). He will get everything out of her that she's capable of doing. She's just a powerful girl. She will listen. When you tell her to do something for you, she goes out and does it.”
On Monday at an eight-team meet in Windom involving the host Eagles, Worthington, Heron Lake-Okabena, BOLD, Cedar Mountain/Comfrey, New Ulm, Redwood Valley and Wabasso, Smith's first event was the discus, and she performed very well, surpassing 111 feet.
Redwood Valley's Emma Gaffney, a senior, won the event with a throw of 117-10. Smith's toss placed her second, even though the mark exceeded the 103-4 and 106-4 throws she'd used to win other competitions already this season.
“I've been working for 110 for a while,” Smith said Monday. “I'll start working for 120, and if I get my technique down I'll be pretty close.”
Always striving to improve, Smith said she still isn't wide enough in the circle, and she's not low enough, either.
Her goal is to get to state in both the discus and shot put. In the latter event, she's hoping that by working on a “glide” approach rather than the “three-step,” she'll add more distance. Monday -- an absolutely perfect day for a track meet -- was the first time she'd planned to go the glide in an actual meet.
“I was in softball until last year, and my coach wanted me to try out for track,” said Smith, who admitted that before last year, “I didn't really know shot and discus are things.”
“Erin Elder convinced her to try track,” said her mother, Marcia. “If you're going to try something different, you might as well do it now. Her softball coach wasn't so happy, though. They tried to convince her she could do both.”
That's out. For now, anyway.
On Monday, Smith improved on her second-place finish in the discus, winning the shot put event with a throw of 37-0 while Gaffney finished second at 36-04.
Thuringer having a busy spring
In another section of the Windom track on Monday, Worthington junior Emma Thuringer stood in line for her turn in the girls long jump. It was a long line, almost like you'd expect the line to be outside a movie theater for a Star Wars premiere.
But Monday's meet was an all-comers affair, where all teams were encouraged to enter every varsity performer they wanted to get a look at.
“Today I don't mind (the line), ‘cuz it gives me time to catch my breath,” Thuringer said.
She was having a busy meet in a season of busy meets for her. She was entered in the 4 x 200-meter relay, the open 400 meters, the 4 by 400-meter relay and the long jump. A little bit before her wait in the long jump began, she placed second in the 400 (1:03.84). Prior to that, the 4 x 200 didn't go quite as well because the team's first and second runners fumbled the baton on an exchange and the foursome finished fifth. The Trojans' 4 by 400 team (Thuringer, Adamari Rangel, Madisyn Huisman and Sena Uli) placed second behind Redwood Valley at 4:34.51.
Thuringer is having a good start to the 2017 campaign. She's already achieved firsts this spring in the 400, the 200 and the long jump.
“I've won the 200 twice, so that's good. It's been competitive. It's nice to have some good competition. I'd like to get my 400 down a couple of seconds (her best times in the 400 were achieved when she was a freshman).”
Thuringer placed seventh in the long jump Monday (13-04.25).
Another Trojan, Obang Ojulu, won the boys 110-meter high hurdles Monday with a clocking of 16.49. He also took part in the winning boys 4 x 200 relay team (Eh Kyoo, Alex Baustian, Ojulu, Frank Rogers), which covered the distance in 1:36.14.
“I had a slow start,” Ojulu said about his hurdle race, “but once I got past the first two hurdles, it was all right. I was able to win. That was my first time running the four by two. We had a really good lead, so it was a lot of fun.”
Ojulu, like Thuringer, is a busy spring athlete. He also competes in the 300-meter hurdles, and on Monday he won that race in 42.42. He has goals this year of breaking the school record in the 300 held by GBrown Ochothow, and qualifying for state.
Two other WHS boys relay teams took firsts in Windom. The 4 x 100-meter team of Kyoo, Baustian, Cesar Barralaga and Rogers won in 46.62. The 4 by 400-meter team of Emmett Bicket, Stewart Merrigan, Chris Nelson and Nathan Schuck won in 3:42.72.
Nelson also won the 800-meter race in 2:13.00.
This means users will now have three choices when it comes to the Librem 5's operating system. It'll ship with free Software Foundation-endorsed PureOS by default, although KDE Plasma Mobile is also on offer. Todd Weaver, CEO of Purism, said that it makes sense to include community-developed Ubuntu in its open-platform offering. "While we develop, support, and recommend PureOS, allowing an alternative to users that is supported by Purism can only help the cause of improving digital rights for users."
A KIND-hearted mum has given something back to a hospital unit that helped save her baby daughter's life thanks to the support of her employers.
Proud mother-of-one Kayleigh Gray, from Buckshaw Village, prematurely gave birth to Emilia, at just 27 weeks on December 27, 2014 – three months before her due date.
Both me and Emilia wanted to give something back to the Neo Natal Unit
Weighing just 1lb 11oz, 5lbs under the average weight for a baby girl and smaller than a Samsung Galaxy Note mobile phone, Emilia was immediately rushed to Royal Preston Hospital where she underwent months of vital treatment and care.
Emilia has just had her second birthday and mum and baby popped into the unit, where Kayleigh, with a little help from her employers,Preston-based signage company Sign Build, gave something back.
Sign Build, on Red Scar Industrial Estate in Preston, has created 25 pairs of acrylic turtle doves, which were designed by graphic designer Kayleigh, to donate to the hospital unit.
“Both me and Emilia wanted to give something back to the Neo Natal Unit,” said Kayleigh, 26. “When I asked my boss Mark, owner of Sign Build, to help out, he didn't hesitate in saying yes.
“The idea of the turtle doves is to give something to the parents who are on the unit, one dove stays with the baby on the unit and the other are taken home. Parents are extremely sentimental during their time at the hospital and this way, although they may not always be on the unit, their son or daughter will always be with them.”
Sign Build owner Mark Cowin said: “The Neo Natal Unit is extremely close to Kayleigh's heart, and supports numerous families daily so we were proud to get involved and produce something so sentimental and support Kayleigh at the same time.”

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) - Uber suspended all of its self-driving testing Monday after what is believed to be the first fatal pedestrian crash involving the vehicles.
The testing has been going on for months in the Phoenix area, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto as automakers and technology companies compete to be the first with the technology.
Uber's testing was halted after police in a Phoenix suburb said one of its self-driving vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian overnight Sunday. The vehicle was in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel when a woman walking outside of a crosswalk was hit, Tempe police Sgt. Ronald Elcock said.
The woman, whose name hasn't been released, died of her injuries at a hospital.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed condolences on his Twitter account and said the company is working with local law enforcement on the investigation.
The federal government has voluntary guidelines for companies that want to test autonomous vehicles, leaving much of the regulation up to states.
The U.S. Department of Transportation is considering other voluntary guidelines that it says will help foster innovation. But Transportation Secretary Elaine Chaos also has said technology and automobile companies need to allay public fears of self-driving vehicles, citing a poll showing that 78 percent of people fear riding in autonomous vehicles
The number of states considering legislation related to autonomous vehicles gradually has increased each year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 2017 alone, 33 states introduced legislation.
California is among those that require manufacturers to report any incidents to the motor vehicle department during the autonomous vehicle testing phase. As of early March, the agency received 59 such reports.

MOSCOW (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Russia on Monday for talks focused on Syria, warning that Israel will not accept Iran's growing military presence there and in neighboring Lebanon.
Before departure for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Netanyahu said that Iran is trying to turn Lebanon into "one giant missile site, a site for precision missiles against the state of Israel, which we will not tolerate."
The Israeli leader also pointed at what he described as "Iran's relentless efforts to establish a military presence in Syria, which we strongly oppose and are also taking action against."
Russia and Iran have joined forces to back President Bashar Assad throughout the Syrian conflict. Russia has waged a military campaign in Syria since September 2015, helping Assad's forces score a series of victories and win back key ground.
At the same time, Russia has sought to maintain friendly ties with Israel, and the two countries' militaries have established close communications to avoid collisions in Syria.
Speaking in a video statement after his talks with Putin, Netanyahu hailed what he described as a "good and in-depth" meeting.
"I told him that Israel views with severity two developments," Netanyahu said. "One, the attempts by Iran to base itself militarily in Syria and the second, Iran's attempt to produce in Lebanon accurate weapons against the state of Israel. I made it clear to him that we will not agree to any of those developments and we will act accordingly."
Israel's chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, posted a rare op-ed on Sunday on several Arabic-language websites, warning Lebanon of Iran's entrenchment and saying Israel is "prepared for all the scenarios."
Putin and Netanyahu also jointly visited Moscow's Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center to see an exhibition about a 1943 uprising at the Nazis' Sobibor camp in occupied Poland. Netanyahu noted that the uprising was led by a Jewish Red Army officer and praised the heroism of the Red Army in defeating the Nazis.
The Russian president expressed his appreciation, saying that the Israeli attitude contrasts with the removal of monuments to Red Army heroes in some European nations.
Putin noted that Russia and Israel are "cooperating closely in resisting attempts to falsify history and revise the results of WWII, deny Holocaust and downplay a decisive role the Soviet Union played in defeating the Nazis."
"The main lesson from the rise of the Nazis and later the defeat of the Nazis is the need to stand up powerfully to murderous ideology in time," Netanyahu said. "That is our mission today as well."

Three people died and 19 others were injured when a Toyota Gaia collided head on with an Isuzu Como commuter omnibus along the Gweru-Zvishavane Road yesterday.
The accident occurred at around 9.15am at the 23,5km peg when the Shurugwi-bound Toyota Gaia, which had two people on board, collided head on with the Gweru-bound Isuzu Como commuter omnibus carrying 20 people.
Acting Midlands police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende said she was yet to get details of the accident.
“I will get hold of the responsible office and furnish you with the details,” she said.
A police source told our Midlands Bureau that on approaching the 23,5km peg, the driver of the Isuzu Como commuter omnibus owned by Mhangami Tours, trading as Zebra Transport, tried to overtake at a continuous line ahead of the oncoming Toyota Gaia.
The source said the driver of the Gaia swerved to the left and veered off the road to avoid the head-on, but the driver of the commuter omnibus lost control of the vehicle and also swerved in the same direction, resulting in the collision.
The commuter omnibus overturned and landed on its roof, while the Toyota Gaia also overturned and landed on its wheels.“Three people, one from the commuter omnibus and two from the Toyota Gaia died on the spot as a result of the collision,” said a police source.
“Seven people whose condition was stable were taken to Shurugwi District Hospital, while 12 others whose condition was reported to be serious were ferried to Gweru Provincial Hospital.”
Gweru Provincial Hospital Medical Superintendent Doctor Fabian Mashingaidze confirmed attending to the 12 accident victims.
A witness, Mr Dumisani Moyo, said the driver of the commuter omnibus was speeding. The Chronicle
The Wilson County native, former small business owner, husband and father of three announced his candidacy for the seat in early 2018, however, Davis said holding a public office has been a dream for much longer.
“I have always wanted to run for the office,” he said. “I've wanted for quite some time to serve my community and the register of deeds office would allow me to do just that.”
Davis said the register of deeds office holds public records for the county. He vowed that if he is elected, he would ensure the office is run smoothly and everyone is greeted with a smile.
Davis commended retiring Register of Deeds Bev Spickard, who has held the office for more than two decades.
“As someone who desires to help our community, the longevity of his public service is admirable,” Davis said.
Davis grew up in the Tuckers Crossroads community. He is the son of attorney Tim Davis and Freeman Foals owner Delaine Freeman Smith and the stepson of Chancellor C.K. Smith.
“My family has a lot of history here dating all the way back to 1799 when our ancestor, William McClain, helped found the county court system,” he said. “It seems we have all worked in the court system in some aspect.”
For the past two years, Davis said he's had the pleasure to serve as a deputy clerk in the clerk and masters office for Barbara Webb.
“The day-to-day activities of the office are filing legal documents for chancery and probate court,” he said. “A typical day in the office includes filing motions for attorneys, helping customers at the front desk and searching for documents in the archives.”
Davis is a graduate of Lebanon High School.
His mother, Delaine Davis, said he is not a stranger to hard work. Davis started a small business while he was still in high school.
“What started as mowing a few yards took off,” Davis said. “By the time I graduated, I was the owner of Davis Landscaping. We did landscape and grounds maintenance work for residential and commercial customers. I believe my experience operating a small business and working in the clerk and masters office gives me the tools to run an efficient office.”
The last few months have been busy for Davis. He hit the campaign trail – and became a father for the third time in May.
“My family has been a tremendous asset to me on the campaign trail. Everyone has pitched in to help and are doing everything they can to support me on this journey. My wife, Holly, has especially been helpful – even with it being very time consuming and us having three young children,” he said.
Children include daughter, Anna Grace, 8, son, Huck, 2, and newest addition, Hadley.
Despite the tremendous joy and support, Davis said he's also experienced a great loss.
His maternal grandfather, John Bryan Freeman, died in June. Freeman was a founding member and served on the board of directors for Wilson Bank & Trust for more than 31 years.
“My grandfather was a great influence on my life. I will surely miss him. He taught me many life lessons but specifically taught me to work hard and be kind to people,” Davis said.
Davis said he wants to carry on that type of legacy in Wilson County.
“I feel like everybody says this, but I enjoy serving the public,” he said. “Now is my chance to do that at a higher level – and help anyone who walks through that door.”
With Spickard, the current register of deeds, not seeking re-election, Davis and Jackie Murphy qualified to run for the office in the Aug. 2 Wilson County General Election. Early voting will be July 13-28.
The moment is quickly becoming lore from the making of Blade Runner 2049, the raved-about sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic: During a choreographed fight scene between Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, the latter clocked his younger co-star right in his unfairly good-looking movie-star face.
“I was acting pummeling, and in one particular moment, one brief moment, I accidentally punched him in the face, for which I immediately apologized, and have been apologizing ever since,” Ford told Yahoo Entertainment at the film's Los Angeles press day (watch above).
Gosling, however, disputed that notion: “By apologizing, you mean you pushed me out of the way and put your fist in the ice?” he asked Ford.
“Yeah, I apologized for that, too,” Ford shot back.
Director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Prisoners) confirmed that Ford landed “a big punch.” But the filmmaker found a silver lining. “It triggered a lot of jokes,” he said. “I said [to Ryan], ‘You know what, you can see it from another way. You just got punched by Indiana Jones. That's an honor.”
Has Gosling accepted Ford's apology? “If it ever happened, I would.”
Blade Runner 2049 opens Friday.

PARIS (AP) — A young American man tried an underhand serve while cramping during a five-setter at the French Open. Hmm. Seen that before, haven't we?
Except there was one key difference this time: For 21-year-old Jared Donaldson against No. 4-seed Grigor Dimitrov on Wednesday, unlike for 17-year-old — and eventual tournament champion — Michael Chang against Ivan Lendl in 1989, the unorthodox strategy didn't come in a victory.
Dimitrov came back to beat the 57th-ranked Donaldson 6-7 (2), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 10-8 in a second-round match that lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes on the new Court 18 at Roland Garros. The most memorable aspect was Donaldson's two unusual service motions; he won the point the first time, but not the other.
"I would never try it if I was feeling 100 percent and stuff," said Donaldson, who could barely move by the end because of painful cramps in his legs. "But obviously Grigor was playing so far back on the return that I felt like, 'You know, maybe it's just something that I'll try.' He obviously wasn't expecting it, you know what I mean? It's kind of a cheeky way to get a point."
Donaldson said he has never seen footage of what Chang did 29 years ago. He did, however, know of the episode: Chang used an underhand serve while cramping during a fourth-round win over Lendl on the way to the French Open title; he remains the youngest man to win a major singles championship.
Dimitrov was not angered by the tactic.
Quite the opposite, actually, shrugging his shoulders and conceding it was smart for Donaldson to try it.
"It was beautiful, right?" Dimitrov said. "He wanted to use something different to kind of try to put me off guard."
Before his first underhand attempt, Donaldson was actually two points from the victory, leading 6-5 in the fifth set and at love-30 on Dimitrov's serve. But Dimitrov took the next four points.
In the next game, at 6-all, 40-30, Donaldson successfully used the underhand motion. He hit a short serve that two-time Grand Slam semifinalist Dimitrov returned long to allow Donaldson to hold.
After Dimitrov broke to lead 8-7 and serve for the victory, Donaldson broke right back.
In the next game, though, Donaldson could barely stand, let alone run. He double-faulted. Then he tried his second underhand serve, dropping the point. Dimitrov hit a winner to break for a 9-8 lead, Donaldson slowly limped to the sideline for the changeover and, soon enough, it was over.
"It wasn't that I was tired or anything," Donaldson said. "It was just my leg muscles had reached their limit, basically."
After the final point, Dimitrov leaned forward while raising each knee to give it a kiss — thanking his own legs for carrying him to the win while Donaldson's gave way.
"I had quite a little bit left in the tank, so that was great," said Dimitrov, who equaled his best French Open showing by reaching the third round. "And I think it meant a lot to the whole team, but especially to my fitness guy. ... It's great to win a match in five sets. I think it stays with you. You keep it."

Replacement trains are on their way into service after three trains on the Metro system experienced faults.
Passengers using the network have been warned of wider impact on the timetable after two trains running between South Shields and St James have developed faults, while one on the line between Airport and South Hylton also has a fault.
A spokesman for the service said: "Apologies for any inconvenience whilst we get replacement trains in service from the depot.
"This will have a knock on effect as we will be using some peak service trains that usually run between Pelaw and Monkseaton and Regent Centre as the replacements, so trains will be busier on your journey to work this morning.
"Apologies and please leave plenty time for your journey."

Oprah Winfrey has no desire to ever be Mrs. Stedman Graham.
In the September issue of Vogue magazine, the 63-year-old star recalls the one time she and Stedman -- her boyfriend of 31 years -- discussed tying the knot. "Nobody believes it, but it's true. The only time I brought it up was when I said to Stedman, 'What would have happened if we had actually gotten married?' And the answer is: 'We wouldn't be together,'" she says. "We would not have stayed together, because marriage requires a different way of being in this world."

Winfrey further explains, "His interpretation of what it means to be a husband and what it would mean for me to be a wife would have been pretty traditional, and I would not have been able to fit into that."
Offering up one of her many Oprah-isms, she adds, "Live life on your own terms."

Winfrey notes that she lives a life of "absolute joyful contentment," which includes couture bathtubs. At her home in Telluride, Colorado, she has a tub that is molded to the shape of her body. "I major in bathtubs," she declares. "I spend my time looking for the best possible bathtub a woman can buy."
The tubs are so nice that even Graham, 66, hasn't been in all of them. "When I was in Chicago, he would ask for permission: 'Can I get in your tub?'" Winfrey quips. "And I would say, 'Mmmmmm. . . . OK.' "

Last September, Winfrey shut down a tabloid report that claimed that she was planning to marry Graham. "Six people who know me well have called today congratulating me or surprised they weren't invited to my wedding," she tweeted. "IT's NOT TRUE!!"
When speaking with TV showrunner Shonda Rhimes on a SuperSoul Sunday episode that aired in 2015, Winfrey revealed when she first realized she didn't want to get married. "The moment he asked me to marry him, I was like 'Oh, God! Now I actually have to get married?'" she recalled, adding that they agreed to postpone their wedding and then never spoke of it again. "But what I realized is, I don't want to be married."

Smoking is costing Sunderland more than £70million a year, new figures estimate today.
Data published in time for World No Tobacco Day by Action on Smoking Health calculates that smoking costs the North East a massive £613.8million a year, with our city losing £71.8million to the burden placed on healthcare, productivity, social care, house fires and littering all because of smoking.
Smoking figures for Sunderland.
The figures show the additional pressure that smoking is putting on hospitals and GP surgeries, with the NHS in Sunderland affected by £13million.
It is estimated that £46.2million is lost from the city's economy and social care for residents needing to be looked after due to smoking costs £9.4million.
Researches found that Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service attend on average 11 smoking-related house fires in Sunderland, which costs the £2.2million.
The report also discovered that tobacco expenditure costs Sunderland £28.9million, with the city's 40,266 smokers on average spending £2,050 a year on cigarettes.
Ailsa Rutter, director of Fresh, Smoke Free North East
Ailsa Rutter OBE, director of anti-smoking group Fresh, said: “We already know that smoking deprives people of many years of good health and robs families of years they could spend with loved ones.
“But these figures show the damage it does to communities, costing every individual, every family, every GP surgery, every council, business and hospital.
“It is also a major driver of poverty.
“We have seen the highest falls in smoking in England here in the North East and our local authorities deserve huge credit for working together to tackle this.
“However, smoking remains our largest cause of preventable death – the aim has to be to continue efforts to make smoking history for more children growing up here in the region.”
The Government's Tobacco Plan for England “Towards a Smokefree Generation” outlines the importance of the NHS supporting smokers using, visiting or working in the NHS to quit.
A 2016 audit by the British Thoracic Society found that more than one in four hospital patients were not asked if they smoke and 50% of frontline staff are not given routine smoking cessation training.
Given the enormous burden tobacco places on society, ASH and Fresh argue that the tobacco industry should be forced to pay to address the harm it causes in line with the ‘polluter pays' principle.
It is estimated that tobacco companies in the UK make a collective annual profit of around £1billion.
ASH and Fresh are now calling for the Government to place a levy on the tobacco industry with the money raised used to fund support for the recurring costs of tobacco control measures to reduce smoking prevalence, such as mass media campaigns, cessation services and local authority enforcement to prevent illicit trade and underage sales.
Earlier this week, the Echo reported how council leader Graeme Miller was backing plans to reduce smoking levels in Sunderland, citing the “enormous” costs to families and the city.
Although Sunderland's smoking rate has dropped from 24.6% in 2010 to 18% in 2016 – it's still higher than the 15.5% England average.
In a bid to meet a 5% Government target by 2025, the city council's health and wellbeing board agreed plans to tackle the “priority” issue last week.
Coun Miller, who sits as chairman of the board, said: “Tobacco and alcohol blight us.
“The cost to families and the city because of the cost of dealing with it is enormous.”
A council report said that the annual cost of smoking to Wearside could even be as high as £94.6million.
WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A space launch has been scrubbed from a remote launch site in New Zealand after an engine glitch caused engineers to abort the flight.
The command to abort Tuesday came two seconds after the engine of the Rocket Lab Electron rocket fired on its launch pad at Mahia Peninsula on North Island's east coast.
There was no immediate explanation for the launch attempt being called off, although mission control said the problem had been reported as the engine built toward liftoff.
In a tweet, Rocket Lab said the launch of the rocket nicknamed "'Still Testing' (was) scrubbed for the day while team reviews data. Updates on a new attempt to follow."
The 23-meter (75-foot) rocket had three satellites on board for Tuesday's launch, each about the size of a shoebox.
White House officials say President Donald Trump will allow a classified memo on the Russia investigation to be published.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Evgeni Malkin got his 12th career hat trick and Bryan Rust scored two goals as the surging Pittsburgh Penguins rallied for a 5-2 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Tuesday night.
Malkin's 24th goal of the season late in the second period tied it. His 25th early in the third gave Pittsburgh the lead for good and his 26th rolled into an empty net with just more than a minute remaining as the Penguins won for the eighth time in 10 games.
Matt Murray stopped 40 shots in his first start since the death of his father, James, this month.
Brent Burns and Logan Couture scored power-play goals for the Sharks but San Jose dropped its second straight game without Joe Thornton, who is out indefinitely with a right leg injury.
Martin Jones finished with 26 saves but also gave the puck away behind the San Jose net in the third period. Patric Hornqvist intercepted Jones' sloppy clearing attempt and fed it in front to a streaking Malkin, who had little trouble putting it into an open net 6:01 into the third.
Rust, hindered by injuries this season, doubled Pittsburgh's advantage 13:58 into the third thanks to a pretty between-the-legs drop pass from Tom Kuhnhackl before Malkin finished off Pittsburgh's sixth straight home victory.
The Penguins returned from the All-Star break looking to build off their best extended play of the season, which has lifted the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions out of a funk and back into the thick of the packed Metropolitan Division race.
It's a surge they've made largely without Murray, who took a leave of absence after his father died on Jan. 16. Casey DeSmith and Tristian Jarry filled in capably with Murray out, but the 23-year-old let coach Mike Sullivan know he was ready to go as his team began what it hopes is a push toward another long playoff run.
Murray certainly looked sharp in his first start since shutting out Boston on Jan. 7, keeping the Penguins in it as San Jose dominated play for long stretches.
Rust's first goal since Nov. 27 on a slick backhand that slid by Jones gave Pittsburgh the lead 11:09 into the first, but the Sharks used a pair of power-play goals in the second to surge ahead. Burns slipped a wrist shot from the point through traffic to tie it at the game's midway point and Couture pounded home a rebound 18:35 into the second to put San Jose in front.
With time winding down in the second, Phil Kessel went to the corner and fed a blind backhand pass to Malkin, who ripped it by Jones with just four seconds left to even the score and give the Penguins a serious boost.
NOTES: Penguins captain Sidney Crosby got an assist on Malkin's empty-netter to extend his point streak to 10 games. ... Malkin played in his 754th career game, passing Jean Provonost for fourth-most in franchise history. ... The Sharks scratched forward Jannik Hansen, C Daniel O'Regan and D Tim Heed. The Penguins scratched D Chad Ruhwedel, D Matt Hunwick and forward Ryan Reaves. ... Pittsburgh went 0 for 3 on the power play. The Sharks were 2 for 5 with the man advantage.

NEW YORK — Russell Westbrook has been fined $10,000 and assessed a postgame technical foul for initiating a confrontation with Utah Jazz centre Rudy Gobert on Monday.
The league made the announcement Tuesday.
The Oklahoma City Thunder guard came onto the court as a substitution following a stoppage with 7:55 remaining in the fourth quarter of a 113-96 Game 4 loss to the Jazz. He intervened in an incident between Gobert and Oklahoma City backup point guard Raymond Felton.
Westbrook committed four fouls in the first half and finished with five. He had 23 points and 14 rebounds, but had just three assists and made 7 of 18 shots.
Things are proceeding swimmingly. How is it possible to outline the biggest political corruption scandal in modern U.S. history; which utilized the full weight of the institutions of government and the vast intelligence community; against the predictable tide of a mainstream U.S. media apparatus who will shout ‘conspiracy theory'; while every single entity associated with the collaborative effort will protect the group behind the scandal?
There's the challenge. How do you introduce the scale and scope of corruption to almost half the country who have relied upon the false narrative delivered by fake news for the past two years?
Answer: You assemble a strategic communications team, timed to activate when a key series of events takes place. Joe diGenova is part of that strategic communications team. The triggering event is the OIG release. The purpose of the team is to help the news consumer digest the corruption elephant one bite at a time.
As each individual indictment is parsed and delivered, there will be tens-of-thousands of pages of evidence, multiple witness statements, and a tsunami of investigative supporting material that needs to be unpacked -per person- and understood against the backdrop of the bigger story.
Understanding the scale and scope is why CTH put together the video series to help grasp the larger issues; and that video series only highlights the FBI and DOJ part of the story. [fyi, that video series will air as a single 30 minute documentary as part of the toolbox].

All by careful design…
ITHACA, N.Y. – Months before northern vineyards burst into their lush summer peak, the delicate grape buds holding the fruit in its tiny core must first withstand the freezing onslaught of winter.
Understanding how grape buds respond to subzero temperatures is of paramount concern to vineyard managers in New York and other northern grape-producing states.
Horticulturists have long relied on traditional methods to study freezing in plants. Now a researcher in Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences is using new technology to explore the cellular mechanics that allow grape buds to survive brutal cold. The research has implications for vineyard economics, especially as climate change opens more northerly land for cultivation and current growing regions experience more extreme weather.
3D technology
Al Kovaleski, a doctoral student in the field of horticulture, is using the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) to create 3-D images of grape buds. The images produced at CHESS are providing a unique perspective as Kovaleski unravels the genetic underpinnings of supercooling in grape buds.
Supercooling is a dynamic process: Different parts within the bud freeze at different temperatures, and those levels and locations change based on the season. When seasonal temperatures plummet, the grape bud responds by expressing cold resistance genes as the cells marshal resources to survive.
“Regions within the bud have different behaviors related to cold resistance. We know there must be a genetic control of what's going on as the bud responds to freezing temperatures,” Kovaleski said. “By identifying which genes are expressed at various times in the seasons, we can isolate those that are most active when temperatures are coldest and pinpoint the genes responsible for supercooling.”
Visualizing supercooling
Plants that overwinter above ground have buds to protect the flower primordia and vegetative growing tips. The current understanding is that as ice forms in extracellular spaces, water leaves the cell until a point where no more can be lost for the cell to survive. At that point the supercooling process begins.
Now, Cornell researchers are teaming with physicists to visualize supercooling. Using the high-energy parallel X-ray beams produced at CHESS, Kovaleski is imaging grape buds by taking advantage of how X-rays scatter when passing through varying tissue densities within the bud.
The scattering gives rise to phase contrast images, from which Kovaleski constructs digital images that allow him to visualize how water shifts. When combined with genetic sequencing data, Kovaleski can create a robust portrait of how buds react at the coldest temperatures.
Big impact
The pursuit is not trivial. Winter freezes have been known to decimate grape crops, such as a cold blast in 2014 that wiped out around half of many wine-making varieties in New York, forcing growers to purchase grapes from outside the state. Subzero cold snaps routinely ravage vineyards across the Northeast, such as the “Christmas massacre” of 1980.
In the Finger Lakes region, deep lakes that typically remain unfrozen during winter help maintain temperatures slightly warmer on the slopes around the lakes, opening these areas for grape growing. But even these protected regions are prone to devastating freezes.
Next step
Deepening the scientific understanding of supercooling provides grape breeders with insights to select the best breeding lines.
“For a trait as complex as low-temperature survival, there is not likely to be a single gene that will impart cold tolerance to seedlings in the breeding program. But the more we understand the complexities of the genetic system, the better breeders will be able to improve cold tolerance,” said Bruce Reisch, research leader of the Cornell-Geneva Grapevine Breeding and Genetics Program.
“Al's work is bringing much needed clarity to this field of research, with potential applicability to a wide range of perennial crops.”
Broader application
According to Kovaleski, peaches and other fruit trees that supercool to survive winter could benefit from this fundamental science. If the same genes at work in buds also are active in green tissues, the genetic data might reduce the risk of spring frosts as well.
Uber Faces Major Fallout from Massive Hack, Alleged Cover-Up
Uber's admission that it took more than a year to disclose the theft of personal data from 57 million customers and drivers has now drawn two lawsuits and a federal probe.
Compounding the ride-hailing titan's woes are news reports that it paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the pilfered data, and that its new CEO knew about the breach for more than two months before revealing it to customers and drivers.
The hack and its fallout are just the latest problems to strike a firm that is already a target for harsh criticism about its management -- from claims it fostered a reckless, misogynist company culture that led to sexual harassment and bullying, to revelations about use of secret technology for evading authorities' oversight, to a trade-secrets lawsuit by Google self-driving spinoff Waymo, and an $8.9 million fine levied Nov. 20 by Colorado over drivers with serious criminal and driving-infraction records.
The beleaguered San Francisco company's latest personal-data trouble started in October 2016, when hackers broke into its systems and downloaded names, email addresses and cell phone numbers of 57 million Uber customers, along with names and driver's license numbers of some 600,000 U.S. Uber drivers, according to statements from the company.
Such information is commonly used for identity theft, which can result in criminals obtaining credit cards and loans in victims' names, or looting their bank accounts.
It wasn't until Tuesday that Uber, in a statement from CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, revealed the breach to customers, drivers and the public. And according to a new report, Khosrowshahi had learned of the hack two weeks after he took the reins of the company Sept. 5, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited unnamed people said to be familiar with the matter.
In his Tuesday statement disclosing the 2016 hack, Khosrowshahi said he had "recently" learned of it.
The breach, and Uber's response to it, drew two lawsuits soon after the company announced it had been hacked. Both suits seek class-action status.
On Tuesday, Alejandro Flores of Los Angeles launched a suit on behalf of himself and people who were Uber customers or drivers at the time of the breach. The legal action takes aim at the gap of more than a year between Uber's discovery of the hack and its public disclosure.
"Customers, and drivers had no chance to protect their identity and their information," said the suit filed in Central District of California U.S. District Court.
Flores also claims credit card and Social Security numbers were stolen, along with dates of birth. If true, that would put customers and drivers at increased risk of identity theft and fraud.
Khosrowshahi had said in his statement that the company's "outside forensic experts" found no indication that dates of birth, or credit card or Social Security numbers were taken.
Uber did not immediately respond to a question about whether those types of data were stolen, or to additional questions about the breach and the company's response. The lawyers representing Flores did not immediately respond to a request for information about the claims of stolen birth dates and credit card and Social Security numbers.
The other lawsuit, filed Wednesday by Danyelle Townsend and Ken Tew, highlights an allegation in a Nov. 21 Bloomberg report that Uber -- under previous CEO Travis Kalanick -- had paid the hackers to delete the stolen data and keep quiet about it.
"Rather than alerting regulators, law enforcement and victims of the Data Breach, Uber sought to conceal the Data Breach by paying the hackers $100,000 to destroy the stolen data and to promise to keep the Data Breach secret from the public and regulators," the suit filed in Northern California U.S. District Court said.
This legal action also includes claims about personal data beyond what Uber has admitted was stolen.
"Also potentially at risk are additional pieces of personally identifiable information generally available in Uber customer accounts including: location history, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth and other information," the suit claims.
Fallout from the hack goes beyond the courts. The Federal Trade Commission said it was "closely evaluating the serious issues raised" by the breach, Reuters reported Wednesday.
The huge hack is not the first data-security issue to put Uber into authorities' sights. In August, the FTC announced that it had reached a settlement with Uber after a hacker accessed names and driver's license numbers of more than 100,000 drivers in 2014. Uber had failed to take "reasonable, low-cost measures" to properly secure its database, the FTC said. In the settlement, Uber agreed to 20 years of independent audits to certify it had an effective privacy program.
That data breach also led to a settlement between Uber and New York's attorney general, which included a $20,000 fine for failing to provide drivers and authorities with timely notice of the hack.
The legal and regulatory problems come as Uber readies itself to go public in 2019, and negotiates with SoftBank over a multi-billion-dollar investment that would give the Japanese tech titan a 14 percent to 20 percent stake in Uber, which is valued at nearly $70 billion.
Although Uber waited until this week to publicly disclose the massive breach of customer and driver data, it told SoftBank about the hack about three weeks earlier, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Lincolnshire's deputy Police and Crime Commssioner has taken on a role in a national campaign fighting to prevent vulnerable people falling prey to scams.
Deputy PCC Stuart Tweedale has taken on a role in the Friends Against Scams campaign as one of only 45 SCAMbassadors across the UK.
Friends Against Scams aims to inspire action, highlight the scale of the problem, change the perceptions of why people fall victim to scams and make scams a local, regional and national topic.
The role of SCAMbassadors, is to use their influence to raise the profile of this problem amongst agencies and the local residents in a drive to prevent people falling victim.
Each year cons cause cost UK residents between £5bn and £10bn. In addition to the financial impact, scams can have a severe emotional and psychological impact on victims.
Mr Tweedale will be touring the East Linsdsey area with PCSO Nigel Wass and Principle Trading Standards Officer Emma Milligan on Tuesday August 22 to warn local communities about the dangers and methods of these tricksters.
“I am honoured to have been selected to take on this role. I have been passionate about tackling the dangers of scams for years and delighted I can now play a role in this campaign,” said Mr Tweedale.
“The people who are behind these cons are despicable. They deliberately prey on the most vulnerable in society and those that become victims are less able to cope with both the financial and emotional damage caused.
“It is a problem that we must stamp out and I will be doing everything in my power to inform people, influence agencies and support those tackling the issue to eradicate it from society.”
Louise Baxter, Team Manager, National Trading Standards Scams Team said: “The tactics used by scammers leave victims socially isolated and ashamed of telling their friends and families what's really going on behind closed doors.
“It is fantastic to have such an influential figure in the community to help us tackle this problem on a local, regional and national level and I would encourage all those that are interested in showing their support to join the campaign and be part of our growing SCAMbassador network.”
A murder trial jury was discharged today , Monday, after saying they could not agree on a verdict.
Keith Brady (30) of Cartron Estate, Sligo had pleaded not (NOT) guilty to murder but guilty to the manslaughter of 59-year-old Martin ‘Matt' Kivlehan at New Apartments, Holborn St, Sligo on August 2/3 2015. His plea was not accepted and he underwent a two-week trial at the Central Criminal Court. During the trial the jury heard that Mr Kivlehan died from two stab wounds to the neck.
Mr Brady accepted that he stabbed the deceased and caused his death and the six women and five men were asked to decide if that amounted to murder or manslaughter.
Shortly before 3pm today the jury foreman handed a note to Justice Paul McDermott to say they would not be able to reach a unanimous verdict. Justice McDermott told them they could return a verdict if ten of them agreed. Less than one hour later they returned and the foreman told the registrar that they had not reached a majority verdict and had written “disagreement” on the issue paper.
Justice McDermott thanked them for their service and exempted them from further service for 20 years. He remanded Mr Brady until next Monday December 4 “on the off-chance that there is an opportunity to deal with the matter.”
Evidence was unconvincing
Mr Brady told gardai he stabbed the deceased while “out of it” and his defence asked the jury to consider whether he was too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for murder and should therefore be convicted of manslaughter. The jury also had to consider whether Mr Brady was provoked by the deceased.
In statements made to gardai Mr Brady alleged that Mr Kivlehan had “touched up” his sister Janice. In one interview he said Janice was saying: “Stop touching me, stop touching me,” and that this was going on for a few minutes. He added: “I thought he was going to do something to her or something.”
In a later statement he said he remembered the deceased getting “grumpier” and his sister getting “loud”. He said he heard the deceased say something like: “I wouldn't touch Janice.” Then he stood up and stabbed Mr Kivlehan in a “freak moment” but couldn't remember where he got the knife.
Justice McDermott told the jury to consider whether it is reasonably possible that Mr Brady's account is true and then whether it is possible that this caused Mr Brady totally to lose his self control.
When considering the defence of provocation he said they should take into account Mr Brady's character, temperament and circumstances. If they found that it was possible that he was provoked, they should find him not guilty of murder, guilty of manslaughter.
If the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the intention to kill or cause serious injury and that he was not provoked, they were told to find him guilty of murder.

Hernàn Luis y Prado, a U.S. Navy officer with combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, was upset over what was happening to returning veterans.
“I saw many of my fellow service members feeling lost with no path to a successful civilian life. I needed to change that,” Prado explained.
So in 2008, he founded Workshops for Warriors (WFW). It is a state-licensed, board-governed, fully audited, 501 (c) (3) nonprofit school that provides quality training, accredited STEM educational programs, and opportunities to earn third-party nationally recognized credentials to enable veterans, transitioning service members, and other students to be successfully trained and placed in their chosen advanced manufacturing career field.
Each graduate, nearly 500 to date, earns third-party, nationally-recognized credentials accredited by the National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS), CNC Software Inc. (Mastercam), SolidWorks, Immerse2Learn, the National Coalition of Certification Centers (NC3), and the American Welding Society (AWS).
On Oct. 5 WFW announced that Stratasys, a provider of applied additive technology solutions, will donate 3D printing technology and services, which will become the centerpiece of the institution's new additive manufacturing STEM-accreditation and training.
At the core of this program is the Stratasys Fortus 450mc, an additive manufacturing solution. Fueled by Stratasys FDM technology, the offering is ideal for demands of high-requirement production – advancing speed, agility, and design freedom for accurate and repeatable 3D printed prototypes, manufacturing tools, and production parts.
“Today's manufacturing demands companies move faster and more efficiently than ever before,” said Rich Garrity, President of Americas, Stratasys. “Lean processes mandate reduction of both tooling costs and risks, as well as removal of design constraints typically hindering productivity. Additive technology is the engine that makes this all possible. We are honored to partner with Workshops for Warriors, empowering the skilled men and women of the military with the tools necessary to succeed in the thriving manufacturing sector.”
All Workshops for Warriors offerings are accredited STEM educational programs, always provided at no-cost through generous donations. The school currently receives no Federal, State, or local funding, and is expected to be eligible for GI Bill benefits in April 2019.
“In our region alone, more than 40,000 veterans transition out of military service each and every year. Unfortunately, many face significant challenges - including access to living-wage jobs. Our mission is to make significant, lasting improvements in the lives of veterans and their families – and job re-training is a key to this transformation,” said Hernàn Luis y Prado, Founder of Workshops for Warriors and a former US Navy Officer. “3D printing is required for accelerated careers in manufacturing, and Stratasys is the ideal partner to help us create these opportunities for students.”

WYOMING, Ohio (AP) — The father of an American college student who was imprisoned in North Korea and was returned to his home state of Ohio in a coma says the family is “adjusting to a different reality.”
Fred Warmbier told Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Wednesday that his son, Otto, was “terrorized and brutalized” during his 17-month detention and has been in a coma for more than a year.
“The day after he was sentenced, he went into a coma,” the father said in an interview scheduled to air Thursday night. He said he and his wife, Cindy, only learned of their son's condition last week.
The 22-year-old University of Virginia student was medically evacuated from North Korea and arrived in Cincinnati late Tuesday. He was then taken by ambulance to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. A hospital spokeswoman did not provide an update on his condition, but said his parents planned to hold a Thursday morning news conference.
Their public appearance will be at Wyoming High School, one of Ohio's top-rated schools. Warmbier graduated from there in 2013 as class salutatorian and had played soccer.
Residents of the northern Cincinnati suburb tied blue-and-white ribbons, the school colors, to trees near the family's home. Joy at his release was mixed with concern over his condition.
Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said there should be an investigation into what happened to Warmbier leading to this “tragic situation.”
Richardson, a Democrat, credited the Department of State with securing Warmbier's return from North Korea without any preconditions but said a forceful response from the U.S. government would be required “if its determined that there was a cover-up and Otto's condition was not disclosed and he didn't get proper treatment.”
City councilwoman Jenni McCauley said the tight-knit community was “thrilled” to have Warmbier back.
“Even though they're saddened by his condition, they're just glad for the family that he is home,” McCauley said. “For any parent, this is their worst nightmare. … We're hoping that he will be OK.”
Warmbier was serving a 15-year prison term with hard labor in North Korea after he tearfully confessed that he tried to steal a propaganda banner while visiting the country.
Such detentions in the totalitarian nation have added to tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. Three Americans remain in custody.
The U.S. government accuses North Korea of using such detainees as political pawns. North Korea accuses Washington and South Korea of sending spies to overthrow its government.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday that his department was continuing “to have discussions” with North Korea about the release of the other three imprisoned American citizens.
When asked by Fox News what he would tell the families of those detained, Fred Warmbier said, “I wouldn't know what to say to them. This is, I've been told, not precedented.”

Credit card debt is a familiar burden to Americans. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are carrying credit card debt or have had it in the past, according to a new NerdWallet survey. And that debt isn't cheap. Households that regularly carry credit card debt pay an average of about $1,300 a year in interest on that debt.
If you want to get out of debt fast -- and who wouldn't? -- you need to free up more money in your budget to put toward your balances. Basic personal finance advice calls for canceling (or shrinking) your cable package and brown-bagging your lunches to save money. Those kinds of small changes are definitely a good start. However, the most effective way to make room in your budget is to focus on major elements of that budget: income, housing, transportation, education and medical costs.
[See: What to Do If You've Fallen (Way) Behind on Your Credit Card Payments.]
1. Increase your income. To come up with more money to pay off debt, you can spend less or make more. A lot of the advice you see focuses only on the spending side, especially since many people doubt that they can squeeze more money out of their current job. But nothing says your day job is the only way to make more money.
If you're an hourly employee, put in for overtime, if possible. If you're salaried, pick up a second job on nights and weekends. Use your skills to make money on the side writing or designing, doing carpentry or odd jobs, house-sitting, pet-sitting or babysitting, tutoring or consulting -- the list goes on. Sell your crafts, if it's something people want. Or sell things taking up space in your home on Craigslist or eBay.
The point is that there are many ways to bring in extra cash to help pay off your credit card debt. Consider your skills and available time and brainstorm how to make extra money in a way that makes sense for you. After that, you can start thinking about how to cut costs.
[See: 12 Simple Ways to Raise Your Credit Score.]
2. Downsize your housing or get paid to host others. Housing is the largest expense in many budgets, and people tend to treat it as a fixed cost, or one that never changes. This doesn't necessarily have to be the case. If you're a renter, explore options for downsizing when your lease is up. If you're a homeowner, consider whether you have more house than you need, and whether your interest rate is higher than market rates. A sale, or even just a refinancing at a lower rate, could translate into hundreds in savings each month.
Another option: renting out a room in your house, either long term or through a short-term rental service like Airbnb. Check whether your city has any restrictions on room-sharing. It isn't a legal option everywhere.
3. Get where you're going cheaper. Vehicles have costs regardless of whether you're driving them, but it's significantly cheaper to drive your car less, so it's worth minimizing your drive time. Save on gas, insurance and maintenance by ditching your car entirely to walk, take public transportation or bike -- whatever is realistic for your lifestyle.
If you live in a large city where space comes at a premium and you don't have a vehicle, you may even be able to rent out your parking space, if your home has one. Again, check your area's restrictions.
4. Same education, lower costs. You can make schooling cheaper without lowering the quality of that education. If you, your spouse or a child is in school, look into scholarships and grants. It's a common assumption that scholarships are only for the best students, but there are plenty of need-based scholarships available, too. Look for scholarships online and ask your school's financial aid office about those offered directly by the school.
Each year, fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a form that determines whether you qualify for federal loans and grants and how much you qualify for. Federal student loans often have better terms than private loans, and grants don't have to be repaid. Meanwhile, some merit-based scholarships require that you have filled out the FAFSA, even if you weren't planning on applying for aid. Basic rule of thumb: Don't turn down free money. It doesn't come along that often.
[See: 12 Habits to Help You Take Control of Your Credit.]
5. Lower your medical costs without compromising your health. We don't recommend bargain shopping for medical care. However, if your employer offers a flexible spending account or health savings account option, you can put money away to pay for health care tax-free. Keep in mind, though, that while HSA money can be rolled over from one year to the next, FSA funds are typically "use it or lose it" each year. Also, both accounts have maximum contribution limits.

By BEN NUCKOLS
Associated Press
OXON HILL, Md. (AP) - This year's Scripps National Spelling Bee has drawn the largest number of competitors in its history, 516 spellers, but the field gets much smaller Wednesday with the announcement of the 50 or so spellers who will make Thursday's finals.
Among the competitors is 12-year-old Atman Balakrishnan, who has tough shoes to fill: His own father was the first Indian-American winner, back in 1985. Now a doctor in Hinsdale, Illinois, Balu Nataranjan recalls that he won by spelling the word "milieu," hardly tough enough for today's competition.
Nataranjan says spellers back then could win by memorizing about 10,000 words, but that won't cut it today: "Now the kids who win have to know somewhere between 40-and-80,000 words."
Atman, making his debut this year, hopes to equal his father's achievement. No pressure, though.
"He does help me and try to make me work harder, because he knows that I want this," Atman said. "If he knew that I did not want this, he would not push me."
As usual, most of the presumed favorites as the field is winnowed down are Indian-American. Eighteen of the past 22 champions have been Indian-American, including three years when there were co-champions.
Natarajan is on the board of the North South Foundation, a nonprofit that hosts national competitions in spelling and other subjects and has served as a training ground for nearly all the recent champions.
"It's become now kind of a good cycle where certain Indian-Americans succeed, and I think they've inspired others to do the same," Natarajan said. "I have no idea what my part is in that, if any."
Here are some other things to know about this year's contest:
HIGH-STAKES TEST
The bee began with a written spelling and vocabulary test. It's the biggest factor in determining the roughly 50 spellers who will advance to Thursday's finals, and the consensus was that it was very difficult.
The field of spellers expanded by more than 200 this year because Scripps started a wild-card program to give opportunities to more kids from highly competitive regions. As a result, Scripps had to craft a test that would separate the most skilled and prepared spellers.
"They made it hard on purpose," said Jacob Williamson, a former speller and a student at Georgetown University who is coaching five spellers this year.
The moments after the test are among the most nerve-wracking for spellers, who spill out into the halls outside the bee stage and frantically Google the answers.
"The vocab was kinda hard this year," said 11-year-old Ashrita Gandhari, who made last year's finals. "It was definitely harder than last year."
Even some of the most accomplished spellers said they missed a few of the vocabulary words, but they were still reasonably confident they'd get through to the finals.
"It was fine, actually. I didn't expect it to be fine," said 13-year-old Erin Howard of Huntsville, Alabama, who finished seventh last year. "I think at worst I missed five."
OOPS
Longtime bee pronouncer Jacques Bailly, revered by spellers for his gentle manner and meticulous accuracy, had a rare slip-up.
Thirteen-year-old Tara Singh of Louisville, Kentucky, got "Diplodocus" - a massive, herbivorous dinosaur - and when she asked Bailly for the language of origin, he said, "dioecious is made up of Greek elements," using the word that the previous speller had missed.
"Um, what was my word?" Tara asked.
QUESTION TIME
Spellers know what questions they can ask Bailly and expect to get useful information in response. That doesn't stop some from trying to get more.
"Can you, like, repeat it slowly?" asked Annie Huang of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, when she got "menehune," a Hawaiian-derived word for mythological, forest-dwelling dwarves.
"Is there, like, a root word or something?" she asked, only to be reminded that spellers have to ask for a specific root and define it to receive that information.
Annie gave it one more shot before she misspelled the word.
"Is the spelling, like, counterintuitive in any way?"
"That depends on your intuition," Bailly replied.

As it happens, far from a crusty don, Forsyth isn't much over 40, according to his bio, and is best known in Britain as a witty etymologist. Another pertinent detail we learn on Page 1 is that the author is — unsurprisingly — not averse to a tipple. In fact, the good folks at A.A. will be apoplectic over this book, which suggests that heavy drinking is a basic human need, providing us with relief from the burdens of civilized society and even, for many cultures in history, a glimpse of the divine. Forget the ruined relationships, the disintegrated livers and the car (or horse-riding) accidents.
Image
This cheerful acceptance of the bottle may strike more abstemious American readers as another very “British” element. Unlike the hand-wringing that has shadowed the drinking life in the United States, the Brits still tend to have an indulgent attitude to bingeing. This, Forsyth explains, makes them one of history's “wet cultures,” in such good company as the Vikings, as opposed to the “dry cultures,” whose mildly buzzed denizens drink in “Continental” style, sipping for hour after hour, but in moderation. (Full disclosure: I was raised in Australia, a land so wet it's practically drowning. Down Under gets its very own chapter on its liquor-addled origins as a penal colony, when rum was currency and even inspired a military coup, the Rum Rebellion. It gives one a patriotic glow!)
This refreshingly guilt-free account of getting sloshed through the ages is a gift to the chalkboard-writers of dive bars the world over, laced as it is with inspirational quotes about the joys of a snifter. We have the Roman poet Horace writing that “Flowing wine makes verses flow,/And liberates the poor and low” and Benjamin Franklin famously declaring that wine is “proof that God loves us, and loves to see us happy.” The alcohol lobby would love an Ethiopian proverb that recurs like a mantra: “When there is no beer, there is no work,” although the Sumerians were blunter: “Not to know beer is not normal.”
In the best pop-history tradition, Forsyth also guides us on step-by-step tours of the legendary drinking joints of the past. We learn how to behave in the rowdy taverns of ancient Ur (“the perfect place for the craft-ale snob”) and at a Greek Symposium, where the wine poured from the krater bowl was closely regulated by the host, although with mixed success. (The guests might end up running deliriously through the streets, shouting and causing mayhem, in a komos.) We visit a medieval English alehouse and discover that our image is largely culled from romantic novels and cheesy Robin Hood films. Fans of “Westworld” will be distressed to learn, however, that Old West saloons had no swinging batwing doors, while the working girls usually provided nothing saucier than conversation.
It's a hectic itinerary. The pub crawl can get a little exhausting, and the reader can get bloated on the relentless whimsy. Some will prefer to dip into chapters at random, jumping from the Old Testament Bible to Ivan the Terrible. But there is always some serious history slipped in with the joking. Almost every human society, Forsyth shows, has created an elaborate web of rules around drinking and drunkenness. Even Attila the Hun had strict protocol at his feasts, with guests toasting one another in order of rank. And those taboos and rituals reveal a great deal about the broader culture.

Cinemas are set to open in Saudi Arabia in March 2018 for the first time since they were banned in in the early 1980s, according to the Saudi minister of culture.

"It's a beautiful day in Saudi Arabia!" tweeted Haifaa al-Mansour the first female Saudi director of a feature film, the acclaimed "Wadjda".
This is the second major social reform, after the lifting of the ban on women driving, announced in recent months as part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's "Vision 2030", a socioeconomic program aimed at modernizing the Saudi economy and shepherding the conservative kingdom into the 21st century.
"This is the best news! I've been waiting for it for 33 years" said Nahar Alhamrani, a self-described movie fanatic from Jeddah. "It will spark creativity and help build a change in people's mindset."
Cinemas existed in Saudi Arabia until they were banned in the early 1980s after a puritanical religious establishment gained control over social and educational affairs in the country.
"Today, the organized Islamist undercurrents that thrived in the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s no longer have influence in society," said Mohammed Alyahya, a nonresident fellow at The Atlantic Council.
Back then, "young and old people traded DVDs, downloaded movies and visited Bahrain to watch movies. The reintroduction of movie theaters is long overdue" added Alyahya.

A multimillion-dollar bootleg industry flourished as a result. Saudis amassed large collections of pirated DVDs of the latest Hollywood blockbusters, circumventing both the ban and censorship. It's this revenue that the decision today also aims to recapture.
"Opening cinemas will act as a catalyst for economic growth and diversification," said Minister of Culture Awwad Alawwad. "By developing the broader cultural sector, we will create new employment and training opportunities, as well as enriching the kingdom's entertainment options"
The Saudi cinema industry is still nascent but has been receiving more attention over recent years with breakthrough movies like "Wadjdah" and "Barakah meets Barakah."
In September, it was announced that Saudi actress Ahd Kamel will star in the Netflix series "Collateral."
"Born a King," a coming-of-age story about the teenager who would become King Faisal, wrapped filming last month. It is the first Saudi English-language feature film officially licensed to be shot in the kingdom.
The announcement by the ministry of culture did not specify whether seating in cinemas would be gender-segregated as most public spaces are in Saudi Arabia or how heavily censored movies will be. Films are usually greatly censored with pixelation added to cover the chest and legs of actresses, as seen on a recent Saudi Airlines flight. Regulations are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.
Multiple malls currently being built had already received licenses to build multiplexes before today's announcement.
By 2030, over 300 cinemas with 2000 screens are expected to have opened across Saudi Arabia.

MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) - A Miami businessman accused of massive fraud involving foreign investors' money in a Vermont ski area has agreed to pay back more than $81 million and give up ownership of two ski resorts, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday.
The proposed settlement with Ariel Quiros must be approved by a court.
Quiros was accused of misusing more than $50 million from more than 700 foreign investors through a special visa program to buy a ski resort and to pay for personal expenses including two luxury condominiums in New York City, the SEC said. Companies he owned failed to contribute about $30 million in investor money toward construction of projects at Jay Peak resort, the SEC said.
The settlement includes a $1 million penalty.
Quiros and then-Jay Peak president William Stenger were accused in 2016 of misusing more than $200 million raised from foreign investors through the federal EB-5 visa program, which can lead to permanent U.S. residency for those who finance projects that create a certain number of jobs.
Quiros has agreed to give up ownership of the Jay Peak and Burke Mountain resorts and his stake in more than a dozen other properties, including the two condos.
"We're very pleased to be another step closer to resolving all of the claims against Mr. Quiros," said Quiros' attorney, Melissa Visconti.
Stenger, of Newport, Vermont, has agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty. He was not alleged to have personally profited from the fraud, the SEC said.
Quiros and Stenger did not admit or deny the complaint's allegations.
The SEC said it seeks to hold wrongdoers accountable and return as much money as possible to victims.
"This settlement achieves both objectives by stripping Quiros of the proceeds of his fraudulent scheme and requiring him to turn over valuable property for the benefit of harmed investors," said Eric Bustillo, director of the SEC's Miami regional office.
Quiros faces other claims from investors, Vermont and a federal receiver overseeing the ski resorts.
Gov. Phil Scott and state Attorney General T.J. Donovan thanked the SEC for its efforts in the case.
"There are positive outcomes from the SEC settlement, including that it will provide federal receiver Michael Goldberg with legal title to the Jay Peak Resort, Burke Mountain Resort and various other real properties previously acquired by defendant Ariel Quiros, allegedly, with investor money," they said in a statement. "Receiving legal title of the resort properties enables Mr. Goldberg to move forward with a sale to a permanent owner, which will be beneficial for the region."
But Scott, a Republican, and Donovan, a Democrat, said more must be done to seek justice for Vermont residents and the communities that have been harmed. They stressed that the state civil enforcement case continues against Quiros and Stenger.

Ambien and similar sleep aids are well-known for sometimes causing some weird behavioral side effects, but changing one's political or cultural views is not one of them.
Roseanne Barr partly blamed the insomnia drug in explaining a tweet that led ABC to cancel her show: "It was 2 in the morning and I was Ambien tweeting," she wrote.
Until this week, Ambien's most headline-grabbing behavioral side effect was "sleep-driving," essentially sleepwalking except getting behind the wheel and going for a drive with no memory of doing so.
But people also have reported making phone calls, eating meals, having sex and doing other things that they don't remember after taking so-called "sedative-hypnotic" medications. People charged with crimes occasionally even have tried "the Ambien defense."
Doctors call these "complex sleep behaviors." On its official Ambien labeling, manufacturer Sanofi calls the side effects "abnormal thinking and behavioral changes" - changes that can include decreased inhibition.
"It's behavior that's done when the individual is in a sense both asleep and awake at the same time," explained University of Pittsburgh sleep medicine specialist Dr. Daniel Buysse. It's not so different from how people sometimes behave under the influence of alcohol, he added, and it can be hard to tell if the behavior really was due to the drug.
And while it's not clear how common such side effects are, Ambien's instructions clearly state: Take it right before you get into bed, and only if you plan to stay there for 7 or 8 hours.
"You should take it and lie down. Read a book or something" but don't wander around or get on the computer or do other things waiting for the medicine to kick in, said Dr. Marc Schlosberg, a sleep medicine specialist at MedStar Washington Hospital Center.
Sanofi said Wednesday in a tweet that "while all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."
Barr later tweeted that she has had odd experiences while taking the drug late at night. "I blame myself, not Ambien," she tweeted.

An unknown quantity for any car journey is how long you might be delayed.
But fear not, figures released by the Department for Transport (DfT) reveal how many seconds drivers will spend at a standstill for every mile they travel on an A road.
The data for Lancashire shows that for every mile on one of the main roads across the area a car will be delayed by 39 seconds.
So for a daily commute of five miles a driver should add around three minutes to the journey to get to work on time. Anyone travelling 20 miles can expect a delay of around 13 minutes.
The latest statistics, covering 2016, show there has been a rise of 2% on the previous year.
And while Lancashire drivers may get furious about traffic jams, they are actually delayed less than the majority of England.
The country overall has an average delay time of 45.9 seconds per mile, which was a 2.8% increase on 2015.
While the DfT hasn't yet released localised data for 2017, it has unveiled the England-wide numbers which show the average delay has increased once again to 46.4 seconds.
Queues can be caused by anything from fuel spills, emergency repairs and broken down lorries, to congestion during peak times.
And the figures appear to show that traffic jams, one of Britain's least popular national pastimes, are getting worse.
All of these impacts speeds on A road, where England's average is 25mph despite speed limits ranging between 30mph to 70mph on anything from small urban roads to dual carriageways.
In 2016 motorists in Lancashire chugged along at 25.5mph, roughly the same speed as a galloping horse.
This was slower than the previous year by 1%.
In October the government wrote to Highways England, which runs major A roads and motorways, demanding a reduction in delays after the transport data company Inrix revealed traffic jams on UK roads cost the economy £9bn a year.

Murdering a General
The Rivera brothers, who led a trafficking organization called Los Cachiros, built a fortune as middlemen, moving cocaine from hidden airstrips northward to the Mexican cartels.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The brothers used violence to muscle out rivals and others, from at least 2003 when Devis Rivera was involved in the murder of a hospital security guard and, the next year, the killing of the man he had been guarding, a Honduran cartel leader.
By late 2009, Mr. Rivera testified that he and other traffickers felt threatened by General Julián Arístides González Irías, the Honduran counternarcotics czar. The American embassy in Tegucigalpa once described General Arístides González as the “last (somewhat) best hope” to revive Honduras' counternarcotics efforts, according to a cable published by WikiLeaks.
“The decision was made to kill him,” Mr. Rivera testified. General Arístides González was assassinated on Dec. 8, 2009 by a gunman on a motorcycle.
Mr. Rivera testified that the traffickers paid $200,000 to $300,000 for the killing, which was handled by a group of police officers.

That was around the same time, Mr. Rivera testified, that he and his brother bought a president.
Concerned about the possibility of extradition to the United States, Mr. Rivera said they paid more than $400,000 in bribes to President Porfirio Lobo, before and after his November 2009 election. At President Lobo's home in early 2010, Mr. Rivera received the assurance he wanted.
“The president said to me to tell my brother not to worry,” Mr. Rivera recalled, “because during his four-year term nobody would get extradited.”
President Lobo also designated his son Fabio, who was once a juvenile court judge, “as a middleman who would be able to protect us, help us — the Cachiros,” Mr. Rivera said.

Fabio Lobo became a valuable ally. “I gave him a bribe almost every time I met with him,” Mr. Rivera said. “I knew that having him with me, everything would go well.”
One time, the president's son, riding with his armed security detail in a convoy of blue Prado SUVs, escorted 1,000 kilograms of cocaine for the brothers through a police checkpoint.
He “lowered the windows a little bit and then started talking with the police officers,” Mr. Rivera recalled.
By Mr. Rivera's account, the president's son threw himself into his new role, asking to visit a backcountry airstrip to “feel the adrenaline — what you experience when you receive a plane loaded with drugs.”
“I'd do anything for you,” Fabio Lobo said in one recorded conversation. “I'll go to the moon and back for you.”

With President Lobo's patronage, the brothers invested in construction companies that competed for government contracts. In the fashion of Pablo Escobar, they opened a zoo, complete with tigers, jaguars, and lions. They developed relationships with one of the country's most prominent families, the Rosenthals, who acted as their bankers and money launderers. They invested drug proceeds in cattle, with their beef later exported to the United States, and agriculture.
Brian H. Bieber, a lawyer for former President Lobo, said his client remains under investigation by the American authorities, which he said has been frustrating for Mr. Lobo, who has been “loud and clear in his emphatic denial” of Mr. Rivera's allegations.
“There is absolutely no credible evidence to support the allegations made by an admitted mass murderer and a convicted drug trafficker,” Mr. Bieber said, adding that the former president had “absolutely no” relationship with the Cachiros.

As President Lobo's term neared its end in 2013, Mr. Rivera had new concerns.
The United States Treasury Department had announced sanctions against the Rivera brothers, and Honduran authorities began seizing their assets, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, even their zoo.

“I was afraid for my life. I was afraid for my family,” Mr. Rivera testified. “I could get killed because I had worked with politicians, police officers.”
By December 2013, Mr. Rivera testified, he and his brother Javier had begun talking with the D.E.A. and prosecutors to try to strike a deal.
TiVo is (cleverly) turning things upside down for Super Bowl LII with introduction of GameSkip. This first-time feature for TiVo DVRs flips the company's SkipMode—which skips commercials in some shows—on its head. With GameSkip, TiVo users can skip the game and get right to the important bits—Super Bowl commercials and the Halftime Show.
Firstly, TiVo's website is oh-so-careful not to mention the Super Bowl by name. I'm not sure why, since the whole point of the event is to submerse us in a marketing bath, but it's notable in TiVo's description:
This coming Sunday, February 4, is the day TV fans wait all year for. Sure, the big game's great and all, but for those who tune in for the multi-million-dollar commercials and the world's biggest halftime show, we've got the perfect solution: TiVo GameSkip. This first-time feature turns SkipMode™ upside-down. After recording the big game, look for the on-screen SKIP icon next to the recording. Then hit play, press the SKIP button1 and your TiVo will jump to the beginning of the next commercial break! Kind of makes you want to give us a high-five, right?
I'll admit that I love and hate this. I haven't had time for sports in a long, long time. So, you know, lolfunny. At the same time, there's a part of me appalled at how commercial advertising has become content in and of itself. It's perverse, and yet another step towards a cyberpunk future where we're all slaves to the Corp.
Then again, I enjoy watching, writing, and talking about Apple's advertising, so my I may need a hand getting up on my high horse on this topic.
And while we're at it, you can just watch teasers for the commercials on TiVo's site. So there's that, too.
Anyhoo…TiVo is giving its customers an interesting choice this year with GameSkip. I'd love to hear if you'd use it, or not, and why.
Virtually every form of movement is faster -- both overall and with abilities like gliding and Supers. Those Supers and power weapon ammo will be available more frequently, too. And if you thought the regular gameplay revolved too heavily around auto rifles, you'll be happy to hear that hand cannons, fusion rifles and other guns should be more useful.
There are other competitive tweaks in line for March 27th, such as quitting penalties, a weekly playlist and 6-on-6 Iron Banner. All told, it's evident that Bungie wants the Crucible to be more appealing in its own right, rather than something to grind when you're looking for new gear. It's just unfortunate that these updates will have taken half a year.
Christopher Plummer has been nominated for a Golden Globe for the role originally played by Kevin Spacey in All the Money in the World.
Plummer was hired just six weeks before the film's scheduled release to reshoot scenes as John Paul Getty, after Sir Ridley Scott chose to cut Kevin Spacey out of the film because of the numerous sexual assault and harassment allegations made against the disgraced actor.
The veteran actor was reportedly the first choice for the part of Getty, the real life oil tycoon billionaire who in the Seventies refused to pay the ransom for his grandson who was kidnapped. The film's plot centres on these events and it reportedly cost $10 million to reshoot the scenes with Plummer.
Scott told Entertainment Weekly it was an easy decision to replace Spacey and admitted that he hadn't contacted him about the changes to the movie. “You can't tolerate any kind of behaviour like that,” he explains. “And it will affect the film. We cannot let one person's action affect the good work of all these other people. It's that simple.”
Plummer will be facing competition in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Drama category. Willem Dafoe (The Florida Project), Armie Hammer (Call Me By Your Name), Richard Jenkins (The Shape of Water) and Sam Rockwell (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) have also been nominated, though Sony must be happy that their Oscars campaign is still in motion.
The studio had reportedly been planning to build a campaign around Spacey in the Supporting Actor categories during this awards season but cooled it after multiple men came forward with allegations against him.

Plummer said of replacing Spacey, according to Indie Wire, “It's really not replacing him [Spacey]—it's starting all over again. Although the situation is very sad.
“I'm very saddened by what happened to Kevin, but what can I do? I've got a role. I admire Ridley Scott and I'm thrilled to be making a movie for him. And so I thought, that was it. Ages ago I was in contention for [the role], way back. So I was familiar with it, and then Ridley came to me and I agreed. I wanted to work with him. He's very good. I loved the script. The script is wonderful.”
The 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards will air live across the country on NBC on Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET from the Beverly Hilton Hotel with host Seth Meyers.

A Florida-based circus operator has agreed to pay $25,000 in fines to resolve criminal charges in New Hampshire following a tent collapse in 2015 that killed two people and injured dozens.
The Caledonian-Record reports (http://bit.ly/2lhdfyS) a prosecutor says the plea agreement resolves eight charges, including operating without a license, and ensures the state will receive money from a defendant who has limited funds.
Sarasota-based Walker International Events initially faced more than $200,000 in fines.
The agreement will need court approval. A March 8 hearing is scheduled.
The company, now out of business, also settled some lawsuits and agreed to pay federal safety fines.
Forty-one-year-old Robert Young and his 6-year-old daughter, Annabelle, of Concord, Vermont, died when a storm with 75 mph winds blew through the Lancaster Fairgrounds, toppling the tent.

Nobody wants to take responsibility for Mariah Carey's New York Eve's flop of a performance which means we now have a classic he said/she said situation on our hands. Hours following her trainwreck show, the iconic entertainer blamed the disaster on “sh*t happening” while her representative further clarified that it was technical difficulties beyond Carey's control that ruined her performance. Now a source within Carey's camp is claiming the star was actually sabotaged, a claim Dick Clark Productions denies.
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A woman detained and deported to Mexico in 2013 despite being in the United States legally will not be allowed to pursue a wrongful arrest lawsuit against the U.S. government.
An appeals court in New Orleans upheld a Texas federal judge's dismissal of the lawsuit by Guadalupe Chaidez Campos.
Court records say Campos had entered the country illegally in 2012 and was ordered out. But she also applied for and received legal "nonimmigrant" status.
Agents detained and deported her when she reported to a probation office in El Paso, even though she had proof of her legal status. She returned in 2014.
Tuesday's ruling said the government is immune from her lawsuit because the border agents, who had seen the 2012 deportation order, acted within their discretion.
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday it's unacceptable and appalling that more than 8,000 children were killed and injured in conflicts last year from Syria and Yemen to Congo and Afghanistan and urged combatants to do more to protect boys and girls.
The U.N. chief said in his annual report on Children and Armed Conflict, obtained by The Associated Press, that the United Nations verified 3,512 child casualties in Afghanistan, more than 40 percent of the total and “the highest number ever recorded” in the country.
Guterres said the recruitment and use of children in conflict more than doubled in Somalia and Syria compared with 2015. And the U.N. verified 169 incidents affecting at least 1,022 youngsters in South Sudan, more than 60 percent of them recruited and used by government security forces, he said.
Extremist groups
The secretary-general said the number of violations against children committed by extremist groups — al-Shabab, Boko Haram, the Islamic State and the Taliban — totaled more than 6,800.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement that Guterres is appalled not only by the more than 8,000 youngsters killed and injured and the recruitment of children but by sexual violence against girls and boys and attacks on schools and hospitals.
“A child killed, recruited as a soldier, injured in an attack or prevented from going to school due to a conflict is already one too many,” said Virginia Gamba, the U.N. special representative for children and armed conflict.
The report contains a blacklist of government forces and rebel groups that recruit, use, kill, maim, rape, sexually abuse or abduct children in armed conflict or attack schools and hospitals.
For the first time this year, Guterres divided the list in two parts, one naming parties that have not taken any action to improve the protection of children, and one listing parties “that have put in place measures.”
​Saudi-led coalition
This year's list, which AP obtained and reported on Wednesday, was eagerly awaited because last year the Saudi Arabia-led coalition fighting rebels in Yemen was put on the blacklist but removed by then-Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon under intense pressure from the Saudis.
Guterres put the coalition on this year's list of parties that are taking action to protect children, a decision welcomed Thursday by Human Rights Watch, Save the Children and the Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict.
The secretary-general said in the report that “the coalition's actions objectively led to the listing for the killing and maiming of children, with 683 child casualties attributed to this party, and as a result of being responsible for 38 verified incidents, for attacks on schools and hospitals during 2016.”
The secretary-general said there were 1,340 verified child casualties in Yemen, more than 50 percent of the deaths and injuries caused by the U.S.-backed coalition.
In talks with Saudi Arabia, Guterres said, its government told the U.N. the coalition took measures to reduce the impact of the conflict on children by changing rules of engagement and establishing a team to review all incidents involving civilian casualties and identify corrective actions.
“These initiatives are steps in the right direction,” Guterres said. “Nevertheless, I urge the coalition to improve its approach since, despite these measures, grave violations against children continued at unacceptably high levels in 2016.”
Dujarric said the secretary-general spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia on Thursday. The country's U.N. ambassador has scheduled a press conference Friday.
Human rights groups
Human rights groups echoed Guterres' concerns.
Jo Becker, children's rights advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said: “The coalition needs to stop making empty promises to exercise caution, take concrete action to stop these deadly unlawful attacks in Yemen, and allow desperately needed fuel and aid to reach those in need.”
Save the Children Director Debra Jones said all parties fighting in Yemen “must sit up and take notice and take action, as must those countries that are supporting or arming them.”
“The world must make sure the violations end,” she said.
Eva Smets, Watchlist's executive director, said the Saudi-led coalition is now one of 64 parties listed for violating children's rights and the U.N. must work with all these parties “to ensure these horrific violations of vulnerable children are never repeated.”

PARACHINAR, Pakistan (AP) — A Pakistani official says a roadside bomb has killed six members of a family in a tribal region near the Afghan border.
Rafiq Khattak, a tribal official, says the family was travelling on Tuesday from the village of Muqbil to the village of Boshera to attend a funeral service in the Kurram tribal region when the planted bomb destroyed their vehicle.
He says three women were among the fatalities. A seventh person in the vehicle was wounded and is in hospital, in critical condition.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Islamic militants operate in the area, and the Pakistani military has carried out several operations there, trying to rout the extremists.

Op-Ed: A View From the Top: The Growing Role of Scientists
Op-Ed: View From the Top
As Climate Science Has Firmed, Role of Scientists Grows
By Paul Hanle
President and CEO, Climate Central
The “March for Science” planned for April 22 in Washington has become a moment when science recognizes it must reclaim its rightful seat as protector of objective truth. The march is not about politics. It is about not throwing away our great engine of truth. And a working engine it is, gaining purchase as facts are uncovered, and casting so much prosperity and opportunity on America and the world in its wake.
Despite my former teacher Thomas Kuhn's famous analysis of scientific revolutions, I am reminded that scientific revolutions are rare. Science mostly moves on fronts, in increments over decades, only occasionally welling up in creative froth with bubbles of idea-foam bursting forth, then solidifying in layers like sedimentary rock. The mechanism of peer review allows for new information to be uncovered. But it does not assure the information is true. Truth comes over time and test—call it a March ofScience. Facts become clear as research findings pack down, as scientists weigh evidence, accept or reject it, and advance to collective understanding that the evidence supports the idea.

The science of climate change has progressed this way. Early conviction of a few experts grew with passing years to widespread understanding based on cumulative evidence. Now, despite a few vocal contrarians whose opposition will go to the grave, a broad and deep consensus exists. So, climate science as it is understood to explain global warming will not be toppled by some abrupt revelation that, after all, they had it wrong. Instead, with rigorous commitment to following the facts, the vast majority of climate scientists recognize that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are causing dangerous changes to the climate. And for them, the overwhelming nature of climate science requires some attempt to come to grips with its implications for the safety, security, health and livelihood of Americans.
Now, mainstream climate scientists have become more emphatic: Greenhouse gas emissions must be cut substantially and quickly to reduce the growing chances of catastrophic impacts.
The evidence for this has strengthened gradually— like the growing frequency of extreme weather events. And so has grown the obligation over time for science to declare that a strong response is needed. That is where the climate-scientific community now is. It is especially crucial that scientists be heard now, as leading officials in the U.S. government, including the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency itself, publicly assert a falsehood—then waffle—that climate change is not connected to emissions of carbon dioxide. Science, and even the fossil fuel companies, know that it is.
The consequences of climate change are hard to overstate. Sea-level rise has already driven thousands of tidal floods on U.S. coasts and lowered real-estate values. Last fall, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released an analysis that showed the devastating Baton Rouge floods, which destroyed or damaged 100,000 homes and cost American taxpayers $12 billion, had a clear “climate fingerprint,” which likely doubled the chances of this event. The 10 hottest years ever recorded have all occurred since 1998 as average global temperatures have risen.
Scientific data and evidence-based thinking must be the starting point to address the profound problem of climate change. That is why the unprecedented cuts recently proposed by the Trump Administration for climate science at NOAA, NASA and elsewhere are a terrible mistake. How can we know what we must do to reduce climate impacts if we cannot even have the data to tell us what needs to be done?
But in the response to this absurdity lies cause for hope. Seeing the assault on fact-based thinking, scientists are energized. My colleagues and I at Climate Central have performed an informal survey of climate scientists throughout the country at research institutions, national labs, and other local centers where the crucial work is carried out. We have found they are ready to march. Not because their funding is threatened, but because they want to fight for the values of rationality, integrity, and objective truth-seeking to which they have devoted their careers and their lives. This is what sets them apart from special interests that organize other marches on Washington. Is this not something we all should aspire to?
But in this age, not all do. I recognize that some Americans hold different views and may be persuaded by means other than data. Let us use what means are needed. Let us honestly and in good faith work with those who harbor doubts. But let us not temporize about the facts of climate science and need for action, nor stand by as others do. The stakes are too high — for scientists, citizens, everyone.

Shaddi Teri Bajayenge Band Hum will hit the screens on March 23 and stars Rajpal Yadav, Mushtaq Khan, Rahul Bagga, Dilbagh Singh, Rohit Kumar, Shrashti Maheshwari, Radha Bhatt And Afreen Alvi. The movie is directed by Gurpreet Sondh and will be Punjabi singer Dilbagh Singh's Bollywood debut. NewsX caught up with the singing sensation in an exclusive interview and got him talking about his future plans, movie scripts, and inspirations.
He is a Punjabi singing sensation who took over the industry with his voice in 2007 has finally made his way to Bollywood and is all set to make his debut, yes, we are talking about the multi-talented Dilbagh Singh. In 2014, Singh collaborated with Millind Gaba on the song Thodi Jinni Peeti Hai, he also sang the hit song Mari Gali for the soundtrack of the 2015 film Tanu Weds Manu. He has also released multiple songs since then and now he is making his debut in Bollywood with Shaddi Teri Bajayenge Band Hum which also stars Rajpal Yadav.
In an exclusive interview with NewsX, he disclosed who his idols are and what he plans to do in the future:
NewsX: Being a part of one of the biggest music industry, who were your idols growing up?
Dilbagh: Anyone who does something different inspires me. I think, Mika is one of the most versatile performers the industry will ever see and he has always inspired me to bring out a presence that entertains my audience. Othe than that of course, there are legends like Daler Mehendi Ji, Gurdas Maan Saheb are there. Even the youngsters that are coming up, whenever they do something fun, I am inspired.

NewsX: What do you think about the new rap culture that is coming up in the Punjabi music industry?
Dilbagh: The core of the music is still the same. We are still using the same raag we used in folk songs. The new rap culture is like, you were cooking butter chicken but you added a Thai curry mix into it. I personally feel its a spice of music and those who like it will listen to it, those who don't will go back to the older music. I appreciate anything and everything new that the upcoming artists are doing and it is working, so I don't see the harm.
NewsX: You have garnered over 4 million likes on your YouTube videos, what are you planning in the future, as far as your music is concerned?
Dilbagh: I have recorded a few new Pop songs which are ready and the videos have been shot. I will release the sings a few weeks after my movie is released. Right now, I am focusing on the promotions of the film and once that is done, I will always go back to it. Other than that, the shows that I do, which is kinda like my bread and butter, I have those lined up post-release as well. I also have two more movie offers, one of which I have signed with a big production house and if all works out well, then I will sign the second one as well.
NewsX: Your movie is titled Shaddi Teri Bajayenge Hum Band, which is unique in itself. The movie stars Rajpal Yadav who is a comedic legend, what was it like working with him?
Dilbagh: As short-sighted as he is, his humanity is double that size. When I first met him, I was questioning whether he will have an ego or not, given the stature, he has in the industry but once we started talking and had a cup of tea before the shot was ready, I realized how innocent he is, cracking jokes and relaxing like any other person. He sits there ordering food and the minute he goes on the camera, he fits right into the character of Selfie Don. In one of the incidents I remember, we shot the climax of the movie in summer and Rajpal sir had to wear a tracksuit and I asked him how he was not hot in that and if needed some arrangements made, he told me, “Actor ko na thand lagti hai na garmi, jo movie mein chahiye bs who karna chahiye, yahi humara kaam hai”. This has stuck with me.
NewsX: Your contemporary Diljit Dosanjh who made his Bollywood debut a few years ago, are you planning to balance music and movies like him?
Dilbagh: I believe in destiny, so I don't know where I will end up. Diljit is also doing exceptional work, he is an amazing artist and a very talented actor, I don't think I am as good an actor yet, maybe after 2-4 films, I will be good as well. He has his own place in the Punjabi music industry. I am looking forward to doing different movies as well. I always aim to do roles that are unique.

NewsX: Daler Mehndi has been one of your idols, what do you think about the recent case where he was found guilty of human trafficking?
Dilbagh: I have known Daler Mehndi ji for years now and I firmly believe that he is innocent. He is a very soft person who won't harm a fly so this is something he can't even think off. He is one of the highest tax-payers and a legend in the industry, there is no need for him to do such things and I am sure the world will see that as well.
NewsX: Your movie is releasing alongside Rani Mukherji's Hichki, do you think that will affect your box-office collection?
Dilbagth: I believe that the audiences who are fans of my work and Rajpal Yadav's work or Rohit Bagga's work will come in to see my film. Every actor attracts their fans and I know that it might affect the collection but I am sure that we will be able to capture hearts as well. I myself will go watch Rani's film as soon as I can. I have started watching every film that hits the theatres since I decided to join the industry to gain experience. Movies clash and that is normal, so only time will tell.
Shaddi Teri Bajayenge Band Hum will hit the screens on March 23 and stars Rajpal Yadav, Mushtaq Khan, Rahul Bagga, Dilbagh Singh, Rohit Kumar, Shrashti Maheshwari, Radha Bhatt And Afreen Alvi.

Brie Bella is raising her daughter as a vegetarian.
The 34-year-old professional wrestler gave birth to her daughter Birdie Joe Danielson - whom she has with her husband and fellow wrestler Daniel Bryan - 11 months ago, and has revealed that whilst she is feeding her a vegetarian diet, she won't stop the tot from eating meat if she requests it.
She said: "As of right now, I am [feeding Birdie a vegetarian diet]. The day that Birdie asks me to try meat, I won't deny it to her."
The 'Total Bellas' star doesn't want to "push" her beliefs onto her daughter, and will let her make her own decisions when she gets older.
She added: "I'll always let her know the things I believe in and why, but I'll never push them on her. I was blessed to be raised in a family where they didn't push a lot of stuff on me.
"I was able to find who I am today and I want Birdie to have that. I'll educate her on why I live the lifestyle I do, but if she asks for it one day I won't make her feel bad about it and I'll let her try it for sure."
But Brie has faced criticism for her decision to raise Birdie on a vegetarian diet, as people are reportedly concerned she is "starving" her daughter.
Brie said: "You almost can't tell people you're a vegetarian because they feel like you're starving your baby. I birthed a nine-pound healthy baby. I ate so many vegetables, which is maybe why Birdie loves them too. I just think people have a misconception about what it means to be a healthy vegetarian."
The wrestling star - who is the twin sister of fellow wrestler Nikki Bella - also revealed that motherhood changed her opinion on vaccinations, as she felt getting her daughter immunised against life-threatening diseases outweighed the possible injury incurred by the needle.
Speaking to People magazine, she said: "I was someone in the beginning who doubted vaccinations. But I started educating myself and I started realising how easy it is for kids to get different diseases and infections that they can't fight off.

Santander banks in Clitheroe has reopened after a terrifying night-time raid.
Two robbers armed with a chainsaw and baseball bat targeted the bank in Castle Street at 11pm last night (Thursday) as security staff were delivering cash.
The offenders threatened the security guards before stealing cassettes containing an unknown quantity of cash. Police said no on was injured in the incident.
Earlier today, crime scene investigators taped off the bank while bank staff waited outside for news.
Officials at Santander have since revealed the branch has reopened.
A spokesman said: "We have been cooperating with police in relation to the incident at our Clitheroe branch which took place last night. The branch has now reopened and we apologise to customers for any inconvenience.”
This is the second time in a year the bank has been targeted. In November last year, armed robbers targeted a vehicle delivering cash to Santander bank, Clitheroe.
A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: "We were called at around 11pm last night to reports of an armed robbery at the Santander bank, Castle Street, Clitheroe.
"It is believed two men, armed with a baseball bat and a chainsaw, have entered the bank as security staff have been delivering cash. They have made threats before making off with cassettes containing cash. Fortunately nobody was injured. "No arrests have been made as yet and our enquiries are now ongoing to establish exactly what occurred.
"We would ask anybody with information about the incident to contact us on 101, quoting log number 1586 of October 5th.
Noted aviator and actor Harrison Ford flew his private plane over a jet airliner on the ground at a Southern California airport Monday. It's not the first time the Star Wars and Indiana Jones star has had problems landing.
The 74-year-old Ford was instructed to land on a runway at Orange County's John Wayne Airport but mistakenly landed on a parallel taxiway, passing over a Boeing 737 carrying 110 passengers and six crew members.
On a recording, Ford asked air traffic controllers, "Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?" according to NBC News, which first reported the incident.
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said the pilot heard and read back the correct landing instructions, according to The Associated Press. Gregor did not confirm it was Ford who was piloting the plane, a single-engine Aviat Husky. The AP reports that he didn't say how close Ford's plane came to hitting the jet on the ground.
No one was injured and the jet, American Airlines Flight 1456, took off for Dallas shortly after without incident.
The FAA is now investigating, which "could result in a simple warning letter to a suspension of Ford's pilot's license," NBC reports.
Ford collects vintage planes and has been flying for decades. According to NPR's Russell Lewis, Ford is "a highly-skilled and highly-rated pilot. He's qualified to fly single and twin engine planes, seaplanes, helicopters and he's also an instrument-rated pilot." In 2015, Ford said he owned "eight or nine various types of airplanes," according to NTSB documents posted on AirSafe.com.
Ford reported on a medical certificate application that he had logged at least 5,200 flight hours, according to the NTSB.
He was a 2008 honoree and received the Legends Aviation Legacy Award from Kiddie Hawk Air Academy, and subsequently had an award named after him.
Ford was seriously injured in March 2015 when he crash-landed a restored World War II-era trainer plane on a golf course near the Santa Monica Airport shortly after takeoff. A National Transportation Safety Board report found the crash was caused by a loose engine part.
In 2000, Ford's plane "departed" a runway in Lincoln, Neb., because of a gust of wind, according to AirSafe.com. He was flying a Beechcraft Bonanza which "sustained minor damage," though Ford and his passenger were not injured.
And in 1999 he crash-landed a helicopter during a training flight in Ventura County, near Los Angeles, according to the AP. "Although the helicopter rolled over on its left side, neither Ford nor the instructor were injured," AirSafe.com notes.
The start of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) talks this week—negotiations foisted on Canada and Mexico by U.S. President Donald Trump—provides a moment to marvel at how trade has emerged, unexpectedly, as a defining issue for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's still-young Liberal government.
In the 2015 election, Trudeau ran on an economic platform that touted deficit-financed infrastructure spending and a boost in federal benefits for families with kids. Trade only briefly popped up as a live issue when the Trans-Pacific Partnership was finalized late in the campaign, and Trudeau said that while Liberals “strongly supported” free trade in general, they would have to “thoroughly examine” the 12-nation TPP's particulars.
That desultory bit of hedging was a faint, final echo of free trade's bygone status as a litmus test of the Liberal-Conservative divide. The issue looked definitive, of course, way back when Brian Mulroney's Conservatives beat John Turner's Liberals in the epic 1988 election—the campaign so bitterly fought over the trade deal with the U.S. that Mulroney secured at great political risk.
But that's history. When Mulroney showed up to brief the Liberal cabinet a few months ago on how to renegotiate NAFTA—the 1994 successor to his Canada-U.S. deal that brought Mexico into the continental economic club—Liberals didn't flinch. Polls tell us why Trudeau could seek Mulroney's counsel with impunity: A recent Pew Research survey found an almost identical 82 per cent of Liberals and 83 per cent of Conservatives in Canada support NAFTA, compared with 68 per cent of Democrats and just 30 per cent of Republicans in the U.S.
The public opinion consensus in Canada has turned free trade into a can't-lose cause to champion in Ottawa. Last fall, the tenacity then-trade minister Chrystia Freeland displayed in sealing the deal on the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) cemented her status as one of the few undisputed rising stars in Trudeau's cabinet. The PM promoted her to Foreign Minister early this year, conspicuously leaving her in charge of Canada-U.S. trade—a daunting defensive challenge after NAFTA-bashing, TPP-nixing Trump won the presidency.
Presiding over the file offers Freeland a plum chance to strategically bind together two politically promising themes. Safeguarding Canada's NAFTA-assured access to U.S. markets is—as that Pew poll confirms—a pragmatic priority most Canadians back. Countering Trump's retrograde “America First” rhetoric about NAFTA appeals to loftier principles, the kind Freeland venerated in her major speech to the House on June 6 about Canada's steadfast commitment, in the Trump era, to the postwar international order. “The system,” Freeland said, “had at its heart the core notions of territorial integrity, human rights, democracy, respect for the rule of law, and an aspiration to free and friendly trade.”
Fitting NAFTA into that aspirational, elevated, internationalist, decidedly un-Trumpian frame conforms better with the self-image of Liberals, and many other Canadians, than the more familiar positioning of free trade as a priority of corporate lobbyists. Still, there's that, too. The business-oriented C. D. Howe Institute flags three specific, stated goals of Trump's NAFTA negotiators that the Canadian government must “strongly resist”:
The U.S. wants goods traded duty-free in the NAFTA zone to have more North American, and specifically American, content. Changing these “rules of origin” levels to boost U.S.-content requirements is a particularly big worry for Canada's auto sector;
The U.S. wants to gain the power to impose temporary duties on Canadian and Mexican products when there's a surge in imports of some product into the American market, even if that surge comes from other exporting countries;
The U.S. wants to get rid of NAFTA's famous “Chapter 19” binational panels, which decide if one NAFTA country can impose duties on another for allegedly unfair subsidies or selling goods at unfairly low prices. It's the sort of dispute resolution Canada has relied on, notably, in softwood lumber disputes.
The danger of failing to hold the line on any of these three big issues has to be deeply worrisome for Freeland, and there are many other dicey issues on the table. So many, in fact, that experts in trade negotiations doubt the talks can be finished in the rushed timetable Trump's team has proposed—just seven bargaining sessions, starting April 16 in Washington, aiming to wrap talks up with a revised NAFTA by the end of the year.
Daniel Schwanen, the Toronto-based C. D. Howe Institute's resident expert on trade and international policy, says one possibility is that negotiators will quickly prioritize a short list of topics truly up for serious discussion. He theorized that Trump has so loudly vowed to get a big win out of changing NAFTA—or just scrap the pact—that Canada and Mexico must be contemplating what they might give up to allow him to claim to have fulfilled his promise.
“It would be best for all three countries if we do this quickly,” Schwanen said in an interview, speculating that negotiators might aim for a result “where Canada and Mexico can say they've avoided the worst, and the U.S. can say we've gained some protection against unfair competition and gained some access.”
The stakes are enormous. Since the deal came into force in 1994, trade among the three NAFTA countries has roughly tripled to more than US$1 trillion. Of course, it's impossible to be precise about how much of that rise can be attributed directly to NAFTA. And the deal hasn't achieved everything originally hoped. For instance, as the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives points out, Canadian manufacturing productivity still stubbornly trails U.S. levels, despite upbeat predictions at the outset that NAFTA-spurring economic integration would close the gap.
But Trudeau's ability to assemble a remarkably broad coalition to help him out on NAFTA shows how widely the deal has come to be seen as essential to guaranteeing that Canadian goods and services aren't unduly impeded from entry into the hugely lucrative U.S. market. His newly appointed NAFTA Council includes not just prominent Tories and New Democrats, but also top union and farming voices, along with the expected business leaders from banking, auto parts, entertainment, high tech and more.
And the council only augments the zone-flooding effort Trudeau has orchestrated over the past few months to win over American allies all over the U.S. (That campaign, as Maclean's detailed in this story, enlisted 17 cabinet ministers, 12 premiers and 13 diplomats.) No matter how the talks end, nobody will seriously be able to fault Trudeau for failing to cover his bases.
The outcomes of the talks that begin this week are as unpredictable as the president who demanded them. In Canada, though, this much is already clear: Confronted with a challenge that hardly figured in their plan for getting elected, Trudeau and his strategists have displayed an ability to react—marshalling resources, assembling a coalition, even creating a cabinet heavyweight—that cannot be denied. Now all that's left is the hard bargaining.
MORE ABOUT NAFTA:
A surprising theory is fueling a long-awaited breakthrough for General Motors Co. shares: that the stuffy century-old automaker could have some technology chops, after all.
Bullish reports from a Deutsche Bank analyst who sees a $30 billion business emerging from GM's bets on self-driving and shared cars has culminated in the stock closing at a record each day this week. Analyst Rod Lache upgraded GM to a buy last month and said Monday that management didn't refute his prediction the company will spin off its mobility business.
The stock climb is a big turnabout for GM. For years, the shares were stuck in neutral as investors were smitten by Tesla Inc. as the better bet on where the industry was headed — toward a future where plug-in cars pilot themselves between charges. Another fear was that the rise of ride hailing championed by Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. would disrupt auto ownership and leave GM clinging to an outdated business model.
Instead, GM has been putting the pieces together to compete with those companies head-on. The automaker acquired Cruise Automation last year to develop autonomous vehicles that are now ready for mass production. GM's car-sharing business Maven is expanding, leading the company to consider deploying automated autos through a Cruise app, via Maven, or through a partner like Lyft, which the carmaker invested in last year.
“GM's AVs will be ready for commercial deployment, without human drivers, much sooner than widely expected,” Lache wrote in his report this week, adding that they could be ready within quarters, rather than years. “This will be material, even to a company of GM's size.”
Stock Climb
GM shares advanced as much as 0.7% to $44.08 on Thursday and have jumped about 11% since Sept. 22, the last trading day before Lache recommended the stock and raised his price target to $51 from $36. He said GM's mobility business by itself may be worth $20 a share.
Lache isn't alone in pushing up GM shares. The stock gained after the company announced plans this week to introduce 20 fully electric cars globally by 2023, reinforcing the view that it's going to be prepared to respond if consumer demand starts shifting to battery-electric vehicles.
The pressure on GM and crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. to dispel the notion they'll lose out on the rise of electrification and autonomy has been intense. Famed activist investor David Einhorn mounted an unsuccessful bid for GM board seats early this year and chided management for the stock trading near its 2010 initial public offering price. Ford ousted CEO Mark Fields in May and replaced him with Jim Hackett, who used to lead the company's mobility unit.
Undervalued Shares
Both Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley have made the case that GM is undervalued. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas made GM one of his top-three stock picks on Sept. 21, though his combined valuation of the company's shared mobility and autonomy businesses are only about $4 billion, much lower than Lache's.
Others are skeptical of assigning such a big valuation to GM's mobility business. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak estimated the company's technology units may be worth about $6 per share in a report Thursday.
Counting pension obligations — a symptom of being an old-line industrial company, if ever there was one — Spak arrived at an estimation that GM shares probably should be trading in the mid-$40s, roughly in line with where the stock is now.
“It's too early,” he wrote, “to call GM a winner.”

Join us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.
The coalition of pastors that includes those who led the defeat of Houston's "Equal Rights Ordinance," also known as the "Bathroom Bill", has issued a response to the report that the National Football League is now warning Texas against proposed legislation to keep boys out of girls' restrooms. SB 6, sponsored by Senator Lois Kohlkorst and heavily supported by Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, would establish a statewide uniform standard in all state and local government buildings—including schools—that boys, girls, men and women must use the restroom, shower or locker room of the sex identified on their birth certificate.
"Yellow penalty flags are flying all across Texas with pastors ruling a personal foul against NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and spokesman Brian McCarthy for threatening the safety of our women and children in Texas," declared the Texas Pastor Council in its statement.
McCarthy reportedly sent an email to the Houston Chronicle in which he warned Texans that, "If a proposal that is discriminatory or inconsistent with our values were to become law [in Texas], that would certainly be a factor considered when thinking about awarding future events ... The NFL embraces inclusiveness ... We want all fans to feel welcomed at our events, and NFL policies prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other improper standard."
TXPC also said that the veiled threat ignores both the recent success of the Super Bowl in Houston and, more importantly, the privacy, safety, decency and freedom for all Texas women and children.

"We demand to know what role the NFL has in dictating the values of Texas, interfering with something outside of regulating their own sport and placing our women and children in harm's way to give preference to one-tenth of one percent who are confused about their gender."
The pastors continued by asserting that, "If the NFL's values include requiring that men can use women's restrooms, we have a special message for the Commissioner and Mr. McCarthy; Pastors of every color and every corner of this state are declaring that we choose mothers over money, daughters over dollars and privacy over predators."
They added that the NFL has apparently decided that women and girls being videotaped in restrooms and showers is unimportant, incidents that have occurred all over the country.
The racially and denominationally diverse coalition representing pastors in cities around Texas from El Paso to Beaumont concluded the statement by making it clear that, "Texans love football, but we love our God, our freedom and our families more. If we are forced to choose, then we will say to the NFL and other sports organizations or lobby groups, 'Don't let the ticket gate hit you on the way out of Texas.'"

TAIPEI (Taiwan News)—Today, May 31 is World No Tobacco Day, a yearly awareness day established by the World Health Organization (WHO) that highlights the risks associated with tobacco use.
The Health Promotion Administration (HPA) of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) held a press conference promoting the World No Tobacco Day and discussed the adverse affects of tobacco.
Deputy Director Yu Li-hui (游麗惠) said that according to WHO, more than 7 million people die each year because of tobacco, whether from direct inhalation or second-hand smoke. About 900,000 non-smokers are dying due to breathing in second-hand smoke.
The theme for this year is “Tobacco and heart disease,” which focuses on the connection between tobacco and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including stroke, heart attack, coronary heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease. WHO also provides information about how to reduce risks, assistance with smoking cessation, and suggests measures which governments and the public can take to decrease the negative effects of smoking tobacco.
According to the MOHW, in 2015, there were 420 million people worldwide suffering from CVD, which is the leading cause of death. Tobacco contributes about 17 percent to all CVD and heart disease-related deaths; tobacco is second only to high blood pressure in causing CVD. Out of the 1 billion smokers worldwide, about 80 percent are of low- and middle-income families and countries, in which the tobacco-related diseases and deaths have the greatest impact.
Lin Chün-li (林俊立), president of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology, reveals that many people think that smoking a little will not affect their health. According to MOHW, a study shows smoking as little as one cigarette a day increases the chances of a heart attack by nearly 50% (48% for men and 57% for women), and the chances of a stroke increases by more than 20% (25% for men and 31% of women); however, from the moment one quits smoking, CVD risks are immediately reduced by 36%.
Yeh Hung-i (葉鸿毅), president of the Taiwan Society of Lipids and Arteriosclerosis, emphasized that there is absolutely no so-called "safe smoking amount.” He pointed out that smokers often think that smoking a cigarette a day, or smoking “a little bit,” will not hurt the body, however, it is a grave mistake.
Doctors have said that the harmful substances in the cigarettes will cause the heart and blood vessels to be in an oxygen-deficient state for a long time, which also leads to inflammation.
Yeh also illustrated how human blood vessels are like a rubber tube. At first, the wall was very clean and flexible. However, as soon as one starts smoking, dirt would build up on the inner walls of the vessels, making them lose their elasticity and durability as time goes by. If they become cracked, it can be life threatening.
Yeh emphasized that about 15 percent of adults in Taiwan are habitual smokers. Even more frightening is that up to 60 percent of patients who have been treated for CVD have continued smoking.
In addition, many electronic cigarettes in recent years have claimed to have a smoking cessation effect, which is a big myth for those trying to quit smoking. Yeh stressed that the biggest problem with electronic cigarettes is that no one knows what has been added to the tobacco.
Some reports have pointed out that electronic cigarettes are often the first step leading to the use of tobacco products and drugs by youngsters. For those wanting to quit smoking, it is suggested to use smoking cessation patches and chewing gums for the best results.
Taiwan's toll-free quit smoking consultation hotline: 0800-63-63-63. There are more than 4,000 smoking cessation service contract agencies throughout Taiwan, to inquire, call: 02-2351-0120. Also contact your primary care physician, or consult with the local health bureaus to learn more about smoking cessation counseling or services.

Stony Plain will hold a second public hearing over proposed Cannabis legislation after making changes to the Town's proposed land-use bylaw following the first public hearing on May 28.
During the May 28 public hearing and regular council meeting, Town council debated the best practices for regulating the sale and use of Cannabis within Stony Plain. A land-use bylaw amendment was constructed from the results of a community survey in circulation from April 9 to May 18, as well as the suggestions from the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC). A total of 1,083 residents and business owners responded to the survey, which honed its sights on the best practices for cannabis retail stores and home cultivation of cannabis.
Results from the survey showed that 56 per cent of respondents supported the legalization of cannabis and that 59 per cent thought that the Town should prohibit cannabis retailers from operating within 100-metres of child-firendly locations such as daycares, playgrounds, public parks and sports fields. Results also showed 53 per cent of respondents said they were unlikely to grow cannabis in their home.
Paul Hanlan, General Manager of Planning and Infrastructure with the Town, said that It's important to have public input when dealing with controversial issues such as this.
“Public participation is important whenever we're creating or amending bylaws surrounding a potentially controversial subject,” he said. “The purpose of the proposed land-use bylaw amendments and cannabis survery was to assess how the residents and business owners of Stony Plain felt about the subject and to confirm whether or not additional adjustments to the proposed bylaw were needed after First Reading. We're pleased to see most stakeholders are in agreement with the proposed bylaw amendments.”
During the public hearing, a number of residents spoke publicly on the matter, with many speaking out about the 100-metre buffer zones which could potentially be increased to 200-metres, effectively shutting out a large area of Stony Plain's downtown which would then be off limits for retailers.
No one spoke in opposition of the proposed legislation.
After the public hearing, council debated the feedback they had received and ultimately made a number of changes to the proposed bylaw including an amendment they would require a 200-metre distance between approved cannabis retail stores, and an increase in distance from schools and health facilities from 100 metres to 200 metres.
Council also passed a motion to reinstitute a business-license fee bylaw for retailers of cannabis and those wishing to produce cannabis commercially.
Because of those changes, the Town will be holding another public hearing on June 25 at 6 p.m.
MIAMI (AP) — A Miami police officer has been charged with being part of a fraud scheme that falsely promised investors high returns on loans to property in Costa Rica.
The Miami U.S. Attorney's Office said in a news release Tuesday that 41-year-old Officer Dermis Hernandez is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors say Hernandez falsely promised investors big profits by putting their money into loans for people buying property in Costa Rica.
Instead, prosecutors say Hernandez and others used most of the money for themselves and to pay returns of earlier investors in a classic Ponzi scheme.
Miami police say Hernandez has been with the department since 2004 and is a member of the marine patrol unit.
It wasn't immediately clear Tuesday if Hernandez had a lawyer to represent him.
JOHNSON CITY — If you're a golf ball, you don't want to be on a tee anywhere near Chloe Garner.
“I try to swing for the roof sometimes for sure,” said Garner. It's fun.”
The ETSU women's assistant coach can crush a ball, as displayed last week in Nevada. Garner defeated the reigning World Long Drive Champion, Phillis Meti, to win the World Long Drive Clash in the Canyon title with a drive of 342 yards. It was a bit of redemption for Garner, who fell to Meti in the World Long Drive Championship in 2016.
“It's been amazing,” said Garner. “There's been a lot of hype, a lot of support from a lot of people and it's been trying to manage that and not get too carried away and ahead of myself.”
Garner is at the top of her sport. But a few years ago, this moment looked like it may never happen, as the former Buccaneer stepped as far away from the greens as she could.
“I lost confidence in myself as a player and if you do that in golf, you're just kind of dead from there,” Garner said. “I didn't touch my clubs for like three years.”
But a trip to Crossfit Johnson City changed her outlook.
“I feel really heavily into crossfit and I started training in there,” said Garner. “The time I wasn't spending golfing was now being put into crossfit. I thought, ‘I wonder with this increased strength that I have, what can I do?' So it was nice to get away from golf for a little bit and kind of get that drive back.”
Now that drive has now turned her into one of the best long drivers in the sport in just two years.
“The fact it happened so quickly, I mean, I feel very lucky for that,” Garner said. “There's not normally that instant gratification.”
Garner has two more World Long Drive Competitions this year, competing in the Mile High Showdown in Denver in July and the World Long Drive Championship in Oklahoma in September. Both competitions will be broadcast on the Golf Channel.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — At least 15 Mississippi companies are heading to the Middle East next month in the hopes of establishing new partnerships.
The Clarion-Ledger (http://on.thec-l.com/2lPofQX ) reports that the businesses will be visiting Dubai and Jordan in late March as part of a Mississippi Development Authority trade mission.
Citing Dubai's expansive and continual growth, MDA Executive Director Glenn McCullough Jr. said the region was ripe with opportunity for partnerships with Mississippi companies.
Companies that will be going on the trip include Belmont-based air compressor manufacturer Wood Industries, as well as Hattiesburg-based Bio Soil Enhancers, a company that manufactures microbial products to improve crop production without fertilizers.
More than 100 Mississippi companies, large and small, went on MDA-hosted trade missions last year. The group has 10 international trade missions planned for 2017.

He added that the league divvied up the money from national television and merchandise deals evenly among the teams. “Whether you're in Buffalo or New York, you get the same share of revenue,” he said. “The only difference is the venue revenues.”
Each team, no matter its record, received about $244 million in 2016 from television revenue alone. Add in tens of millions of dollars from merchandise revenue, and a team has enough money for its entire payroll before a ticket is sold.
For billionaires, the lure can be enticing. But what does it take to become the next member of the exclusive N.F.L. team owners club? Here are four things buyers should consider.
The Buyer's Motivation
Photo
When Arthur Blank, a co-founder of Home Depot, bought the Atlanta Falcons in 2002 from the team's original owners, he committed to making the Falcons better for the city. The same could be said for Robert McNair, who worked for four years to persuade the N.F.L. to return to Houston in 2002.
“You want to determine what the primary motivation of the buyer is,” said Joseph A. Bailey III, who was the chief executive of the Miami Dolphins a decade ago, during Wayne Huizenga's ownership of the team. He said many incentives drove bidders, including asset appreciation, a sense of civic duty, access to other owners, a legacy for family heirs or simply a love of the sport.
Mr. Bailey, who runs the sports leadership practice at RSR Partners, said that if he were consulting a buyer on the purchase of the Panthers, he would determine that motivation and structure the bid accordingly.
The Team's Potential
Photo
All N.F.L. teams generate an incredible amount of money, but not all franchises have the same aura. Jerry Jones, the charismatic and forthright owner of the Dallas Cowboys, is in a league of his own for promoting and monetizing the value of his team, which is said to be the most valuable sports franchise in the world.

He is also the only owner to have opted out of the shared revenue agreement so that he can, for example, produce Cowboys apparel on his own and keep all the revenue from it.
But if you're not buying a team like the Cowboys, or for that matter the New England Patriots, who are vying for their sixth Super Bowl victory on Sunday, you have to consider the team's potential. A popular team can bring in extra revenue from the fans who buy seats, hot dogs and beer at the stadium.
It all comes down to marketing. For instance, Shahid Khan, owner of Jacksonville Jaguars since 2012, has to compete with two other professional football teams and a half-dozen major college football programs in Florida.
Mr. Bailey said Mr. Khan was giving his team a more international presence to distinguish it from other teams. The team has played in London every year since 2013 — to the point where The Guardian called the Jaguars “London's team,” a play on the “America's Team” moniker embraced by the Cowboys.
The Seller's Desires

Determining what the seller wants in a buyer isn't always straightforward. Clint Murchison Jr., who owned the Cowboys from their creation in 1960 to 1984, had specific criteria for a buyer.
“He wanted to sell it to someone who was a Texan and lived in Dallas and had a real affinity for the state,” said Mr. Bailey, who worked for the Cowboys from 1970 to 1989.
Mr. Murchison chose Harvey Bright, a Texas businessman known as Bum, who made his money investing in oil and gas. Mr. Bright sold the team to Mr. Jones in 1989.
Some sellers want to keep the team in the family, Mr. Bailey added, while others seek “a pure transaction.” Still others look for a buyer who will allow them to remain a limited partner.

Mr. Ganis of Sportscorp said he expected Mr. Richardson to seek a buyer for the Panthers who would do right by his partners: “Knowing him, he will fulfill his fiduciary obligations to his partners, which is more in line with the highest and best proposal that is likely to pose the fewest issues to the N.F.L.”
The League's Blessing
Photo
The final factor is that the buyer has to be someone the league wants. At the end of the day, three-quarters of the 32 owners need to approve the sale of a team.
“There's a limited group of people who are predisposed to buying a team,” said Bob Reif who was the chief marketing officer of the Rams from 2005 to 2016, during a time when they were sold and moved to Los Angeles from St. Louis. “It's rare the N.F.L. doesn't know who's going to come up as an owner.”
Mr. Khan had bid on the Rams and seemed poised to prevail, but in the 11th hour, Stan Kroenke, who owned part of the team, exercised the option to buy the rest. Mr. Khan was able to buy the Jaguars, the next team that came up for sale.
“When you're buying a team, you're not only making a deal between you and the seller, you also have to get the blessing from the N.F.L.,” said Anthony Di Santi, global head of sports finance and advisory at Citi Private Bank. “The buyer and seller can agree on price, but if the league doesn't like the buyer or doesn't like the price, it's not going to happen.”
BIDWELL, Ohio — Regardless of the records, these teams were about as even as they could be.
The unbeaten Southern and winless River Valley boys basketball teams were tied after the first half, at the end of regulation and at the conclusion of the first overtime in a non-conference battle on Saturday, but the visiting Tornadoes earned a two-point edge in the second extra session and escaped Gallia County with a 73-71 victory.
The Tornadoes (3-0) — who've surpassed the 70-point plateau in each of their games this winter — claimed a 20-15 lead eight minutes into play, allowing the Raiders (0-4) to sink just three field goals in the stanza.
River Valley — which posted a season-high in points on Saturday — made up the five-point margin in the second quarter, outscoring the Purple and Gold by a 16-11 clip, while holding SHS to just a trio of field goals to tie the game at 31.
On the strength of two trifectas in the third quarter, Silver and Black outscored their guest by a 14-11 tally, and the hosts headed into the fourth ahead 45-42.
In the fourth quarter, both teams sank six field goals, including a pair of three-pointers apiece. However, Southern sank 5-of-9 free throws in the period, while RVHS made just 2-of-6, leaving the teams tied at 61.
Both squads scored three points in the first overtime session, River Valley on a Rory Twyman three-pointer and Southern on a Coltin Parker two-pointer and a Brayden Cunningham free throw.
In the second overtime, Twyman hit another trifecta for the hosts, while Dustin Barber and Matthew Mollohan both contributed a two-pointer to the RVHS cause. Meanwhile, the Tornadoes made just one field goal — a Weston Thorla two-pointer — but had five players combine to make 7-of-9 free throws, sealing the 73-71 victory.
With five players in double-figures scoring for the second straight game, Southern was led by Parker with 14 points, nine of which came from beyond the arc. Cunningham, Thorla and Dylan Smith scored 13 points apiece for the victors, while Trey McNickle poured in 10. Jensen Anderson had seven points in the victory, while Austin Baker came up with three.
In addition to Parker's trio of three-pointers, Thorla and Anderson both sank a triple in for the guests.
For the Raiders, Barber led the way for scoring 22 points, 10 of which came from the charity stripe. Jarret McCarley was next for RVHS with 14 points, followed by Twyman with 11 and Layne Fitch with seven. Patrick Brown and Chase Caldwell both had six markers, Mollohan and Kyle Coen added two points apiece, while Jordan Lambert rounded out the team total with one point.
Twyman connected on a trio of three-pointers for the Silver and Black, Caldwell hit a pair of trifectas, while McCarley and Fitch made one each.
For the game, Southern shot 24-of-35 (68.5 percent) from the free throw line, where River Valley was 18-of-28 (64.3 percent).
This was the lone scheduled meeting between RVHS and SHS this season. Both teams get back to action in their respective leagues on Tuesday, with the Raiders hosting Vinton County, and the Tornadoes traveling to Trimble.

Astronauts Go Spacewalking To Service Lab's Robot Arm
Spacewalking astronauts gave a hand to the International Space Station's big robot arm Tuesday. As the federal government geared back up 250 miles below, NASA astronauts Mark Vande Hei and Scott Tingle floated outdoors to install the new mechanical gripper.
Because of the lingering effects of the government shutdown, the spacewalk got started in the morning without live coverage on NASA TV. An on-air message simply stated: "We regret the inconvenience." Nearly an hour into the spacewalk, however, NASA TV came alive and began broadcasting the event with typical blow-by-blow commentary.
Space station operations were largely unaffected by the three-day shutdown. Considered essential personnel, Mission Control kept watch as usual at Johnson Space Center in Houston.
Vande Hei performed a similar spacewalk last October, when he replaced the first of two original hands on the Canadian-built arm. This second new hand will go on the opposite end of the 58-foot arm, able to move like an inchworm by grabbing hold of special fixtures.
The bulky bundle of latches -- more than 3 feet, or a meter, long and weighing more than 440 pounds, or 200 kilograms -- needed to be replaced because of wear and tear. It's been in orbit, grabbing cargo capsules and performing other chores, since 2001.
Tingle had to use extra muscle to release a stubborn bolt securing the spare mechanical arm.
"Nice work," Vande Hei said. "And the crowd goes wild," chimed in Mission Control.
Next, the spacewalkers wrested the old, degraded hand from the robot arm. It was the first spacewalk for Tingle, who arrived last month, and the third for Vande Hei.
"Make us proud out there," astronaut Joe Acaba told the spacewalkers from inside. "We'll have hot chowed for you when you get back."
Vande Hei will go back out Monday with another astronaut to finish the job. Then the two Russians on board will conduct a spacewalk Feb. 2 to install a new antenna on their country's side of the outpost.
The space station is home to three Americans, two Russians and one Japanese.

Associated Press
PHOENIX (AP) - Voters in a Republican-heavy Arizona congressional district headed to the polls Tuesday as a Democratic newcomer looked to pull off an upset victory for an open U.S. House seat held by Republicans since the early 1980s.
Hiral Tipirneni, an emergency room physician and a cancer research advocate, is hoping to replicate Democratic wins in Pennsylvania, Alabama and other states in a year where opposition to President Donald Trump's policies have boosted the party's chances in Republican strongholds.
Still, many observers in Arizona see Tipirneni's odds as slim against the Republican, former state Sen. Debbie Lesko. Trump won the district by 21 points in 2016.
At a polling place in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, a stream of voters made their way into a church meeting room converted into a polling place, including Larry Bettis, a retiree who consistently votes Republican and wants Trump to build the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border
"I voted for Lesko, and I don't know why," Bettis said. "I guess it's better the enemy you know than the one you don't know."
Ken Buedel, an active Democratic Party volunteer, said he was optimistic about the possibility that Tipirneni could win, or at least get a larger percentage of votes than Democrats in the past. He drove Democratic canvassers around the suburbs northwest of Phoenix as the election approached.
"I think Dr. Tipirneni is a terrific candidate and if she gets elected, I think she'll do real well," said Buedel, who is originally from Chicago. "She's the best candidate I can imagine to help turn this red district more blue."
Lesko and Tipirneni are competing in a special election to replace former Rep. Trent Franks in Arizona's 8th District, who resigned in December amid sexual misconduct allegations.
Lesko represented parts of the district in the state Legislature since 2009 and has an extremely strong base of support in a district Franks had locked up since 2003.
She's opposed to Tipirneni's push to expand government-run health care, backs the president's tax cuts and is pushing his border wall proposal.
"I support securing the border, and part of that is paying for and putting up a border wall where it makes sense," Lesko said. She said her opponent "is on record of opposing any money going toward the border wall. This is not what our constituents want."
Tipirneni is pushing a plan that would allow people under retirement age to opt in to Medicare coverage to provide new competition in health care markets, and opposes a wall while boosting enforcement through technology and drones and adding Border Patrol agents. She also said the fastest growing segment of immigrants in the U.S. illegally overstayed visas.
"To me a wall is not an answer, and quite frankly a lot of people have chimed in on a bi-partisan basis that a wall is not the answer," she said.
Tipirneni is seen as a fresh Democratic face with relatively moderate views that could get support during an optimistic year for her party. "I think there are a lot of recent elections to suggest that conventional wisdom doesn't necessarily apply," she said. "There's a lot of enthusiasm in our base."
The numbers strongly favor Lesko - in the Feb. 27 primary, 2 out of 3 ballots were cast for a Republican. The district sprawling across western Phoenix suburbs includes some of the most conservative areas of the red state, including the retirement communities of Sun City and the Glendale home of former GOP Gov. Jan Brewer, who never lost an election and campaigned for Lesko in a 12-way GOP primary.
National Republican groups are spending big to back Lesko. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy flew in for a fundraiser last week. Lesko welcomes the spending from national GOP organizations.
"Not only do I want to win, but I want to win by a lot so the Democrats can see that they don't have a chance in a red district," she said in a recent interview.
National Democratic groups haven't committed money to ads in the race, but in recent weeks, some progressive groups have been spending to back Tipirneni, and she has been running non-stop TV ads in recent days.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 23, 2018--Prophecy Development Corp. (“ Prophecy ” or the “ Company ”) ( TSX:PCY, OTCQX:PRPCF, Frankfurt:1P2N ) announces an amendment to the Gibellini mineral lease agreement dated June 22, 2017 (the “ MLA ”), whereby Prophecy has been granted the right to cause the current holder (the “ Lessor ”) of the Gibellini mineral claims (which Prophecy is currently leasing) to transfer their title to the claims to Prophecy.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180423005223/en/
(Graphic: Business Wire)
Mineral Lease Agreement Background:
Under the MLA, Prophecy agreed to pay the Lessor, annual advance royalty payments which will be tied, based on an agreed formula (not to exceed US$120,000 per year), to the average vanadium pentoxide price of the prior year. Upon commencement of production by Prophecy, the Company will stop advance royalty payments and instead pay to the Lessor, a 2.5% net smelter return ( “NSR” ) until a total of US$3 million is paid. Thereafter, the NSR will be reduced to 2% over the remaining life of the mine (and referred to thereafter, as “production royalty payments”). All advance royalty payments made, will be deducted as credits against future production royalty payments.
Prophecy leased the Gibellini mineral claims (which comprise the majority of the resource per the Company's news release dated November 20, 2017) with the intent to develop and operate a mine on the claims. In addition, Prophecy has either staked or acquired an additional 24 square kilometers surrounding the leased mining claims in the past 9 months for its proposed processing facility and potential future resource expansion.
Details of the Amendment:
With the amendment, Prophecy shall have the option to, at any time during the term of the MLA, require the Lessor to transfer title over all of the leased, unpatented lode mining claims (excluding four claims which will be retained by the Lessor for sentimental reasons and which contain minimal resource) (the “ Transferred Claims ”) to Prophecy in exchange for US$1,000,000, to be paid as an advance royalty payment (the “ Transfer Payment ”). A credit of US$99,027.22 in favour of Prophecy towards the Transfer Payment is already paid upon signing of the amendment, with the remaining US$900,972.78 portion of the Transfer Payment due and payable by Prophecy to the Lessor upon completion of transfer of the Transferred Claims from the Lessor to Prophecy. The advance royalty obligation and production royalty shall not be affected, reduced or relieved by the transfer of title.
John Lee, Prophecy's Executive Chairman, states: “With the rights to the title transfer secured, Prophecy can now engage in in-depth discussions with cornerstone investors, vanadium product off-takers and banks on equity, debt and prepaid off-take financing. Talks are already underway and we expect to report material progress in due course.”

‘More than five billion could lack water by 2050'
Image: Shutterstock
More than five billion people could suffer water shortages by 2050 due to climate change, increased demand and polluted supplies.
That's according to a new report from the UN, which suggests this could lead to severe conflict unless actions are taken to reduce the stress on rivers, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs.
The UN says around 4,600 cubic kilometres of water are used every year – roughly 70% of this is used in agriculture, 20% by industry and 10% to supply the world's households.
Global demand for water has increased sixfold over the past century and continues to grow at the rate of 1% each year.
Combined with world population potentially rising to 10.2 billion, up from 7.7 billion today, this means up to 5.7 billion people could live in water-scarce areas by 2050, up from 3.6 billion today.
This is expected mainly to occur across Mexico, western South America, southern Europe, China, Australia and South Africa.
The number of people at risk of floods is also expected to increase from 1.2 billion to 1.6 billion.
Such issues are already becoming apparent – residents of Cape Town are currently facing severe water rations as water runs out.
The New York Times has learned that an employee of the organization was paid $25,000 in 2015 as part of an agreement that concealed her allegations that Mr. Martin had groped and propositioned her in his apartment during what was supposed to be a work meeting.
In an interview, she said the August 2015 incident changed her life.
“I joined JLUSA to empower people and instead had all the power taken away from me,” the woman, 32, said. “I was rendered powerless and silenced while he was empowered with an even bigger microphone.”
The encounter took place when the organization was still forming a board. The review of the employee's allegations and the confidential agreement made with her were handled by Arabella Advisors, a philanthropy services firm that manages the New Venture Fund, one of the early nonprofit supporters of JustLeadershipUSA.
As part of the agreement, which The Times have reviewed, the woman had promised not to discuss the allegations or money she received. She said she agreed to termination and $25,000 in compensation after declining an offer to remain with the nonprofit but to work from home.
When she learned of Mr. Martin's resignation, she suspected that there were other instances of misconduct. After she was contacted by The Times, she said she had decided to breach the nondisclosure pact because she wanted to support other women who had talked to The Times about their experiences with Mr. Martin.
Two of those women, both of whom work for criminal justice nonprofits, said in interviews that they were subjected to lewd acts by Mr. Martin — incidents that occurred after the confidential agreement with the former employee. In separate incidents, in 2016 and 2017, the women said, Mr. Martin masturbated in front of each of them.
Like the former employee, the two other women said they wanted to preserve their privacy, and they agreed to be interviewed on the condition that their names not be published.

Mr. Martin, 47, through an attorney, denied any inappropriate conduct with the former employee or with the other two women.

“Glenn vehemently denies any of the allegations that are the subject of this article. These allegations are simply not true,” Keith White, his lawyer, said in a statement.
Vivian D. Nixon, chairwoman of the JLUSA board, said the employee never approached her about her concerns and that the “investigation and settlement were not shared with the founding JLUSA board of directors.”
At that time, JLUSA was still seeking tax-exempt status, so the New Venture Fund, a nonprofit based in Washington, D. C., acted as the group's fiscal sponsor and handled personnel matters.
“We were not made aware of any concerns by our fiscal sponsor about moving forward with the formation of JLUSA under Glenn Martin's leadership,” Ms. Nixon said in a statement.
Lee Bodner, president of the New Venture Fund, said in an emailed response to questions, “I talked to our lawyer, and everything here is covered by confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations and we cannot discuss them.”
On Tuesday, Ms. Nixon and the organization condemned abuse and harassment while also saying space needed to be made for both victims and offenders to heal.
JLUSA now has about two dozen employees and has secured millions of dollars from big-name charities, including the Ford Foundation, Google.org and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the foundation started by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. In 2016, Mr. Martin was appointed to a commission to look into Rikers. Last year, he starred in a commercial urging Mayor Bill de Blasio to close Rikers.

But in its early days, the organization was based in Mr. Martin's Harlem apartment and had a small staff. The employee who later made her accusations said she was inspired to work for the group because many of her relatives had been incarcerated and, in her view, unfairly punished by the justice system.
On a Monday in August 2015, the woman and another employee stuffed envelopes for a fund-raiser at Mr. Martin's apartment from around 4 p.m. until 7 p.m. The woman said it was the first time she had been in Mr. Martin's home.

After the woman and the other employee left, she glanced down at her phone at around 7:30 p.m. and saw that Mr. Martin had texted her at 7:09 p.m. “Was going to ask u to get a drink with me and discuss JLUSA 2016 planning.”
She returned to his building for the meeting. For about two hours, they talked about work over a bottle of wine. But at around 10:15 p.m., Mr. Martin shifted the tone of the conversation and told her he was attracted to her, she said.
The woman detailed her account of the night's events in an email two days later to human resources at Arabella Advisors.
Mr. Martin “comes toward me and kisses me. He touches my face, shoulder, waist, breasts. I shake my head. I say no and look down at the ground for a while and his hands are all over me. He tells me he fantasizes about me all the time. He says I need to let him get this out of his system. That phrase is said at least three times until I leave.”
His advances, including requests to join him in his bedroom, continued. “He repeatedly said he's not going to sleep with me but that I should come into the bedroom with him,” she wrote in the email, which The New York Times has reviewed.

The woman finally left, receiving a text from Mr. Martin at 10:48 p.m. “Let me know when you're safe.”
She responded at 10:54 p.m., “Home now.”
Shaken, the woman told her husband what happened that night. In the following days, she said she also told Arabella and David Mensah, a consultant who still works with JLUSA. Mr. Mensah did not respond to messages for comment. Arabella referred questions to the New Venture Fund.

On Thursday, a few days after the incident, Arabella's senior director of human resources responded, “Just wanted to quickly let you know that I have received this email and will be circling back with you very soon. I also wanted to say that I'm very sorry to hear this happened to you.”
The next month, the woman officially left and agreed to accept the payment. In an email on Sept. 10, 2015, the senior human resources director said Mr. Martin would be informed that she was leaving and would inform other staff. “As discussed previously the communication will be neutral and absent any of the details about what happened or the terms of this agreement,” the director wrote.
About four months later in January or February of 2016, another woman, 35, said she met Mr. Martin at a panel discussion, and then he pursued her through direct messages on Facebook. Interested in talking to him about justice reform, she said she accompanied Mr. Martin to his apartment one evening.
She said she found him attractive, but a chat over wine took a lewd and unexpected turn after Mr. Martin went to his bedroom. She said he was lying on the bed and asked her to join him, which she said she declined to do. “The best way to describe it was a whining ‘Why don't you want me?'” she recalled.
He then pulled out his penis and masturbated, she said. “I felt paralyzed. I couldn't move or walk away. I couldn't. I was stuck there,” she said, later adding, “I remember thinking, ‘He's not embarrassed?'”
She said she saw him once more, seeking an apology that she did not receive. She also tearfully told her new boss what had happened, because she feared Mr. Martin had spread a different story within the justice reform community.
“People would be drooling to hear him talk,” the woman said. “You look at this man and there's a trail of women who have been harmed. You're hurting the women that are doing the work.”
In February 2017, another woman, a 29-year-old social worker, met Mr. Martin when he visited her organization to talk about justice reform. He later encouraged her to apply for a job at JLUSA but almost immediately began to make unwanted advances, she said.

The advances, which the woman said she now views as harassment, contributed to her decision to withdraw her application, she said. Mr. Martin continued to contact her, and in March, she went to confront him at the office in Harlem, she said. “He tried to kiss me. He grabbed my neck. He tried to pull my pants down,” she said, noting that they were alone in the office.
She said she fended him off, but then he masturbated in front of her. She said she “froze.” “I was completely demoralized,” she said.
She spoke to two friends who confirmed to The Times that the woman told them what happened. One of the friends provided text messages that the woman sent her showing her concern about the earlier advances.
After Mr. Martin resigned, the woman approached The Times. She said she had been reluctant to speak out about Mr. Martin, who had become the face of criminal justice reform in the city.

“We had full intentions of coming either way,” said fan, Leroy Holiday.
Southern's homecoming game was moved up to 1 p.m. in preparation for potential severe weather expected to impact the state this weekend. “The game became secondary and making sure we followed whatever procedures and guidelines we had in place to promote safety on the Southern University campus was on the forefront,” said Chris Jones with Southern University.

Fans rescheduled their plans to come in a little early. "With the weather and everything coming, it does have an impact on us because of all the stuff we were looking forward to, but it doesn't change anything. It doesn't change my attitude or anything that's going on,” said DeShaun Fontenot, another fan.
On the corner of Curtis Street and Scenic Highway, a family is continuing a 5-year tailgating tradition. “We're the hard hitters and we don't care rain, sleet, or snow, whatever happens, we're going to be here. No matter what, we're dedicated Southern fans,” said Tim McKay, a devoted fan.
The die hard Southern University fans say nothing, not even severe weather can keep them from supporting their Jags. “I just enjoy doing it. I enjoy the people. I'm a people person and I love doing what I do," said Nathan Berry.

The Latest on a bill to increase oversight over the Hawaii fishing industry (all times local):
12:20 p.m.
A Hawaii committee has advanced a bill that seeks to provide more oversight of the commercial fishing industry after an Associated Press investigation found hundreds of foreign fishermen confined to boats and some living in subpar conditions.
The proposal advanced Tuesday would require fishing boat owners who want a commercial license to provide a copy of employment contracts with every fisherman on board before the state grants a license.
Rep. Kaniela Ing says that without access to employment contracts, there's no way to check whether fishermen are getting what they were promised, even if what they agreed to be horrendous.
Jim Cook of the Hawaii Longline Association says people agree to unfair contracts every day. He questions whether it's the state's responsibility to interfere in business between an individual and a company.

9 a.m.
Hawaii lawmakers are calling for more oversight of the commercial fishing industry after an Associated Press investigation found hundreds of foreign fishermen confined to boats and some living in subpar conditions.
A bill would require fishing boat owners who want a commercial license to provide to the state a copy of the employment contracts with every fisherman before the license is granted.
The fishing industry is pushing back, saying it's already highly regulated by the federal government. The industry also initiated a universal contract to be signed by crew members and boat owners.
Rep. Kaniela Ing says the universal contract and the idea of the industry policing itself are not enough.
Ing's bill is being heard in the House Committee on Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs on Tuesday.
Customers have been lining up to order some of Tesla's electric big rigs since the Semi debuted in November, but there is one big question: where will they get charged? According to Reuters, at first the rollout will rely on customers like Pepsi and UPS to build on-site "megachargers" and trucks will be restricted to going back and forth on routes that keep them near home base. Representatives for the companies confirmed they're working with Tesla to build in-house charging locations, however, the plan for a Supercharger-like network that could juice up trucks on the road is a bit fuzzier.

Preston came from behind to see off struggling Hull at Deepdale on Saturday.
Look back on the action as it happened.
Most people probably agree that working out is never the best part in a day; you feel uncomfortable, vulnerable, fatigued and would rather be doing just about anything else. Yet somehow at 5:30 a.m. on a Monday morning, dozens of Winston-Salem residents get downtown, step on a bike and ride their hearts out to loud music and encouraging instructors for 45 minutes.
Earlier this month, CycleBar, an indoor cycling franchise, opened a new location in downtown Winston-Salem. Originally offering a few weeks of free classes, the studio is now completely up and running, offering multiple classes a day with various instructors. The classes are unique — they're loud, difficult and focused on growth and strength. At the heart of the CycleBar story is an emphasis on personal wellbeing and health.
Dixon Douglas (‘06) grew up in Winston-Salem. After graduating from Wake Forest, he moved to Charlotte but eventually found his way back to his hometown, working in marketing and communications. His passion for physical fitness was sparked when he worked for a marketing firm whose client was Humana.
“One of the partnerships I brought Humana into was the Rock & Roll Marathons, so I would run with people and have meetings,” Douglas explained. “I would really just run with anyone and ask what drives them, and they always had a compelling story. I felt that I needed to bring this passion to Winston-Salem to provide a platform for health and wellbeing in this city.”
This passion for wellbeing and physical fitness has found a home in CycleBar, as people from all walks on their health journey strap into their bike and ride for the duration of 45-minute classes. The classes are set to the beat, meaning you ride to the music and adjust your difficulty and pace accordingly. They also feature basic choreography, arm exercises and stretching.
Charlotte Bristow, a senior at Wake Forest and one of the instructors at CycleBar, was always familiar with cycling and decided to try instructing after hearing about this new opportunity. After finding the courage to tryout, she doesn't regret her decision at all.
“I've been so happily surprised by the spirit and energy everyone has brought to class,” Bristow said. “So many of our riders have never been on a stationary bike before or taken a class like CycleBar, yet they come hooting and hollering through the class like seasoned spinners.”
Every new business has its bumps, but CycleBar has seemingly navigated theirs smoothly. As Douglas was sharing his insight behind starting his new passion project, he was simultaneously dealing with the internet being down, greeting customers and working to get new riders registered.
“Just starting a business always has bumps and bruises, but Wake Forest always taught me how to navigate these challenges,” Douglas said. “We expected to run into obstacles and prioritized how best to solve them.”
While fitness and wellbeing are at the heart of the new cycle studio, part of CycleBar's mission is to also fully invest itself in the Winston-Salem community. The company has already partnered with an organization that raises awareness for apert syndrome by offering free rides and taking donations to cover medical costs. This is only the first instance of community partnerships that the new studio hopes to continue to build in Winston-Salem, as they look to the future.
“I hope that it expands from just a place that people can exercise into an opportunity for everybody,” Douglas said. “What I really hope to see is that somehow CycleBar is in people's minds as a fundamental part of the Winston-Salem community and to continue to be able to work with other organizations to make health and wellbeing a centerpiece in Winston-Salem.”
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has justified its unwillingness to try to prosecute corporate criminals by insisting it must focus on the "efficiency and strength" of the financial system as well as its "fairness and integrity".

WASHINGTON (AP) — Whatever the motive of the shooter at a congressional baseball practice, some Republicans say that in the era of President Donald Trump, they're being threatened like never before.
They point to a virulent backlash against Trump that they say has gone beyond the bounds of moderate political dissent and – subtly or not – advocates violence.
“I've been saying, ‘What is it going to take for this to get some visibility,'” said Charlie Kirk, a young conservative activist. “And now here we are.”
During a news conference at the shooting scene Wednesday, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, declined to comment about whether America's political climate could be a factor. But he said, “There's too much, I believe, raw discourse that's pulling people apart.”
The gunman, identified as James T. Hodgkinson, opened fire Wednesday on Republican lawmakers and associates practicing baseball in a Virginia suburb outside Washington. A top House Republican, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, was critically wounded, as were several other people. Trump said the gunman had been killed.
Police haven't stated a motive. But Hodgkinson's strong anti-Republican stances and background as a former volunteer on Bernie Sanders campaign only added to suggestions that the shooting was politically motivated.
Such an assessment could be premature. Some initially attributed the 2011 shooting of Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords to intense partisanship, though that did not appear to be what motivated the gunman.
But prominent Republicans, including Trump's children, have long been unsettled by the rage against the president. Daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump said in a recent television interview that she did not expect the “viciousness” and “ferocity” of her father's critics.
Donald Trump Jr. is among those arguing that “liberal hate speech” leads to violence. He tweeted support for a comment by conservative political consultant Harlan Hill: “Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President.”
He was referring to a New York City production of “Julius Caesar” that portrays the assassinated title character looking like Trump in a business suit. That came on the heels of comedian Kathy Griffin posing with a bloodied rendering of Trump's head.
In both cases, there were consequences: lost sponsorships for the theatrical production and CNN dropping Griffin as host of its New Year's Eve special, despite her apology.
Kirk has been chronicling threats that get little attention outside conservative media.
John Griffin, a media arts and animation professor at the Art Institute of Washington, for example, commented on Facebook about the Republican health care plan, saying: “They should be lined up and shot. That's not hyperbole; blood is on their hands.”
When Kirk tweeted about the professor's threat, the University of Georgia chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists, a student group at the Athens campus, wrote, “This is absolutely outrageous! House Republicans should NOT be shot! They should be guillotined.”
Griffin later apologized on Facebook for using “inappropriate” language, but said it spoke to “the fear so many feel right now in this country.” Neither he nor the student group immediately responded to a request for comment Wednesday.
Democrats, in turn, point to Trump's rough language – he has urged on fights at his rallies – as justification for their own. And on Wednesday, House Democratic leader James Clyburn of South Carolina said plenty of Democrats have experienced the level of hatred as Republicans.
“I'm not a Republican. And I've had all kinds of threats against me and my family,” he said. “It's got nothing to do with partisan politics.”
Ben Shapiro, a conservative writer and radio show host, says the violent rhetoric from all viewpoints contributes to “worse politics in general.” But he warns it is a mistake to say that atmospherics causes any one act of violence.
“Yes, that sort of rage culture is destroying the country,” he said. What happened at the ballfield is “a symptom, but it's not the chief symptom.”
This year, lawmakers, particularly Republicans, have experienced rowdy, overflowing town halls that they say border on dangerous.
Rep. Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican, said he has been concerned that security for members is “nothing near what it needs to be.” He said town halls now often include “a thousand people screaming, and it only takes one person off the reservation” to cause a problem.

However, at 11.35pm on New Year's Eve Tyler's gran had passed away at home - just hours after he had snapped some final pictures wit her.
Mum Nicola Robertson, from Hebburn,is now offering a £100 reward if the phone can be found.
Nicola said: "He's absolutely devastated.
"He'd been to see his gran, who had been poorly for quite seem time, a bit earlier in the day and he took some picture of them together.
"She then sadly died a few hours later. His phone had run out of battery and when in the taxi home he'd asked his girlfriend to keep it and it must have dropped on the floor.
"We're not bothered about the actual phone, it's the pictures we want and they weren;t backed up."

Asian shares rose Thursday after U.S. stocks recovered most of their sharp losses from a day earlier than jitters over Italy's political situation subsided.
KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.8 percent to 22,201.82 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 1.1 percent to 30,385.50. The Shanghai Composite index rebounded 1.8 percent to 3,095.47 and Australia's S&P ASX 200 climbed 0.5 percent to 6,011.90. South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.6 percent to 2,423.01. Shares rose in Taiwan and were mostly higher in Southeast Asia.
WALL STREET: Banks and energy companies surged Wednesday as investors reversed course on hopes that Italy will be able to avoid a new round of elections. Stocks had plunged the previous day as investors expected the Italian gridlock would be resolved with new elections that could have turned into a yes-or-no referendum deciding whether Italy would continue to use the euro. The S&P 500 index jumped 1.3 percent to 2,724.01 and the Dow Jones industrial average also climbed 1.3 percent to 24,667.78. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.9 percent to 7,462.45. The Russell 2000 index surged 1.5 percent, closing at a record high of 1,647.99. Italy's FTSE MIB stock index climbed 2.1 percent after a 2.7 percent drop a day earlier. Prices for Italian government bonds also rose, sending yields down following a huge surge the day before.
CHINA MANUFACTURING: Chinese factory activity grew at its fastest rate in eight months on stronger demand, a survey showed Thursday, in a positive sign for the world's No. 2 economy despite trade tensions with the U.S. The official purchasing managers' index, or PMI, rose to 51.9 in May from 51.4 the previous month. Readings above 50 indicate expansion, while lower numbers indicate contraction on the index's 100-point scale.
ANALYST'S VIEWPOINT: "Today's strong set of official PMIs tell a reassuring story about current growth momentum. However, we will have to wait for more reliable indicators to be published in order to get a clearer picture of the health of China's economy," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary.
CHINA TRADE: China's government said Thursday it reserves the right to retaliate if Washington goes ahead with proposed investment controls Beijing said violate global trade rules. The Commerce Ministry's comment came as the two sides prepared for weekend talks in Beijing on American complaints about China's trade surplus and Beijing's promise to buy more American goods.
CURRENCIES: The euro rose to $1.1689 from $1.1664. The dollar fell to 108.66 yen from 108.89 yen.
ENERGY: U.S. crude oil slipped 25 cents to $67.96 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It jumped 2.2 percent on Wednesday to $68.21 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 43 cents to $77.29 per barrel. It added 2.8 percent to $77.50 a barrel in London. Oil prices fell 7.6 percent in five days following reports OPEC countries and Russia might start producing more oils soon.

It's the kind of goal that makes fans groan because, man, he probably should've stopped that.
A shooter skating down the wing or even behind the net fires the puck between a goaltender and the near post for a short-side goal. It looks like it shouldn't go in, but it has been happening a lot more this season as players figure out what goalies are doing ... or at least trying to do.
"Those goals, they don't look good, but I think if people knew how hard it was to do that maneuver, they might be a little less quick to jump to judgment on the goalies," Chicago Blackhawks goalie Scott Darling said.
That maneuver is called the "Reverse VH" and it's the most widespread way for goalies to cover the post and not allow soft goals to be scored. An opposite of the previously-used "VH" stance, it means a goalie's pad against the post is horizontal along the ice while the back leg is vertical.
The Reverse VH is more effective than its predecessor, but as NHL Network analyst and former goaltender Kevin Weekes has said : Short side has become the new five holes. And everyone in hockey knows it.
Brian Boucher, another retired goalie turned analyst, said you can't go two or three nights without seeing a short-side goal somewhere around the league . As recently as Thursday night, Colorado Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog went short side on Stanley Cup-winning Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Matt Murray on a textbook sharp-angle shot that looks like a bad goal but is more the product of shooters understanding techniques.
"Guys are realizing that the sharp-angle shots are extremely difficult to stop," Vezina Trophy-winning goalie Braden Holtby of the Washington Capitals said. "You do see more and more guys trying it because it's a high-quality scoring chance. Guys figure out trends now. They kind of figure them out a little quicker than they used to, which isn't great for us."
Jonathan Quick led the Los Angeles Kings to two Cups by using the Reverse VH and taking advantage of his Gumby-like athleticism. The stance, which originated in Sweden a few years before, took off in the NHL after Quick won the Cup in 2012 and now it's a go-to for most goalies.
Goaltending analyst Justin Goldman points out that when a skater is coming down the ice, there's actually more room for the puck on the short side than the far side because there's less distance for it to travel. More short-side goals isn't a result of the Reverse VH being a bad stance, but instead he believes it's goalies overusing it and losing the cat-and-mouse game between them and shooters.
Too often goalies drop to their knees into the Reverse VH and become sitting ducks for Alex Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby, Joe Pavelski and some of the best snipers around.
"The shooter knows the goalie's going to drop into this stance, which means he can release a puck a half a second or a half a step sooner than usual and he knows what his target is before he even looks up and sees where the goalie is," Goldman said. "They're almost over-anticipating what a shooter is going to do before he actually does it and the shooter has the capacity now, he has the wherewithal and he has the accuracy to pick that spot."
Darling thinks some goalies are still mastering the relatively new Reverse VH, and 2006 Cup-winner Cam Ward of the Carolina Hurricanes acknowledged he still uses the old VH style because he's more comfortable in it. Ward looks at Tuukka Rask of the Boston Bruins as someone who can push side-to-side with power out of the Reverse VH, and Goldman called 2013 Vezina winner Sergei Bobrovsky of the Columbus Blue Jackets the "posterchild" for doing it right.
"It's a tough position to get fully square, but when the puck's behind the net it gives you good coverage for pass outs and things like that," Philadelphia goaltender Steven Mason said. "It's complicated, but I think sometimes it can be overused."
Flyers teammate Jakub Voracek said he just shoots "wherever it's open," but that's often the short side nowadays. When the best shooters can anticipate a goalie going down early and putting the puck where he isn't, Goldman said it's so difficult to get back up that the key is being patient and staying upright longer.
"The problem is because goalies rely on this stance so often, they're dropping down into it before the puck is actually off the shooter's stick," Goldman said. "You want the shooter to make the first move. You want to hold your feet. You want to keep yourself as patient as possible so you read what the shooter does first and then you react."
Easier said than done, perhaps, even for the best in the game. A lot has changed since Boucher set the consecutive shutout record in 2003, and he doesn't even know if he'd be able to perfect the Reverse VH and deal with the expectations of goaltenders today.
"You've got to be in position to make the second and third saves because at the end of the day it's about keeping the puck out of the net," Boucher said. "Whether it's your fault or it's not your fault, if you don't keep it out of the net you're going to have a tough time winning games and you're going to have a tough time having a job."
MUSICAL COACHES
Michel Therrien became the fifth coach fired this season when the Montreal Canadiens canned him Tuesday and replaced him with Claude Julien, who was fired by Boston last week. Julien took five more days to get a new job than Bruce Boudreau did when fired by Washington on a November Monday in 2011 and joining the Anaheim Ducks on Wednesday.
MILESTONE WATCH
After registering a point Tuesday in the Penguins' win over Vancouver, Crosby is one away from 1,000 for his career . He's at 756 games now and will soon become the second-fastest active player to hit 1,000 after the ageless Jaromir Jagr.
GAME OF THE WEEK
The Blue Jackets host the Penguins on Friday in what very well could be a first-round playoff preview.
LEADERS
Points: Crosby (Pittsburgh), Connor McDavid (Edmonton), 61; Goals: Crosby, 30; Defenseman points: Brent Burns (San Jose), 59; Goals-against average: Devan Dubnyk (Minnesota), 1.97; Save percentage: Dubnyk, .933.

To the Editor:
New York's current system of rent regulations was created to correct the culture of disinvestment that resulted in a dramatic loss of rental housing throughout the 1970s and '80s. As a result of these changes, the condo and co-op conversion rates dropped significantly, owners and investors began to make capital investments in the city's rental housing, and vacancy decontrol stimulated a wave of new construction that is a part of the solution to the ongoing housing crisis.
Today our housing stock is in the best shape on record: The latest Census Housing and Vacancy Survey demonstrated that the quality of our rental housing has the lowest measured maintenance deficiencies since the first 1991 survey. The latest Rent Guidelines Board data showed a decline in distressed properties. Every year, owners spend over $10 billion improving New York's housing stock while creating 104,000 well-paying local jobs for employees who make repairs.
There are bad landlords who should be brought to justice for breaking the law, as well as bad tenants who abuse the rules. We support a renewed focus on providing rent regulation protections to those who genuinely need them and clear assessment to remove high-income tenants who don't belong in the system. However, there is no question that New York's system of rent regulations has improved the overall condition of the city's housing stock.
JOHN H. BANKS, NEW YORK
The writer is president of the Real Estate Board of New York.
To the Editor:
Bravo to The New York Times for describing housing court exactly as it is: an eviction machine where landlords drive the volume, bring questionable cases and are never punished. And just the threat of taking someone to court means that about a fourth of tenants moves out before the formal process. It is a weapon that landlords wield primarily against poor black and brown New Yorkers.
While the article mentions the right to counsel, it misses the strength and potential of this law that the tenant movement won. It is so much more than funding for free attorneys; the law emboldens tenants to organize and fight for their rights as the threat of eviction becomes less powerful. The knowledge that tenants have a right to an attorney will be a deterrent to landlords who would otherwise harass tenants, deny services and repairs or charge illegal rents.
Medicaid, a 1960s Great Society pillar long reviled by conservatives, seems to have emerged even stronger after the Republican failure to pass health overhaul legislation.
The federal-state health insurance program for low-income Americans hasn't achieved the status of Social Security and Medicare, considered practically untouchable by politicians, like an electrified "third rail." But it has grown to cover about 1 in 5 U.S. residents, ranging from newborns to Alzheimer's patients in nursing homes, and even young adults trying to shake addiction. Middle-class working people are now more likely to personally know someone who's covered.
Increased participation — and acceptance — means any new GOP attempt to address problems with the Affordable Care Act would be unlikely to achieve deep Medicaid cuts.
"This was an important moment to show that people do understand and appreciate what Medicaid does," said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, a nonpartisan group that represents state officials. "The more people understand what Medicaid is and what it does for them, the less interested they are in seeing it undermined."
With Republicans in control of the White House, both chambers of Congress, and 34 out of 50 governorships, it would have been hard to imagine a more politically advantageous alignment for a conservative overhaul of Medicaid.
President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to cover more low-income adults, many of them working jobs without health insurance. Thirty-one states have accepted the ACA's expansion, covering about 11 million people.
The GOP bills would have phased out funding for the Obama expansion, but they also placed a limit on future federal spending for the entire program — a step now seen as overreach.
The per-beneficiary spending caps in the House and Senate bills translated to deep cuts that divided Republicans.
Also, GOP governors who had expanded the program couldn't swallow the idea of denying coverage to hundreds of thousands of constituents. Some Republican governors went public with their opposition, while others quietly warned their congressional delegations about dire consequences.
"I think there is a recognition among many that Medicaid is not just a welfare program but an underpinning of our social system," said Diane Rowland of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
An AP-NORC poll taken last month found the public overwhelmingly opposed to GOP Medicaid cuts, by 62-22.
"You just can't do this to people who are in situations that they didn't put themselves in," said Sara Hayden of Half Moon Bay, California. Unable to work as a data journalist due to complications of rheumatoid arthritis, she was able to get health insurance when her state expanded Medicaid.
Hayden estimates that one of the medications she takes for the disease would cost about $16,000 a month if she were uninsured. She pays nothing with Medi-Cal, as the Medicaid program is known in California.
"If they are going to repeal and replace, then I am dead in the water," she said.
Brian Kline of Quakertown, Pennsylvania, works as a customer service representative, and got coverage after his state expanded Medicaid in 2015. Early last year he was diagnosed with colon cancer following a colonoscopy. After treatment that Medicaid paid for, his last CT scan was clear.
"You just wonder if the Republican bill had passed...what would have happened to me?" said Kline. "Would I have had access to my doctors and the tests to make sure my cancer didn't come back? I'm not sure what the answer to that question would have been."
Many Republicans view Obama's Medicaid expansion as promoting wasteful spending, because the federal government pays no less than 90 percent of the cost of care, a higher matching rate than Washington provides for the rest of the program.
"That is not a good recipe for encouraging states to implement better, lower-cost models of care," said Mark McClellan, who oversaw Medicare and Medicaid under former President George W. Bush.
Nonetheless, the debate showed Congress can't just elbow its way to a Medicaid overhaul.
'You are going to have to be gentle and thoughtful, working in a bipartisan way to see what ideas will reach across the aisle," said Republican economist Gail Wilensky, also a former Medicare and Medicaid administrator.
The push for Medicaid changes will now shift to the states. Some on the political right are seeking federal approval for work requirements and drug testing. But activists in the 19 states that have not yet expanded their programs are contemplating revived campaigns.
An area that could find bipartisan support is health promotion, since Medicaid beneficiaries tend to have higher rates of smoking and other harmful lifestyle factors.
Katherine Hempstead, who directs health insurance research for the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation says Medicaid has come out a "winner" in the debate.
"Medicaid has shown itself to be very much appreciated by a broader constituency than we might have originally thought," she said. "And that is an important takeaway."

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Monday spoke with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and stressed that unity and resistance of the “oppressed Palestinian people” and other Muslim nations will lead to the failure of the “U.S.-Zionist plan” to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Rouhani's remarks were quoted by the state-owned Iranian network PressTV.
The Latest on the announcement that Prime Minister Theresa May is seeking to call a general election on June 8 (all times local):
11:20 a.m.
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused her opponents of "political game-playing" and undermining the country in the upcoming talks to exit the European Union.
May said Tuesday that the divisions in Parliament explained her change of heart on an early election. Since becoming prime minister last July in the aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the EU, May had consistently said she would not seek an early election.
May said she has concluded that the "only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead is to hold this election."
Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, the next general election date was to be in 2020. But an early election can take place if two-thirds of lawmakers in the House of Commons vote for it. The opposition Labour Party, which trails May's Conservative Party in opinion polls, has said it supports such a move.

11:15 a.m.
Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is planning to call a general election for Thursday, June 8.
In a surprise statement in Downing Street, May said Parliament will be asked to vote for the election on Wednesday.
May's Conservative Party is way ahead of the main opposition Labour Party in opinion polls. A resounding win would bolster her mandate in upcoming talks with the European Union over the country's exit.
She said "division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit."

10:45 a.m.
The British pound has fallen amid mounting speculation that Prime Minister Theresa May is planning to call an early general election.
In the wake of an announcement that May will make an unexpected statement in Downing Street at 11:15 a.m. (1015GMT), the pound was down 0.3 percent at $1.2525.
May's office says she will speak after the weekly meeting of her Cabinet.
FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad says that "truth be told, nobody is really that aware of what is going on but this uncertainty has caused a reaction."
———
10:30 a.m.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is due to make an unexpected statement in Downing Street, triggering speculation that she plans to call an early election.
May's office says she will speak at 11:15 a.m. (1015GMT) Tuesday, after the weekly meeting of her Cabinet.
Such statements are generally reserved for major news, such as resignations and election calls.
May, who took office in July after predecessor David Cameron stepped down, could be tempted to go to the polls to secure her own mandate as she negotiates Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.
But she has previously said she will stay in office until the next scheduled national election, in 2020.
Under Britain's Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, the prime minister can call an election if two-thirds of lawmakers vote for it.
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — The ISU Four Continents figure skating championships are returning to the U.S. for the first time in seven years.
The meet is scheduled for Feb. 7-10 at Honda Center in Anaheim, California, home to the NHL's Anaheim Ducks.

SpaceX company announces that rockets which have been grounded since September explosion will return to service next week.
Elon Musk's SpaceX company announced that it has found the cause of a September launch pad explosion that destroyed a $300 million Israeli communications satellite.
The company's Falcon rockets have been grounded since the Sept. 1 explosion. SpaceX said in a statement that it expects to return to flight on January 8.
The statement posted on the SpaceX website on Monday said the explosion was caused by the failure of one of three helium tanks, known as composite overwrapped pressure vessels or COPVs, inside the liquid oxygen tank in the rocket's second stage. The loose liquid oxygen triggered a fuel explosion.
The investigation was overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Air Force, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Transportation Safety Board.
The unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was in the midst of a routine fueling test for its scheduled launch when it exploded. The explosion was felt throughout NASA's Cape Canaveral, Florida facility and for several miles around.
The rocket was scheduled to hoist into orbit the Amos 6 satellite, built by Israel Aerospace Industries and owned by Spacecom Ltd. in partnership with Eutelsat Communications of France. It was expected to operate for 16 years in part on behalf of Facebook and bring Internet connectivity to sub-Saharan Africa and television service to providers in Europe and the Middle East. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the project in June 2015.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies found that several of US President Donald Trump's associates, as well as several members of his campaign team, spoke numerous times with Russians prior to the November 2016 elections.
According to the New York Times, phone records and intercepted calls show Trump campaign officials and advisers repeatedly conversed with senior Russian government and intelligence officials. The conversations took place over a period of several months.
Four current and former US officials told the New York Times the communications were first discovered in the fall, around the same time as intelligence realized Russia posted disinformation to sabotage Hillary Clinton's campaign.
It is not clear what was discussed during the conversations, or if Trump was mentioned in them.
Authorities refused to identify which officials were involved, and were unable to find evidence connecting the phone calls to the cyberattack or foul play.
However, one of the officials in question is said to be Paul Manafort. Manafort served as Trump's campaign chairman for several months, and resigned after it became known that he had worked as a political consultant in both Russia and Ukraine.
The FBI also investigated consultant Roger Stone and former foreign policy adviser Carter Page. All of these completely denied any and all accusations. As part of their Trump investigation campaign, the FBI has also also obtained bank records, travel documents, and conducted interviews.
Manafort said, "This is absurd. I have no idea what this is referring to. I have never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers, and I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation today.
"It's not like these people wear badges that say, 'I'm a Russian intelligence officer.'"
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said no one in the Trump campaign had contact with Russia prior to the election and that "there is nothing that would conclude me [sic] that anything has changed in the meantime."
The calls in question are completely separate from the ones Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn reportedly had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

DEAR MADAM PRESIDENT
An Open Letter to the Women Who Will Run the World
By Jennifer Palmieri
180 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $20.
Not long after Hillary Clinton's unexpected defeat to Donald J. Trump, her campaign's communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, shopped around a book idea. “I was advised that if I didn't have something juicy to share about Hillary, there wouldn't be interested in me,” she writes in “Dear Madam President: An Open Letter to the Women Who Will Run the World.” But, she adds, using Clinton's frequent description of herself, “there aren't any juicy things to share about Hillary because she's a simple and serious person.”
In any other election year, an advice book from a high-ranking campaign official on the losing candidate's side wouldn't have much coin. But 2016 wasn't like any other election year, and as it turns out Palmieri has plenty of wisdom — and even a little dish about Clinton — to dispense.
In this slim volume, Palmieri neatly weaves her heartbreaking personal story of losing her sister to Alzheimer's weeks after losing the election with lessons learned from her long career in Democratic politics and Mitch Albom-style wisdom (“When the unimaginable happens, imagine what else may be possible”). Palmieri had been President Obama's White House communications director when she agreed to join the Clinton campaign. She (like most of us) thought Clinton would win and didn't think her gender would be much of an obstacle, especially after Obama had broken racial barriers.

Clinton warned Palmieri otherwise. Before the race started, Clinton “held forth for more than an hour” to recap each scandal, from the uproar in Arkansas when she resisted taking Bill Clinton's name to the White House and her doomed 2008 presidential campaign. “She was as bewildered as anyone by the phenomenon of ‘Hillary Clinton,'” Palmieri writes.

Flash forward to the day after the November election and Palmieri has started to see almost everything about the public's perception of Clinton through the prism of gender. She seethes at the supporters who ask her why Clinton couldn't have struck the emotional notes of her concession speech during the campaign. “‘Yes, I'm sure you loved her concession speech,' I thought. ‘Because that's what you think is acceptable for a woman to do — concede.'”
Transcript for Stocks plunged 666 points Friday
Back here at home, to the economy, and the markets' worst week in two years. Friday's Dow nose-diving, reflecting a variety of jitters. ABC's Rebecca Jarvis with more. Reporter: Tonight fear that the market free-fall will continue. Stocks plunging 666 points Friday. The worst day for the Dow since June 2016. But even with those declines the major averages still up 28% over the last year. Behind the numbers, a tale of two economies. I see the tradesmen busy here in Tucson and I know our business back in Michigan is as busy as it's ever been in 25 years. Reporter: Some Arizona voters sitting down with Tom llamas describing a booming economy, but others say they're not feeling it. I see a lot of poverty. Eporter: Since the financial crisis, stock ownership has dropped from 62% to just 54%. And while dozens of corporations has handed out raises and bonuses after the tax cuts and wages are growing at their highest pace in eight years, many employees have yet to see the benefit.

Detroit Tigers ace Justin Verlander apparently isn't worried he might be tipping his pitches.
The right-hander tweeted "working on my tipping" Monday with a gif of himself drinking a beer in a pool.
Verlander matched a career high by allowing nine runs Saturday in the Indians' 13-6 win over the Tigers. gave up 11 hits in four-plus innings, including home runs by Carlos Santana and Lonnie Chisenhall. The 2011 AL Cy Young Award winner and MVP also gave up nine runs against the Chicago White Sox on April 6, 2008, and versus Texas on May 25, 2014.
Manager Brad Ausmus said Verlander and catcher James McCann changed their signals throughout the game as a precaution against signs being stolen.
On Sunday, McCann strongly hinted that he believed Verlander was tipping his pitches.
"We use multiple signs with nobody on base. We change our signs often. It's got to be something other than that," McCann told reporters, according to mlive.com.
"For a day where I thought he had his best stuff all season, they seemed to be on quite a few pitches," McCann said. "What that is, I don't know. We're going to study film and see."
Indians manager Terry Francona said his team wasn't stealing signs.
"I'm just happy when our guys get our signs -- and I'm being serious about that."
Asked if he thought Verlander might be tipping his pitches, Ausmus told reporters: "Could be."
"Hitters are always trying to find an edge on pitchers. And looking for a pitcher tipping is standard operating procedure. I can't tell you whether it is or isn't. Only the Indians could tell you that, and they probably won't," he said, according to mlive.com.

There are three reasons to watch the Outback Bowl between the Florida Gators and Iowa Hawkeyes at 1 p.m. this afternoon:
You attended one of the schools and university pride is important to you
You hate yourself
You crave a free appetizer from Outback Steakhouse and you're pulling for it to be coconut shrimp or a bloomin' onion
In the interest of marketing, branding and bowl season, Outback is again giving away a bloomin' onion if the SEC team (Florida) wins and an order of coconut shrimp if the B1G team (Iowa) wins. This practice has been in place since 2013 and the bloomin' onion has won three of four games. It must be a real conflict if you're an Iowa supporter but can't get enough fried onions in your system.
There are some rules, though, which seems to go against Outback's brand. You can only get one free item, you have to say “Outback Bowl” to your server, which seems demeaning, and the offer is only good the day after the game. This much like when Ross was offered a free crab cake appetizer when he was “stood up” on a blind date on an episode of Friends.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (all times local):
3:10 p.m.
Iran's foreign minister says the warring parties in Syria should accept the four-point peace plan that Iran put forward in 2013.
Mohammad Javad Zarif says in an interview with The Associated Press that Iran believes this plan "remains the only way for Syria to achieve peace." The plan requires an immediate cease-fire, formation of "an inclusive government of national unity," a new constitution and democratic elections.
But Zarif warns that "if people have the ultimate objective of changing the realities through political means that they couldn't do through military means, then that's another name for continuing this cycle of violence."
He says "the obligation" of outside powers — including Iran, Russia, the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council — is "to facilitate the political solution and not to dictate it."
__
3 p.m.
Iran's foreign minister says Saudi Arabia's "young and ambitious leaders" were under the "illusion" they could score a quick victory in Yemen in three weeks.
Mohammad Javad Zarif made a pointed reference to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in an Associated Press interview. He says the Saudi-led coalition has bombed civilians in Yemen since the war began in 2015. Zarif is pointing to Sunday's attack on a wedding party that killed at least 20.
Zarif insists Iran is not supplying weapons to Shiite Houthi rebels who control the capital, Sanaa, and much of northern Yemen. He says they already have all the weapons they need.
He says Iran "would like everybody to stop attacking civilian areas," including the Houthis firing missiles into Saudi Arabia.

2:05 p.m.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif is warning the Trump administration that pulling out from the Iran nuclear deal would undermine talks with North Korea by proving that America reneges on its promises.
He tells The Associated Press that if President Donald Trump withdraws, Iran would "most likely" abandon the deal as well. Zarif says Iran would no longer be bound by the deal's international obligations. That would free up Iran to resume uranium enrichment activity beyond the limits imposed by the 2015 nuclear accord.
Zarif says Iran would welcome reduced tensions on the Korean Peninsula. But he says Trump is showing that the U.S. "is not a trustworthy, reliable negotiating partner." Zarif says that makes the U.S. "a rather unlikely partner" for any other global agreements.

That said, the company is tweaking the platform's name a bit: in an announcement posted on its website, it revealed it will now refer to the online gaming platform as Blizzard Battle.net. It will also be reworking its logo to reflect the change. This solves one of the issues the company wanted to address, since "Battle.net" alone makes it sound like the platform is a separate brand. By compromising and simply tacking the company's branding to the platform, Blizzard is keeping fans who've been around for years happy. It's also saving itself the trouble of thinking of a new name that might never reach Battle.net's level of recognition.

Kira: Posted: 2017-08-04 @ 9:17pm PT I think it is a next step in technology and what companies will start working toward. However, like everything else, it's going to be a long time getting there involving fighting different people's opinions. But one thing I do predict, as the different software apps are being created... apple will make it's own apps that aren't compatible with anyone else, and others will make theirs compatible together. LOL Also, it will be many years of testing and companies trying to create their own chip to make their version "the one" that conquers all others. It's like every other technology, it will take decades to be flushed out to working everywhere. I remember back in the 1980s when they started putting microchips in credit cards... and that took what, about 30 years to "make it official" that all cards had to have one and merchants had to get the new card readers.

A helicopter kicks up dust as it lands at a staging area near the Oroville Dam on Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, in Oroville, Calif. State officials have discussed using helicopters to drop loads of rock on the damaged emergency spillway of the dam. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Lake Oroville and its dam in Northern California are critical components in California's complex water-delivery system. Damage to spillways that are used to drop water levels in the lake and relieve pressure on the dam prompted evacuation orders covering nearly 200,000 people. Here's a look at Lake Oroville and its place in California's water system
___
HOW IMPORTANT IS LAKE OROVILLE?
Lake Oroville is the starting point for California's State Water Project, which provides drinking water to 23 million of the state's 39 million people and irrigates 750,000 acres of farms. It is the largest reservoir in the system, which was built in the 1960s and early 1970s to carry rain and snowpack from the Sierra Nevada mountains to parts of the San Francisco Bay area, Central Valley and Southern California.
Lake Oroville, completed in 1967, is a cornerstone of the system of 34 reservoirs, lakes and storage facilities, built and operated by California's Department of Water Resources. It feeds into the Feather River — about 70 miles north of Sacramento — as well as the Sacramento River and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. From there it travels south on the 444-mile California Aqueduct.
Oroville's storage capacity of 3.5 million acre-feet of water is enough to supply urban California for up to six months, said Peter Gleick, president emeritus of the Pacific Institute, a water research organization based in Oakland, California.
"The risk of losing Oroville is very, very low" he said. "The consequences would be catastrophic."
___
WHAT ARE SPILLWAYS?
When reservoirs get too full, their operators release extra water down long channels, or spillways, designed to carry it downstream in a safe, controlled way.
Oroville Dam has a main concrete spillway that normally is used to release floodwaters into the Feather River downstream. A second spillway mainly made of earth serves as an emergency backup. It also was supposed to be able to handle high flows from the dam, but it had never been used before Saturday.
The force of water siphoned from the lake has damaged both spillways.
___
WHAT CAUSED THE FLOOD THREAT?
After five years of drought, a wet winter has strained the system at Lake Oroville, which is receiving runoff from melting snow in the Sierra Nevada as well as from the latest in a series of heavy storms.
Dam operators noticed chunks of concrete in the main spillway on Feb. 7. When workers stopped releasing water to investigate, they found that concrete patches the size of football fields had washed out of the channel. With the reservoir nearing the top of the 770-foot-high dam, dam operators were forced to keep using the main spillway despite increasing damage to it from the rushing water.
The dam reached capacity Saturday, sending water surging over the second, emergency spillway. Operators on Sunday noticed water was gouging a hole in the earthen emergency spillway as well. Fearing that the emergency spillway could fail and send torrents of water rushing downstream uncontrolled, authorities ordered the evacuation Sunday evening.

BESIDES OROVILLE, WHERE DOES CALIFORNIA GET ITS WATER?
The Central Valley Project, operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, irrigates more than 3 million acres of farms and provides enough drinking water for more than 1 million people. The system of 22 reservoirs was built from 1937 to the 1950s, extending about 400 miles from the Cascade Mountains near Redding to the Tehachapi Mountains near Bakersfield. It includes Shasta Lake, the only reservoir in California that's larger than Oroville.
The Colorado River supplies 19 million urban dwellers in Southern California through a 242-mile aqueduct from Lake Havasu, Arizona, to the state's coastal regions that was completed by Metropolitan Water District of Southern California in 1941. The Colorado also farms California's Imperial Valley — a major source of the nation's winter vegetables — through the 80-mile All-American Canal that hugs the state's border with Mexico.
Other significant pieces of the state system include the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which carries water from Mono Lake to the city of Los Angeles, and the Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite National Park, which supplies the San Francisco Bay area.
Egyptian police have arrested 12 people at a protest against the transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia.
Security officials say the Monday arrests were made around the Journalists' Union building in central Cairo, where dozens of people, mostly lawyers and journalists, had gathered to demonstrate. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to brief reporters.
Last Thursday, state media reported that President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's government approved the maritime border agreement and sent it to parliament for ratification despite a court ruling the deal unconstitutional.
The transfer was announced alongside a Saudi aid package last year, leading critics to condemn it as a land sell-off. The April signing of the agreement set off the largest demonstrations of el-Sissi's two-year rule.
JOHNSON CITY, TN (WJHL)- Annie Light is six-years-old, and like most kids her age, “Annie has got a lot of energy she likes to move, play with her friends,” her mom Ellie Light said.
But for Annie, finding a place to do that is more challenging. She was diagnosed with autism about four years ago., “She picks up on the environment that she's in so if it's chaos and then she is chaotic,” Ellie Light said.
According to the CDC, autism is a complex neurobiological disorder that typically affects how a person perceives the world, interacts with others, and communicates.
This month is World Autism Month. The CDC estimates that as many as one out of every 68 children born today will be diagnosed with some form of autism spectrum disorder.
We found out places here in the Tri-Cities are hosting events to be more inclusive to children with autism. Hands On! Regional Museum has sensory nights on Mondays every quarter, a night catered to children who need a calm, quiet environment, including kids on the autism spectrum.
Light said a typical event at Hands On! Regional Museum with loud noises, lights, and lots of kids, isn't ideal for her daughter Annie.
“We've been told time and time again that my child can only spend a half hour here, 20 minutes, and then get distracted and w've got to go and now they spent two hours here and they enjoy every minute,” Andy Marquart, executive director of Hands On! Regional Museum said.
Marquart and his staff worked with occupational therapists from ETSU and Milligan to help set up sensory nights.
“The lights will be a little dimmer and the sound will be completely turned off so there's no music, there's no paging, any exhibits that do make a lot of noise are inoperable that night,” Marquart said.
“When we go to the Hands On! when it's just us everybody knows our situation, we all have the same situation pretty much and we can watch each other's kids,” Light said.
And Hands On! isn't the only place creating special events for kids with autism. JC Penny workers in Johnson City took it upon themselves last Friday to have a sensory-friendly Easter egg hunt for kids who want a more calm environment. And Quantum Leap Trampoline Sports Arena recently had a sensory night at the trampoline park.
“It means so much we know there's community support and we actually can take our kids and just let them be kids rather than having to make them fit into a typical setting,” Light said.

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Federal prosecutors decided Wednesday not to retry Sen. Bob Menendez on corruption charges that ended in a hung jury last fall, lifting the legal cloud hanging over the New Jersey Democrat as he gears up for re-election this year.
Prosecutors filed a motion with the court on Wednesday to throw out the case after a judge threw out some of the counts last week. The first trial for Menendez and Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen ended in a hung jury last November.
Menendez, 64, was charged with trading his political influence for gifts and campaign donations from Melgen, 63. Both had denied the charges.
Last week the judge threw out the bribery counts related to Melgen's campaign donations. Eleven charges remained before Wednesday's decision, including bribery, fraud and conspiracy.
Defense lawyers had argued Melgen's donations had to be tied to specific acts by Menendez to be considered bribes. That's a higher standard than the one applied to gifts Melgen gave to Menendez over the years that are the basis for the bribery charges that remain.
U.S. District Judge William Walls' ruling essentially overrode the jury, which couldn't reach a verdict after several days of deliberations in November.
After the mistrial, several jurors said as many as 10 of the 12 panel members were in favor of acquittal, leading some experts to speculate the government wouldn't pursue a retrial.

STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:
We're going to spend much of this hour in Charlottesville, Va., where events over the weekend have been described as mayhem, catastrophic, a stain on America, even domestic terrorism. Violence erupted yesterday after white nationalist groups descended on the city of Charlottesville. The so-called Unite The Right rally was protesting the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in the center of the city, though people tell us it goes much deeper than that. We're going to hear from a variety of voices today as we reflect on what happened. First, let's talk about what we know. After police dispersed the massive crowd, 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. allegedly slammed his car into a group of people who had come to march against the white supremacists. Thirty-two-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer lost her life in that car attack. Nineteen others were injured. Two Virginia state police officers also died in a helicopter crash. They had been monitoring the rally. The Department of Justice has opened a federal probe into the events in Charlottesville. This afternoon, there was more trouble. Sandy Hausman of WVTF is here to bring us up to speed. She joins us live from Charlottesville. Good to speak with you again, Sandy.
SANDY HAUSMAN, BYLINE: Yes.
SMITH: So, Sandy, we mentioned there was more trouble today. What happened? Set the scene for us.
HAUSMAN: Well, Stacey, the man who organized yesterday's Unite The Right rally had a press conference this afternoon, or at least he tried. It turned out, several hundred people found about it, and they showed up to shout Jason Kessler down.
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you.
HAUSMAN: After Kessler had spoken for less than five minutes, largely drowned out by chanting, a man rushed up, shouting that the white supremacist leader should be charged with murder in connection with the crash that killed one person and injured 19 other people. The crowd then closed in on Kessler and pursued him. He ran away. State Police in riot gear blocked the mob, and that allowed Kessler to escape.
SMITH: You spoke with several people there today. What else did you hear?
HAUSMAN: Well, it was kind of ironic. This whole event took place under statues of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who lived in this area and were the original supporters of the First Amendment. But when I talked to Susan Chrishell (ph), Sharonda Brown (ph), Jay Scott (ph) and Brenda Castaneda (ph), they didn't see any problem with what happened.
SUSAN CHRISHELL: I support everyone saying what they want to say. But when it becomes violent, nobody belongs here, and I don't care what your position is.
HAUSMAN: Do you blame Jason Kessler for what happened yesterday?
SHARONDA BROWN: Yeah, yeah, I think it's - yeah, it's his fault pretty much.
JAY SCOTT: We also blame Donald Trump. You know, the hat says make America great again, which everybody already knows that means - from the white supremacists' view, it means make America white again.
BRENDA CASTANEDA: You know, we were here yesterday. We're all pretty tired, but they've got to know that we don't want them here and that every time they come out to rally, they're going to be met with heavy opposition.
HAUSMAN: What about the First Amendment? Aren't they allowed to speak?
CASTANEDA: Sure, they're allowed to speak. But that, you know, that constrains what the government can do. It doesn't constrain what citizens can do. It doesn't mean that we can't stand up and yell louder than they are.
SMITH: Were there any other injuries today?
HAUSMAN: Fortunately, there were not, although one man was arrested for spitting on Jason Kessler. And we also had some good news from the University of Virginia Medical Center, where the injured people were taken yesterday. Ten of them are now in good condition, and nine have been released.

A ‘'humanoid robot'' has carried the Olympic Torch on the latest stage of the journey to Pyeongchang.
Organisers were determined: "to showcase our advances in technology."
The "Hubot", named Hubo, made its appearance at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and technology, in Daejon.
This special Torch Relay leg began with Torchbearer, Professor Dennis Hong, founding director of the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory at UCLA, in Los Angeles, riding in an automated car.
Then came the Hubot's own moment to shine when it took the flame from Professor Hong.
Hubo is 120 centimetres tall, has a maximum stride of 35cm and is capable of 65 paces per minute.
It even has individually moving fingers and performed what Torch Relay officials described as a "high difficulty performance" (sic) as he cut a hole through a brick wall as part of an emergency scenario.

After the ‘run' Hubo passed the flame to Dr Oh Jun Ho.
He had been in charge of the mechanical engineering team which developed the robot back in 2004 .
"Through the robot's participation in the relay, we were able to show people how far (South) Korea's robotic industry has developed and show people the different ways that robots can be used in the near future," he said.
In turn, Dr Oh Jun Ho handed the flame to Gang Da Bin, a winner of the Junior Software Cup, who carried the Torch to represent the next generation of scientists.
Pyeongchang 2018 have confirmed that around 85 robots will be deployed as volunteers during the Winter Games.
Some will even help to provide information for visitors.
The Hubot was not the first robot to participate in the 2018 relay.
An undersea robotic craft helped carry the flame in the early stages of the journey.
Organisers insisted that the Torch Relay would show the future and the past .
That has even meant a journey back to prehistoric times when a dinosaur skeleton at the Geological museum, in Daejon , offered an unusual backdrop for runners in the Relay.

The more conventional bearers have included Kim Sung Hyun, a young dental student who has already seen the Olympic flame pass by.
He was at school in Vancouver when the relay passed in 2010.
“The relay was near my home, so I went to watch it.
“I took a photo with a Torchbearer and always dreamed I could do it in Korea one day.
“When I heard I had been picked I felt exhilarated.
“I think it is a good opportunity to show my foreign friends how Korea has grown,” he said.
When Suh So Huan was chosen she also received an unexpected gift.
“When I told my husband, he bought me an indoor exercise bike as a present.
“I have been using it to train everyday for the run,'' she said.
Former Los Angeles Dodgers baseball pitcher Park Chan Ho also carried the flame in Daejon.
After almost two decades in the US he ended his career back in South Korea with the Hanwha Eagles.
He handed the flame to Eagles batter Kim Tae Gyun.
The arrival of the flame at the Daejon Expo Park was greeted in traditional style with girl band Mamamoo adding to an already considerable K-Pop presence and performing for the crowds.

Lloyd Mutasa marked his return to Dynamos yesterday when he conducted the Glamour Boys' training session following the board's directive for his reinstatement three weeks after he was sacked.
In a surprise U-turn that has left even some of their supporters baffled, the former midfielder is back in charge of the Glamour Boys.
Biggie Zuze, who had been elevated to the position of interim coach, has been fired.
Mutasa, who is currently in camp with the Warriors for the COSAFA tournament, showed up at the team's training session yesterday, together with Zondai Nyaungwa, who had also been relieved of his duties as goalkeepers' coach.
The Glamour Boys' secretary-general Webster Marechera was not immediately available to comment on the developments.
But DeMbare sources yesterday said Mutasa will be assisted by Lloyd Chigowe in the meantime.
Chigowe was recently promoted from the juniors after Mutasa was kicked out on a technicality when the club announced they were redeploying him to the position of technical director.
“The board has given the directive and from today (yesterday) Mutasa will revert to his position,'' sources said.
“He is the one who will take care of the training from today onwards and has returned together with goalkeepers' coach Zondai. Unfortunately for Zuze he has been told to go home and it appears he is no longer in the plans for the time being.''
The decision, however, has not been well received by the executive and it appears this might create tension within the Glamour Boys leadership.
Mutasa may not be in charge this weekend when Dynamos travel to Triangle for their next game, leaving the team in the hands of his assistants Chigowe, Nyaungwa and team manager Richard Chihoro, who is also a qualified coach.
Mutasa may also miss the trip to Mutare City the following weekend if the Warriors make it to the final of the COSAFA Cup, where they start as favourites.
The club's board of directors, led by Bernard Marriot-Lusengo, has ordered the executive to reinstate the coaching department following the team's disappointing run under caretaker coach Zuze.
Mutasa was in charge of the opening 10 games of the season when DeMbare managed only nine points.
The poor start cost him his job with Zuze taking over on an interim basis.
However, the club has continued to struggle for results.
The leadership was not happy that the team only managed to add five points to their tally in the last four games under the interim technical team.
Dynamos are currently 11th on the log standings with 14 points from 14 starts.

Wildlife advocates plan to challenge the approval of a new Yellowstone River dam to benefit farmers that critics say could kill off a dwindling population of a fish dating to the time of dinosaurs.
A bypass channel for the irrigation dam would be built near the Montana-North Dakota border to let endangered pallid sturgeon reach upstream spawning grounds.
But scientists don't know if the fish would use the channel.
Wildearth Guardians and the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a court filing Friday they are negotiating with officials on how to proceed following last month's dam construction approval by the U.S Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation.
The groups have a lawsuit pending over the $57 million project.

CHARLOTTE, Mich. (AP) - The Latest on the final sentencing hearing for disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar (all times local):
5:55 p.m.
A man who tried to attack Larry Nassar in a Michigan courtroom has publicly apologized again and insists he's "no hero."
Randall Margraves told reporters Friday that he's remorseful and embarrassed. He says, "This cannot be a lawless society."
Margraves lunged at the disgraced former sports doctor after listening to two daughters speak in court about how they were sexually abused. A third daughter also says she was a victim. Sheriff's deputies tackled Margraves.
Margrave says he lost control when it appeared that Nassar was shaking his head during his daughters' statements.
Morgan Margraves says her father was hearing some details for the first time. She says he reacted "like most fathers would have done, and probably wanted to do, in a situation like this."
___
12:35 p.m.
A judge says there's "no way" she will punish a father of three victims of Larry Nassar after the dad tried to attack the former sports doctor in a Michigan courtroom.
Randall Margraves apologized Friday, a few hours after he charged toward Nassar during a sentencing hearing in Eaton County, Michigan.
Judge Janice Cunningham says a punishment isn't appropriate based on the crimes committed by Nassar and the anguish felt by families. But she also says it's wrong to "combat assault with assault."
Cunningham could have given Margraves a jail sentence or fine as she considered whether to hold him in contempt of court.
Nassar must listen to scores of victims before he's sentenced next week for sexual assault. He's admitted molesting young gymnasts. He's already been sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison in another county.
___
11:50 a.m.
A doctor who specializes in gynecology says Larry Nassar molested her at age 11 at a camp for elite gymnasts.
Brittney Schumann says she couldn't be an advocate for women's health by staying anonymous. She told Nassar, a former sports doctor, that he's a "disgrace" to the medical profession.
Victims are confronting Nassar in court in Eaton County, Michigan. Earlier Friday, a father of three of Nassar's accusers tried to attack Nassar. Bailiffs quickly tackled the father.
Nassar will be sentenced next week for molesting three girls at a gymnastics club, but he first must listen to dozens of victims. He's already been sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison in another Michigan county.
Nassar worked at Michigan State University and at USA Gymnastics, which trains Olympians.
___
10:50 a.m.
A sentencing hearing has resumed for Larry Nassar after a father of three of his victims tried to attack the disgraced former sports doctor in a Michigan courtroom.
Randall Margraves was quickly tackled by bailiffs Friday when he lunged at Nassar. Two of Margraves' daughters are among more than 30 victims who've given statements during the hearing, which began Wednesday.
The judge resumed the hearing after about 25 minutes. She said the pain and suffering endured by Nassar's victims is "unthinkable," but that families can't react with physical violence.
The hearing focuses on sexual abuse that occurred while Nassar worked with Twistars, an elite Michigan gymnastics club.
More than 150 girls and women confronted Nassar in a separate case focused on his time with Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics. He was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison in that case.
___
9:20 a.m.
A father of three victims of Larry Nassar has tried to attack the disgraced former sports doctor during a court hearing in Michigan.
Bailiffs tackled the father Friday morning in the courtroom.
After two of his daughters spoke, the father, Randall Margraves, asked the judge for "five minutes" in a locked room with Nassar. The judge said she could not do that.
Margraves then asked for one minute, but the judge said she also couldn't allow it. He then rushed at Nassar.
Two of his daughters had given statements to the court. They said their other sister also had been molested by Nassar.
Crying could be heard in the courtroom as Nassar was escorted out. Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis told families in the courtroom to "use your words" and that violence "is not helping your children."
___
9:05 a.m.
A Michigan judge says controversial comments made by an attorney for disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar were "unfortunate."
Judge Janice Cunningham opened the second day of Nassar's final sentencing hearing on Friday by addressing comments that attorney Shannon Smith made the day before to radio station WWJ.
Smith said she had doubts about the large number of women and girls who say they are victims.
The judge says Nassar didn't authorize the statements and has disavowed them. Cunningham says it's unfortunate Smith made the comments during the sentencing proceedings.
Cunningham says "what is relevant is for the court to hear each individual story and how the criminal actions of the defendant impacted each individual's life."
The hearing focuses on Nassar's work with Twistars, an elite Michigan gymnastics club. More than 30 victims have given statements so far. During a similar hearing that ended last week, more than 150 girls and women came forward.
___
11 p.m.
Disgraced gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar is expected to hear from more victims who say he molested them when his third and final sentencing hearing resumes.
The proceedings that continue on Friday probably will extend into next week.
This time the focus is on abuse that happened at the elite Twistars gymnastics club in Michigan where Nassar offered treatments. The young athletes who confronted Nassar on Wednesday saved some of their harshest words for John Geddert, an Olympic coach who operated Twistars.
They said Geddert created an ultra-competitive atmosphere, was indifferent to injuries and rarely offered gymnasts any choice to see a different doctor.
Geddert has been suspended by USA Gymnastics, the sport's governing body, and has announced his retirement. He transferred ownership of the gym to his wife.

Nobody truly knows whether Floyd Mayweather's boxing match with Conor McGregor will turn out to be a unique spectacle or an overhyped debacle.
The only certainty is that the next 2? months of hype will be a masterpiece of fight promotion from two of the best ever to play that game.
Mayweather and McGregor revealed their plan Wednesday to fight Aug. 26 in Las Vegas . In an appropriate move for a fight that grew into reality after two years of verbal jousting and several months of social-media skewering, the two titans of their respective sports confirmed the news on their Instagram accounts.
And in another preview of what everyone should expect during their summer of promotion, McGregor's post included his photo opposite Floyd Mayweather Sr., the boxer's 64-year-old father, with a straight-faced caption: "THE FIGHT IS ON."
Few athletes in recent sports history have sold their sports better than the imperious Mayweather and the loquacious McGregor.
Both fighters have spent years crafting outlandish public personae characterized by a few common themes: cartoonish arrogance, a fetishistic obsession with money and an eagerness to make reckless pronouncements about their opponents, their opponents' fans — and, increasingly, each other.
They'll use those gifts to ratchet up the hype during a hot summer culminating in their desert showdown. Along the way, they might even sell the skeptical portion of the public on a fight that — as even its promoters acknowledge — could turn out to be a colossal mismatch.
Mayweather apparently learned about McGregor's verbal skills even before his fighting acumen, according to Mayweather adviser Leonard Ellerbe. McGregor rapidly rose from obscurity to multi-division UFC dominance only because he coupled his mixed martial arts skills with attention-grabbing soundbites.
"This kid, he's been making a lot of noise," Ellerbe said Wednesday, recalling the reason that he first introduced Mayweather to video of McGregor's punching power.
Mayweather and McGregor have traded innumerable shots online and through the media while this fight evolved from a preposterous barroom fantasy discussion into a real thing.
McGregor even talked about it back in 2015, when he told Esquire that he would "kill (Mayweather) in less than 30 seconds" and affirmed his interest in the bout while appearing on Conan O'Brien's talk show.
McGregor ignited the hype in May 2016 by posting a mock-up of a fight poster on Twitter. Mayweather responded three weeks later with his own less polished version of a poster , and the unbeaten champion claimed he had started the rumors of a McGregor bout.
With little to lose and immeasurable wealth and fame to gain, McGregor used his public platform in promoting his UFC bouts last year to take repeated jabs at the 40-year-old Mayweather's age, declining skills and unwillingness to end his retirement.
McGregor turns 29 next month, making him decidedly middle-aged in pro sports, yet he takes humorous delight in painting himself as a raw youngster going against a grizzled old-timer .
As recently as December, Ellerbe said a Mayweather-McGregor fight would never happen because the UFC's top brass wouldn't allow it. UFC President Dana White also acknowledges he was once lukewarm about the possibility, believing Mayweather wouldn't risk his legacy.
And then in January, McGregor posted a cartoon on Instagram in which he stood over a flattened Mayweather, holding both fighters' championship belts aloft. As a bonus, McGregor's caption read: "Call me CJ Watson!" in a biting reference to the former NBA guard who had a relationship with Josie Harris, the mother of Mayweather's children.
Mayweather replied eight days later with an Instagram post of an infographic comparing the fighters' net worth. In the caption, Mayweather instructed McGregor: "Before you ask for $25 million, be worth more than $25 million."
Vegas sports books introduced a betting line on the bout in February.
Mayweather had clearly warmed to the idea of fighting McGregor by March, when he told fans in Britain that he would come out of his latest retirement to take on the challenge. That same month, McGregor showed up in a fur coat at fellow Irishman Michael Conlan's boxing debut at Madison Square Garden and harangued the assembled media with a rant punctuated by his latest catchphrase: "I am boxing!"
After posting a video on April 20 in which he shadowboxed and insulted Mayweather's courage, McGregor took a brief break from his social media pursuit of Mayweather after his first son was born in May .
Mayweather went back to his usual retirement m?tier: Posting photos of himself surrounded by the trappings of outlandish wealth .
And then the megafight was on , after remarkably simple negotiations among the UFC, Mayweather Promotions and Showtime.
A national press tour is expected to kick off soon. Mayweather and McGregor will spend the summer showing off their promotional gifts for a fight that started as a social media argument — and became the main event of the year.

Trump arrives at White House, bypasses questions on race
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Latest on President Donald Trump and the weekend's violence and death in Charlottesville, Virginia (all times local):
11 a.m.
President Donald Trump is back at the White House and ignoring shouted questions about the race-fueled clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Trump briefly waved as he walked alone into the building, which is under renovation. He did not respond to loud queries from reporters about whether he condemns white supremacists and whether he condemns the actions of neo-Nazis.
One woman was killed Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters who'd gathered to oppose a rally by white nationalists and others who oppose a plan to remove from a Charlottesville park of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
Trump has said “many sides” are to blame for violence.
The president is in Washington for one day during a working vacation mostly in Bedminster, New Jersey.
___
9:20 a.m.
The CEO of the nation's third largest pharmaceutical company is resigning from the President's American Manufacturing Council citing “a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.”
President Donald Trump lashed out almost immediately Monday at Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Twitter, saying Frazier “will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!”
Frazier's resignation comes shortly after a violent confrontation between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one person dead and 19 injured. He said in a tweet on Monday that the country's leaders must “honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.”
Trump responded to Saturday's violence in Charlottesville by blaming bigotry on “many sides.” He has not explicitly condemned the white supremacists.
___
9:15 a.m.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions is telling ABC's “Good Morning America” that the death of a woman in Charlottesville, Virginia, “does meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our statute.”
Sessions said the Justice Department is pursuing the case “in every way.”
He added: “You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought, because this is an unequivocally unacceptable and evil attack that cannot be accepted in America.”
Sessions also says he is meeting with President Donald Trump and officials from the FBI on Monday to discuss the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.
___
7:00 a.m.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions says “too much has been read into” President Donald Trump's statement Saturday amid violence at a protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, related to the removal of a Confederate monument.
In several television interviews on Monday, Sessions said Trump had “explicitly condemned” violence and that “he totally opposes” the values espoused by white supremacy organizations. Trump referenced violence “on many sides.”
He tells NBC News that Trump ” will be speaking to the people today” although he isn't sure what Trump will say. Sessions added: “He's been firm on this from the beginning. He is appalled by this.”
___
3:44 a.m.
As President Donald Trump remained out of sight and silent, pressure mounted from both sides of the aisle for him to explicitly condemn white supremacists and hate groups involved in deadly, race-fueled clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Trump, who has been at his New Jersey golf club on a working vacation, was set to make a one-day return to Washington on Monday to sign an executive action on China's trade practices. But he will likely be unable to escape questions and criticism for his initial response to the Saturday's violence, for which he blamed bigotry on “many sides.”
The White House tried to stem the damage on Sunday. Senior aides were dispatched to the morning news shows, yet they struggled at times to explain the president's position. A new White House statement on Sunday explicitly denounced the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups, but it was attributed to an unnamed spokesperson and not the president himself.

DENVER – A federal jury in Denver on Monday found that Taylor Swift was assaulted and battered by former Denver DJ David Mueller when he groped her at a photo-shoot ahead of a June 2013 concert, and found that Andrea Swift and Frank Bell did not interfere with Mueller's employment.
The jury also awarded Swift the $1 she had sought in her counterclaim in the suit. Mueller was awarded nothing because the jury found against him.
Taylor hugged her mother and attorneys after the verdict read, and her mother, Andrea, wept. Courtroom reporters said Mueller did not even glance at his attorneys as the verdict was read.
The jury's decision came on the sixth day of the trial involving Swift, her mother and manager, and the former DJ, David Mueller.
The judge in the case, William J. Martinez, on Friday removed all claims made by Mueller against Swift herself from the lawsuit, but one claim—that her mother and manager had influence Mueller's firing from KYGO—went forth to the jury.
Swift's counterclaim of assault and battery by Mueller also went to the jury.
Mueller originally sued Swift, alleging that she and her team falsely accused him of groping her at a photo shoot before a concert at Denver's Pepsi Center on June 2, 2013, which led to his wrongful firing by KYGO. He sought reimbursement for his firing, which he alleged was wrongfully done.
Swift filed a countercomplaint, alleging that Mueller touched her rear end inappropriately during the photo. She sought only $1 in damages for her counterclaim.

I experienced a demo version of Venues last week to watch a basketball game, a replay of the Golden State Warriors vs. Memphis Grizzlies match that aired last December. To try out Venues, I needed an Oculus Avatar set up and to connect my Facebook account to my Oculus account. Venues will be available on the Gear VR as well as the Go at launch, while Rift users will have to wait a while longer.
As I delved into the experience, I was forced to sit through a Code of Conduct video that explains inappropriate behavior could get me kicked out. The reason for that is, unlike the other social VR apps, Oculus Venues is open to everyone, not just me and my friends. After all, Venues is supposed to mimic how it feels to be at a concert or a sporting event, surrounded by strangers. And sure enough, that's exactly how the Oculus Venues demo felt.
When I logged in, I found myself sitting in a virtual seat on the sidelines of Oracle Arena, with the game playing out in front of me. But instead of feeling like I was at an actual live event, it was more like watching a giant IMAX screen. This is because the camera angles kept switching, which removes the suspension of disbelief, and the video quality was pretty pixelated and grainy. An Oculus spokesperson told me that, eventually, they'll want the Venues experience to be as close to the real deal as possible, where the camera angles remain static. But even then, I doubt the video quality will be as good as a 4K TV set.
I was also immediately surrounded by sound, not just of the basketball game, but of people talking all around me -- again, simulating the experience of being at a live event. As I looked around the virtual seats, I noticed I was surrounded by other Oculus avatars with usernames above their heads, all seemingly engaged in conversations. There was no one sitting next to me, so I looked down at the menu console and hit the 'Try New Seat' button, which instantly repositioned me in the virtual stadium. I was next to someone who turned out to be, conveniently, an Oculus PR person. As she started talking me through the settings and options, her mouth moved, giving an air of realism to our virtual conversation. Interactions are very similar to the ones I experienced in Rooms, where I can turn my head, nod and even wave my hand.
She told me I can adjust the volume of the event as well as the voice chat going on around me. So if I can't hear who's talking to me, I can always turn down the event volume and turn up the chat. At any point in time, I can see in the menu console the three closest people to me: I had one person to my right and two to my left, and I could tell who's talking by their vibrating speaker icon in the menu console.
One feature that I particularly like is being able to mute noisy people around me. I can find their avatar and username in the menu and mute them. If I find them particularly offensive, I can also block and report them. Ah, if only you could do that to people in real life.
Unfortunately, however, I can't adjust an avatar's volume, specifically. I found this to be a shame, as sometimes I want to still hear what they're saying, but just at a softer level. I also wish I knew who else was speaking around me -- I could still hear some voices above me, for example, but since they were in the seats behind me, they didn't show up on the menu console. Mostly, I wanted to know who they were, so I could mute them.
Aside from just hitting the Try New Seat button to change seats, I can also just teleport with cursor controls -- just look at a seat I want and hit OK. If I get tired of the crowd in general and want a little bit of alone time, I can also switch to Solo Viewing mode, which lets me watch the game in peace. It's like having my own personal luxury box.
But what if I just want to watch the game with my friends, with no strangers around? Well, there doesn't seem to be much of an option for that. An Oculus spokesperson said we could just all sit in the same part of the stadium, which doesn't seem very different from being at a real event. I guess that makes it seem more realistic, but it's a part of reality that I don't like all that much.
If you're slightly more extrovert, though, there are a few features designed for you to make friends with people you don't know. Remember you had to hook up your Oculus account with your Facebook account? Well, if you do, you might come across a random audience member who's a friend of a friend. For example, during my demo, I happened to sit next to a person who's a mutual friend of three former co-workers of mine. We struck up a conversation, and he added me as a Facebook friend, right then and there, thanks to a little button in the Venues menu. As I traveled from seat to seat, I saw people with similar interests, like so-and-so was also a fan of the Giants -- information that was probably culled from our Facebook profiles.
If you're getting a little scared about the invasion of privacy, well you have the option to turn social sharing off. Also, your real name is never shared -- only your Oculus ID. And you never share your real-life photo either; it's always just your avatar. Additionally, if you're ever concerned about someone creating a ruckus or calling names in the Venues app, Oculus says there'll be several moderators monitoring each event to make sure bad actors are taken care of.
Admittedly, I enjoyed my virtual sports hangout more than I thought I would. The interactions were pretty fun, and I liked that I was able to mute the people around me as I talked to someone else. At the same time, however, the demo I experienced was just with a handful of people. Oculus says that actual live events can have a crowd of around 1,000, which seems like a lot to handle, even if they're all just virtual avatars. I'll have to try Venues out at an actual live event to see if I'll still like it.
Thankfully, it seems I won't have long to do so. The first live Venues event, a Vance Joy concert, will air tonight at 7:30pm PT / 10:30pm ET. Other events scheduled throughout the summer include live MLB games, concerts from AEG Presents, film screenings of Lionsgate movies and plenty of standup from Gotham Comedy Live. All Venues events are free.
Spring Has Sprung and the Fish Are Hungry!
Capt. Joe Londot – Barracuda Bob's Island Surf & Sports
Now that we're finally beyond the reach of those pesky cold fronts, it's time to dust off your trusty rods and reels, respool with fresh braid and get out there to target your favorite species.
As March progresses water temps will start climbing out of the 60s and into the 70 plus zone, with this warming bait will migrate northwards from sunnier climes and into our nearshore and offshore areas. This rapid influx of bait will be followed by hungry predators looking to gorge themselves after a winter of privation.
Inshore look for redfish to start congregating on the shallow flats near mangrove shorelines and oyster bars working the bottom for crabs, shrimp, worms and anything else that appears edible. Look for schools of mullet milling around and free-jumping, as the reds will be close by eating anything the mullet flush out. Be careful not to spook the fish by moving in too close or tossing your baits directly into the school, it is better to use long casts and either overshoot the schooling fish or cast to the outside edges of the activity.
While live baits like big shrimp or small pinfish will score well, this is a good time to throw a Gulp plastic tail pinned to a jighead. You'll want to hop your rig slowly back towards you so the fish can see the movement and the splash of sand it makes, then let it sit static or a moment or two before hopping it again. Some of the biggest reds of the season will be taken using this method.
Hungry trout will be patrolling the grass flats covering Clearwater Bay and St. Joseph's Sound; it won't be unusual to find them in very shallow water during low light hours. This is a great time to deploy a topwater lure like a MirrOlure Surface Walker or Zara Spook Jr. As the sun comes up the trout will head for deeper flats, so break out some big live shrimp, pin them under a popping cork and work all the grass flats you can reach. The jig and tail combo mentioned for reds will also work well here, just cast out as far as you can and work the lure back with a jigging motion just clearing the tops of the grass.
Schools of Spanish mackerel are marauding all around the Causeway bridges. Live shrimp pinned to a long shank hook and floated under a bobber will score plenty of fish, but when the schools blow through it's best to switch to a Gotcha plug, silver spoon or diamond jig. Just cast these deadly lures out as far as you can and reel them in as fast as you can while jigging them along. Mackerel love to attack shiny, fast-moving baits and will compete with each other to see who nails it first!
There are so many great fishing opportunities to talk about this month but there just isn't enough space in this column to address them all, so plan to stop into Barracuda Bob's on the Dunedin Causeway. Here you can pick up the baits and rigs you'll need and get the latest on what's biting out there and where to find them.
The friendly and knowledge crew at Barracuda Bob's has been directing anglers to fish in the Clearwater/Dunedin/Tarpon Springs area for eight years now and we have everything you'll need to enjoy a fun and productive day on the water!

The wildest story of the 2017-18 NBA season (which has featured plenty) came to light on a night when no basketball was being played. The Ringer published a report from Ben Detrick about multiple Twitter burner accounts that appeared to be tied to Bryan Colangelo, which stunned NBA Twitter and caused fans, media, NBA executives, and even Joel Embiid to lose their collective minds over the possibility Colangelo was bad-mouthing his own players and other teams on secret Twitter accounts.
Nearly 24 hours after the report dropped, Sixers Twitter has been hard at work trying to determine who exactly is behind the accounts. There's plenty of reason to question whether Colangelo himself, ostensibly a busy man being an NBA executive, would have time to operate five separate Twitter accounts just to defend his honor. However, the information used by these accounts, namely “Eric Jr,” was so detailed with regards to information that would only be known by someone very close to the organization made it seem that, at best, these were accounts run by someone close to Colangelo.
NEW YORK (AP) — A spokeswoman for a New Jersey city where the Kushner Cos. is a major real estate developer says the firm has withdrawn its request for a 30-year tax break for one of its buildings.
Jersey City spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill says the company owned by the family of Jared Kushner sent a letter about a week ago withdrawing a request for a break on city taxes for its planned One Journal Square building. The mayor recently came out against the break.
It is the latest setback for the Kushner real estate company in a city where it has several projects.
The shared office space company WeWork recently pulled out as anchor tenant of One Journal Square. That has reportedly put in doubt a state tax break that was tied to WeWork.
House Republicans are mulling an overhaul to the tax code, specifically, how businesses are taxed. One possibility? Businesses that import items would see higher taxes on those goods — as much as 20 percent — and exporters would have the money they make off those exports exempt from taxes. Domestic manufacturers favor the plan, but not surprisingly, retailers that import goods aren't that keen on it. Several retail industry CEOs are up on the Hill this week to weigh in. So let the lobbing begin.
More than two hundred people have been killed and hundreds more are still missing after torrential rains on the outskirts of Sierra Leone's capital Freetown caused a mountainside to collapse onto a residential community.
A government morgue has received 205 bodies from the mudslide, and at least 71 injured people have been transferred to hospitals, Abu Bakarr Tarawallie, the head of communications for Sierra Leone's Red Cross Society, tells The Two-Way.
Some 600 people remain unaccounted for as rescuers continue digging through the mountain of mud to find survivors and recover bodies, Tarawallie said.
"It is likely that hundreds are lying dead underneath the rubble," Sierra Leone's Vice President Victor Foh told Reuters while visiting the scene of the mudslide. "This disaster is so serious that I feel myself broken. ... We're trying to cordon the area. Evacuate the people."
Tarawallie says recovery efforts face serious challenges. "We are not sure if we will be able to recover all of them considering the herculean task of reaching them out of the depths of the huge mud brought down by the slide," Tarawallie says. "We're not sure of the capacity that exists for them to be reached before they decompose."
Video posted by the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation show strong, churning rivers of mud flowing down streets and through houses. "It appears many people were still sleeping when heavy rains triggered the mudslide which engulfed the area," NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reported.
The damage is extreme, says International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Programme Coordinator Abdul Nasir: "In places, entire communities seem to have been washed away and whatever is left is covered in mud," he said.
Up to 3,000 people are believed to have lost their homes, Tarawallie says. "It is estimated that over 100 houses are affected, and about 25 houses were submerged in the mud."
Efforts to aid the people who have lost their homes have been "a little bit chaotic," he says. "No organized structure or shelter has been put in place for them." He says that the Red Cross is currently working on a response to help the people who have survived the mudslide.
Reuters spoke with Salimatu Bangura, who lives in the flooded area and lost her brother this morning. "We were asleep when we heard the noise of one of the walls falling down. By the time we got up water was flowing in and the whole house was flooded," she said.
Tarawallie stresses that Sierra Leone regularly experiences floods and mudslides due to heavy downpours. He adds: "The only particularity of this is that it is unprecedented that for the first time we are having this magnitude of impact and huge loss of property and lives."
According to the wire service, deforestation and poor urban planning have exacerbated the dangers in Sierra Leone during the rainy season.
"There is little to no urban planning going on in the city at all levels of society," Jamie Hitchen of the Africa Research Institute told The Guardian. "The government is failing to provide housing for the poorest in society. There is a chronic housing deficit in the city and the issues only get discussed on an annual basis when flooding happens and [it] comes into the spotlight."
Howard County commissioners will hold a workshop to review the interlocal agreement with the city of Big Spring for the purchase of a radio system for law enforcement.
The workshop will take place just prior to the commissioner's regular meeting Wednesday. The workshop will start at 2:45 p.m., while the meeting will begin at 3:30 p.m. Both gatherings will be in the second-floor conference room of the Howard County Courthouse.
During the meeting, commissioners will hear a presentation of a report from the Arbitrage Group about General Obligation Refunding Bonds, series 2015. The Arbitrage Group is a provider of arbitrage rebate and mathematical verification services based out of Houston; Birmingham, Alabama; and Hudson, Wisconsin.

Arsenal's restaurant scores three stars for sustainability
The Diamond Club at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium has scored three stars for green dining.
The Sustainable Restaurant Association (SRA) said it achieved the highest ‘Food Made Good' rating – a first for a sports stadium restaurant – by demonstrating “outstanding levels” of sustainability across its operation.
It rates restaurants based on a wide range of sustainability and ethical practices, including the use of locally sourced meat and fish, waste reduction and energy efficiency policies.
The restaurant sources 75% of its food locally and has partnered with charities to reduce food waste by redistributing it to people in need.
Andrew Stephen, Chief Executive of the SRA said: “Luxury, football and sustainability are three words you don't always associate together.
“But the team at the Diamond Club have married them together, matching their passion for serving ethically sourced ingredients with a commitment to ensure those ingredients help provide meals for people who need them rather than ending up in the bin. A winning combination.”
NEW YORK — A crude pipe bomb strapped to a man inspired by the Islamic State group went off Monday in a crowded subway corridor near Times Square, injuring the man, slightly wounding three others and snarling the rush-hour commute for hundreds of thousands of New York workers.
Surveillance cameras captured the man walking casually through the crowded passageway when the bomb suddenly went off at 7:20 a.m. amid a plume of white smoke, which cleared to show the man sprawled on the ground and commuters fleeing in terror. Investigators said it was not clear if the bomb was set off intentionally or went off prematurely.
“This was an attempted terrorist attack,” Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters. “Thank God the perpetrator did not achieve his ultimate goals.”
The suspect, who was identified as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah, was being treated at a hospital for burns to his hands and abdomen. The others who were injured suffered ringing in the ears and headaches.
Law enforcement officials said Ullah was inspired by the Islamic State group but had apparently not had any direct contact with the group. The officials said he lives in Brooklyn and came to the U.S. from Bangladesh about seven years ago on a visa. They said he was speaking with investigators from his hospital bed.
A person briefed on the investigation said Ullah came to the U.S. on an F-4 visa, a preferential visa available for those with family in the U.S. who are citizens or permanent residents, and that he made the bomb in his Brooklyn apartment. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the blast.
Investigators were searching his apartment, interviewing witnesses and relatives and looking for surveillance footage that may show his movements in the moments before the attack.
The explosion, which happened in an underground passageway under 42nd Street between 7th and 8th avenues, triggered a massive emergency response by police and firefighters both above and below ground, tangling subway and bus service at the nearby Port Authority bus terminal.
Everything around Times Square was shut down, halting what would ordinarily be a bustling rush hour at the “Crossroads of the World.”
Authorities said the bomb was a low-tech explosive device attached to the man with Velcro and plastic ties. They were investigating how it was made.
A photo published by the New York Post showed a bearded man crumpled on the ground with his shirt apparently blown off and black soot covering his bare midriff. A police officer was holding the man's hands behind his back. Another photo shown on cable channel NY1 showed the bearded suspect, wide-eyed, on a stretcher being loaded into an ambulance.
Elrana Peralta, a customer-service worker for Greyhound, said she works in the Port Authority terminal complex near where the blast happened but did not hear the explosion.
“All we could hear was the chaos,” she said. “We could hear people yelling, 'Get out! Get out! Get out!”'
John Miles, 28, from Vermont, was waiting for a bus to Massachusetts. He did not hear the blast either, but saw police react.
“I didn't know what was going on. Officers were running around. I was freaking out,” he said. There was an announcement that people should take their bags and leave. “They didn't incite panic. It was fairly orderly.”
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that President Donald Trump had been briefed on the explosion. Instead of commenting on the suspected terror attack, Trump sent a tweet at 9:17 a.m. criticizing a Sunday story in The New York Times that said he watched cable news television for at least four hours a day.
The blast came just weeks after eight people died in New York when another man, also said to be inspired by the Islamic State, drove a rented truck onto a bike path near the World Trade Center.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference following the attack that New Yorkers should be alert but go about their lives.
“Let's go back to work,” he said. “”We're not going to allow them to disrupt us.“

Problem child of a rifle...(Cold Bore Question) I have a model 70 featherweight push feed that has been my meat and potatoes gun since I bought it new in the early 90's. Early on I always shot 165 grain factory core-lokts. When I began handloading for it 10 years or so ago I shot 165 Hornady Interlocks and 165 partitions. My handloads were fairly anemic but the rifle grouped adequate for my needs at the time (about 1-1.5"). With the rifle zeroed 2-3" high at 100 I killed truckloads of deer.
As I got more into shooting I was less happy with the performance of the rifle. I had it bedded, free-floated, and had a trigger job done. I began looking for a higher performing load and shot a variety of 165-180 grain projectiles with only average accuracy. Lots of groups around 1.5". I did notice lots of cold bore shots 1-2" higher than the rest of the group. In a rush last Fall I found what I thought was going to be my all-around load with a 150 TTSX going about 3000 fps with 3 shot groups in the 1-1.25" range. Plenty adequate for a big game rifle that I never plan to shoot much over 400 yards with. I settled on the charge pretty quickly and didn't do much follow-up testing.
I didn't hunt with the rifle much and decided on the last weekend of the season to fill a doe tag with it. I held for the chest at maybe 125 yards and spined the deer.
I took it out Saturday to check zero and my cold bore shot went 6.5" above center. A good 3.5-4" above where it should have been. I adjusted the scope down and my shots with a warmer barrel were hitting below center at 100 yards. Unadjusted they would have been 2-3" high, right where I wanted them.
Looking back, even with my older loads, I have had several deer that were spined or missed completely on the first shot and then punched cleanly with the follow up. I always shrugged it off as poor shooting but I am rethinking that.
Any suggestions to reduce the spread between the cold bore and a warmer barrel?
Do I just sight the "group" dead on or just below at 100 and let the cold bore go 3" higher if it will do it consistently?
Do I try adding some fore end pressure to the stock and see if that quiets things down?
Is it time to rebarrel (I almost feel bad even doing that to the old girl)?
Guns flow through my house like water but this is not one that I ever plan to give up, except maybe to a grandkid. Way to much sentimental attachment. Every mark on that rifle is mine and probably 90% of my big game kills were with that gun. At the same time, I have gotten spoiled with accurate rifles and it drives me a little nuts having a rifle that I don't have much confidence it.
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks
The need for students to learn about racism in American society existed long before I began teaching a course called “White Racism” at Florida Gulf Coast University earlier this year.
I chose to title my course “White Racism” because I thought it was scholarly and succinct, precise and powerful.
But others saw it differently. Many White Americans (and some people of color) became upset when they learned about this course.
Thousands took to social media and far-right news sites and racist blogs to attack the course and me personally.
Some 150 of these individuals sent me hateful and threatening messages.
It might be tempting to blame the hostility to my course on the current political climate, in which the president of the United States routinely makes overtly racist statements and receives some of his strongest support from members of White racist hate groups. But I cannot recall a time when scholarly critiques of White supremacy in the United States have not been met with scorn.
For instance, an identically titled course taught at the University of Connecticut also ignited controversy when it made its debut in the 1990s.
White racism is nothing new
Whether a course is titled “White Racism” or “The Problem of Whiteness” or any other appropriate term in no way diminishes the academic legitimacy of the course. Scholars have used the term for decades.
I've taught courses on racial stratification in the U.S. for nearly a decade. The course, and others like it, is anchored in a damning body of historical and contemporary scholarship. That scholarship shows that Europeans and their White descendants colonized what would become the United States as well as other places around the globe. They practiced all manner of inhumanity against non-whites. This has included genocide, slavery, murder, rape, torture, theft, chicanery, segregation, discrimination, intimidation, internment, humiliation, and marginalization. This is inarguable.
Most Americans may have a general awareness of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, Jim Crow laws, lynchings, housing and labor market discrimination, and police brutality. Where we differ is about the gravity and scope of these white racist practices and the extent to which their effects continue to this day.
This disagreement is due in large part to many White Americans (and more than a few folks of color) subscribing to what I and others refer to as the myth of a colorblind society.
The myth of a colorblind society crumbles underneath a substantial body of social science research.
This myth holds that the United States is a “post-racial” society, where race is no longer related to individuals' life chances. Some buy into this myth to the point where it prevents them from recognizing the everyday reality that the United States is white supremacist in nature.
But the myth of a colorblind society crumbles underneath a substantial body of social science research that documents how race still matters in numerous areas of American life. For instance, the evidence shows that race still matters in the labor market and workplace, education, and even in access to clean water. Race matters in health care, the criminal justice system, and even everyday retail and dining experiences.
Still, many refuse to believe that racism persists. They point to the civil rights legislation of the 1960s or, more recently, the election of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States, as evidence of the “end of racism” or, at least, the “declining significance of race.”
Some might suggest that it would be easier to talk about White racism if it were done in less inflammatory or offensive ways. Perhaps this delicate approach—one that takes into account what author Robin DiAngelo refers to in her forthcoming book as “White fragility”—might be desirable or necessary for those who are fearful of the consequences of speaking unvarnished truth on racial matters. But when it comes to professors who deal with racial stratification, we should not be whitewashing reality.
Can there be “Black racism”?
The most common complaint about my course that I've encountered thus far is that anybody can be racist. They ask indignantly: What about “Black racism”? Or what about other forms of racism they believe exist on the part of Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native peoples. My answer is: There is no such thing as Black racism.
I am in no way the only one who holds this view. As Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, president of the American Sociological Association, said here at FGCU recently when asked if it would be fair to have classes such as “Asian Racism” or “Latino Racism”: “We can all be prejudiced, yeah? So, Black people can be anti-White, but there is a big difference between having prejudiced views about other people and having a system that gives systemic privilege to some groups.”
There is no such thing as Black racism.
Indeed, Blacks did not develop and benefit from a centuries-old comprehensive system of racial oppression composed of laws, policies, practices, traditions, and an accompanying ideology—one that promotes the biological, intellectual, and cultural superiority of whites to dominate other groups. Europeans and their white descendants, however, did. This is systemic racism. And students in courses such as mine are introduced to the scholarship that attests to this reality, past and present.
For instance, students will read and discuss pieces by and about W.E.B. Du Bois, Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, Joe Feagin, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Charles Mills, Paul Butler, Nikki Khanna, and Derrick Bell, among many others. They will also do work that will strengthen their ability to identify and confront colorblind racist statements.
Public money for a public problem
Some detractors of my course have suggested that students stand a better shot at getting a good grade in my course if their racial politics align with my own. This is nonsense. If a student finds peer-reviewed empirical evidence counter to that covered in the course, I would welcome the opportunity to review it.
Agreeing with my take on racial matters doesn't impact a student's grade. Whether a student earns an A in any of my courses is entirely dependent on the quality of the work they produce.
White supremacy and White racism remain terrible and intractable features of American society.
Another criticism I've heard is that I am teaching a course titled “White Racism” at a public university at taxpayer expense. However, not only should my course and others like it be taught at public colleges and universities, they must be taught at such institutions.
Florida Gulf Coast University President Michael Martin has strongly and publicly supported my academic freedom to teach my “White Racism” course.
“Reviewing the course content is much more instructive than passing judgment based on a two-word title,” he said in a statement. “At FGCU, as at all great universities, we teach our students critical thinking skills by challenging them to think independently and critically about important, even if controversial, issues of our times.”
Indeed, White supremacy and White racism remain terrible and intractable features of American society. It is in the public interest that students be provided with not only an opportunity to learn about the origin, logic, and consequences of White racial domination, but also how to challenge and dismantle it. The public university classroom is among the best places for this to occur.

If you worry about your privacy, you might be the type to put tape over your webcam, iSight, or FaceTime camera. Perhaps you use an app like Oversight, instead, so you can detect camera activity. There's actually a way you can disable your Mac's front-facing camera altogether, and it won't leave sticky residue on the component. This works on all versions of macOS and OS X.
Why Should I Disable My Mac's Camera?
This process isn't for the average Mac user. Rather, it's for those who want the privacy of having their cameras turned off. Security professionals, system administrators, and similar folks can benefit from this procedure.
A Word of Warning
Just to make sure you understand, this is an advanced tip that will fully disable the software components behind your Mac's front-facing camera. When you follow these steps, you'll prevent the camera from being used by any of the applications on your Mac. I'll also show you how to enable the camera again when you need it. If, however, you aren't comfortable modifying system files using the command line with superuser privileges, you should keep going the tape-over-the-lens route.
First, Disable System Integrity Protection
Introduced in OS X El Capitan, System Integrity Protection, or SIP, is also called rootless mode. It prevents you from modifying certain system-level files and folders. That's precisely what we need to do to disable the front-facing camera, so let's disable SIP temporarily. First, back up your Mac, then proceed.
Reboot your Mac into Recovery mode, and launch the Terminal from the Utilities menu. Then, issue the following command:
csrutil disable
Now reboot into normal mode and proceed. We'll turn SIP back on after we're done.
Completely Disable your FaceTime Camera
Now we'll be able to issue the commands necessary to disable the Mac's front-facing camera. Open the Terminal app from /Applications/Utilities and issue these command strings, one at a time, into the command line. Enter each command on its own line, even copying and pasting to make sure everything goes right.
Terminal will ask for your password for the first one, but remember it after that.
sudo chmod a-r /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreMediaIO.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VDC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/VDC
sudo chmod a-r /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreMediaIOServicesPrivate.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AVC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/AVC
sudo chmod a-r /System/Library/QuickTime/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer.component/Contents/MacOS/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer
sudo chmod a-r /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/AppleCamera.plugin/Contents/MacOS/AppleCamera
sudo chmod a-r /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/FCP-DAL/AppleCamera.plugin/Contents/MacOS/AppleCamera
Now, when you open an app that needs to use the camera, your Mac will tell you that no camera is available. This includes FaceTime, Skype, Photo Booth, QuickTime, iMovie, etc., and is exactly what we're looking for when we disable the FaceTime camera or webcam.
If you have apps running that already had access to the camera, you may have to relaunch that software for changes to take effect. You don't have to reboot, though.
Turn System Integrity Protection Back On
Now, reboot into Recovery mode again. Re-enable SIP by issuing this command from Terminal:
csrutil enable
Turning the Camera Back On
When you want access back to your camera, you just reverse what you've done previously. First, go back into the Recovery mode and disable SIP, as before. Once you've done that and you're back in normal boot mode, launch Terminal again and issue these commands, one at a time, each on its own line:
sudo chmod a+r /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreMediaIO.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VDC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/VDC
sudo chmod a+r /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreMediaIOServicesPrivate.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AVC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/AVC
sudo chmod a+r /System/Library/QuickTime/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer.component/Contents/MacOS/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer
sudo chmod a+r /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/AppleCamera.plugin/Contents/MacOS/AppleCamera
sudo chmod a+r /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/FCP-DAL/AppleCamera.plugin/Contents/MacOS/AppleCamera
Now, you can launch your favorite camera-using app, and it will work just fine again.
Make sure you turn SIP back on.
What Do These Steps Do?
If you aren't familiar with file permissions on a UNIX system, the commands to disable the FaceTime camera take away read access to the files required for the camera to function. When we turn camera capability back on, we give that read access back.

Apple's new emojis are here.
First announced on World Emoji Day (yes, apparently, that exists) in July, hundreds of new emojis will be available next week on iPhone and iPad with iOS 11.1, Apple said on Friday.
Emojis, colorful and playful pictograms that are available on a range of devices, have altered the way humans communicate with one other and have become a powerful force in pop culture, both online and off.
Hillary Clinton tried to use emojis to reach out to young voters during the 2016 campaign. Last summer, Sony Pictures released a movie that imagined emojis' inner emotional life. (Neither the campaign nor the film was a success. The real-world track record of emojis is not great.)

Nevertheless, emojis have provided a cheeky visual shorthand for such common experiences as laughing, vomiting and, with the latest update, the desire to reference a hedgehog in everyday conversation.

CLEVELAND (WFAN) — This is what the Yankees are now up against.
To advance to the AL Championship Series the Bombers have to win three out of four against a juggernaut Indians team that has lost only four of its last 38 games. And they will have to do it by going through the best pitcher in the league twice.
That's Corey Kluber, and the Indians did actually lose three consecutive Kluber starts in some freaky, fluky stretch in July. But the task facing the Yankees is obviously gigantic.
MORE: Palladino: Trouble With The Curve? Yankees Didn't Have A Clue In Game 1
Kluber was 18-4 during the regular season and his 265 strikeouts were second only to the Red Sox's Chris Sale. Kluber led the American League in ERA (2.25) and WHIP (0.869), and threw five complete games, including three shutouts.
The Yanks saw Kluber twice in August. The schedule makers must have been conspiring to keep them away from his July losing streak. On Aug. 3 in Cleveland, Kluber fired a three-hitter with 11 strikeouts in a 5-1 victory. Then on Aug. 28 in the Bronx, the impressive right-hander tossed eight innings of three-hit ball in a 6-2 victory.
Overall, the Yankees have now faced Kluber seven times. He's 5-1 with a 1.80 ERA in that span and the Bombers have scored a grand total of 13 runs (10 earned).
This isn't a tall order. This is an extra venti grande, or whatever you're supposed to call them. Small, medium, and large work just fine for the rest of the world, so why do we have to … never mind. Back to the point. This is going to be hard.
But this is sports, remember? Where you believe anything can happen when the bounces go the right way. And the guy on the other side can make his statement, too. That's the ageless CC Sabathia.
Sabathia, who will be making his 20th postseason appearance, has waited a long time to get back here. He was a playoff fixture when he pitched in six straight Octobers for the Indians, Brewers, and Yankees from 2007-12. But he hasn't pitched a playoff game since the 2012 ALCS, the series that began with Derek Jeter breaking his ankle and ended with the Yankees being swept by the Tigers.
Sabathia has waited through six trips to the disabled list, a couple of knee surgeries, and one trip to alcohol rehab to get back to this place. And it's in the same building where he made his name, where 17-year-old Sabathia sat next to his mom and signed his first pro contract.
Two decades later, the 37-year-old southpaw is preparing to pitch what could be his last game in a Yankees uniform. He has the power to extend this season and his career if he can go toe-to-toe with Kluber on Friday afternoon.
These Yankees have clung all year to the idea that nobody thought they would get this far in 2017. So now they need to use some of that same resolve, because there aren't many who believe they can overcome this obstacle, either.

"Yehuda and Sharren, we in the Likud represent a great deal of traditional and religious people. If we need to – we can improve the Supermarket Law, but you do not bring down a coalition over such a law. In any event, I do not feel so good, so do us a favor: Finish the talks with Bibi and let's vote and get it over with," Hazan wrote on Twitter.
The father of the toddler found dead in a hot car is charged
The father of the toddler who was left inside a hot car in Burlington last week is now facing charges.
Police were called to a building on North Service Road around 5:30 last Wednesday evening. Police say the three-year-old child was inside an SUV and was pronounced dead on scene.
37-year-old Shaun Pennell of Burlington has now been charged with criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessaries of life.
The SUV was in the parking lot of a building that's home to a Christian media group and other businesses. The preliminary cause of death was determined to be hyperthermia, consistent with the child being left in a vehicle and exposed to high temperatures for an extended period of time.
There's no mention of a game lineup, and Atari noted that its "objective" is to announce the pre-order date sometime in April. It could be well into the spring before you can even put money down on a VCS, let alone hook one up to your TV. We're still holding out some hope for the VCS, especially since it won't be limited to playing vintage games, but the proof will be in the pudding -- Atari needs to show a working device and playable titles for this to be more than another nostalgia cash-in.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate's GOP and Democratic leaders can't agree on much, but they both say they want to dedicate weeks to passing legislation to fund the government next year — and avoid the annual take-it-or-leave-it vote on a foot-tall, $1 trillion-plus catchall spending bill.
For now, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer are saying all the right things to try to revive the older, more deliberative ways of doing Senate business rather than bundling the 12 annual spending bills together.
Critics say it gives too much power to top leaders while rank and file lawmakers are shut out of secretive negotiations.
President Donald Trump is playing a role as well, promising that he won't sign any more such "omnibus" appropriations bills.
Before they can begin thinking about turkey at Christmas dinner, the Niagara College men's and women's basketball teams first have to deal with another bird.
The Fanshawe Falcons provide the opposition in a doubleheader Wednesday at the Athletic Centre at the college's main campus in Welland. Action tips off with the women's game at 6 p.m. The men take the court two hours later.
Head coach Mike Hurley's men's team and Mike Beccaria's women's squad come into their final game before the between-semesters break with different goals.
While the men want to win their second in a row, the women want to head into the holidays on a winning note after snapping a five-game winning streak.
Beccaria's sixth-ranked Knights were no match for the Humber Hawks, the No. 1 team in the province and the three-time defending Ontario Colleges Athletic Association (OCAA) champions.
“The score, 102-50 in favour of Humber, speaks for itself,” Beccaria said after Friday night's loss at home. “Saying it was not a good night would be a dramatic understatement.
“We need to collect ourselves and be better against Fanshawe.”
Humber showed no signs of a letdown after setting the OCAA record for consecutive wins in women's basketball two nights earlier. The Hawks had the hotter shooting hand from the floor, 40-for-95, 42 per cent; compared to 18-for-55, 32.7; for Niagara, as well as from beyond the three point arc, 13-for-30, 43.3 per cent; compared to 5-for-17, 29.4 per cent.
Humber won the battle of the boards, 55 rebounds to 32, and dominated the game when it came to converting turnovers into points, 52-7.
St. Catharines native and Governor Simcoe graduate Mary Ingribelli topped the Knights in scoring with 15 points as well as in rebounding, seven.
Niagara, which was ranked sixth in the province last week, fell to 6-3. Fanshawe, No. 3 in the top 10, visits from London, Ont., with an 8-2 record.
Humber's 95-54 victory over the University of Toronto-Mississauga Eagles last Wednesday was the Hawks' 68th win in a row in regular-season and post-season play.
The previous mark of 67 was held by the Algonquin Thunder, who went undefeated from November 2011 until January 2015.
Humber hasn't lost a game in women's basketball since losing on the road to the St. Clair Saints on Nov. 8, 2014.
Knights ground Hawks
Three players recorded a double-double, and Niagara needed every one of those points and rebounds – and then some sum – to beat Humber in men's college basketball.
“As much as it was nice to beat an always tough Humber team, we didn't play to the best of our abilities as we need to play better team defence and on offence have a better assist-to-turnover ratio as well as improve our foul shooting,” Hurley said after the eighth-ranked Knights knocked off the fifth-ranked Hawks 102-97.
“We did shoot the ball well from the floor and had a great rebounding game, which ended up being the difference.”
Niagara shot 60.5 per cent from the floor, 46-for-47, compared to 46.3 per cent, 38-for-83; for Humber.
The Knights won the rebounding battle by a wide margin, 56 to 21.
Key contributors for Niagara in the win were Van Hutchinson, 36 points, 12 rebounds; Jordon McDonald, 24 points, 10 rebounds; Jordan Wilson, 21 points, 13 rebounds; and Levi Mukuna, 13 points, eight rebounds.
The win in the opening game of a home-and-home series with Humber improved the Knights to 6-3 lifting them into fourth place in the West Division.
The Fanshawe Falcons, 6-4, Lambton Lions, 6-4, and Mohawk Mountaineers, 6-5, also have 12 points, but Niagara has a game in hand on Fanshawe and Lambton and two on Mohawk.
The Knights volleyball teams have already wrapped up the first half of the season and won't resume league play until Saturday, Jan. 13, when they host the Conestoga Condors in a doubleheader.
At the break the Niagara women, 6-2, and the Niagara men, 4-4, are ranked third and seventh, respectively, in the province.

ATHLETES OF THE WEEK
Niagara College's top scorers in men's and women's basketball are also the top athletes for the week ending Sunday at the region's community college.
Van Hutchinson Jr. had a game-high 36 points and 12 rebounds as the men's team clipped the Humber Hawks 102-97, while Mary Ingribelli had 15 points as the women's team dropped a 102-50 decision to Humber.
“Van has been great for us all season,” head coach Mike Hurley said. “His ability to come up big in games like these show how crucial his success for us heading into the OCAA championships in 2018.”
The Knights are guaranteed a berth in the elite eight as hosts of the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association men's basketball championships taking place March 1-3 in Welland.
Ingribelli is Niagara's top female athlete for the second week in a row. The St. Catharines native and Governor Simcoe graduate is sixth in the province in scoring averaging 17.9 points per game.
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Tuesday that the most significant question posed by the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn is why intelligence officials eavesdropped on his calls with the Russian ambassador and later leaked information on those calls to the press.
“I expect for the FBI to tell me what is going on, and they better have a good answer,” said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which is conducting a review of Russian activities to influence the election. “The big problem I see here is that you have an American citizen who had his phone calls recorded.”
Flynn resigned Monday night, days after The Washington Post reported that intelligence officials had recorded Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. before Trump took office. Those recordings, The Post reported, appeared to contradict Flynn's own claims that he had not discussed easing U.S. sanctions on Russia.
Although it remains unclear whether Flynn himself was being monitored for any reason, his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were intercepted because the Russians' calls are routinely monitored.
The president also criticized the leaks in a tweet early Tuesday morning.
The International Federation of Fitness and Bodybuilding (IFBB) have announced that four of their disciplines will be at the 2018 South American Games in Cochabamba, Bolivia.

Shia Waqf Board chairman Waseem Rizvi on Friday stated that all the Muslims against the construction of Ram Mandir must shift to Pakistan and Bangladesh. The remarks by the Shia Waqf Board chairman came in after he offered his Friday's prayers in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. After meeting the high priest, Acharya Satyendra Das, Rizvi criticised the fundamentalist mentality of the people and said that it was this mentality that is causing disruptions in the area.
Just a few hours after the Supreme Court announced that it will be hearing the cases pertaining to Babri Masjid and Ram Janambhoomi from February 8, a Shia Waqf Board in Uttar Pradesh announced that all the Muslims standing against the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya must leave India and settle in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The remarks were made by the chairman of Shia Waqf Board, Waseem Rizvi, on Friday soon after he offered prayers at the disputed site in Ayodhya.
After offering his Friday prayers, Waseem Rizvi also met the priest of Ram Janambhoomi. After meeting the high priest, Acharya Satyendra Das, Rizvi criticised the fundamentalist mentality of the people and said that it was this mentality that is causing disruptions in the area. He said, “Those who are opposing the Ram Janambhoomi temple in Ayodhya and want to build the Babri Mosque there… People having such fundamentalist mentality should go to Pakistan and Bangladesh. Such Muslims do not have any place in India.”
Criticising people who were disrupting harmony over the construction of the Ram Temple, UP's Shia Waqf Board chairman added, “Those who want to spread Jihad in the name of the mosque must go and join the forces of Abu Bakr Baghdadi, the Islamic State (IS) chief in Syria.” He further alleged that some fundamentalist Muslim clerics are working for the destruction of the country. All those involved in this destruction must migrate to Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Reacting to Rizvi's remarks, a Shia cleric demanded the arrest of Rizvi alleging that he was trying to create communal tension in the area. Talking to PTI, president of Shia Ulema Council (SUC) Maulana Iftekhar Hussain Inquilabi alleged that Waseem Rizvi is a criminal and has been charge sheeted by the CB-CID. The cleric further added that in order to avoid the arrest he is creating this drama.
Bulawayo-born music video producer Vusumuzi ‘Blaqs' Hlatshwayo has come out in defence of Killer T's new video for Bvunza Tinzwe of the chanter in a coffin, saying it was all about creativity that people will understand when it is released.
This video comes after another controversial one by Ammara Brown and her sister Chengeto – Watchu want -where the former had a python slithering on her body that left people in awe.
Now some pictures from Killer T's video shoot for the hit track Bvunza Tinzwe on Monday and yesterday found their way onto social media depicting the chanter as a dead man in a coffin.
While some viewed it as plainly ingenuity those with deep seated superstitions have been criticising the chanter likening the scene to satanism initiation.
It seemed the comments on social media perturbed Blaqs and he went on Facebook live yesterday to set the record straight and defend the music video.
Vusa Blaqs said the video was depicting death which everyone will go through.
“I'm here to demystify the issue of Killer T being dead. This is part of the art that we're creating.
“What we want to do is to cross boundaries and really address the issues people are afraid to address.
“Death is just death guys everyone will die even me I'll die. Don't be hung up with a coffin it's just a piece of wood and we did that to create art and visuals for a song that talks about what it talks about,” said Blaqs. He said the music video will be out sometime soon.
“Soon people will understand what we were doing with the concept of the music video.
“They shall love it for our creativity,” said Blaqs.The Chronicle

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Charles Manson's cremated remains have been scattered nearly four months after the cult leader died in prison. A funeral was held Saturday following a court battle for the 83-year-old's remains.
Pastor Mark Pitcher of the Church of the Nazarene in Porterville, California, says 20 to 25 people attended the funeral.
Among them were Manson's grandson, Jason Freeman, and Freeman's wife, Audrey.
Freeman prevailed last week in a months-long court fight for custody of Manson's remains.
His grandfather was cremated after the service and his ashes scattered.
Pitcher said Monday he agreed to lead the service because Freeman and his wife are Christians.
Manson was sentenced to life in prison for orchestrating the 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and eight others.
He died in November.

According to a Washington Post report, based on two more unnamed “officials”, special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating President Donald Trump for ‘obstruction of justice' presumably based on the firing of FBI Director James Comey.
This report/outcome is not unexpected as it would be part of Mueller's investigative duty to follow-up on any assertions made in this regard regardless of merit.
(Washington Post) […] Trump had received private assurances from former FBI Director James B. Comey starting in January that he was not personally under investigation. Officials say that changed shortly after Comey's firing.
Five people briefed on the requests, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said Daniel Coats, the current director of national intelligence, Adm. Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency, and Rogers' recently departed deputy, Richard Ledgett, agreed to be interviewed by Mueller's investigators as early as this week. The investigation has been cloaked in secrecy and it's unclear how many others have been questioned by the FBI. …The obstruction of justice investigation into the president began days after Comey was fired on May 9, according to people familiar with the matter. Mueller's office has now taken up that work, and the preliminary interviews scheduled with intelligence officials indicate his team is actively pursuing potential witnesses inside and outside the government. The interviews suggest Mueller sees the attempted obstruction of justice question as more than just a “he said, he said” dispute between the president and the fired FBI director, an official said.” (link w/ paywall)
It would appear the FBI and Robert Mueller's team are still leaking information as noted by President Trump attorney:
“The White House now refers all questions about the Russia investigation to Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. “The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal,” said Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Kasowitz.”
As we previously discussed – The risk represented by Robert Mueller is not connected to or about anything surrounding the Russian Conspiracy Narrative; the legal risk is within ‘the leaking‘ of classified intelligence information to undermine the administration, the potentially illegal ‘unmasking‘, and now adding an obstruction of justice angle.
If we avoid all the shiny things, ignore the shell game and reset our frame of reference to the only illegal activity currently known, the leaking; the main illegal activity visible is the illegal leaking of classified intelligence information.
Despite his earnest efforts, there is clear and mounting evidence that former FBI Director James Comey was the primary source of leaked information to the media. The latest Washington Post report is yet another example. The reporter for the Post article is one of a limited number (25) people whom James Comey follows on Twitter.
You have no named sources. Interesting that James Comey aka @projectexile7 and you follow each other. DM buddies? — Covfefe Katica (@GOPPollAnalyst) June 14, 2017
The risk to Comey from his media leaking continues to explain everything James Comey has recently done, said and advanced.
If the evidence of James Comey being the source of multiple FBI leaks reaches the primary artery of investigative sunlight, who inside that investigative and prosecutorial decision making process becomes the risk? Answer that question and you discover the angle Comey is playing to cut off their ability to hold him accountable.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Asst AG Rod Rosenstein et al are the people Comey needs to worry about, isolate and control. It is not coincidental that Comey is setting up the future action of these participants to be politically motivated.
James Comey's layer of innuendo against Jeff Sessions is an obvious strategy toward that end. If Comey can frame Sessions as retaliatory against him, he would position any legal action as retaliation.
Anyone who is buying into the story of James Comey leaking the memos to his friend, Daniel Richman, to get a special prosecutor appointed is falling for the shell game constructed entirely by James Comey. More than likely this is the explanation he has already given to Robert Mueller, hence his motive to state within his testimony.
It is important to remember that James Comey told congress he previously met with Robert Mueller to discuss his testimony prior to appearing before congress.
James Comey admitted to this specific “leaking”, because the justification to ‘get a special counsel appointed‘ is the explanatory storyline James Comey wants to present in public.
The alternate reason for leaking, the political motives, are much more damaging to him.
James Comey benefits two ways from his explanation. First, he justifies terrible behavior through a prism of his honor could find no other way (his status remains). Secondly, he sets up special counsel Mueller as fruit of a poisoned tree leading to voices calling for Mueller's removal. Win/Win. Comey also benefits from calls by his political opposition to eliminate Robert Mueller who is investigating the leaking.
However, if you accept the full hindsight of now identified FBI leaking, the greater likelihood is that Comey didn't leak the memo to get Mueller appointed, he leaked the memo (May 16th) as an afterthought to cover for the leak mentioned by President Trump (May 12th), of a private conversation, that appeared in the New York Times on May 11th.
Remember, James Comey's counter-intelligence investigation could have asked for a special counsel at any time. Asst. AG and Interim AG Sally Yates was part of that investigative leadership team. If Comey wanted a special counsel, Comey could have asked DOJ to appoint a special counsel any time he wanted.
He didn't.
Comey didn't request appointment of a special counsel because the special counsel would only prove there's nothing there. However, fast forward to now and the real investigative risk is in being “a leaker”.
How quickly everyone forgets those admitted conversations by James Comey friend at Lawfare blog Benjamin Wittes:
“I did not know this particular fact, but it doesn't surprise me at all. The principal source for the rest of this story is, well, me—specifically a long interview I gave to reporter Michael Schmidt on Friday about my conversations with FBI Director James Comey over the last few months, and particularly about one such conversation that took place on March 27 over lunch in Comey's FBI office.” (link)
Benjamin Wittes admits that FBI Director James Comey specifically discussed with him the overall content of private communications with President Trump.
When you take the Wittes outline in conjuction with Comey's admitted leaks to his other friend Daniel Richman, Comey is transparently in a position of being fingered as the source of multiple media leaks to NYT reporter Michael Schmidt.
That is the current risk for James Comey. The discovery that Comey was the leaker is the risk now represented by Robert Mueller and is inherent in Comey's need to control the framework of his leaking activity.
James Comey was part of the political apparatus that constructed the “muh, vast Russian conspiracy” narrative and carefully nurtured it for over 8 months – even keeping congress in the dark on the entire matter. From James Comey perspective, the problem, the illegality, is now the leaking – NOT the original issue of the Russian election hacking narrative.
Remember, it was in FEBRUARY when the FBI (McCabe) went to President Trump's Chief of Staff privately and told Reince Priebus there was no truth to media reports, based on FBI leaks, of FBI evidence showing Trump campaign officials involved with Russian officials regarding the 2016 election. It was all a complete nothingburger.
Details – On February 15th while discussing another issue FBI Assistant Director Andrew McCabe asked Reince for 5 minutes alone after the meeting. At the one-on-one meeting McCabe told Priebus the New York Times Russia and Trump campaign story was a “bunch of BS”.
Priebus asked McCabe if McCabe would be able to say that publicly and get the media off his back about a ridiculously false narrative. Asst. Director McCabe said he would check with his boss, FBI Director James Comey. Later, McCabe called back and said he couldn't issue a statement about it.
Reince Priebus was simply asking for the FBI to give truthful information about the false reports to the public. The White House was asking Comey to deliver transparency.
Quote from the FBI to Priebus: “We'd love to help, but we can't get into the position of making statements on every story”…
In hindsight, from current appearances, those February leaks (mentioned above) that drove the New York Times February report were actually leaks coming from James Comey.
Stop and think about it. McCabe was telling chief-of-staff Reince Priebus not to worry about a NYT report based on leaks coming (first, second or third-hand) from James Comey himself. Priebus asks McCabe for help, James Comey then tells McCabe the FBI cannot publicly refute the story which is based on Comey's leaking.
If everyone associated with this line of inquiry can stop themselves from following the shell game constructed by Comey, and avoid the distractions he is laying down (Lynch), they'll eventually find a way to point this out.
Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication…and WOW, Comey is a leaker! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2017
I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!' — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2017

I'm not sure how many times we need to go through this. The trifecta parable of confusing privacy settings, postpublication safety considerations and the requirement of major headlines for companies to give a shit. It's as if the makers of Strava and its ilk are living in a completely different internet.
Let's be clear: Fitness apps have a massive privacy problem. MapMyRun, Nike + RunClub and Strava (to name a few) all come with scary default privacy settings that are combined with mapping tools. These apps are a dream come true for stalkers, terrorists and spies.
And yet, nearly 10 years after Please Rob Me made a devastating mockery of Silicon Valley's reckless location-sharing mania — by using publicly available social-media information to show when people's homes are vacant — Strava just burps and says, "Hold my beer."
Strava's global heat maps have been around for awhile but got a big update in November 2017 boasting "1 billion activities" and "3 trillion latitude/longitude points" mined from "10 terabytes of raw input data" from its users. (Spoiler alert: unsuspecting user plot twist ahead. We'll probably never know how much of this inadvertent sharing came from Strava's carelessly confusing privacy settings.)
Yet it was the observations of one national-security-policy nerd on Twitter over the past weekend that got all the infosec chickens clucking. "Strava released their global heatmap," tweeted Nathan Ruser. "13 trillion GPS points from their users (turning off data sharing is an option) ... It looks very pretty, but not amazing for Op-Sec. US Bases are clearly identifiable and mappable."
And Strava's location data patty-cake playtime with the data of its "global community of millions of runners, cyclists and triathletes" who use Fitbits and phones is amazing. For spies and bad guys, that is.
With the data, press reported that it's possible to "establish the names and hometowns of individuals who have signed up for a social sharing network where runners post their routes and speeds. One popular route on a base in Iraq has been nicknamed "Base Perimeter" by the U.S. runners who regularly use it. Another outside-the-big-U.S. base in Kandahar, Afghanistan, is called "Sniper Alley."

If only someone in the San Francisco startup's offices had foreseen this. Except they sort of did. People had for months been trying to tell Strava that its privacy protocols were dangerous and that its maps were just a little problematic.
These issues with Strava had been well-established by at least July of last year when a female runner and journalist exposed the company's very real privacy problems in an article for Quartz. I think the article was overlooked and largely ignored because the app's fairly dangerous privacy mess was described as a "feminist issue." As in, it got shuffled off as a women's problem.
Strava's response to the July 2017 article — calling out its reckless privacy practices as a threat to women — was to publish a blog post two days later essentially blaming users for not doing its privacy settings correctly.
It's hardly a coincidence that the people most at risk of violence from apps that exploit user privacy and location data are the ones most routinely ignored when they raise the alarm.
Anyway, when increasingly larger news outlets began to report about Strava's exciting new feature, self-guided online tours of military facilities in war zones, Strava attempted to reuse its old blog post from last year as a statement.
When no one would go away, Strava issued a new statement saying that it takes the safety of its users seriously. The company will now focus on privacy awareness to address security issues.
That's great. This is fine. Well, not really. Nathaniel Raymond, director of the Signal Program on Human Security and Technology at the Harvard School of Public Health, told press that the public availability of the data represents "a potential catastrophe."

The US military kind of agrees. A lot. Reuters reported by midweek that US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ordered a review of the situation and will be changing its guidelines for the use of all wireless devices on military facilities. As is tradition, no one's confirming or denying anything. "Pentagon spokesman Colonel Robert Manning told reporters at a news briefing he did not know of any instances in which U.S. base security had been compromised as a result of the mapping," the outlet reported.
Many would expect Strava's heatmaps to have been taken down for review, pending user privacy clarifications (making sure people understand what they're sharing), meetings with military and hopefully also domestic-violence shelters and also women in general. But if this is you expecting this, you would be wrong.
The maps are still live as a wire, and people are poring over them like porn from an alien planet. "People wearing Strava-enabled fitness trackers appear to have been poking around a Thames shipwreck containing nearly 1,500 tonnes of explosives from the Second World War," The Register reported in this great post on interpreting the heatmaps, cautioning us on how to avoid jumping to conclusions as more people tear into the data looking for new things to make headlines out of in the coming weeks.
We can only hope that some good comes out of the Strava heatmap debacle. I don't mean the kind where Strava seizes the opportunity to radically change the way user privacy is taught to ordinary people, to take the lead in creating sustainable data sharing practices for at-risk populations, or any such impossible nonsense. I mean the more realistic kind, where people find Disneyland's secret entrances.
Former Sunderland boss David Moyes has revealed it was sacked director of recruitment Tony Henry who recommended West Ham sign Africans Islam Slimani and Ibrahim Amadou and that the controversial comments he allegedly made came as a "massive shock".
The club sacked Henry, originally from Houghton-le-Spring, on Friday after the Daily Mail claimed he said they no longer wanted to sign African players because "they have a bad attitude" and "cause mayhem" when not selected.
Tony Henry, wearing number 4, playing for Oldham at Sunderland in 1987.
West Ham said in a statement that he was dismissed "following his unacceptable comments that were widely reported" and also added: "We will not tolerate any type of discrimination."
Before Wednesday's transfer deadline, they had attempted and failed to recruit both Algerian Slimani, who instead joined Newcastle on loan from Leicester, and the Cameroon-born Amadou from Lille.
Moyes was regardless asked about allegations that 60-year-old Henry, who briefly worked in a scouting capacity for Sunderland in 2014, claimed a directive to avoid African signings came from him.
But the manager said: "If we were signing two African players on deadline day, you would have to say it's incorrect and wrong.
"It's a massive shock, because you are well aware of the couple of players we were trying to sign on deadline day, so that's why it's a big surprise. We were very, very close to signing two players from Africa.
"I've known Tony and he has to get on with his stuff but all I can say is that it wasn't correct because we were trying to sign two players like that on deadline day."
Asked if Henry had recommended Slimani and Amadou, he then responded: "Yes. They were two players who were slightly available, albeit who came up late."
Moyes also approached the club's players to hold a "frank conversation" with them regarding the reports surrounding Henry.
"That conversation will remain private," the 54-year-old said. "All I can tell you is the players have worked really well. Hopefully we can move on.
"In all my time in football I've seen very little racism, and I don't see it at any club. I've no doubt that it's happening, so don't think I don't. But I've seen very, very little."
Three south Louisiana men have been arrested on child pornography charges, according to Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry.
“These arrests were made possible through a partnership with local, state, and federal law enforcement leaders,” Landry said in a written statement. “We will continue these collaborative efforts to make our communities safer.”
Arthur Thiel, 42 of Houma, was arrested on 150 counts of possession of sexual abuse images/videos of children (under the age of 13), three counts of distribution of sexual abuse images/videos of children, two counts of production of sexual abuse images/videos of children, and two counts of molestation of a juvenile. Thiel was booked into the Terrebonne Parish Jail as a fugitive from Lafourche Parish, following a joint investigation by the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation (LBI) Cyber Crime Unit, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and the Lafourche Parish Sheriff's Office.
Timothy Billiot, 49 of Morgan City, was arrested on 10 counts of possession of sexual abuse images/videos of children (under the age of 13), five counts of possession of sexual abuse images/videos of children, and one count of distribution of sexual abuse images/videos of children. He was booked into the St. Mary Parish Jail following a joint investigation between the LBI Cyber Crime Unit, HSI, the St. Mary Sheriff's Office, and the Louisiana Probation and Parole, Thibodaux Field Office.
Colby Babin, 27 of Gheens, was arrested on one count of sexual abuse images/videos of children (under the age of 13). He was booked into the Lafourche Parish Jail following a joint investigation between the LBI Cyber Crime Unit, HSI, and the Lafourche Parish Sheriff's Office.
Landry condemned the alleged actions of the suspects saying,
“The victimization of children should infuriate all of us and shake us to the core. My office and I will keep doing all we can to bring justice to the despicable who prey upon our state's most innocent.”
Anyone with any information or concerns of the suspects is asked to call the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation at 800-256-4506. Callers can remain anonymous.

Transcript for East Coast braces for possible 4th nor'easter in 3 weeks
We're going to turn next here to that severe weather threat at this hour. A tornado watches. Authorities are calling it a particularly dangerous situation going into the night. Dark clouds ahead of a snowstorm that moved out of Colorado, into the plains. And look at this. Damaging hail in Alabama. As I mentioned, now the fourth nor'easter in just three weeks. And perfectly timed for the first day of spring. Kind of torture. Senior meteorologist rob Marciano back with us again tonight, tracking it all. Reporter: Hey, David. We'll start with the southern part of this. You mentioned the pds watch. Not uncommon to get large tornadoes this time of year. A tornado confirmed on the ground in southwest Alabama. Then, eventually to coastal Carolinas and Georgia and tomorrow in through parts of Florida. Hopefully weakening by then. Northern part of this system, winter storm watches all the way up through Boston. Completion for now, but it will spin that moisture into the cold air. Heavy, wet snow. At this point, we're thinking five to ten inches of wet snow along the I-95 corridor, in some of the cities. Some uncertainty in that, David, but we're confident it's going to be the fourth nor'easter. Rob, thank you. We're going to move on tonight, and to new undercover

TORONTO — WestJet says it is reviewing its baggage policy after a customer complained that it discriminated against travellers from certain countries.
The airline currently has a policy that prevents travellers to Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago from checking in more than two bags, unless the extra luggage is "a golf bag containing golf clubs."
Jared Walker tweeted about the policy after his 62-year-old mother was prevented from bringing an oversized bag on a trip to Jamaica to attend a funeral.
Walker, 30, said the policy is "absurd" and shows preferential treatment to tourists, as opposed to travellers returning to their country of origin.
WestJet told The Canadian Press in a statement that the baggage policy was in place for Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago "due to the amount of excess checked baggage brought by guests travelling to these particular destinations."
The company said it's reviewing the aspect of the baggage policy related to golf bags, recognizing "the optics are poor."
It further said that travellers who want to bring more than two bags to Jamaica or Trinidad and Tobago can do so through WestJet Cargo, its air shipping service.
The airline said it apologized to Walker and reached out to him in an attempt to resolve the issue. "It was never our intention to be discriminatory in this specific baggage policy," said Lauren Stewart, a spokeswoman for WestJet.
Walker said he received an apology and other messages from the company Wednesday afternoon but it was too late to help his mother, who was already in Jamaica.
He said he booked tickets for his mother, Nellrene Walker, so she could attend her sister's funeral in Jamaica. After paying for the tickets, he saw WestJet's baggage policy, and called customer service, he said.
Watching is The New York Times's TV and film recommendation newsletter and website.
This is a strong week for serious TV. While lighter fare always abounds — and sometimes feels particularly essential — we're turning our attention now to documentaries, dramas and a home-design show, all of which have some weight to them.
We're always adding new recommendations to Watching, and we recently added one of my favorite shows ever, “Pushing Daisies.” If you like romance, whimsy, pie or all three, try it.

When to watch: 10 p.m., on PBS (check local listings).

The first half of this documentary is an interesting and enjoyable iteration of the “these people are fanatical about something I am unaware of” genre. (In this case, it's seed libraries and activism around the preservation of plant varieties.) The second half, unfortunately, drifts toward the generic. Also of note, though, are the lovely interstitial animations and the art direction in general — dreamy and quirky and sometimes cute, with a style of stop-motion animation that's almost “Sesame Street”-like.

‘L.A. Burning: The Riots 25 Years Later'
When to watch: 9 p.m., on A&E.
If you watched “O.J.: Made In America” and wanted more about the L.A. riots, which occurred 25 years ago this month, this documentary is for you. In fact there are five documentaries about the riots showing in the next week and change. This one is solid, affecting and effective — focused, rather than sprawling.
Also Tuesday: “Pretty Little Liars” is back at 8 p.m.on Freeform for its final 10 episodes. Back in the day, this was a fun and bold thriller, but I admit to having lost track of it somewhere around Season 4, when it became clear the show was simply never going to solve anything.

This oddball anthology series from FX is back for a third season. This time it's set in 2010 and stars Ewan McGregor in dual roles as Emmit and Ray Stussy, rival brothers who are both, of course, overly involved in society's dark, seedy side. As in the other seasons, a set of ominous coincidences sets off a deadly chain reaction that ensnares small-town law enforcement (this season it's Carrie Coon, also currently starring on “The Leftovers”) and small-time criminals (like the parolee played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead).

“Fargo” has a stunningly elaborate soundscape. The first episode alone features more kinds of sounds made only by paper than any show in living memory: rustling, crumpling, blowing away, shivering; the sound of rifling through a pile, the sound of shuffling cards, the sound of pulling paper out of one's pocket.
The character names are almost Dickensian — Gloria Burgle, the cop! Nikki Swango, the temptress! — and the wigs and costume design walk right up to the line of satire. Everything on “Fargo” is slightly askew, which can sometimes have a dampening effect, making its characters feel slightly flat and remote.
Watching “Fargo” reminds me of watching calligraphy videos, with sweeping curlicues and gorgeous, effortless loops. It's beautiful, hypnotic, artful, but still sometimes hard to read.

‘Grand Designs'
When to watch: Now, on Netflix.
Save to Watchlist ribbon Save to Watchlist
There are 17 seasons of “Grand Designs” in Britain, but American viewers will have to be satisfied with the two now available on Netflix. Hey, it's a start. “Grand Designs” is the rare home design and real estate show that is not fundamentally contrived, stupid, or contrived and stupid. (I say this as a “Trading Spaces” obsessive. I don't judge your “House Hunters” love, but I see a better path for us both.)
This show follows people embarking on elaborate construction plans for wildly interesting homes — some that radiate “nightmarishly impractical idea” from the get-go, some fascinating and beautiful, some eventual money pits thanks to rotten luck. The house design is always interesting, and the host, Kevin McCloud, is more probing than perky, unlike his HGTV colleagues.
Earlier today President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump hosted a celebration of Hispanic Heritage month in the EAST ROOM of the White House.
[Transcript] 12:52 P.M. EDT – THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you in Puerto Rico!
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. You should, you should. (Laughter.) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
And it's great to be with you and Secretary Acosta, Treasurer Carranza, and to every Hispanic American serving in the White House and all across our administration. Thank you very much. (Applause.) It's a great privilege for the First Lady, Melania, and I to be with you all today. Thank you very much. (Applause.)
We want to welcome our ambassadors, members of Congress, local officials, and Hispanic community and faith leaders, and guests from across the White House. You are really special people. You've worked so hard with us. Today's performers, Julissa. How was she? Was she good? Huh?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
THE PRESIDENT: I heard she was fantastic. And “Yes” Movement Orchestra, and the work that they've done and the incredible job that they've done. Thank you very much.
We're honored to have you all here to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. Right? (Applause.) Please, First Lady. Please, come up. Come up. (Applause.) And, by the way, we just got back from Puerto Rico together, and it was really quite a sight. We're doing a great job there, and they are great, great people. They are great people. They've been through a lot.
PARTICIPANT: So are you!
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.)
As we gather for this celebration, our hearts remain heavy and sad for the victims of the horrible mass murder in Las Vegas. On Wednesday, in Nevada, I visited with brave survivors still recovering in the hospital, and with heroic police officers, first responders, and everyday Americans who acted with speed and courage to save countless lives. No evil on this Earth is more powerful than the love and courage of the American people.
All of America is praying for the wounded and the grieving, and we will be with them today and we will be with them forever. (Applause.) And I spent a lot of time going through the hospital with Melania and seeing some incredible people who were so seriously wounded. We will never leave their side.
We're also praying for the people of Puerto Rico. We love Puerto Rico. (Applause.) Puerto Rico.
PARTICIPANT: We love you!
THE PRESIDENT: And we also love Puerto Rico. (Applause.) And we're marshaling every federal resource at our disposal.
Earlier this week, I traveled to Puerto Rico to oversee federal response to the two devastating hurricanes. Remember, it was two. It was one, and then it was another. And that second one was brutal. And they struck that great and beautiful island. And we now have more than 15,000 federal personnel on the island — 15,000. We will not rest until that job is done.
Puerto Rico has a long road of recovery ahead — very long road. But we know that its people are proud and they are resilient, and they will come back strong. (Applause.) And I've spent a lot of time with Governor Rosselló — who is a terrific man, a terrific person — on Tuesday. And we will be there all the time to help Puerto Rico recover, restore, rebuild. We're working together very closely with your great governor and your congresswoman, who is terrific — Jessica [Jenniffer]. Terrific. (Applause.)
We stand with them and with all of those who have suffered through natural disasters over these past several weeks, including those in Texas and Florida. And Louisiana got hit, and got hit very hard. And the state of Alabama was incredible. They helped so many people coming up from Florida. And Georgia, likewise — so many incredible people. And also, we have to remember this: the Virgin Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands. Governor Mapp, who's become like a friend of mine — I spoke to him so much on the phone. The job he's done — they were hit so hard. And not much was left. But they're rebuilding, and the spirit is incredible. U.S. Virgin Islands.
We're also keeping in our hearts and prayers all of those affected by the disastrous earthquake in Mexico. In recent weeks, through extremely difficult times, we've seen Americans coming together from all races and all backgrounds to unite as one people, under God. And I will tell you, we sent crews to Mexico, and the President was very gracious; called me yesterday and thanked me.
We have some really talented people. They went there to help to solve that unbelievable, difficult problem that they have. That earthquake was devastating, and I appreciate the President of Mexico. And they were so kind in their response, but that was a tragic event. And our people did a fantastic job. So I want to thank all of our first responders and the people. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) And you have a wonderful President in Mexico, I can tell you.
America is unified, there is no challenge we cannot overcome. When we empower the hopes of our people, especially these young, fantastic people right in front of me who performed so brilliantly — when we embrace the dignity and beauty of human life, and then you just look out, there is no task either large and no dream beyond your reach. No dream. There's no dream beyond your reach. You know that, right? I'm talking to some very young people up front that you can't see. (Applause.)
No matter who we are, or where we come from, we are all Americans, and we are all bound together by our love for this country, and for its flag, and for each other. Great love. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much.
In that same spirit of unity, togetherness, and love, we are truly thrilled to have all of you right here at the White House. The White House, what a special place. Right? You've read about the White House, you've heard — who was at the White House before? You have some of the congressmen that were. Right? Right? Not too many. It's a very special place. But this is a celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month. Right? (Applause.) That's a big deal. That's a great thing.
From our earliest days, Hispanic Americans have enriched our country and helped shape our history. Their contributions, through the generations, to art and music and literature, to science, scholarship, and exploration, are extraordinary.
The spirit and creativity that shines through Hispanic heritage is woven into the very fabric of our great nation. Our amazing Hispanic American communities embody our great American values of faith, and family, and security, and hard work, and freedom. (Applause.)
Their commitment to those values is why countless citizens of Hispanic descent have served in uniform to defend our country, our citizens, and our flag. Sixty Hispanic Americans have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for their outstanding bravery in battle. Did you know that? Sixty. That's a lot. That's a lot. (Applause.) It's our great, great Medal of Honor.
Did you say we have — oh, wow. That's so fantastic. Do you mind if I go up and shake hands? I'll interrupt our speech. I want to shake hands with somebody. (Applause.) I heard you were here. I'm glad I got to meet you. I heard you were here. The Medal of Honor. That's the big deal. Right? That's the big deal. Thank you for being here. We appreciate it. (Applause.) Thank you.
Today, we're grateful to have more than a quarter of a million Hispanic Americans serving in our military. We salute all of those who defend our nation and who defend our way of life.
of you here today represents a vital part of the fabric of this nation, and the nation that I love and that you love. You teach our children, you lead our churches, you protect our communities, and you defend our nation. Among you are leaders in government, faith, and business. Fantastic people in this audience. I know some of them, and believe me, they're very tough and they're very smart. Sometimes they're too tough, but that's okay. I have to deal with it. I have to deal with it. Fantastic people.
In fact, today, Hispanic American-owned small businesses are growing at a tremendous rate, especially among our Latinas. (Applause.) Raise your hands. Go ahead. It's tough to compete with, I will tell you — (laughter) — who are leading the way and starting new businesses. You're leading the way. You're leading the way. You guys better get going. (Laughter.) And once we pass our historic tax reform plan — and we are having not only reform, we're having the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The history of our country. (Applause.) Does anybody in this room mind getting a massive tax cut?
AUDIENCE: No!
THE PRESIDENT: Does anybody object to paying less taxes?
AUDIENCE: No!
THE PRESIDENT: I don't see any hands. Okay. (Laughter.) But Hispanic American businesses and families will prosper like never before. This tax cut and tax reform is going very well, and it's going to be a tremendous boost for our country, including the fact that we're the highest-taxed nation in the world. And we will go from that to being down on the lower wrung of taxes. So we'll be paying far, far less. So that's very important for keeping our businesses and our jobs. (Applause.)
We're working every day to secure a future of peace, prosperity, and sovereignty for every American citizen. And we hope for a future of freedom and prosperity throughout the entire Western Hemisphere.
That's why, under my administration, we have taken decisive action to stand with the good people of Cuba and Venezuela. (Applause.) Great people. Great, great people. As I announced before a wonderful crowd in Little Havana earlier this year, we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban regime until it delivers full political freedom for the Cuban people. (Applause.)
same failed communist ideology that has brought oppression to Cuba has brought nothing but suffering and misery everywhere and every place it has been anywhere in the world. Communism is the past. Freedom is the future. (Applause.)
We also stand with the people of Venezuela, who are suffering under the ruthless socialism of the Maduro regime. We reject socialist oppression, and we call for the restoration of democracy and freedom for the citizens of Venezuela. (Applause.)
Many Hispanic Americans understand very personally why it is so important for us to defend our nation God-given freedom — we want God-given; it's God-given freedom — and uphold the rule of law. Our commitment to these values has been the source of America's prosperity, the foundation of our security. And these values has made us a beacon, an absolute beacon, to the nations of the world.
As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, we're grateful for all of you who have contributed to our communities and for your continued leadership in America.
With your help, we will strengthen our country's great foundations of faith, and family, and freedom, and we will build together one great American future.
It's a tremendous honor to have you all at the White House. I want to thank you. I want to God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) God bless the United States of America.
And with that, I'd like to welcome a very special person who is doing a tremendous job as our Secretary of Labor, Secretary Acosta. Alex, keep it up. Keep it up, Alex. Thank you. (Applause.)

The two are betting that this alliance will be particularly helpful for banks, governments, health care providers and others that often count BlackBerry and Microsoft as customers. Of course, it's also a hedge against Google -- both of them see G Suite and other Google services as a threat to their bottom line, and working together could give them an edge where they might struggle on their own.

ORLANDO, Fla. – This is just a hasty, back-of-the-napkin calculation, so don't take it as statistical gospel.
But by my approximate count, going all the way back to his University of Virginia days and including his long career in MLS and the US national team, Friday's World Cup qualifier vs. Panama was the 1,020th high-level soccer game that Bruce Arena has head-coached.
People often toss around phrases like “I've done this a thousand times,” but in Arena's case, he really has seen just about everything in his three-plus decades on the sidelines. So as the USMNT gathered in central Florida this week, their World Cup hopes hanging in the balance as fans and the media fretted and probed, the players could look to their grizzled, wisecracking leader and know that he's been there, done that.
“He prepares his teams well for whatever situation that we're in,” defender Matt Besler said of Arena postgame. “He did a great job of motivating us and preparing us the right way. Then at the end of the day it's in our hands. He gives this team confidence and he has an experience about him, the way that he goes about things, because he's been in these positions before. And that carries over to his teams.”
And when the opening whistle blew at Orlando City Stadium, all the careful planning and intense preparation clicked, unleashing a vicious storm of attacking soccer that left Panama bruised, breathless and humiliated, to the tune of a 4-0 rout.
“In all my years with the national team, this is probably the most prepared I think the team has been, in terms of the work that the coaching staff put in,” said Jozy Altidore, who scored two goals and set up a third. “It's a huge, huge A+ to them.
“From Sunday, since the guys landed, they were showing video, pulling guys aside, making sure we were prepared for this game. They made us understand how important the game was to them. Kudos to Bruce and his team for preparing everybody.”
Details matter at this level. And though Arena makes a good show of dismissing the game's complexities with his wry smile and smart-aleck demeanor, he's shown time and again that he can master them, and deploy them to help his teams win.
On paper, the USMNT started in a 4-4-2 (or 4-1-3-2 if you're being pedantic) that many – this correspondent included – were quick to depict as more of the same for a squad whose recent performances seemed to suggest they needed something much more dramatic. There was even a whiff of recklessness, perhaps overconfidence, in a setup that piled a great deal of responsibility on Michael Bradley, the sole defensive midfielder behind five attack-minded colleagues.
“I think we've played some of our best games like that,” said goalkeeper Tim Howard. “Michael is as honest and hard-working as they come. The guys who played in alongside of him were asked to do two jobs: spring the attack, get in off the shoulder, and then also protect the fullbacks. So tough job for Darlington [Nagbe] and Paul [Arriola], but they did it well tonight.”
As it turned out, the home side weren't leaving their backsides exposed so much as baring their teeth – and their guests were quickly devoured, falling behind 2-0 before 20 minutes had elapsed.
“They smelled blood from the beginning,” Howard said of Altidore, his strike partner Bobby Wood and Christian Pulisic, deployed underneath them as a classic No. 10. “Any time they picked up the ball it was either a yellow-card foul or some sort of breakaway. They clearly recognized that from the beginning. We spoke about being aggressive, not just ‘being up against them and kicking them' aggressive, but getting the ball, playing forward, putting them on their heels. We stuck to the game plan – it was good.”
The USMNT had spoken repeatedly of the importance of scoring first in the lead-up to this game, which is easy to say. But Arena set up a starting 11 that made that easy for his players to achieve, too. When Panama got up off the canvas and began to mount a response, Arena had a plan for that, too.
“Yes, it was,” he said postgame when asked if he considered his team's tactics and shape a gamble. “We wanted to push five players forward into the attack as aggressively as we could. The way Panama plays, we could afford to do that.
“They made a change when they took [Edgar Yoel] Barcenas out [in the first half] and they went to some version of a 4-2-1-3, maybe, and put a little bit more pressure on Michael, had three players in the central part of the midfield. That's why we brought Dax [McCarty] in, to play next to Michael, give him a little bit more help.”
While their fans were fretting, the US were building the tools for victory, secure in the knowledge that their boss had a solid plan for success in a big moment, in front of an appreciative, partisan crowd.
Turns out, he did.
“Everybody was relaxed,” said Altidore. “We knew we were coming to a place where we were going to have heavy support, as we did here tonight, and we knew we just had to make sure we were the protagonist tonight, and put them under pressure from the first minute, and we did that.”

Steve Jarrett, DFS Chelmsford store manager, said: “In the lead-up to the DFS Chelmsford opening we wanted to get to know the local community better and reached out to some of our nearby neighbours. When we heard about the work Fair Havens Hospice does and that the staff were working hard to raise money to purchase a new sofa, our hearts were truly touched.”
Louise McKay, Ward Sister at Havens Hospices said: “This has already made a huge difference.”
Gospel musician Rev TT Chivaviro has signed a contract with South African record stable FG Records and Music Promotions.
The deal was signed last week, with their new compilation album expected next week.
“They took all our songs from the last five albums and selected 10 songs they think South Africans will fall in love with. They are handling marketing, promotions and sales,” he said.
Chivaviro said they have already identified the songs and they had named it ‘Handinyarare-The best of Rev TT Chivaviro 2'.
“We are now busy with sleeves for that compilation album which they will push this year, then they pick up the rest of our albums after this year,” he said.
He said the deal has come at a time when his album ‘Maranatha' was making an impact on the local market.
Some of the selected songs include ‘Ebenezer', ‘Handinyarare', ‘Mhepo Inoperekedza', ‘Sorry', ‘Mercy Rewrote My Life', ‘Zvaitwa Zvaitwa', ‘Apo Mambo Ouya', ‘Chechi Yoenda Sehondo' and ‘Dondifemerai'.
FG director Hamilton Kubashe said it was a good experience having the musician to be part of the stable.
“Chivaviro has been very consistent and his music is fast gaining ground here and in Zimbabwe. We decided to have him aboard and we are very optimistic that this deal will bear fruits,â€ he said.
Kubashe said they were doing their best to make the music available in South Africa and all the platforms available.
“We will do our best in marketing the album,” he said. The Herald

PHOENIX (AP) — A former Arizona lawmaker who became the first kicked out of a state Legislature since the #MeToo movement began because of a lengthy pattern of sexual misconduct is running for office again.
Don Shooter, a Republican expelled from the Arizona House in February, said he filed around 900 signatures Wednesday to seek the GOP nomination for a state Senate seat in the same southern Arizona district he used to serve.
He wouldn't comment on the circumstances surrounding his expulsion, which came as lawmakers of both parties faced a national reckoning over sexual misconduct that began last fall.
Politicians accused of impropriety have resigned, been stripped of leadership posts and faced other repercussions. A Democratic state representative in Colorado also was expelled this year.
Sitting in the lobby of the Arizona secretary of state's office waiting to file his signatures, Shooter said "Let's dance."
He said he wants to talk about policy issues, such as the water needs of the agricultural industry and public education. Arizona teachers launched an unprecedented statewide strike this year over a lack of education funding.
"That's the only thing I miss about being away from here, was the ability to solve problems," Shooter said.
Shooter was elected to the Senate in 2010 and moved to the House in 2017. The lawmaker was known as a politically incorrect jokester who threw booze-fueled parties in his office on the last day of legislative sessions.
A female lawmaker, Rep. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, accused him in November of propositioning her for sex and repeatedly commenting on her breasts. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard ordered an investigation after Shooter accused Ugenti-Rita of having an inappropriate relationship with a staffer, but she was cleared.
Other women soon came forward to accuse Shooter of inappropriate sexual comments or actions.
Shooter eventually apologized for what he called his "jarring, insensitive and demeaning" comments but argued that he never sought to touch anyone or have a sexual relationship with them.
An investigative report released prior to his expulsion found he engaged in "repeated pervasive conduct (that) created a hostile work environment for his colleagues and those with business before the Legislature."
In mid-April, Shooter filed a claim — a precursor to a lawsuit — saying he was targeted by the governor's office because of his efforts to expose widespread fraud in the state procurement system. It accused also Mesnard of changing House rules and policies on harassment to remove Shooter from his committee chair post and ultimately to force the expulsion vote.
To get on the November ballot, Shooter will have to win the GOP primary. Incumbent state Sen. Sine Kerr, a dairy farmer who was appointed to fill the seat, has filed signatures along with Brent Backus, a conservative who owns a consulting business.
Democrat Michelle Harris, who served in the Air Force for 21 years, also is running for the seat.

A local charity raised more than $20,000 at an annual color run event in Mount Airy.
Nicholas Cooke, who founded Helping Hands Foundation of Surry County in 2011, said the non-profit organization he started at age 16 had another successful color run earlier this month.
Cooke said the event was held at Veterans Memorial Park in Mount Airy. More than 300 people took part in the 3.1-mile color run, helping Cooke's organization raise about $24,000 to put toward its mission.
It was the third year for the event, according to Cooke. In 2015, the tun raised about $20,000, and in 2016, about $17,000 was raised.
The organization's mission is “to create long lasting solutions to end poverty and hunger while fostering individual pride and sustainability.”
In short, Cooke said that means Helping Hands helps prople with all sorts of things. The programs and services provided by the organization include; food, clothing, toiletries and utility bill assistance. Prior to the start of the school year, Helping Hands also partners with local school officials to provide school supplies to children who might are in need of them.
Cooke noted funding generated by the color run, donations from members of the community and other fundraising efforts made it possible to provide aide to more than 400 clients in 2016.
Many people and organizations contributed in making the event a success, according to Cooke. About 75 volunteers manned the event, and Coram Construction, Carolina Carports, Eagle Carports, and A.E.S. Inc. sponsored the event. Additionally, an anonymous donation was made in honor of the Shepherd's House, the local homeless shelter.
Cooke also thanked the Mount Airy Police and Fire Departments and the Mount Airy Rescue Squad for directing traffic and providing availability to medical services should they have been needed.
“I am always amazed and extremely grateful for the enormous amount of support from this community each year. The sponsors, volunteers and participants always step up to the plate and support us,” said Cooke. “The funds raised from this event will allow us to help so many people in 2017.”
“We accept monetary donations and other donations such as gently used clothing, toiletries, school supplies, and food at our office, which is located at 114 West Lebanon Street, Mount Airy, NC 27030,” added Cooke.

Police say one man has been killed and two people injured in a knife attack on a train in the northern German city of Flensburg.
Federal police said in a statement the incident took place Wednesday at around 7 p.m. local time.
They said the details of the attack were not clear yet, but that one of the injured was a 22-year-old female police officer. The statement said she appeared to have used her pistol, suggesting she may have killed the man.
German daily Bild reported that following a dispute, one man attacked another man with a knife and then a police officer who was called to intervene.
The German news agency dpa reported the Flensburg main train station had been evacuated and service to Flensburg had been interrupted temporarily.

INDIANAPOLIS, IN – Celadon Group, which offers extensive trucking operations across North America, has entered a new joint venture with Element Transportation that oversees more than 10,000 tractors for leasing operations.
The move combines the leasing portfolios of Celadon, Element, and 19th Capital that were managed by Celadon's Quality Companies. Celadon and Element each hold 49.99% of the joint venture. Quality Companies, meanwhile, will provide leasing management services in exchange for a monthly fee per tractor.
Celadon contributes $100 million in cash and lease equipment in exchange for equity in the joint venture. That includes proceeds and the deferred purchase price on assets sold to 19th Capital in the 2016 fiscal year.
In addition to closing the joint venture, Celadon receives about $50 million for equipment associated with the Quality business, “substantially” reducing the equipment held for sale or leasing.
Teams have been working on the joint venture since August, and it helps Celadon leave the “capital-intensive component” of the leasing business, reduce balance sheet debt, and convert its Quality Companies unit into what is described as “an asset-light” business, said Paul Will, Celadon's chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
"This joint venture expands Element's position in the Class 8 tractor sector and provides a great opportunity to broaden our range of fleet services across a larger market, with a great partner,” said Bradley Nullmeyer, Element's Chief Executive Officer.
The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is based on Rebecca Skloot's nonfiction bestseller of the same name and stars Oprah Winfrey as Henrietta's daughter Deborah and Rose Byrne as Skloot herself. According to HBO's press materials, the film tells Henrietta's story from Deborah's perspective as she and Skloot "learn about the mother she never knew and understand how the unauthorized harvesting of Lacks' cancerous cells in 1951 led to unprecedented medical breakthroughs, changing countless lives and the face of medicine forever." Beyond just medicine, Henrietta's story is one of an African American woman who unknowingly saved countless lives after her death and changed how we discuss the consent and privacy issues involved in using someone's genetic material without their knowledge.
The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks will debut on HBO Saturday, April 22nd at 8 pm ET/PT.
Charged and Ready: Tesla Builds World's Biggest Battery
Elon Musk's giant lithium-ion battery is now powering South Australia -- delivered within about 60 days after announcing the contract.
Musk easily beat his promise that the $50 million battery would be "installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free."
"The completion of the world's largest lithium-ion battery in record time shows that a sustainable, effective energy solution is possible," Tesla said.
"We are proud to be part of South Australia's renewable energy future, and hope this project provides a model for future deployments around the world."
South Australia Premier Jay Weatherill, with the Labor Party, touted the world's largest lithium-ion battery as part of his $420 million plan to take his state off the country's national power grid.
"The world's largest lithium-ion battery will be an important part of our energy mix, and it sends the clearest message that South Australia will be a leader renewable energy with battery storage," Weatherill said of the battery when it was completed in November.
The battery, according to Hornsdale Power Reserve, takes up less than 2.5 acres of land and has the ability to power 30,000 homes for an hour during a blackout.
The launch comes after the battery was put under a regulatory testing period that examined the battery's ability to charge to, and from, Australia's National Energy Market and it's ability to act as a generator.
Tesla said the battery will help solve the state's power shortage problems and assist during summertime peak loads.

On Sunday, Megyn Kelly Today‘s official Twitter account revealed Jessica Leeds, Samantha Holvey, and Rachel Cooks — three of the at least 19 women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct — would appear live on Monday's program. Appear they did, and while their conversations with Kelly largely revolved around their previous allegations, a few previously unheard bits of their accounts came to light throughout the hourlong conversation. Like Leeds's story of meeting Trump and his first wife, Ivana, at a Humane Society fundraiser in New York.
Three years after her encounter with Trump in first class aboard a commercial flight in the '80s, Leeds moved to New York when she got a job with the charitable organization. She subsequently worked at a fundraising gala hosted by Saks Fifth Avenue, doling out table assignments to the guests — including Trump and a “very pregnant” Ivana:
“He stands there as I'm handing him his table assignment and he says, ‘I remember you. You were that… woman from the airplane.' He called me the worst name ever… It's the worst one… The room cleared. It was like everybody disappeared… It was shocking.”
Leeds refused to say the word, let alone the phrase “the c-word,” but Kelly repeatedly asked her to confirm what Trump had called her. “You don't want to say it out loud, but does it begin with a ‘c'?” the host asked. When Leeds said it did and continued on, Kelly followed up. “Does it end with ‘t'?” All the while, the Megyn Kelly Today studio reacted to Leeds and Kelly's exchange with a mixture of nervous laughter and shocked gasps. And considering the president's documented history with the word, Leeds's update to her story seems all the more credible.

CAIRO (AP) — A top Egyptian rights lawyer says at least eight protesters were detained and accused of "association with a terrorist organization" after joining a small protest in Cairo over the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Khaled Ali says the protesters were arrested on Saturday in front of the Egyptian Press Syndicate in downtown Cairo after rallying against President Donald Trump's move.
It wasn't immediately possible to reach the prosecutors on Monday for a comment.
Ali says those detained, including a female activist, are accused of links to the Muslim Brotherhood group, Egypt's onetime largest Islamist group which was outlawed after the ouster of the Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.
Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is a close ally of Trump, whose announcement triggered protests across the world.

The 55-year-old director has been married to the 53-year-old costume designer since 1997, and despite the passing of time, the couple still know how to have a good time between the sheets.
Asked whether they still have regular sex, he answered: "Yeah, we do. And you know what? She rocks out. She's a bit of a wolf. She always dresses up in strange costumes."
Despite still enjoying an active erotic life, Baz concedes that their lovemaking exploits have evolved over time.
The acclaimed writer - who has daughter Lillian, 14, and son William, 12, with his wife - revealed that he's slowed down as he's gotten older.
He told The Guardian newspaper: "Look, it's never gonna be like when you were 20. I'm not saying it's boring, but it becomes part of the ceremony: the intimacy, the talk afterwards.
"Our relationship is full of acceptance. She knew who I was going in, and I knew who she was. Without going into details, we've lived a pretty boho life. There's nothing about either of us that the other one doesn't know. We have our way, and that works for us."
The loved-up couple first met in the late 80s and, at the time, Baz was going by his birth name of Mark Anthony Luhrmann.
However, he subsequently changed his name to Baz by deed poll after being likened to a fictional anthropomorphic fox called Basil Brush from a British TV show.
Baz - who now splits his time between New York and Sydney - said: "I had this crazy curly hair, this big 'fro, and at school there were all these boys in their uniforms who used to beat the s**t out of me.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia has deployed a cruise missile in violation of a Cold War-era arms control treaty, a Trump administration official says, a development that complicates the outlook for U.S.-Russia relations amid turmoil on the White House national security team.
The Obama administration three years ago accused the Russians of violating the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty by developing and testing the prohibited cruise missile, and officials had anticipated that Moscow eventually would deploy it. Russia denies that it has violated the INF treaty.
U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that the missile became operational late last year, said an administration official, who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the matter and demanded anonymity.
The deployment may not immediately change the security picture in Europe, but the alleged treaty violation may arise when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis attends his first NATO meeting in Brussels on Wednesday. It also has stirred concern on Capitol Hill, where Sen. John McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, called on the Trump administration to ensure U.S. nuclear forces in Europe are ready.
"Russia's deployment of nuclear-tipped ground-launched cruise missiles in violation of the INF treaty is a significant military threat to U.S. forces in Europe and our NATO allies," McCain, R-Ariz., said in a statement Tuesday. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin was "testing" Trump.
Trump's White House is in a difficult moment, with no national security adviser following the forced resignation Monday night of Michael Flynn. He is accused of misleading Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with a Russian diplomat while President Barack Obama was still in office.
Meanwhile, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday that a Russian intelligence-collection ship has been operating off the U.S. east coast, in international waters. The official was not authorized to discuss an intelligence matter and so spoke on condition of anonymity. The ship had made a port call in Cuba prior to moving north, where it has been monitored off the coast of Delaware, the official said.
The New York Times, which was first to report the missile deployment, said the Russians have two battalions of the prohibited cruise missile. One is at a missile test site at Kapustin Yar and one was moved in December from the test site to an operational base elsewhere in the country.
The State Department wouldn't confirm the report. It noted that last year it reported Russia was in violation of its treaty obligations not to possess, produce or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, or to possess or produce launchers for such missiles.
"The administration is undertaking an extensive review of Russia's ongoing INF treaty violation in order to assess the potential security implications for the United States and its allies and partners," State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.
John Tierney, executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said strategic stability on the European continent is at stake.
"If true, Russia's deployment of an illegal ground-launched cruise missile represents a very troubling development and should be roundly condemned," Tierney said.
Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, sees little reason for the U.S. to continue adhering to the INF treaty, in light of Russia's violations. He has recommended building up U.S. nuclear forces in Europe, which currently include about 200 bombs that can be delivered by aircraft. The U.S. withdrew land-based nuclear-armed missiles from Europe as part of the INF deal.
The treaty has special significance in the recent history of arms control agreements. Signed in December 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, it has been credited with helping accelerate an end to the Cold War and lessening the danger of nuclear confrontation. It stands as the only arms treaty to eliminate an entire class of U.S. and Russian weapons — nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles of intermediate range.
The Obama administration had argued for maintaining U.S. compliance with the treaty while urging the Russians to halt violations. At the same time, the Pentagon developed options to counter Russian cruise missile moves, some of which would have involved bold military action.
At his Senate confirmation hearing in February 2014, Ash Carter, who headed the Pentagon until last month, said disregard for treaty limitations was a "two-way street," opening the way for the U.S. to respond in kind. He called Russia's violations consistent with its "strategy of relying on nuclear weapons to offset U.S. and NATO conventional superiority."
Dear brides-to-be, we know that you can't stop thinking about having sex for the first time, because, it's both worrying and exciting! So, take a deep breath, stop overthinking, and read the following lines carefully in order to enjoy this with your husband to the maximum.
Most brides worry about having sex for the first time and forget about how important it is to pamper their vagina after. Part of enjoying sex is to have a healthy vagina, and the more you're careful with it at this very sensitive stage, the better it is for you. So, this is what you need to do.
1. Prep your vagina before having sex for the first time:
Let's go through this quickly because it's important. You need to wash your vagina with lukewarm water before sex, and you should never use neither soap nor vaginal wash ever, because, they're very irritating to the area. You should use a lubricant, and you and your husband should take your time with foreplay for you to relax, and to be ready for intercourse.
2. Visit a gynecologist before your wedding:
Well, we should all make it a habit to visit the gynecologist regularly for quick check-ups. He'll check on your reproductive system general health, he'll give you the right medication for your body in case you get a vaginal infection, irritation or inflammation during your honeymoon, and he'll tell you everything you need to know about contraceptives.
3. Get a warm bath after having sex for the first time:
It's your honeymoon, so, there's no better time for a warm, not hot, baths than this time! Fill your bathtub with only warm water, get in there and relax. The warm water will help you relax and it will gently cleanse your vagina.
4. Use an anti-irritation cream:
Ask your gynecologist to prescribe you a cream that can ease the pain after having sex for the first time, and that will prevent any kind of irritation during your honeymoon.
5. Use soft cotton towels:
As you can see, you have to be very gentle to this area at this very sensitive time, so, if you're used to using regular toilet paper after peeing, you should switch to soft cotton towels, to avoid irritation and dryness.
6. We know how important sexy lingerie is at this point, but please don't forget about cotton underwear:
If you ask your husband, he'll tell you that sexy lingerie is wasted money, it will only last for 5 minutes on. So, instead, invest in nice cotton panties, they'll feel very soft and gentle to your vagina after having sex for the first time.
7. In case of distress, use ice:
Ice is a great natural way to numb any kind of pain, so, if you feel pain down there after having sex for the first time, then put some ice inside a cotton cloth, and just hold it between your legs. We also suggest that you be wearing your cotton underpants to protect your skin from the ice, it can burn your skin. Leave it there for 15 minutes, and you'll feel better.
8. Stay away from the pool:
Most couples prefer pools during their honeymoon for privacy, but pools can be very harmful, irritating, and a very good place to catch an infection after having sex for the first time. So, if you want, you can go swimming in the sea, a safer and more hygienic option for you.
9. Ask your husband to make sure that his private parts are clean before intercourse:
Yes, this is very important for you not to catch any infection, your vagina is very sensitive right now, and you want to keep it as good as possible.

How the Christian Science Monitor revamped its workflows with its readers in mind (Lenfest Institute)
Last year, the Christian Science Monitor overhauled its digital operations, taking its daily reporting into a daily news digest that promises readers coverage that they won't be able to get elsewhere. But to deliver on that promise, the Monitor also had to rethink its culture and workflows, with the value to readers as top priority. The Lenfest Institute's Joseph Lichterman explains how the Monitor put its readers at the core of its decisions — and ultimately brought in thousands of paying subscribers as a result.

A German newspaper is a consumer cooperative, meaning its readers essentially own the newspaper (International Journalists' Network)
As more people start thinking about how to make membership programs work, one German newspaper can serve as a case study. Berlin-based daily newspaper Tageszeitung (called Taz for short) was founded in 1992 as a consumer cooperative, meaning that the newspaper is essentially owned by its members. Taz has 10,000 members who make recurring donations, 50,000 print and digital subscribers, and 17,000 reader-owners who pay a minimum of €500 (about $625 USD) to join the cooperative. That reader ownership means that Taz has chosen to do some things differently than most news organizations: It does not have a paywall, but all readers are encouraged to make a donation when reading online. And, when its members were wary of third party payment systems, Taz started building its own online payment system.

In its fourth-quarter earnings report, Amazon revealed that its “other” revenue grew by 60 percent year-over-year to $1.7 billion. Amazon's “other” revenue is mostly comprised of advertising — and that growth could signal some major competition for the Facebook/Google duopoly. A major factor behind that growth is an expansion in its search marketing product, Amazon Marketing Services. Plus, Amazon's pitch to advertisers and agencies is that it has a “total wallet” perspective: It can pair what people are searching for with what they're actually buying.

What went wrong at the Los Angeles Times? (CNN Media)
“After years of painful, protracted decline, the Los Angeles Times has recently descended into chaos,” Dylan Byers writes. The paper has had three editors-in-chief in six months, its publisher is on leave for sexual harassment allegations, and the recently unionized staff believes Tronc is trying to break up the union. But how did the L.A. Times get to this point? Michael Ferro's leadership of Tronc is key to that answer, Byers argues. “Some sources expect that the Times will continue to implode, allowing a white knight … to come in and buy the paper for next to nothing,” Byers writes. “But other sources close to the paper say those saviors don't exist. Ferro does not appear to be interested in selling, they say, and they fear that if he ever decides he is, there will no longer be much worth buying.”

CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) - An Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history was charged Friday with manufacturing armor-piercing bullets, according to court documents.
Unfired armor-piercing bullets found inside the Las Vegas hotel room where Stephen Paddock launched the Oct. 1 attack had the fingerprints of ammunition dealer Douglas Haig, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Phoenix. It says Haig didn't have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition.
Haig has acknowledged selling 720 rounds of tracer ammunition to Paddock in the weeks before the shooting that killed 58 people. Tracer bullets contain a pyrotechnic charge that illuminates the path of fired bullets so shooters can see whether their aim is correct.
The criminal charge involves another type of ammunition - armor-piercing bullets.
The documents don't say if any ammunition tied to Paddock was used in the attack. Las Vegas police wouldn't say whether armor-piercing bullets were used in the shooting but referred to a preliminary report saying some rifle magazines were loaded with armor-piercing ammunition.
Haig, a 55-year-old aerospace engineer who sold ammunition as a hobby for about 25 years, was charged 35 minutes before holding a news conference where he said he didn't notice anything suspicious when he sold the tracer rounds to Paddock.
Haig told investigators that when Paddock bought the ammunition at his home in suburban Phoenix, Paddock went to his car to get gloves and put them on before taking the box from Haig, the complaint said.
"I had no contribution to what Paddock did," Haig told reporters earlier Friday, adding that there was nothing unusual about the type or quantity of ammunition the shooter bought. "I had no way to see into his mind."
A phone message left for Haig's attorney, Marc Victor, wasn't immediately returned.
The two armor-piercing bullets found in Paddock's hotel room with Haig's fingerprints had an "incendiary capsule" on their noses, the documents said. A forensic analysis of those two bullets had tool marks consistent with the equipment in Haig's backyard workshop, according to the complaint.
It also alleges that FBI agents searching Haig's home on Oct. 19 found armor-piercing ammunition.
The complaint said Haig sold such bullets in more than 100 instances to customers across the United States, including Nevada, Texas, Virginia, Wyoming and South Carolina.
He appeared in court Friday and was released under the condition he not possesses guns or ammunition. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a fine as high as $250,000.
Haig and his business partner, whose name wasn't provided, sold 40 to 50 rounds of incendiary rounds to Paddock in late August at a Las Vegas gun show, according to the complaint.
The next month, Haig said he met Paddock at a Phoenix gun show and that he was well-dressed and polite.
He didn't have the quantity of tracer ammunition on hand that Paddock was seeking, so Paddock contacted him several days later and lined up a sale at Haig's home.
Haig said he was shocked and sickened when a federal agent informed him of the massacre 11 hours after it unfolded.
Haig's lawyer said they held the news conference in a bid to protect his reputation after he was revealed earlier this week to be a "person of interest" in the investigation. Haig's identity emerged by mistake after his name was not redacted in court documents.
A law enforcement official previously told The Associated Press that investigators don't believe Haig had any involvement or knowledge of the planned attack when he sold ammunition to Paddock. The official wasn't authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Haig arose in the investigation when a box with his name and address was found in the Mandalay Bay hotel suite where Paddock opened fire on a music festival below.
He gave the box to Paddock to carry the 720 rounds of tracer ammunition from the sale.
Haig said Paddock told him that "he was going to go out to the desert to put on a light show, either with or for his friends. I can't remember whether he used the word 'with' or 'for.' But he said that he was going out at night to shoot it with friends."
Haig, who has closed his ammunition business, said he has received unwanted media attention and death threats since his name was released.
The FBI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives referred questions to the U.S. attorney's office in Las Vegas, which declined to comment.

A proposed Snowboard and Freeski Big Air World Cup competition due to take place in Düsseldorf next season has been postponed for a year due to a scheduling conflict.
The event had been scheduled to be held on a temporary ramp in the Espirit Arena in January, the same venue which hosted the World Table Tennis Championships last year.
Organisers have determined, however, that there will be "insufficient time to realise the construction of the competition ramp" in the 54,000 capacity venues due to other events also taking place there.
"Because of this, the decision was made to postpone the event from the 2018/19 season until the 2019/20 World Cup season, where the safety of the athletes can remain paramount and the true vision for the competition can be fully realised," said the International Ski Federation (FIS).
"At this time the proposed schedule for the Düsseldorf Snowboard and Freeski big air World Cup will see the competition held from January 2 to 4, 2020."

The Big Air World Cup season is due to begin in Cardrona in New Zealand in September and continue with events in Milan, Beijing, Canyons in the United States, Quebec and Oslo.
"While the cancellation of this season's Dusseldorf event is disappointing for all parties involved, excitement for the 2020 event is high as the FIS snowboard and freeski tours look forward to bringing World Cup big air action to one of the great cities of Europe," FIS added.
"With Düsseldorf 54,000 seat Espirit Arenas - home to the Fortuna [football team who recently earned promotion to the Bundesliga for the 2018/19 season] - lined up to host the competition, the Düsseldorf snowboard and freeski big air competitions are set to be season highlights in January 2020."
NEW YORK (AP) — New guidelines recommend that U.S. adults begin colon cancer screenings earlier, at age 45 instead of 50.
The new advice was issued by the American Cancer Society on Wednesday. The lower age puts the cancer group out sync with recommendations from an influential government advisory group, which says screenings should start at 50.
Cancer society officials acknowledge the shift to 45 could cause confusion but felt strongly that they needed to act now.
The group was influenced by its study, published last year, that found rising rates of colon cancer and deaths in people younger than 50. Experts aren't sure why there has been a 50 percent increase in cases in younger adults since 1994.
LSU's Mardi Gras meet at the PMAC packed in over 13,000 fans Friday night for a second straight sellout.
D-D Breaux's No. 2 Tigers beat No. 6 Kentucky and tacked on another win to that 30-0 home record over the last five seasons.
The official capacity of the PMAC for gymnastics is only 12,700, but it was standing room only to see another exciting Friday night filled with big moments.
LSU started things off on vault and got a 9.875 from all-around winner Myia Hambrick in the fifth slot. Following the senior to close out the rotation was Kennedi Edney, who posted a 9.825.
On bars, the Tigers suffered two falls, but more than made up for it with four career bests. The top four scores were all better than Kentucky's competitors. Sara Finnegan topped the list at 9.975, but Lexie Priessman added a 9.950, Hambrick a 9.925, and Sami Durante a 9.900.
On the beam, LSU kept building its lead with Hambrick taking top honors on a 9.925 performance and she added a near flawless 9.975 effort on the floor to close out her all-around title.
But perhaps the highlight of the night was Priessman doing her first competitive floor routine in more than a year, after working her way back from the latest of eight surgeries and things got emotional with each tumbling pass as the crowd held its breath and her head coach and teammates cheered the Cincinnati native on to a 9.875, which was good enough for second place in the floor exercises and capped off yet another great show for that packed house.
"Honestly, it was so fun,” said Priessman. “I went out there and I trusted what I've been training lately and D-D came up to me before I went and she said to me, ‘Do it for Gracie,' and as soon as she said that, I just felt a relief right away and I went out there and I just did what I was capable of doing and this whole week, the whole team and coaches have been pushing me. So, it was just the time of my life, honestly, tonight."
Hambrick scored a career-best in the all-around, finishing with a total score of 39.700.
LSU next heads to Missouri on Friday.

The ongoing sage of Stormy Daniels‘ alleged affair with Donald Trump continues, with new details emerging on a near-constant basis. Trump's personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has been a major player in the story of the consensual affair and the subsequent fallout. Cohen sat down with Vanity Fair and laid out his side of the events, addressing claims from Daniels (real name Stephanie Clifford) and her lawyer Michael Avenatti.
Cohen claims that his attempts to silence Daniels have nothing to do with Trump's presidential campaign: “If she had come to me a month before, or three months before, I would have done the same thing. People are mistaking this for a thing about the campaign. What I did defensively for my personal client, and my friend, is what attorneys do for their high-profile clients. I would have done it in 2006. I would have done it in 2011. I truly care about him and the family—more than just as an employee and an attorney.” It also seemed that Cohen was surprised with Trump's win, saying that it seemed “that you can't beat the Clinton machine.”
He also addressed Avenatti's claims that someone close to Trump threatened Daniels, saying “unlike Mr. Avenatti, we are not handling this matter through the court of public opinion. We are handling it through a court of competent jurisdiction.” He also reiterated that he personally was not behind that claim.
“In fact, I have never spoken to her. I have never e-mailed her. I have never met her. I have never texted her. Every interaction with Ms. Clifford was always through her previous attorney. I can only speak for myself,” he said. “I reiterate: I have never threatened her in any way and I am unaware of anyone else doing so.”
When asked about why he used his personal home equity line to pay Daniels' settlement, Cohen explains that “he did it for his own reasons and it's irrelevant if people believe him or not.” However, he does take offense at CNN implying that he is a “less sexy version” of Ray Donovan.

AP Entertainment Writer
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The unprecedented sudden cancellation of one of television's top comedies has left a wave of unemployment and uncertainty in its wake.
Roseanne Barr's racist tweet and the swift axing of her rebooted show put hundreds of people out of work, with some wondering whether they would be paid, most knowing they wouldn't be, and few with any legal recourse.
"A lot of people there are just middle class Americans making a living and now they're out of work, especially at a time when we're ramping up into production for the fall season," Rebecca Sun of the industry trade publication The Hollywood Reporter said in an interview with The Associated Press. "It is pretty devastating for all of the people who worked on that show who are now collateral damage as a result of their star's racist beliefs."
Contractual details for those involved with the show, including Barr, were not immediately clear, and would play out in the coming months.
Experts say high-profile figures in the television industry typically have contractual clauses that give them significant severance for shows that are not produced.
Lower-level workers are generally out of luck at an unfortunate time. Though "Roseanne" and many shows just had their season finales, jobs for next season are mostly taken.
Ben Sherwood, president of Disney-ABC Television Group, apologized in a memo Wednesday to "the many men and women who poured their hearts and lives into the show and were just getting started on next season. We're so sorry they were swept up in all of this and we give thanks for their remarkable talents, wish them well, and hope to find another way to work together down the road."
The cancellation came on the first day of meetings for the newly assembled writers for the fall season of "Roseanne." They arrived after Barr's tweet, but before ABC President Channing Dungey's announcement that the show was finished, leading to what executive producer and writer Dave Caplan said were "a lot of bittersweet hellos - and a couple hours later, a lot of very difficult goodbyes."
"Everybody is still in shock at how quickly this all went down," Caplan told The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday. "It's unfortunate because the writers did pass on other jobs to take this job and nobody really knows yet what kind of compensation they're going to get."
For cast and crew members that did have longer-term contracts, Barr's show-sinking tweet could be deemed, strange as it sounds, an "act of God." A "force majeure" or "act of God," legally, is some unpredictable event such as an earthquake or a riot that changes the underlying circumstances.
"It means something outside of the control of the parties. Roseanne's speech wasn't in the control of ABC," said F. Jay Dougherty, a professor who specializes in entertainment and media law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "It wouldn't surprise me if this was treated by the studio like that kind of event, giving the studio a right to terminate contracts."
Barr herself suggested on Twitter lately that she may try to take some action.
"You guys make me feel like fighting back," Barr tweeted to her followers Wednesday. "I will examine all of my options carefully and get back to U."
Her contract may have a "morals clause," however, which are often included in the contracts of television stars, athletes and other prominent figures, demanding a standard of behavior as the face of an enterprise.
"If there is a morals clause in her contract, then breaching that would give the studio a right to terminate her contract, and possibly even sue her for damages for breach of contract,"
"We can't predict whether there will be lawsuits or not," Dougherty said, "but I don't think there will be successful lawsuits."

What we eat can influence more than our waistlines. It turns out, our diets also help determine what we smell like.
A recent study found that women preferred the body odor of men who ate a lot of fruits and vegetables. Whereas men who ate a lot of carbohydrates gave off a smell that was less appealing.
Skeptical? At first, I was, too. I thought this line of inquiry must have been dreamed up by the produce industry. (Makes a good marketing campaign, right?!)
But it's legit. "We've known for a while that odor is an important component of attractiveness, especially for women," says Ian Stephen of Macquarie University in Australia. He studies evolution, genetics and psychology and is an author of the study.
From an evolutionary perspective, scientists say our sweat can help signal our health status, and could possibly play a role in helping attract a mate.
So, how did scientists evaluate the link between diet and the attractiveness of body odor?
They began by recruiting a bunch of healthy, young men. They assessed the men's skin using an instrument called a spectrophotometer. When people eat a lot of colorful veggies, their skin takes on the hue of carotenoids, the plant pigments that are responsible for bright red, yellow and orange foods.
"The carotenoids get deposited in our skin," explains Stephen. The spectrophotometer "flashes a light onto your skin and measures the color reflected back," says Stephen. The results are "a good indicator of how much fruits and vegetables we're eating," he says.
Stephen and his colleagues also had the men in the study compete food frequency questionnaires, so they could determine the men's overall patterns of eating. Then, men were given clean T-shirts and asked to do some exercise.
Afterwards, women in the study were asked to sniff the sweat. (Note: The methodology was much more scientific and precise than my breezy explanation, but you get the picture!) "We asked the women to rate how much they liked it, how floral, how fruity," and a bunch of other descriptors, explains Stephen.
It's a small study, but the results were pretty consistent. "Women basically found that men who ate more vegetables smelled nicer," Stephen told us.
Men who ate a lot of meat did not produce a sweat that was any more — or less — attractive to women. But meat did tend to make men's odor more intense.
"This is not the first study to show that diet influences body odor," says George Preti, an adjunct professor in the dermatology department at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia.
A study published in 2006 found that women preferred the odor of men who ate a non-meat diet, "characterized by increased intakes of eggs, cheese, soy, fruit and vegetables."
But Preti points out that the relationship between diet and body odor is indirect.
Some people think if they eat a garlic or onion — or a piece of meat — they will smell like that food. "But that's not what happens," Preti says. Your breath might smell like the food you eat, but not your sweat.
Body odor is created when the bacteria on our skin metabolize the compounds that come out of our sweat glands.
"The sweat doesn't come out smelly," Preti explains, "It must be metabolized by the bacteria that live on the surface of the skin."
Now, of course, at a time when good hygiene and deodorant use are commonplace, is the smell of our sweat a big concern?
I put that question to the happy-hour crowd at a bar down the street from the NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C.
"I'm pretty OK with my smell," Stefan Ruffini told me. That evening he was ordering a burger on a bun and a side of fries, along with a beer. When I told him about the findings of the study, he laughed it off.
"I've got a girlfriend, so I don't worry about these things!"he said.
The study did not assess diet and odor attractiveness among same-sex couples.
"As a lesbian, I haven't smelled a man in several years," Stacy Carroll, who was also at happy hour, told me. "I eat a lot of produce, I have a girlfriend, so it's working out!"
Carroll says people who eat a lot of fruits and vegetables are more likely to be interested in their health --"feeling good, looking fit" — than their smell.
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The U.S. has added the leader of Hamas to its list of international terrorists, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic militant group.
State Department counterterror official Nathan A. Sales told a Tel Aviv conference that Ismail Haniyeh is now considered a "specially designated global terrorist." The designation freezes any assets Haniyeh may have in U.S. jurisdictions and bars Americans from any financial transactions with him.
The U.S. already considers Hamas a terrorist organization. Wednesday's announcement steps up U.S. opposition to the group, which has killed hundreds of Israelis and has fought three wars with Israel since taking over the Gaza Strip in 2007.
Hamas says the designation will not deter it from opposing Israel. Other Hamas officials, including the group's Gaza leader, are also on the list.
CBS Local — A woman in South Carolina got quite a surprise after opening a package she thought contained a yoga mat she had ordered, but found nearly 20,000 illegal pills valued at $400,000 instead.
According to local police, the Rock Hill resident was waiting for her package on Sept. 30 when her mailman handed her a box around 2 p.m. local time. The woman, who chose to remain anonymous, discovered two bags full of narcotics in the package and immediately called the Rock Hill Police Department. The homeowner reportedly told officers that she did not know why someone would use her name and address to ship drugs.
The county's drug unit commander, Marvin Brown, believes the package was probably sent there to be picked up by a waiting dealer. Brown said that the perfect place for drug pickups are, “vacant apartments [and] homes where people have gone to work for the day.”
The drugs were actually sent to the woman's old house, which is still vacant, but because the address was misspelled the package was re-routed using her name. “The dealers weren't as intelligent as they thought they were,” Commander Brown added.
Authorities say each oxycodone-type pill had a street value of about $20, making the total drug bust worth as much as $400,000. Police are reportedly working to trace the botched delivery back to the person in California who sent it.
NEW YORK (AP) — Antonio Brown is nearly impossible to stop.
The Steelers star receiver has already put up some stellar stats in his career, including the most receptions in NFL history (526) in any player's first six years in the league.
And through four games this season, he has 388 yards receiving, which is second in the NFL and only 3 yards away from leading the league.
The top spot is a familiar place for Brown as he beat out everyone for the No. 1 position among the AP's top 10 wide receivers. The voting was done by Pro Football Hall of Fame member James Lofton and 10 AP football writers.
Brown earned eight first-place votes and finished with 103 points.
"Not only is he the best receiver in the game, Brown might be the best all-around player in the NFL," said the AP's Barry Wilner, who is based in New York.
Atlanta's Julio Jones was in second place with 98 points. Jones received the other three first-place votes and six for second place. He led the NFC and was second in the NFL last season with 1,409 yards. He had nine catches for 180 yards with two scores in the NFC championship game against Green Bay as they Falcons reached the Super Bowl before blowing a 28-3 lead and losing in overtime to New England.
"One of the masters of accumulating yards after the catch and a clutch performer, too, as the Packers witnessed in the NFC championship game last season," said the AP's Dave Campbell, who's based in Minneapolis.
Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants was third with 69 points.
"The guy is one of the most talented players in the game — and one of its most polarizing," said the AP's Dennis Waszak Jr., based in New York. "His acrobatic, one-handed catches have made him an exciting superstar, but his other on-field antics have also kept him in the headlines for the wrong reasons."
Houston's DeAndre Hopkins was next with 57 points, edging Tampa Bay's Mike Evans, who had 55 points.
"Does he (Hopkins) finally have a dynamic partner in Deshaun Watson?" asked the AP's Schuyler Dixon, based in Dallas. "If so, watch out for soaring numbers."
Cincinnati's A.J. Green finished sixth with 52.
"Consistently one of the best," the AP's Rob Maaddi, who's based in Philadelphia, said of the Bengals Pro Bowler.
Veterans Larry Fitzgerald of Arizona and Green Bay's Jordy Nelson tied with 36 points.
"Any list would be invalid without Fitz, who's averaged 108 catches the last two seasons after everyone thought he was headed for retirement," said the AP's Arnie Stapleton, who's based in Denver.
Dallas' Dez Bryant followed with 29 points.
"The usual big numbers aren't there this year, but Bryant remains one of the most feared receivers and should boost production as the season goes on," said the AP's Josh Dubow, who's based in the Bay Area.
Minnesota's Stefon Diggs rounded out the top 10 with 18 points.
"He's leading the league in yards and yards per game," said the AP's Teresa Walker, who's based in Nashville, Tennessee. "Imagine how much worse off the Vikings would be without him."

Pakistan expressed disappointment over the decision of Indian government to reject 500 visa applications from Pak pilgrims. The high commission in New Delhi said pilgrims could not visit at the time due to the absence of requisite security clearances. While Pak high commission released a statement saying that they are disappointed with the decision for not allowing pilgrims to visit Urs of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer.
Indian high commission has rejected 500 visa applications from Pakistani pilgrims. The reason behind it was the absence of requisite security clearances. In reply, Pakistan expressed disappointment over the decision of Indian government. The Pakistani pilgrims were about to visit the shrine of Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer. The high commission in New Delhi said pilgrims could not visit at the time due to the absence of requisite security clearances. Every year hundreds of pilgrims from both the sides visit to the holy places.
Pakistan's foreign ministry released a statement which said that the visit is a symbol and effort to bring close 2 communities and spread peace and harmony. The visit was about to take place under the 1974 India-Pakistan protocol to visit religious places. It was deep disappointment that India failed to issue visas of the 503 pilgrims to participate in Urs of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer. “Pakistan notes with deep disappointment the non-issuance of visas by India for the visit of the 503 Pakistani zaireen (pilgrims) to participate in the Urs of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti (RA) at Ajmer Sharif, India from 19-29 March 2018,” the statement said.
In January, 192 Pakistani pilgrims could not participate in Urs of Hazrat Khawaja Nizamuddin Aulia due to non-issuance of visas, said Pakistan high commission. On the other side, Indian government sources reported that such visits and promoted by the country and visas granted after following some processes. Such visits cannot take place in view of the prevailing circumstances and absence of requisite security clearances.

CHICAGO (AP) — Illinois Congressman Bobby Rush says the Justice Department should re-open the case of the Emmett Till lynching now that a key witness has been quoted as saying she lied about what the Black teen said and did before he was murdered.
A new book by author and historian Timothy B. Tyson says Carolyn Donham told him a decade ago she wasn't telling the truth with her claims of sexual advances by the 14-year-old Till.
In August 1955, Till was kidnapped, tortured, shot, mutilated. Donham's first husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam, were acquitted of the murder, but both later claimed responsibility.
The Justice Department in 2007 determined the Till case did not warrant federal prosecution due to the statute of limitations on any potential federal crimes.
Rush said Tuesday the department's decision should be reevaluated.

MEXICO CITY — The body of a photographer was found Friday in the northern state of San Luis Potosí, a day after he was abducted from his home by men dressed as police officers, Mexican officials said.
The photographer, Edgar Daniel Esqueda Castro, is the fifth journalist to be killed in Mexico this year in retaliation for their reporting, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists in New York.
Another journalist, Salvador Adame Pardo, was abducted from his home in the Mexican state of Michoacán in May; although the authorities say that his burned body was found, his family believes that he is still missing.
According to Mr. Esqueda's wife, armed men broke into the couple's house while they were sleeping and said they were government agents. “They grabbed Edgar by the neck and threw him to the ground while pointing a gun at me,” she told Reporters Without Borders, a press freedom group.

Mr. Esqueda's body was found at 9 a.m. on Friday, dumped in an open area near the airport, the San Luis Potosí State prosecutor said in a statement. Mr. Esqueda had been tied up and tortured, according to Metrópoli San Luis, one of two online newspapers to which he contributed.
Malcolm X is featured in the season premiere of Smithsonian Channel's “The Lost Tapes,” and the episode enjoyed a debut screening hosted by Comcast, Smithsonian Channel and the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture in Baltimore.
Among the 50 guests present for the screening were city council members Sharon Green Middleton (District 6) and Leon F. Pinkett, III (District 7). A panel discussion followed the episode, which included Smithsonian Channel Executive Producer John Cavanaugh, Damion Thomas, Ph.D, curator of the National Museum of African American History & Culture, and members of the audience.
Without narration and with few title cards between scenes to provide context, the film seems almost fanatically—or, perhaps, militantly—committed to an objective accounting of Malcolm X's 1962 rise to prominence in the aftermath of the LAPD's shooting of Nation of Islam member Ronald Stokes through his assassination in 1965.
“Malcolm X's” verite style draws on archival footage of the minister and civil rights leader in his prime, pulling from speeches to his congregants, panel discussions on “City Desk” and the breathless wild-eyed insinuations of young Mike Wallace's “The Hate That Hate Produced.”
Photographs and audio recordings smooth the transitions from one segment to the next, leaving the viewer witness to something like a 48-minute testimonial.
“This is the first time that I have been able to just soak up and eat his words from his mouth,” one audience member said during the panel discussion. “I may have a recording here or a recording there. But to have a film that chronologically allows me to hear him speak, his speaking in not just sound bites, that's what I appreciate most about this.”
The film's primary focus is simply what Malcolm said and what he did, leaving any further analysis by the wayside. The viewer is left to fill in the gaps between every line with their own meaning, or to try to imagine the producers' own intent.
For example, one video sample so degraded that Malcolm's face is washed out, leaving only a gleaming white silhouette. Watching Malcolm preaching, it is as if he is glowing with inner light. Is it an allusion to Malcolm's divine spark? He's sainted by more than one adherent in the film. When a director doesn't say anything, the search for meaning can grow desperate.
“I think it's a consequence of the filmmaking format, as much as anything,” Cavanaugh told the AFRO. “Certainly, we tell American history stories. That's what we do. That is always sort of our mode of thinking. When we go back and look at stories like this, it's about telling you what happened. And this series, more than any other, it's immersive. When there's no narration, it's about dropping you in the moment and experiencing history sort of live. You're seeing reactions to events as they occur.”
It may be useful to consider “The Lost Tapes: Malcolm X” as a museum piece, a curio. The closest the film gets to narrative and character are pictures of Malcolm on his pilgrimage to Mecca, near his conversion to Sunni Islam. The closest to a private moment is Malcolm kneeling alone with his god in the Great Mosque of Muhammed Ali, Cairo. But he's not saying anything.
Like the pyramids, “The Lost Tapes” Malcolm is grandiose, regal, larger than life, but there's never a peek at the man inside.
“The Lost Tapes: Malcolm X” will premiere on the Smithsonian Channel on Monday, February 26 at 8 p.m. ET.
Three Preston-based art hubs are being celebrated in the North of England.
Art research project In Certain Places, The Birley artist studios and the Harris Museum and Gallery have all made it into a listing of organisations involved in exciting artistic ventures.
The Hannah Directory is a yearly print publication and website in the North which takes snapshots capturing some of the year's best activities in the arts, music, business, new social organisations and scientific discoveries.
Now on its sixth annual edition, this year's launch of the publication takes place on Friday, June 8 between 12 and 2pm in the Victoria Building at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan).
The Birley artist studios will be marking the occasion at the same event by launching their latest initiative. The Birley Editions is a printing and publishing project focussing on limited edition prints, artist books, zines and multiples.
Organiser of the Hannah Directory Andrew Wilson said: “Preston is recognised nationally at the moment for its innovative civic culture.
“Its arts organisations have been critical to the development of that culture.
“For more than a decade they have been showing how partnerships between organisations, a public process of investigation and taking measured risks can be much more productive than just following the same route as everywhere else.
“Birley Editions will be a new contribution to that unique civic culture.”
Visitors to the launch will be able to view prints and publications by artists from the region and purchase original artworks at affordable prices.
They will also be able to get a free copy of the new Hannah Directory.

This month of each year, we commemorate the great individuals and events in the history of African-Americans.
Tuesday marked the 199th birthday of perhaps the greatest of them all, Frederick Douglass—a singular exemplar and apostle of the American spirit.
"He was an American of the Americans," Douglass once said of Abraham Lincoln, in words that apply no less aptly to himself. "Born and reared among the lowly, a stranger to wealth and luxury, compelled to grapple single-handed with the flintiest hardships of life ... he grew strong in the manly and heroic qualities demanded by the great mission to which he was called."
Douglass loved America. He loved it for its principles and for its promise. Nonetheless, the sentiment of patriotism, which he regarded as "pure, natural, and noble," did not come naturally or easily to him.
"What country have I?" he asked in an 1847 editorial, and he then answered: "None." As he confessed to his early abolitionist mentor William Lloyd Garrison, the sentiment of patriotism "was whipt out of me" by the slave masters under whose dominion he was born.
Given the circumstances of his youth, it is unremarkable that Douglass, after escaping from slavery, would embrace the teaching of Garrison, who in his abolitionist zeal rejected the Constitution as a pro-slavery "covenant with death" and who would call for non-slaveholding states to sever their association with slaveholders by seceding from the federal union.
What is remarkable is that within a few years, by conscientious study and reflection, Douglass set himself on a different course.
Douglass came to reject the Garrisonian position, and he explained why in a Fourth of July oration delivered July 5, 1852, a speech now recognized as the greatest of all abolitionist speeches.
In it, he praised the Constitution as "a glorious liberty document," and he extolled the Founding Fathers for their courage and their wisdom alike: "They were brave men. They were great men too. ... They seized upon eternal principles and set a glorious example in their defense. Mark them!"
In those principles—the principles of the Declaration of Independence—Douglass found the distinctive promise of America.
"The leading object of [our] government," Lincoln said in a July 4 message of his own, is "to elevate the condition of men—to lift artificial weights from all shoulders—to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all—to afford all an unfettered start, and a fair chance."
Precisely so, Douglass added in the most popular of his post-Civil War speeches:
America is said, and not without reason, to be preeminently the home and patron of self-made men ... [The] principle of measuring and valuing men according to their respective merits and without regard to their antecedents, is better established and more generally enforced here than in any other country.
Douglass summarized the nation's promise a few years after the Union victory. America's mission, he proclaimed, is to become "the most perfect national illustration of the unity and dignity of the human family that the world has ever seen."

The converse is still more telling: As Douglass conceived of the virtue of the country in terms of human integration and elevation, he conceived of the main dangers to it as forces of disintegration and degradation, including any and all artificial barriers to the exercise of individual rights and the cultivation of civic unity.
Those forces and barriers were manifold. In the antebellum period, they included not only slavery itself but also Garrison's disunion proposal, in which Douglass found "no intelligible principle of action."
Both before and after the Civil War, they included also the ideas of constitutional state sovereignty and of sectionalism whereby portions of the country were licensed to disregard rights proper both to human beings and to American citizens.
"The true doctrine," Douglass wrote in objecting to the Supreme Court's Slaughter-House Cases doctrine of differential state and federal citizenship rights, "is one nation, one country, one citizenship and one law for all the people."
Most powerful of all sources of disintegration, however, was race. Beyond his objections to race-based slavery, needless to belabor here, of particular interest is Douglass' objection to the cultivation of racial identity even when the aim was racial uplift rather than oppression or exclusion.
A few months before he died, he observed, "We hear, since emancipation, much said ... in commendation of race pride, race love, race effort, race superiority, race men and the like."
Conceding that what he had to say "may be more useful than palatable," he nevertheless admonished the friends of racial equality that they:
... make a great mistake in saying so much of race and color ... It is an effort to cast out Satan by Beelzebub ... I would place myself, and I would place you, my young friends, upon grounds vastly higher and broader than any founded upon race or color ... Not as Ethiopians; not as Caucasians; not as Mongolians; not as Afro-Americans, or Anglo-Americans, are we addressed, but as men. God and nature speak to our manhood, and to our manhood alone.
Douglass' story is the story of an American who, like his country, rose from a low beginning to a great height, who gained freedom by his own virtue and against great odds, and who matured into a world-famous apostle of universal liberty.
It is the story, too, of a man divided by race, who with time and work became his country's most prominent representative of the aspiration toward racial uplift, reconciliation, and integration.
Recounted in three finely crafted autobiographies, Douglass' story is timely in any season and locale.
In our own, a time when many Americans feel trapped by circumstances, ignored, or disdained by those in positions of public responsibility and confused about the meaning and merits of their country's identity, it is particularly so.

The Latest on the war in Syria (all times local):
6:45 p.m.
Syrian activists say the last round of talks with Russian mediators to reach a truce in southwestern Syria have faltered, threatening a relative calm that prevailed for days.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, said the talks collapsed Wednesday because Russia wanted the rebels to hand in their heavy weapons in a surrender deal that would restore government control over Daraa province.
The opposition had also demanded safe passage to opposition-held northern Syria, a request denied by Russia, according to other activists.
The talks' failure comes after a relative lull in the fighting that has raged for two weeks in the south, displacing up to 300,000 people, many of them moved toward the Jordanian border. The government is already in control of most of Daraa province.

Another six Russian combat jets have flown back home after a stint in Syria.
Russian TV stations showed the Su-25 ground attack jets landing Wednesday at their home base in the Krasnodar region in southern Russia. The Russian Defense Ministry said that a total of 27 warplanes and helicopters have returned home in recent days.
It wasn't immediately clear if the redeployment represented Moscow's attempt to scale down its military presence in Syria or was part of a regular rotation. In the past, the military has rotated its aircraft in Syria, keeping their number at a few dozen.
Russia has waged an air campaign in Syria since September 2015, helping turn the tide of war in President Bashar Assad's favor

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has reaffirmed his government's determination to stand by Syrian President Bashar Assad in the Arab nation's yearslong civil war.
Rouhani spoke to reporters in Vienna, where his country's nuclear agreement with world powers was drawn up three years ago and where the Iranian president held talks with Chancellor Sebastian Kurz on Wednesday.
Rouhani said the people of Iran "will continue our path alongside the nation and government of Syria, until all terrorists are annihilated."
Shiite Iran — along with Russia and the Lebanese Shiite militant Hezbollah group — has been a staunch ally of Assad's government and advisers from Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard, as well as trainers, commanders and experts are stationed in military bases across Syria.

Russia says demands for Iran's complete withdrawal from Syria are "unrealistic."
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday after meeting with his Jordanian counterpart that Iran is one of the key powers in the region, and that it would be "absolutely unrealistic" to expect it to abandon its interests. He said regional powers should discuss mutual complaints and negotiate a compromise.
Russia and Iran have provided crucial military support to Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces, helping them turn the tide in the civil war.
Israel has said it will not tolerate an Iranian military presence in Syria and has launched military strikes against Iranian targets there in recent months.
Lavrov said Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump would discuss the situation in southern Syria, where government forces are waging a new offensive, at their July 16 summit. He said a cease-fire in the region brokered by Russia, Jordan and the U.S. had envisioned the withdrawal of non-Syrian forces and the deployment of Syrian troops along the frontier with Israel.

Islamic State media outlets are reporting that the son of the group's leader has been killed fighting Syrian government forces.
The announcement of the death of the young son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appeared on the group's social media accounts late Tuesday. It included a picture of a young boy carrying a rifle and identified him as Huthaifa al-Badri.
The statement did not specify when he was killed. It said he was an elite fighter who was killed while fighting Syrian and Russia troops at a power station in the central Homs province.
Al-Baghdadi has been reported killed or wounded on a number of occasions but is widely believed to still be alive. IS has been driven from nearly all the territory it once controlled in Syria and Iraq.

SAN FRANCISCO--At least two people are dead after a shooting at a UPS facility in San Francisco on Wednesday morning.
The gunman shot himself and his condition is unknown.
Media reports say San Francisco police have secured the building, and is searching the building for victims and witnesses, the department said in a tweet.
The package sorting and delivery facility employs about 850 people.
UPS spokesman Steve Gaut released a statement saying four employees were involved in a "shooting incident" but that the company cannot provide any identifications until the police investigation is complete.
"We understand that there are potentially multiple deaths, although some individuals were transported to the hospital and we are unsure of their status at this time," the statement said.

The city of Hoover celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. But what's in a name? And how did this growing city come to be?
The vision for Hoover goes back to one businessman, William Hoover Sr., founder of Employers Mutual Insurance of Alabama (1922). His children and grandchildren describe him as a man of great character, personality, inspiration and vision.
Some of the Hoover family still live in or near the city that bears their family's name. William Hoover Sr. (1890-1979) and his wife, Helen Carnes Hoover (1902-87), had four children: Jane Hoover Parrish, twins Bill Hoover Jr. (1936-2009) and Helen Hoover Holmes, and Thomas Hoover.
Hoover's children went on to have families of their own with grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Parrish and Holmes still live in homes that were built in the Green Valley community's early years. Elizabeth Holmes, Holmes' daughter and Hoover's granddaughter, also lives in the area, and Thomas Hoover and his family live in Birmingham.
On this milestone anniversary for the city, the family reflected on how the city started and where it is today, but it is the personal memories between father and child, grandfather and grandchild that illustrate that the name behind the city was also a much loved family man.
“My father always took time for us to do things together as a family. He was the wheel and my mother the hub,” Parrish said.
Helen Holmes remembers her father's pet names for his children and grandchildren. “My twin brother [the late Bill Hoover Jr.] and I were simply called ‘Sister/Brother' or he would call me ‘Tiddlem' sometimes, which we are not sure how to spell,” she said with a laugh. Jane, whose full name is Dorothy Jane, was called “Doshie” Jane.
“One of my fondest memories with my father is a time when he was changing his shoes in our parents' room, and I was leaning on the chair. We were all going to a movie (a ‘picture show' as we called them back then). He asked where I wanted to go, and I said the Ritz, and he said, ‘You don't want to go to the Ritz; it will make you have fits!' To a 5-year-old that is funny,” Jane said. “It is memories like that, the funny man our father was, that I remember the most.”
Elizabeth Holmes said she remembers the time the family patriarch spent with the youngest of the Hoover family.
“He always made time for us, the grandkids, no matter what he was doing,” she said.
As a child himself, Hoover looked to his own father as inspiration. Hoover's father had a brick manufacturing business near Russellville, and it was his intention to build a town for the workmen and name it Hooverville. When it did not happen, it became the dream of his son, William, to make it a reality. This vision started with the courage, planning and foresight to step out and start his own business in 1922.
It was a monumental task forming Employers Mutual Insurance of Alabama in downtown Birmingham, and Hoover did it without taking a salary. The company emerged from the Great Depression as one of the most sound casualty companies in the nation. In 1929, the company was converted from a mutual company to a stock company — Employers Insurance Company of Alabama, Inc.
In 1944, Hoover purchased 160 acres on what is now Tyler Road. Being quite the visionary, Hoover began buying land on U.S. 31 under the company “South Jefferson Company” in the 1950s after learning the state planned to start widening U.S. 31. Hoover realized this would cause movement south toward U.S. 31 and would bring opportunity to the area. This area became known as the Hoover community, and with that, he also brought his company to the area.
The groundbreaking for Employers Insurance Company of Alabama's new home office building in the community was in December 1957, and it was completed in September 1958. The business was in what is now the Hoover Court shopping center.
The Hoover family often says the city was built and managed from this location in the early days. Hoover died in 1979 as the city of Hoover was expanding and growing.
If he could see the city today, would it be what he envisioned?
“I get asked all the time if my dad would be surprised at the size and scope of his namesake city, and the answer is no, he would not be surprised at all,” Thomas Hoover said. “He envisioned, as he told me many times, not only the growth of the city of Hoover but the entire area south of Shades Mountain to Double Oak Mountain and beyond.”
Much of the land Hoover acquired he sold or gave away for those schools, churches and city government facilities. Hoover gave the land for Green Valley (now Hoover) Country Club, and the original city hall and police station were built on Hoover's land. Elizabeth Holmes said that giving spirit is one of the qualities that she seeks for her own life.
“His spirit of giving and caring about the interest of others has inspired me to give back to my community, as well,” she said, “whether it is giving artwork to charity or teaching art to inner-city children or to the kids at the school where I work.”
Elizabeth Holmes, an artist and painter, credits her grandfather and grandmother with helping her realize her dream.
“When I was young, it was fun to tell people who my granddad was, but as I grew older, it affected me in a deeper way,” she said. “He accomplished his dreams to start a city. It took hard work and sacrifice. His determination spurred me on my own path to achieve my own dreams to become a working artist. That, coupled with my grandmother's love of art and the way she fostered that love and creativity with me, greatly influenced my dream.”
As the city celebrates its 50 years, Helen Holmes reflected on the anniversary.
“I feel even prouder of its founding as I watch the growth and quality of its businesses, school system, police and fire and parks,” she said. “I am once again reminded of my father's dream to carry on his father's dream to have a city. Even today, as I walk around Star Lake and children playing in the park, I think about the reality of my father's dream and how pleased he would be today to see how the city has flourished.”
Parrish agreed. “It makes me feel very honored to be a daughter of the founder of Hoover. It has really grown from just the small community of 406 people it started out as,” she said.
Elizabeth Holmes looked to the future of the city and, at the same time, recognized its impact of the last 50 years.
“My grandfather's name on the city reminds me of the responsibility and the privilege it is to leave a positive legacy for others,” she said.

Scientists Uncover Monster Black Hole from Early Universe
Astronomers have discovered a super-size black hole hearkening back to almost the dawn of creation. It's the farthest black hole ever found.
A team led by the Carnegie Observatories' Eduardo Banados reported in the journal Nature on Wednesday that the black hole lies in a quasar dating to 690 million years of the Big Bang. That means the light from this quasar has been traveling our way for more than 13 billion years.
Banados said the quasar provides a unique baby picture of the universe, when it was just 5 percent of its current age.
It would be like seeing photos of a 50-year-old man when he was 2 1/2 years old, according to Banados.
"This discovery opens up an exciting new window to understand the early universe," he said in an email from Pasadena, California.
Quasars are incredibly bright objects deep in the cosmos, powered by black holes devouring everything around them. That makes them perfect candidates for unraveling the mysteries of the earliest cosmic times.
The black hole in this newest, most distant quasar is 800 million times the mass of our sun.
Much bigger black holes are out there, but none so far away -- at least among those found so far. These larger black holes have had more time to grow in the hearts of galaxies since the Big Bang, compared with the young one just observed.
"The new quasar is itself one of the first galaxies, and yet it already harbors a behemoth black hole as massive as others in the present-day universe," co-author Xiaohui Fan of the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory said in a statement.
Around the time of this newest quasar, the universe was emerging from a so-called Dark Ages. Stars and galaxies were first appearing and their radiation ionizing the surrounding hydrogen gas to illuminate the cosmos.
Banados suspects there are more examples like this out there, between 20 and 100.
"The newfound quasar is so luminous and evolved that I would be surprised if this was the first quasar ever formed," Banados said. "The universe is enormous and searching for these very rare objects is like looking for the needle in the haystack."
Only one other quasar has been found in this ultra-distant category, despite extensive scanning. This newest quasar beats that previous record-holder by about 60 million years.
Still on the lookout, astronomers are uncertain how close they'll get to the actual beginning of time, 13.8 billion years ago.
Banados and his team used the Carnegie's Magellan telescopes in Chile, supported by observatories in Hawaii, the American Southwest and the French Alps.

OTTAWA — A private member's bill aimed at ensuring Canada's laws are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has earned the approval of the House of Commons.
Bill C-262, introduced by New Democrat MP and reconciliation critic Romeo Saganash, won the support of MPs by a margin of 206 to 79 and is now en route to the Senate.
Saganash was among the original architects of the UN declaration, which was adopted by the General Assembly in September 2007.
Saganash says he believes his legislation is the most important bill Parliament has considered in a long time.

Japanese prosecutors are investigating two of the country's biggest construction companies, Obayashi Corp. and Kajima Corp., for suspected wrongdoing linked to a public-backed $79 billion magnetic-levitation rail network.
After local media reported authorities were looking into bid-rigging related to construction of Central Japan Railway Co.'s maglev project, Obayashi Corp. said in a statement that prosecutors had raided its office Friday on suspicion it used fraudulent information to obstruct business.
Kajima Corp. staff are also being questioned by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office after receiving queries over its involvement in contracts for the train line, company spokesman Atsushi Fujino said.
The scandal has emerged as the latest hiccup for JR Central's 9 trillion yen ($79.38 billion) high-speed rail project. Scheduled to open its first leg in 2027, the maglev line will link Japan's two biggest cities of Tokyo and Osaka upon completion in 2045. As part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to export infrastructure technology, the government said last year that it would provide low-interest loans to speed up the opening of the second stage of the project.
“The construction ramp-up has been slow at JR Central and increased scrutiny of the tendering and bidding could delay that further,” Denise Wong, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said by e-mail.
Obayashi shares fell 7.2% on Monday, the biggest loss in almost four years. Kajima declined 4.1%.
Emergency Exit
Obayashi won four construction contracts for the project in April 2016, according to JR Central spokesman Shinya Nino. The contract under investigation involves the building of an emergency exit at a facility in Nagoya, with completion targeted for Sept. 2019. JR Central isn't aware of any wrongdoing in the bidding process, Nino said, adding that the company will request an explanation from the companies involved in the investigation.
Maglev trains rely on magnetic power to float the cars above the ground, eliminating the friction of steel tracks. The trains start off running on wheels — the kind used on F-15 fighter jets — until they're going fast enough for the magnets to kick in and create lift. In 2015, a JR Central maglev train ran at a record 375 mph. JR Central couldn't say if the investigation will impact the construction schedule.
This isn't the first time construction companies including Obayashi have been caught up in scandal. Obayashi was punished for bid-rigging on a subway system in Nagoya in 2007, and said in April it was investigated by the country's Fair Trade Commission for suspected antitrust violations on an Environment Ministry contract.

EL CAJON (KGTV) - A man was shot by El Cajon police Sunday night after lunging at officers with a knife.
Police were called at around 9 p.m. to reports of an incoherent man standing in traffic at Second Street near Oakdale Avenue.
Officers tried to talk to the man when he pulled out a knife and started walking south toward Madison Avenue.
Officers twice used a TASER to subdue the suspect but he pulled the barbs out of his skin.
Police reportedly struggled to get the knife out of his hands and was shot when he lunged at the officers with the knife.
The suspect, described as a white male in his 60s, was taken to a nearby hospital. His condition is unknown at this time but police say he is expected to survive.

The Lakers have had most every major NBA Draft prospect come through the doors of their practice facility over the past two weeks. Lonzo Ball was the first and most notable, as he has long been the presumptive No. 2 overall pick, but the Lakers have ensured they do their due diligence on the matter by bringing in Josh Jackson and De'Aaron Fox as well.
Projected top overall pick Markelle Fultz will also join the Lakers for a workout on Thursday, in what will be his only non-Celtics pre-draft workout.
Dear readers,
Last week, I shared part of a presentation I made at the 10th annual Daily Breeze Successful Aging Expo held at the Torrance Marriott entitled “A New Life Stage; A New Time.” This week I would like to describe several indicators that reflect this new time as we experience an unprecedented increase in life expectancy with increasing numbers of older people.
Lifestyles matter: How we live our lives impacts how we age. We can slow the aging process and improve our level of functioning by engaging in physical exercise and activities, mental and social engagement, good nutrition and having a sense of purpose.
But there is more. Not only are these aspects important on how well we function, they have an impact on how long we live. In a 30-year follow-up study researchers from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health revealed some interesting findings. At age 50, life expectancy increased with five lifestyle habits: not smoking, eating a healthy diet, regular exercise, keeping a healthy body weight and moderate alcohol consumption. Women who maintained all five healthy habits gained, on average, 14 years of life and men who did the same gained 12.2 years compared with those who didn't maintain healthy habits.
A new way to work: Two terms that regaining popularity is “encore career,” a career that embraces purpose, passion and sometimes a paycheck – for the greater good. About nine million people between ages 44 and 70 are already in encore careers and another 31 million are interested in having one. For the past 10 years, Encore.org has awarded Purpose Prizes for those 60 and older who have used their talents and experiences to make a profound difference in their communities. AARP now sponsors this program.
An example of a past winner is Catalina Tapia. He came from Mexico at the age of 20 with six dollars in his pocket and a sixth-grade education. After starting his own gardening business, he sent his son to UC Berkeley law school and concluded that more young Latinos should have a similar opportunity. He launched the Bay Area Gardeners' Foundation, a nonprofit organization of area gardeners that provide scholarships to low-income Latinos. Tapia and his fellow gardeners asked their employers and local businesses to donate to the fund. They raised $250,000 in the first two years and awarded grants to 18 students from low-income families who wanted a college education. Recipients pledged 20 hours of community service for each year they receive scholarship funds. Tapia won a $100,000 prize.
Aging in place: Older adults have the opportunity to age in their own homes for as long as possible and to stay connected to their communities by becoming a member of the Village, a non-profit membership organization that does just that. The Village is a geographic area where older adults live. Members can be recipients of services including transportation, home tasks such as changing a light bulb or taking out the trash cans, home visits, shopping and tech support. Although not mandatory, members volunteer to provide such services. Many Villages offer rich social and cultural activities that reflect members' interests. See South Bay Village at http://www.sbvill.org/ and Palos Verdes Peninsula Village at www.peninsulavillage.net/. To find a village near you, see the Village to Village Network at http://www.vtvnetwork.org/ .
Technology: The technology and aging space is considered a $20 billion industry that includes fitness and caregiving programs, web games, smartphones, chronic disease management systems, fall detection and prevention programs, mobility aids and emergency response systems. Many technology advancements enhance opportunities for independence, safety, confidence and dignity. One example is the Liftwarespoon and Liftwarefork designed for those with a hand tremor. A gadget that attaches to a special fork or spoon serves as a stabilizer eliminating a tremor. That means no spilled soup or the drop of a hamburger on your lap.
These are just four examples that indicate we are living in a new time when research and innovative programs and products are responding to an aging population that values choices, giving back, dignity, connection and enjoying life. It's a time of high expectations and aspirations.
G.E. vowed to cooperate with the investigation, just like every company does, and Ms. Miller said that “there is nothing here that I am overly concerned about.”
But accounting investigations tend to take on a life of their own. They require a company and its outside auditor to explain a wide range of decisions that raise questions about the propriety of its internal controls. And as with any investigation, where the S.E.C. starts is not necessarily where the agency will end up if other issues come to the surface.

A starting point will be the insurance charge that G.E. said will total $15 billion over seven years because of issues estimating the costs of long-term care and other policies. That is a substantial underestimation. The S.E.C. will want to know whether the failure to recognize the losses earlier was a means to keep the company's earnings afloat, and why it took this long to disclose them.
Revenue recognition related to service agreements is an area of concern for the S.E.C. because aggressive accounting can hide a deterioration in a business line. Some companies book revenue early, robbing from the future to make the present look better in the hope that things will turn around.
The S.E.C. rule prohibiting accounting fraud is quite broad: “No person shall directly or indirectly, falsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record or account.” One limitation is that any misstatement has to be “material,” although the size of G.E.'s insurance charge and the importance of its service agreements likely means any problems uncovered will meet that standard.
This is not the first time G.E. has dealt with questions about its accounting. In 2009, the company settled civil fraud and accounting charges with the S.E.C. for using improper methods to steadily increase its reported earnings to meet or exceed the consensus earnings estimates of analysts and avoid any negative results. G.E. agreed to pay a $50 million penalty as part of the settlement, a substantial price for smoothing out earnings to remain in the good graces of investors.
Accounting fraud goes to the heart of the markets. Investors rely on financial statements to assess the future prospects of a company and expect one plus one will equal two. Any indication that the numbers were fudged puts at risk the trust investors have in management, further damaging an enterprise like G.E. that is already dealing with a host of challenges.
MIAMI COUNTY — Miami County Common Pleas Court Jeannine Pratt sentenced Erick Segura, 24, of Tipp City, to serve 10 years for 34 counts of drug trafficking and engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity on Monday.
Judge Pratt stated Segura, a U.S. citizen, helped traffic drugs in the area “which are killing people every day.” Judge Pratt told Segura the drugs he helped transport into the Miami Valley were “destroying lives and families all around the state.”
Segura addressed the court prior to sentencing and said, “I'm sorry for the wrong path I took.” Segura said he began trafficking drugs to support his family and wife. His wife Aleesha Segura-White was also arrested in connection with the drug ring bust in 2013.
Segura said he was “ready to face my charge since 2013” and would use his prison time to “get my life in order.”
“I'll be gone from my family for a stupid choice I made,” Segura said. “I pray to God I go to prison to change my ways and I become a new man to my wife and kids.”
Last month, Segura was arraigned on a bill of information charging him with felony engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, conspiracy, concealed carry violation, money laundering, possession of heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine and trafficking heroin.
Segura pleaded guilty to the charges in exchange for a plea deal to serve 10 years on all charges and to have the original indictment dismissed. There was no condition the sentence was to be mandatory and Segura forfeited rights to two vehicles, a 2008 Chrysler 300 and 2007 GMC Sierra seized in the case.
The sentence is not mandatory and Segura will be eligible for judicial release after five years. He was ordered to pay $125 to the Miami County Sheriff's Office for drug lab testing. He was found to be indigent and no mandatory fine was imposed. He was given 244 days in jail time credit. Segura will serve five years of post-release control following his release from prison. His license was also revoked for five years.
Segura was one of three subjects Miami County Sheriff's Office arrested in Tipp City last fall, on indictments stemming from the alleged drug ring, which was first uncovered in 2014. Jose Barajas, a Mexican national, was later arrested in connection to the incident.
Segura, along with his brother Mario and wife Aleesha, were arrested due to their alleged ties to the drug ring which included nearly 80 pounds of heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine that was distributed in the Miami Valley.
Last month, Jose Barajas, 37, entered a plea of guilty to four felony charges in a change of plea hearing to plead guilty to the superseding grand jury indictments of one count first-degree felony engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, two counts of first-degree felony aggravated funding of drug trafficking and one count of second-degree felony conspiracy to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity.
Barajas was represented by public defender Jack Hemm. A joint plea agreement with the state recommends Barajas to serve three years in prison on all counts. The agreement did not include a clause that he would have to testify against the other defendants. Barajas' sentence will be mandatory and he is not eligible for early release. He also will serve five years of post-release control.
Judge Jeannine Pratt stated Barajas could face up to 41 years in prison and pay a total of $35,000 fine for all charges. Barajas is also subject to have his driver's license suspended up to five years.
Barajas will be sentenced on May 2. Mario Segura's trial has been continued until May 9. Aleesha Segura-White's trial has been set for trial on May 16. All three are currently incarcerated at the Miami County Jail.

Los Angeles Dodgers' Yasiel Puig avoids an inside pitch from Cleveland Indians starting pitcher Trevor Bauer during the fourth inning of a baseball game, Tuesday, June 13, 2017, in Cleveland. (AP Photo/Tony Dejak)
CLEVELAND (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig has been suspended one game and fined by Major League Baseball for making an obscene gesture to Indians fans on Tuesday night.
Puig flashed the middle finger on both hands at fans sitting behind home plate at Progressive Field after hitting a home run in the second inning. Baseball executive Joe Torre announced the one-game penalty and undisclosed fine.
Puig is appealing the decision and will play Wednesday night. The mercurial player said he ''stooped'' to the level of fans who he said were heckling him in the on-deck circle. Puig said that the group of fans kept talking to him after the home run.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts spoke with Puig about the incident Wednesday. The manager addressed the media before the suspension was announced.
''I made it clear I was not pleased with what he did,'' Roberts said. ''He understands how I felt - and he won't do it again. To have us talking about obscene gestures, I don't want to do that and he doesn't want to do that.''
Roberts said Puig regretted the incident.
''It's something that he wishes didn't happen,'' Roberts said. ''He didn't appreciate what was being said, and he reacted.''
The suspension is the latest incident involving Puig, who has tried the Dodgers' patience with previous behavior.
Puig got two hits in the Dodgers' 7-5 win over the Indians.
Roberts played in the majors for 10 years and realizes there's a give-and-take with fans.
''You either have fun with it, which is what I tried to do, or maybe you go back a little with them to try and win them over,'' he said. ''But sometimes, when it is in bad taste, you get emotional.''
Nearly 60 athletes from eight nations are due to compete at the seventh-leg of the International Swimming Federation Artistic Swimming World Series in Surrey in Canada.
Competition will take place from tomorrow in the Surrey Sport and Leisure Centre around 40 kilometres south-east of Vancouver.
Strong teams from Ukraine and Japan feature heavily with nine Olympians set to compete.
This includes Yukiko Inui of Japan, the Olympic bronze duet medallist who is favourite for the solo competition in Canada.
She will also compete alongside Kanami Nakamaki of Japan in the duet, where Ukrainian's Anastasiya Savchuk and Yelyzaveta Yakhno are set to be their biggest rivals.
Paris, Beijing, Tokyo, Samorin, Budapest, Madrid, and now… Surrey BC 🇨🇦! The magic of FINA Artistic Swimming World Series stops in Canada this weekend, for its seventh meet. Are you going to watch it live on https://t.co/nzeAyslyoo? 😍🙌🏻
⏩ https://t.co/Gk9PO52dc5 pic.twitter.com/IBCbTNAHzA — FINA (@fina1908) May 30, 2018
Canada's Jacqueline Simoneau will lead the home team in solo, duet and team events.
French teenager Eve Planeix and Austrian triplets Vasiliki, Anna-Maria and Eirini Alexandri are also entered.
Action is due to begin tomorrow with solo, mixed duet and team technical events.
Team free, duet technical and free combination finals are then due to be held on Friday (June 1) before solo and duet free and highlight team events on Saturday (June 2).
It follows other World Series legs in Paris, Beijing, Tokyo, Samorin, Budapest and Madrid.
A service member in the U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State group has died in a "non-combat related incident" in Iraq.
A statement from the U.S. military said the service member was killed on Monday, without providing further details. It did not identify the individual or give a nationality.
According to the Pentagon, there are 4,815 U.S. troops in Iraq, including special operations forces. They are mainly providing logistical and other support to Iraqi combat forces, but have been operating closer to the front lines as part of a massive operation to retake the IS-held city of Mosul.
This is what happens when there is a lull during the basketball playoff season. Chris Herring, for FiveThirtyEight, goes into full detail of the relatively high number of times Kevin Durant's shoe falls off during games:
All told, an extensive video analysis of Durant's games from the past three regular seasons and postseasons reveals that the four-time scoring champ has come out of his shoe at least 31 times since the beginning of the 2015-16 campaign. That number, compiled against 20 different NBA teams, equates to losing a sneaker roughly every eight games or so — a mind-bogglingly high figure considering that Durant has had his own signature Nike shoe, designed to fit the unique contours of his feet, dating back to 2008.
“His shoe comes off more than anyone I've ever seen,” says teammate Draymond Green.
The question, of course, is why.
Today, technological advances are more relevant than ever, especially in the world of finance. Though the basic principle of using non-coin-based systems has been around for quite some time, it has only been in recent years that the technology to support those ideas has become so widely available. It seems certain, therefore, that the future of mobile bill payment technology is bright.
Also known as mobile money or mobile wallet, mobile bill payment technology allows individuals to make payments with their mobile phone rather than paying with a check, credit card or cash. Mobile bill payment is being adopted worldwide in a variety of ways and by the end of 2013 is expected to reach over $600 billion.
It makes sense that mobile bill payment is taking off; in today's world of instant gratification, it seems obvious that instant financial transactions are going to be the next step. Reassuringly, this technology also affords consumers some security. Credit cards, debit cards and cash all have the disadvantage of being prone to theft or loss and while a mobile device may also be lost or stolen it can still help protect its owner's financial accounts.
Advantages of mobile bill payment technology
Mobile bill payment technology has many advantages for both businesses and consumers. For consumers, it offers a convenient and easy way to pay for bills, services and goods with relatively little risk. For businesses, providing customers with yet another payment method can help to improve overall sales and increase customer loyalty.
Implementation is relatively inexpensive and there is no sophisticated technical knowledge for businesses to worry about. Consumers usually just have to download an app to their mobile device, which enables them to begin enjoying the benefits of the system almost instantly. In addition, mobile bill payment capability also gives the individual access to deals and offers and the ability to transfer funds easily. Often, the mobile wallet has cheaper fees than the average credit card interest rate.
Companies are able to accept payments away from their home base and reach a whole new world of customers. Mobile bill payment technology also enables them to effectively brand their image, engage in social marketing and enjoy considerable cost savings.
What's next for mobile bill payment technologies?
In the past couple of decades online banking has become the norm. In fact online payments now account for a significant proportion of all online financial transactions, especially in developed markets where internet access is not an issue. This trend, which has already spiked among mobile phone users, is likely to continue migrating to the tablet market as the devices become more and more popular.
Industry experts estimate that approximately 200 million mobile users will be paying bills via their mobile devices by 2017. With tablets becoming an even more popular solution for both companies and consumers the interest in, and acceptance of, mobile banking and mobile bill pay is set to surge. In view of this advancement, businesses may have no other choice than to keep up with consumer demand for mobile payments.

Transcript for Classified GOP memo focuses on warrant to monitor Carter Page communications
very busy Friday night, and we begin with the firestorm over that classified memo written by congressional Republicans. President Trump declassifying it, describing, quote, grave concerns from the FBI, and from Christopher WRAY. The president tonight calling the alleged aver described in the memo, quote, a disgrace. Democrats say it is misleading and an attempt to undermine Robert Mueller who wants to interview the president. What is in the memo? Here's ABC's chief White House correspondent, Jonathan Karl, tonight. Reporter: Before the public even saw the newly declassified Republican memo, President Trump was portraying it as a bombshell. I think it's terrible, if you want to know the truth. I think it's a disgrace, what's going on in this country I think it's a disgrace. A lot of people should be ashamed of themselves and much worse than that. Reporter: The controversial memo is written by the Republican staff of the house intelligence committee, chaired by Devin nunes, a close trump ally. It focuses entirely on one narrow aspect of the Russia investigation, a warrant to monitor the communications of Carter page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy advisor and the Obama justice department went to a secret intelligence court to apply for the warrant in October, 2016. According to the Republican memo, an essential part of the application was the now infamous dossier on Russian election meddling and team trump written by former British spy Christopher Steele. The memo claims the judge who approved the warrant was never told the dossier was paid for by the democratic national committee and the Clinton campaign, and that the judge never knew that Steele allegedly told a senior justice official that he was "Desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president." The memo says that former deputy FBI director Andrew Mccabe told the house intelligence committee that, "No surveillance warrant would have been sought without the Steele dossier information." But Democrats on the committee say that's misleading. As they have cherry picked information from the FISA application they've also cherry picked information from Mr. Mccabe. Reporter: Democrat Adam Schiff says Mccabe portrayed the dossier as one of many key pieces of information used in getting the warrant to monitor Carter page. As ABC news has previously reported, page was on the FBI's radar since 2013 because of his suspicious contacts with Russian operatives. In 2016, when the Trump campaign was pressed to list their foreign policy advisers, page's name was on their short list. But last year page's Russia ties came under growing scrutiny including questions about whether R met with the Russian ambassador at the Republican convention. Did you meet sergey kislyak in Cleveland? Did you talk to him? I'm not going to deny I talked to him. Reporter: Page has denied any wrongdoing, but the president has distanced himself. I don't think I've ever spoken to him or met him. And he said he was a very low level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. It's possible I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. Reporter: The Republican memo released today lists several current and former law enforcement officials involved in applying for the surveillance warrant including former FBI director James Comey and deputy attorney general rod Rosenstein, the official overseeing Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into Russian meddling. Several people close to the president tell ABC news, trump has been deeply frustrated with Rosenstein. Does it make you more likely to fire Rosenstein? You figure that one out. Let's go live to Jon Karl at the White House tonight. We just heard President Trump, but tonight the White House insists there are no discussions of firing rod Rosenstein? Reporter: That is the official word here at the White House tonight, but the tension is real. Rosenstein joined with Christopher WRAY, the FBI director, in pleading that the White House not release this Republican memo, and the president lashed out at the leadership of the justice department and the FBI, tweeting that, quote, they have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats. Keep in find those are people who are lifelong Republicans appointed by President Trump. Jon Karl leading us off tonight.

Underground pockets of boiling water and steam in a northern New Mexico national preserve that represent the heart of an ancient collapsed volcano could get extra federal protection under a new effort by the National Park Service aimed at limiting or preventing tapping the geothermal energy from neighboring land.
Federal officials said last week that the Valles Caldera National Preserve would become the 17th U.S. park unit with designated thermal features if approved. A monthlong public comment period will end Jan. 26.
Yellowstone, Crater Lake and Hawaii Volcanoes already are on the list of parks with federally protected geothermal features.
Dubbed the "Yellowstone of the Southwest," Valles Calderas is home to vast grasslands, the remnants of one of North America's few super volcanoes and one of New Mexico's most famous elk herds. The bear-claw shaped ring of mountain peaks that form the caldera also is culturally significant to neighboring Native American tribes.
Its visible geothermal features are nowhere near as striking as Yellowstone's geysers and consist mainly of above-ground, pungent smelling sulphur springs.
The nearly 140-square-mile preserve was purchased by the federal government in 2000 and managed as a working ranch for years. The Park Service took over preserve management in 2015.
The last privately-owned mineral rights within the preserve were taken over by the federal government about a decade ago to protect against geothermal development within Valles Caldera's boundaries.
Park officials said the proposed designation would address geothermal development just outside the preserve's boundaries by requiring federal agencies to work with the Park Service to determine if proposed drilling to tap adjacent geothermal resources would adversely affect the preserve's geothermal reserves.
The idea of tapping the steam beneath the preserve dates back decades, with the energy crisis of the 1970s spurring the first major wave of interest in the nation's geothermal resources .
The U.S. Department of Energy, Union Oil Co. and Public Service Co. of New Mexico spent millions of dollars looking into the feasibility of developing a geothermal power plant on what was then private property. The idea was ultimately abandoned in the 1980s.
Experts have said the caldera is still hot enough to produce steam and could generate electricity if harnessed.
In 2005, Texas-based GeoProducts — which owned the last of the private rights — threatened that unless the government agreed to what the mineral rights owners believed was a fair market price, the company would build a full-scale geothermal power plant in the southwest corner of the preserve, along with transmission lines to export the electricity.
Later that year, then-President George Bush signed legislation aimed at settling the dispute over the mineral rights. Government lawyers followed up with a condemnation lawsuit that gave the government control over the mineral rights needed to tap the park's geothermal reserves.
Interest in New Mexico's geothermal resources has increased again recently as the state works to wean itself from fossil fuels and boost renewable energy development.
In 2012, Gov. Susana Martinez signed legislation to ease the process for companies trying to develop geothermal resources.
More recently, another effort to encourage geothermal development happened when regulatory authority was shifted from the state's Oil Conservation Division to the Energy Conservation and Management Division.
The state's first utility-scale geothermal power plant opened in 2014 in southern New Mexico and supplies power to Public Service Co. of New Mexico, the state's largest electricity utility.

Thylacine DNA Reveals Secrets and Hidden Weakness
The first full genetic blueprint of the long-extinct thylacine has revealed the animal suffered from genetic weakness well before it was isolated on Tasmania 10,000 to 13,000 years ago.
An international team of researchers led by associate professor Andrew Pask from the University of Melbourne used DNA from the 106-year-old preserved remains of a juvenile thylacine or Tasmanian tiger to sequence the animal's genome, making it one of the most complete genetic blueprints for an extinct species.
Their findings, published in the journal Nature, provide new information on the biology of the unique marsupial and reveal that the population was in danger long before it came in contact with humans.
"We've always known that the Tasmanian tiger did not have much genetic diversity, so it would be more susceptible to diseases," he said.
"It's very much like the Tasmanian devil in that respect and we've always thought that happened once it became isolated on Tasmania between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago.
"But what we found is that the population declined about 70,000 years ago, long before it was isolated meaning it probably had more to do with changes in the climate back then."
While overhunting was "without doubt" responsible for the animal's extinction in 1936, Pask said its genetic weakness would have made it more susceptible to disease had it survived.
He said that while researchers were still a long way from bringing the animal back from extinction it was a "major hurdle" cleared. The information could help efforts to protect the Tasmanian devil because researchers could use it to infer what a healthy marsupial's genome should look like.
The researchers also found that despite its similarities to the Australian dingo, the thylacine's DNA actually has more in common with the kangaroo.
Scientists consider the thylacine and the dingo as one of the best examples of what's known as "convergent evolution," the process where organisms that are not closely related independently evolve to look the same as a result of having to adapt to similar environments or ecological niches.
Because of their hunting technique and diet of fresh meat, their skulls and body shape became similar despite the Tasmanian tiger's DNA having more in common with a kangaroo.
Pask said the genome showed the Tasmanian tiger was an "unbelievable" example of convergent evolution, because it proved how distant the two species were.

"Their similarities are absolutely astounding because they haven't shared a common ancestor since the Jurassic period, 160m years ago," he said.
"The appearance of the thylacine is almost a dingo with a pouch. And when we looked at the basis for this convergent evolution, we found that it wasn't actually the genes themselves that produced the same skull and body shape, but the control regions around them that turn genes 'on and off' at different stages of growth.
"This reveals a whole new understanding of the process of evolution, we can now explore these regions of the genome to help understand how two species converge on the same appearance, and how the process of evolution works."

Taylor Swift has won her court battle. (Photo: John Shearer/LP5/Getty Images for TAS)
After six days in court, a verdict has been reached in the Taylor Swift groping trial. After deliberating for several hours, a jury in a Denver courtroom ruled that former radio host David Mueller assaulted and battered Swift at a meet-and-greet photo session at the Pepsi Center in June 2013.
Swift is being awarded $1. Her mother Andrea and a member of her management team, Frank Bell, did not intentionally interfere with Mueller's KYGO contract, the jury ruled.
After the verdict was read, Swift hugged her attorneys and her teary-eyed mother before mouthing the words “thank you” to the jury. Mueller and his team remained expressionless.
“I want to thank Judge William J. Martinez and the jury for their careful consideration, my attorneys Doug Baldridge, Danielle Foley, Jay Schaudies and Katie Wright for fighting for me and anyone who feels silenced by a sexual assault, and especially anyone who offered their support throughout this four-year ordeal and two-year long trial process,” Swift said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE.
“I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this. My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.”
Baldridge also gave a brief statement on the steps of the courthouse. “I think it's a new day, because someone with the guts and the courage to stand up with absolutely no upside in doing so — that being Taylor Swift — has told everyone, ‘This is it, the line's drawn.'”
The verdict came after an emotional day for Swift, who watched as Mueller's lawyer, Gabe McFarland, argued before an eight-person jury that her allegations of assault destroyed his client's career. When McFarland claimed that Mueller “is not the guy” who grabbed Swift's backside, the 27-year-old star shook her head and mouthed the word, “Wow.”
She became even more emotional when McFarland turned his attention to the photo taken during the alleged incident, which has become something of a smoking gun in this case.
“Is that the face of someone who's had someone grab their butt? Who is shocked?” he asked the jury. “There's nothing in Taylor Swift's face to suggest anything is wrong.” Meanwhile, Swift herself turned away from the public gallery towards her mother and dabbed tears from her eyes.
Swift regained her composure and leaned back in her chair as she listened to her attorney, Douglas Baldridge, deliver his statement, recalling Swift's Aug. 10 testimony during which she said: “I am not going to allow you or your client to make me feel like this is my fault, because it isn't.”
“To use Andrea Swift's words, I don't know whether to ‘vomit or cry' when I see a member of the bar subscribe to that re-victimization,” continued Baldridge.
Swift's lawyer also called Mueller's case a “game of chicken” where “victims are prone to blink rather than relive the shame and humiliation of what took place.” He also noted the token $1 Swift is seeking in damages, “the single value of which is immeasurable to all women in this situation.”
“It means no, and it tells every woman that they will determine what is tolerable to their body,” he added.
It was a trial filled with passionate rhetoric, often by Swift herself. The 27-year-old took the stand on Thursday, testifying for about an hour against Mueller.
“It was a definite grab, [a] very long grab,” Swift said in court. “It was long enough for me to be completely sure it was intentional.”
Afterwards, “a light switched off in my personality,” Swift said, and added that she “just looked at the floor. I couldn't look at either of them [Mueller or his girlfriend at the time, Shannon Melcher], and I just said in monotone, ‘Thanks for coming.'”
When Swift was asked about how she reacted upon learning about Mueller's termination, she said, “I didn't have a reaction to a strange person I didn't know losing his job…that was a product of his decisions, not mine.”
She continued: “I don't know anything about Mr. Mueller. I don't know him. I think what he did was despicable, horrifying, shocking, but I don't know him at all.”

McLEAN, Va. (AP) - It's an annual rite in Fairfax County, which has one of the wealthiest, best-educated populations in America: Hundreds of second-graders troop off to private psychologists for IQ tests to prove they're worthy of advanced academic programs in the public schools.
The competition is fierce. Acceptance, some parents believe, can be the key to getting into prestigious Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a magnet school that routinely sends graduates to the most competitive colleges.
"I guess I never made the cut," said Aaron Moorer, who is African-American and eventually graduated from Mount Vernon High with a 3.8 GPA. "I never made the special class."
Moorer's family wasn't aware that hundreds of families file appeals every year, armed with private exams costing more than $500, to persuade bureaucrats their child is deserving. This system exacerbates a problem plaguing gifted-and-talented programs across the nation: Black and Hispanic students almost never file the appeals that can secure their admission.
Using the Virginia Freedom of Information Act to obtain 10 years of county records, The Associated Press found that fewer than 50 black and Hispanic second-graders have filed successful appeals. That's less than 3 percent of the 1,737 second-graders admitted through the appeals process, further skewing a program already heavily weighted toward whites and Asians.
Fairfax County has the nation's 10th largest public school system, with more than 188,000 students. Of those, 25 percent are Hispanic and 10 percent are African-American. But over the last 10 years, blacks and Hispanics have constituted only 12 percent of the students deemed eligible for Level IV, the most advanced academic program.
Notably, the data show that when black and Hispanic students do submit intelligence tests, they are just as likely to gain admission as their white and Asian counterparts. The problem is that black and Hispanic students only rarely submit appeals.
Francisco Duran, the school system's chief academic and equity officer, downplayed the disparities in the appeals process, citing successful efforts to enroll more black and Hispanic students through teacher referrals and other means. But he acknowledged that the school system is not where it wants to be in terms of identifying students at an early age who have the potential for advanced academics.
"We want it to be so that we don't have a need for an appeals process," Duran said.
Looking back, Moorer is sure he could have handled more advanced classes if given the opportunity.
"Not being included in the academic program kind of left me feeling unchallenged. I was able to get straight A's but I was often left bored in class. I felt somewhat envious to know that many of the friends that I had in those classes were learning at a more advanced level," said Moorer, now an undergrad at Hampden-Sydney College. He also was accepted at James Madison University but was waitlisted at Virginia Tech and turned down by University of North Carolina.
For talented students, the stakes are high: Children in Level IV, the highest and most competitive, can be assigned to schools with concentrated numbers of gifted students, providing what many parents feel is a more robust learning environment. Lower levels, offered in neighborhood schools, may include occasional enrichment projects, outside classwork and advanced reading assignments.
The appeals culture in Fairfax is so prevalent that nearby George Mason University has graduate psychology students learn their trade by administering the tests. Ellen Rowe, the Cognitive Assessment Program's director, said sliding-scale fees make testing accessible to low-income families, but "we don't control who comes to us."
Even the lucky ones can sense the injustice. Mark Biear of Vienna, who is white, has two kids in Level IV, one of whom successfully appealed. He found that some parents discussed the process openly, while others seemed reluctant to share information might give another family an advantage.
"I wish it was more transparent," said Biear.
Jonathan Plucker, president of the National Association for Gifted Children, said Fairfax County's system "feels pretty extraordinary, but it doesn't surprise me." Wealthy, suburban districts often face intense parental demand for gifted programs, he said.
Plucker applauds the placement testing for all second-graders, but says allowing hundreds of parents to spend hundreds of dollars for a second IQ test defeats the purpose. "Why add a second level to the process that just reintroduces the disparities you're seeking to get rid of in the first place?" he asks.
Carol Horn, who ran the advanced academic program for Fairfax County Public Schools until her recent retirement, acknowledged the enrollment gap. She noted that some form of appeals process is required by the state. She initiated Young Scholars, an effort to enroll and support more minorities in advanced classes, and encouraged teachers to send more kids of color her way, which has led to more diversity.
"If parents don't know about the program, teachers become the advocate for the children," Horn said.
It's not just that appeals are costly, said Tina Hone, who advocated for minority students when she was a Fairfax County school board member. Some black and Hispanic families may be less interested in advanced placement when it means moving a child out of neighborhood school where specialized education isn't offered, she said.
"It's about cultural norms," said Hone, who is African-American. "It's not just about money."
Katherine Cespedes said teachers didn't encourage her to pursue advanced academics after she arrived in Virginia from Argentina at age 7. She said they initially focused more on developing her English-language skills.
"I don't think my teacher believed I was capable back then," Cespedes said. Only after an English teacher at Falls Church High School took interest in her did she push herself to take honors courses, graduating with a 3.5 GPA and earning a scholarship for George Mason University.
There are just a few dozen black students at Thomas Jefferson, where sophomore Alina Ampeh is surrounded by whites and Asians - a situation she's lived with since elementary school. She's grateful that all those years of advanced classes prepared her for TJ's rigorous academics, but says that doesn't necessarily make her special: She thinks many of her classmates simply have parents who worked the system. "If you want to get in, you just complain about it," she said.
Alina's mother, Karen Ampeh, also is grateful, but disappointed that so few African-Americans have benefited from such high-quality instruction.
"In my experience, the AAP program is for students who are pushed by their parents, or possibly other adults, to be in the program," she said. "It is not a welcome environment for black students unless they have a lot of support from home."

Elie Saab never fails each time to have us gasping in awe at the beauty of his work. This year, he took it even further with the interesting theme "Of Forms and Light" at his show in Paris fashion week. He translated Barcelona's artfulness through the use of figure hugging and dramatic designs. His interpretation of light came through the use of reflective and shiny textures which added an even more artsy touch to the beautiful pieces on the runway. He also used a lot of ruffles around the chest and shoulder area.
If you're as enchanted by his designs as we are, we suggest watching this video to take a look at how the designs and fabrics flow and move on the runway. Then, scroll down to take a look at our some of our favorite looks from Elie Saab's F/W 2018 Haute Couture collection and save them for inspiration.

Black people are the least successful people in the world. According to research, in the USA white people are five times richer than black people. In the UK alone, half of young black males are unemployed. In Africa, poverty is the continent's middle name. Yes, white people and racism can be blamed here and there for the suffering of the black people, but the truth is most of the suffering of the black race is self-inflicted. Black people refuse to think for themselves.
One of the greatest gifts God gave to mankind is the ability to think critically but sadly, black people refuses to do this, always needing a “man of God” to think for them. Donald Trump is reported to have said black people are lazy, I think what he meant was that black people are cognitively lazy. It's not a racist statement, it's brutal truth.
Being the poorest people in the world, yet the most religious, believing that God should somehow miraculously bless them with wealth by going to church and yet they will always remain in poverty. Not long ago I was also part of the black circus of religion. Being in a black Pentecostal church made me completely retarded as I was no longer able to use my God-given mind to think for myself. I entered the church building with money and left it there thinking that would give me a breakthrough.
Today I watch in sadness as millions of my black brothers and sisters abandon their minds in the name of Church/God. As we are entering into the New Year, black people will be flocking to churches on 31st December for All Night Services dubbed The Crossovers leaving churches at early hours of the morning on New Years Day. Most of these Crossover services have nothing to do with the salvation of soul or seeking the face of God but rather claiming financial breakthroughs and miracles.
The Black Pastors, Spiritual Fathers and “Prophets” will be making the most of New Year's Eve. For them, New Year is a time to make more millions as they tell their gullible followers to sow seeds so that they will be blessed in 2017.
They will be telling single women that they will be getting married in 2017. People will be promised big breakthroughs, cars, houses, businesses, promotions etc. Everyone will be all hyped up at these freaky Crossover services.
Now the sad thing is these gullible followers were promised the very same thing the previous year. They were also told that 2016 was their year but at end of the year, they are exactly the same as they were the previous year, and the year after. No breakthroughs! No miracles! But they will still go again this New Years Eve for some fresh “anointing”. Is this not some mental illness?
In the UK prosperity false prophet, Uebert Angel has resorted to having Porn Star Ray J as his guest of honor at his CrossOver all night service just to pull the crowds. Ray J is the Black American who made Kim Kardashian rich and famous (through a sex tape) whilst being the loser in the end. Now Uebert Angel thinks it's something worth bragging about that Ray J will be a guest of honor at his Crossover night service.
Zimbabwe probably has the highest population of prosperity “prophets” in Africa even though it is now the second poorest country in the world. The poverty stricken people of Zimbabwe are obsessed with false prophets and spiritual Fathers.
Zimbabwe's biggest Spiritual Father Ezekiel Guti has promised his millions of followers that 2017 is the year of “Having and not giving back what you already have”, whatever that means. False Prophet Walter Magaya will be holding his own Crossover Night where he is promising his blind followers prosperity.
Another Zimbabwean False Prophet Eugene Makore who is always bragging on Facebook about his flashy cars has asked people to sow a seed (money) so that they receive their 2017 breakthroughs. The breakthroughs even come in packages, gold, silver, bronze, and platinum. These packages are according to how much money you give off course. With the platinum package, you get a chance to speak to Eugene Makore directly on the phone, which is supposed to be a “blessing”.
If you think Eugene Makore is barking mad, wait for this. Father of all false prophets in Africa Emmanuel Makandiwa is also doing a massive New Year Cross Over service for 2017 where he is promising even bigger financial miracles and breakthroughs. The gullible followers are being told to pay as much as $7000 for bigger blessings.
Emmanuel Makandiwa is the spiritual son of TB Joshua who was humiliated in November 2016 after giving a false prophecy that Hillary Clinton would win the USA presidential elections. If Zimbabweans are able to make these “Men of God” millionaires, why then do they blame Robert Mugabe for poverty.
Below is a shocking video of a worker of Emmanuel Makandiwa asking people to give money for 2017 breakthroughs.
Zimbabwean Makosi Musambasi who shot to fame in 2006 after entering Big Brother UK now resides in Nigeria where she is now a teacher of the bible. She often tells people that if you don't tithe (giving money in church) you will die poor. She will also be attending an all night Crossover Service by Nigerian Bishop Abioye where people are expected to bring empty bottles and be given “anointing oil” by their prophet.
As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, white people are more successful financially than black people simply because they use their brains, its that simple. God doesn't grant you success because you have paid money in church or fasted. Mark Zuckerberg didn't pray and fast to become a billionaire, he simply used his intelligence and added hard work to it. No Papa had to lay his hands on him to invent Facebook.
So for those single women who have been promised husbands by their “prophets”, forget what Papa has said and just get out more, and maybe stop putting too much makeup that you are barely recognisable, and surely you will meet someone. For those who want financial breakthroughs, work hard, be innovative and maybe use your God given talents to get to your destiny. You don't need special anointing oil from a “Prophet” to be successful.
2017 will just like any other year. You make it special by your own efforts. It won't be a year of breakthroughs or whatever stupid themes your “prophets” promises you.
Until black people are able to think for themselves, work hard, identify opportunities, take a risk in entering into new areas, they will continue to be impoverished hence a nitch market for self-styled prophets to be richer.
For 2017 start by celebrating New Year in your own houses. Stop this New Year Cross-Over madness. You will save yourself a lot of money that you will surely need throughout the month of January as you recover from Christmas spending. Happy New Year my readers!

Two Israeli nano-satellites were successfully launched into space from India at 6am Wednesday, using a launcher from the Indian Space Research Organization.
The new nano-satellites are the size of milk cartons, allowing Israeli researchers better navigation and easy information access.
One of the satellites belongs to Ben Gurion University and will provide Israel with high-resolution photos. The BGUSAT is equipped with cameras able to detect climate trends and changes, and has a small chip allowing it to function like a larger satellite. The BGUSAT weighs 11 pounds (5 kg).
The second satellite belongs to SpacePharma, the Israeli company which first developed nano-satellites. This satellite has a mini-lab on board which conducts four experiments, some of which investigate the effect of zero gravity on different substances. The experiments are controlled by the researchers via a direct application on their smartphones. The automatic system allows the researchers to change the experiments as necessary, as well as receive data on radiation, temperature, and more. The SpacePharma satellite weights 9.92 lbs (4.5 kg) and is equipped with a camera which can take microscopic pictures.
A record 101 other satellites from around the globe left the same launcher together with the Israeli satellites. All of the satellites entered an orbit 310.75 miles (500 kilometers) high within minutes after launch.
88 of the other satellites launched on the PSLV launcher belong to a US company, three of them belong to India, and the others belong to Kazakhstan, Holland, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.
Launched together, the 102 satellites weighed 1,378 kilograms. India's three satellites were released at a lower orbit, but the other 97 will orbit together with the Israeli satellites at a height of 310.75 miles (500 kilometers) from Earth.
The launcher traveled at a speed of 16780.6 mph (27,000 km per hour), which is forty times faster than the average airplane.
The Israeli satellites will serve researchers from Israel and around the world, providing information for climate research and medicine. Science, Technology and Space Minister Ofir Akunis (Likud) said, "We are proud to see how Israeli research has launched. We are proud of the Israeli researchers who developed these two small satellites, which will help us advance medical and environmental research for the sake of all humanity."

Carrying on their daughter's passion for dancing has always been at the forefront of Glennys and Gary Woods's minds after she died in a tragic accident.
So setting up St Wilfrid's Dance Group in Preston was a natural tribute to their beloved Wendy.
St Wilfrids Dance Group in Preston
The couple founded the group in 1991, a year after 10-year-old Wendy died when her coat got caught in the doors of a bus on her way home from a dance class in Preston.
Glennys says: “It is our way of making good come from tragedy. Wendy's accident happened the week before Christmas in 1990. It was dreadful.
“So we set up the dance class in her memory and we run it for a charity.
“We donate our time for free. Our dancers pay £2 per session and when we have £1,000 saved, we split it between two charities.
Wendy Woods, who died in December 1990
“Wendy loved dancing. She was very talented and could have gone to the top. She was a member of a ballroom dancing class in Avenham Street, Preston.”
Dancing has always been a part of Glennys and Gary's lives - and it was something they introduced their two children to.
They were contemporaries of Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas and her husband Corky, who ended up training Wendy.
Glennys, who has three grandchildren, adds: “We were on the dance scene with Shirley Ballas and her husband Corky who used to train the formation team at Avenham Street. As a result, he did dance demonstrations and trained Wendy, as well as my other son, Gary.
“We used to compete in the dance formation at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom and when Shirley and Corky competed, we used to keep an eye on his son, Mark, who is now a professional dancer on Dancing with the Stars.
“Shirley and Corky were both lovely.
“I have always enjoyed dancing. I have danced since I was a little girl. My mum sent me to dance lessons and so that is why I put my own children into classes.”
The couple's passion for dancing now inspires others once a week at St Wilfrid's Parish Centre, Chapel Street, Preston.
The dance sessions also raise funds for charities. Their latest drive sees them donate £500 each to Rosemere Cancer Foundation's 20 Years Anniversary Appeal and Donna's Dream House in Blackpool, which provides holiday experiences for youngsters with life-threatening illnesses and for recently bereaved families.
Glennys, who through the group has donated many thousands of pounds to primarily local causes over the years, adds: “We do a bit of everything – ballroom, Latin and American.
“We have a great time. And the fact we are able to donate the dance fees to great causes makes it so much better.
“I think Wendy would have been proud. We have met so many lovely people through our fund-raising.
“Every year we let the members chose the charities. They write a charity on a piece of paper and we pick two. In the past we have donated to the Salvation Army, St Catherine's Hospice and Hearing Dogs for the Deaf.
“We have now donated £500 to Rosemere Cancer Foundation's 20 Years Anniversary Appeal and Donna's Dream House in Blackpool.”
The group meets every Wednesday evening from 7.30pm to 9.30pm in St Wilfrid's Parish Centre, Chapel Street.
Glennys adds: “Our dance group is open to everyone, including absolute beginners and those with two left feet.”
The always-on hyper-connected world we live in brings with it huge potential, some of it good and some of it bad
The always-on hyper-connected world we live in brings with it huge potential, some of it good and some of it bad. The age of hyper-connectivity has enabled the Internet of Things (IoT) to succeed, which promises more personalised and automated services, optimised resource utilisation and added convenience, but have we ignored the risks and merely focused on the hype?
The number of connected devices has grown at an unprecedented rate with current estimates at between 6-12 billion devices. This number seems enormous but if you doubt it, I suggest you login into your home router and look at how many devices are registered – you may be surprised when you see your TVs, amplifiers and heating thermostats featuring on the list.
We already have cars that can drive themselves and buildings that can configure their environmental control systems based on your presence. The amount of machine-to-machine communication going on around us is growing all the time, but in many cases, we haven't considered ‘security' to be part of our buying or implementation processes.
IoT devices, by their very nature, must be easy to deploy and use, but we should not forget that these devices are just small computers. How many of us would plug a computer straight into the Internet using the (old) original, un-patched version of an OS, with no firewall or security devices to protect it, using the default username and password? Not many, but this is what is happening in many cases with IoT devices.
Emerging threats
2016 brought the darker side of the connected world more sharply into focus, with the proliferation of botnets, and weaponised DDoS services, based on IoT devices. If we think back to the early noughties DDoS attacks were often generated by large botnets of compromised end-user's workstations, because of multiple vulnerabilities and a lack of security awareness.
Cyber-criminals have realised that IoT devices offer a significant capability, just waiting to be exploited in a similar way, and we all saw how thousands of relatively small, innocuous CCTV cameras and DVRs could be leveraged to generate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks at 500Gbps or greater, affecting the availability of Internet services from many well-known Internet brands.
Many IoT devices have good connectivity on unmonitored network segments, and enough processing capability to drive a significant volume of DDoS attack traffic. Attacks from these devices are responsible for some of the increased scale and frequency of DDoS activity reported in Arbor Networks' annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR). And, DDoS is just one use-case for compromised IoT devices – more on that later….
The layered defence strategy
Compromised IoT devices offer attackers a new way to threaten the availability of the Internet services we use, but the best way to protect our businesses has stayed the same. Most businesses today are reliant on the data and application services they utilise via the Internet, and availability issues can be very costly. To combat today's DDoS threat, businesses and governments alike need to implement a multilayer DDoS protection strategy.
Multi-layered defences incorporate both an on-premise and cloud or ISP-based component. The on-premise component allows businesses to detect and mitigate attacks immediately, before there is any service impact. However, the on-premise solution can't deal with increasingly common, large attacks that can saturate Internet connectivity, and this is where the cloud or ISP-based service steps in – to deal with the higher magnitude attacks. The good news is that many more enterprises are adopting layered defence. Arbor's WISR showed that 30% of enterprise organisations had adopted this model in 2016, up from 23% in 2015. &
Putting the right defences in place does require investment, and there are many competing priorities in businesses for both IT and security budget. But given the dependence most businesses now have on connectivity for interaction with customers, partners and suppliers, these kinds of defences are essential. Incorporating availability threats into business and IT risk assessment processes can help to quantify the potential impact of a DDoS attack, helping to prioritise investment, and the WISR report shows that around two-thirds of enterprises have now taken this step.
The tip of the iceberg
The combination of DDoS and IoT devices will undoubtedly continue to make the news headlines in the latter part of 2017, as we see even larger attacks causing problems for both service providers and enterprises. However, DDoS is only one of the ways in which IoT devices can be exploited. We are already seeing compromised IoT devices being used as proxies to obfuscate the original source of traffic. And, if you are thinking that the risk to IoT is limited to those devices that are exposed to the Internet – think again.
Windows malware that looks to scan local networks for IoT devices to infect is already a reality. This would allow attackers to gain a foothold within a network, using our IoT devices, so that they could then move on to target other resources inside or outside of our networks.
The hyperconnected world provides us with some amazing opportunities, mostly positive, but some negative, such as the use of IoT devices to amplify existing threats and create new ones. One thing we can all do is try to avoid becoming a part of the problem, and the solution here is simply to implement good IT security hygiene when we deploy IoT devices.
Improving the security of IoT devices and preventing their compromise are key goals of the security industry and the manufacturers of these devices, but until that is done, and it may take some time, everyone needs to protect themselves from the threats we know that are out there, and DDoS is a significant and growing threat.
Tim Murphy is the Australian country manager for Arbor Networks.
The article is adapted from Musk's presentation at the International Astronautical Congress and begins with an argument for why we should focus on Mars for our move towards interplanetary life. Musk then notes that with current technologies, a ticket to Mars would cost around $10 billion, which he correctly deduces is a prohibitive amount if we want to actually colonize another planet.
Getting that cost down to the median price of a house -- around $200,000 -- is key to making the Mars plan viable, says Musk. And he outlines four essential steps that will need to be taken if there's any hope of doing that. First, the transportation would have to be fully reusable because any amount of waste would significantly increase the cost. And ships would need to be refilled while in orbit. Additionally, we would need to be able to produce propellant on Mars and it would have to be optimized for cost, reusability, and easy production -- Musk proposes methane.
Musk then proceeds to detail the proposed engine, rocket booster and ship as well as how many ships we would need and how many people each one should be able to carry. For the crew compartment Musk says, "There will be movies, lecture halls, cabins, and a restaurant. It will be really fun to go. You are going to have a great time!"
Musk sketches a rough timeline for these events, but keeps it purposefully vague. It's clear, however, that this is something he's actively working towards. The fifteen-page journal article is not quite what you expect to see in a peer-reviewed journal -- there are some humorously unnecessary venn diagrams and a few tables that are nothing more than bullet points. But it's a much more flushed out write-up than we usually get from Musk. To see the presentation the article is based on, check out the video below.
Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S8 is one of the worst-kept secrets in the smartphone business. And now Samsung has itself to blame for a new leak.
The company on Monday published a support page to its site citing the model number, the SM-G955FD. While the page was taken down soon after, eagle-eyed observers noted that the page referred to a Galaxy S8 Plus, and not just a Galaxy S8.

Several S8 rumors have cropped up over the last few months that suggest that Samsung is planning to change its Galaxy S8 branding. The company in the past used two names to describe its devices based on their size and features. The Galaxy S7 line, for instance, featured a Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. The latter featured a curved display, thus the "edge" name.
However, several reports say that Samsung is planning to nix differentiating branding altogether and simply go with Galaxy S8. If the support page is any indication, though, Samsung appears to be planning to use Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus to describe its devices.
MORE: iPhone 8 vs. Galaxy S8: Clash of the Titans
Samsung is rumored to be planning a curved display in both Galaxy S8 models, thus the reported decision to remove the "edge" branding. However, one Galaxy S8 model is expected to come with a screen size up to 6.2 inches. That would likely be the Plus version, firmly pitting its bigger device against Apple's iPhone 7, which also comes in a Plus model.
In addition to screen size, we've heard (and seen) a slew of Galaxy S8 rumors of late, including reports that it will be the first smartphone to ship with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. The device is also expected to nix the home button and instead rely on a virtual home button. The front of the Galaxy S8 could be nearly entirely covered by a screen. Last but not least is a new Bixby virtual assistant that will take on Siri and have a dedicated launch button on the side of the phone.
Samsung has of course kept its plans close to the vest, but did say that it won't unveil the device at Mobile World Congress later this month. Instead, the company is rumored to be planning a late-March unveiling followed by a mid-April launch.
We'll be there to cover every last detail.

OAKLAND, Calif. — Tampa Bay right-hander Nathan Eovaldi has not allowed a hit through six innings against Oakland in his first start since having a second Tommy John surgery.
Eovaldi has four strikeouts and 70 pitches. The only hitter to reach so far is Matt Chapman, who drew a one-out walk in the first inning.
Rays centre fielder Johnny Field made a diving catch on a sinking liner from Mark Canha in the third. Right fielder Carlos Gomez made a similar play to take a potential hit away from Chad Pinder in the sixth.
Eovaldi last pitched in the majors on Aug. 10, 2016, for the Yankees. Nine days later, he underwent a second elbow surgery. Eovaldi also had Tommy John surgery in 2007 when he was a junior in high school.
Kyle Larson led the way in opening practice for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Friday at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Larson's time of 28.113 seconds (192.082 MPH) was 0.094 seconds ahead of Ryan Newman as he seeks the Bank of America 500 pole. Larson, a four-time 2017 winner has yet to reach Victory Lane in this year's NASCAR playoffs.
Fellow title contenders Kevin Harvick, Denny Hamlin, and Chase Elliott completed the top-five drivers in practice. Hamlin was the lone Toyota on the board after the first three NASCAR playoff races have been dominated by the Camry contingent.
Though the 90-minute session went well for these men, some didn't have it so smooth, especially in Turn 4.
The trouble started quickly when Dale Earnhardt Jr. slapped the wall in the opening minutes of the day. The No. 88 driver went to a backup car, returning to the track to complete eight laps.
Earnhardt said the contact was caused by the PJ1 substance put down in the corners.
“It's had a bad reaction to the sun. It's really slick,” Earnhardt said. “We saw at Bristol that it takes some heat to work in and activate to create grip. We've never seen it like this. It went straight into the fence, no stopping it.”
With the Bank of America 500 being run on Sunday, during the daytime, Earnhardt is “a little concerned” by the substance.
“This was a race I was excited about,” he said. “It's the first Charlotte race planned to be in the daytime [in many years]… I think it will go well. Hopefully, that stuff will activate.”
Earnhardt was just the first of several drivers to have problems. David Ragan joined the fray when he hit the wall off Turn 4 while Kyle Busch pancaked the same area late in the session.
Brad Keselowski looked to suffer even further damage when he spun his No. 2 Ford in between turns 3 and 4. However, a drift spin kept him from significant damage, only brushing the wall.
Ryan Blaney finished the session sixth quickest while Martin Truex Jr., Michael McDowell, Jamie McMurray, and Kurt Busch completed the top 10.
All-Star forward Kevin Love will return to the Cleveland Cavaliers' lineup for Monday night's game against Milwaukee after missing 21 games with a broken left hand.
Love suffered the injury in a Jan. 30 loss at Detroit. The initial timetable for Love, who underwent minor knee surgery on Feb. 14, causing him to miss the All-Star Game five days later, was for him to be out two months.
Love, who underwent surgery on the same hand in October 2009, was averaging 17.9 points, 9.4 rebounds and shooting 40 percent on 3-pointers before being injured.
Scientists Unveil Our Ancient Ancestor 'Little Foot'
Researchers in South Africa have unveiled what they call "by far the most complete skeleton of a human ancestor older than 1.5 million years ever found."
The University of the Witwatersrand displayed the virtually complete Australopithecus fossil on Wednesday.
The skeleton dates back 3.6 million years. Its discovery is expected to help researchers better understand the human ancestor's appearance and movement.
The researchers say it has taken 20 years to excavate, clean, reconstruct and analyze the fragile skeleton.
The skeleton, dubbed Little Foot, was discovered in the Sterkfontein caves, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Johannesburg when small foot bones were found in rock blasted by miners.
Professor Ron Clarke and his assistants found the fossils and spent years to excavate, clean, analyze and reconstruct the skeleton.
The discovery is a source of pride for Africans, said Robert Blumenschine, chief scientist with the organization that funded the excavation, the Paleontological Scientific Trust (PAST).
"Not only is Africa the storehouse of the ancient fossil heritage for people the world over, it was also the wellspring of everything that makes us human, including our technological prowess, our artistic ability and our supreme intellect," said Blumenschine.
Adam Habib, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Witswatersrand, hailed the assembly of the full skeleton.
"This is a landmark achievement for the global scientific community and South Africa's heritage," said Habib. "It is through important discoveries like Little Foot that we obtain a glimpse into our past which helps us to better understand our common humanity."

MIAMI (AP) — Tens of thousands of Cubans living in the U.S. are adapting to a harsh new reality: After enjoying decades of favored status dating back to the Cold War, many of them now face the same deportation risks as any other immigrants.
They feel betrayed by former President Barack Obama's administration, which in its waning days stripped away a nearly automatic path to citizenship that had been offered since the 1960s to Cubans who arrived on U.S. soil, even those who showed up without a visa. The change was part of a thaw in relations with Cuba, which also agreed to start accepting the return of more of its people who get deported.
Now some Cubans have been detained at routine appointments with immigration officials, and many more fear they could be imperiled by old deportation orders or caught up in the increased arrests of non-citizens pursued by President Donald Trump's administration.
"I wasn't prepared for any of this. How could I have seen this coming?" said Maykel Vargas, a Cuban who spent three months in detention after immigration officials took him into custody when he was trying to renew a temporary document. "I don't know what is going to happen."
Anticipation is mounting about a White House announcement on Cuba planned for Friday and how it may affect business deals and leisure travel. But experts agree that Trump's new policy is not expected to restore previous immigration privileges. Any changes open the possibility that the Cuban government could scale back commitments on migration agreements, including promises to take back deportees.
Vargas, 37, worked as an Uber and Lyft driver to provide for his sister, who is single and pregnant. He said he couldn't afford the $700 required to apply for permanent residency, a much more complex process. He continues fighting deportation after being released Monday with an ankle monitor.
Hermes Vigoa, 46, wasn't even nervous when he showed up at an immigration office in Miami earlier this year to renew a temporary document he needed for his driver's license and car insurance while he completed the permanent-residency process.
He arrived in the U.S. two years before Obama canceled to fast-track citizenship system. Cubans still have a path to residency if they find a way to arrive in the U.S. with a visa, but Obama ended the open-arms treatment to curb a recent immigration surge mostly through the Mexico border.
"I thought everything was fine until an officer told me, 'You are in limbo' and told my girlfriend to take all my stuff because I was being detained," Vigoa said. He was detained for a month before he was released, without explanation, to continue seeking a green card.
Immigration officials did not respond to requests for information on these cases.
Officials say more than 36,000 Cubans currently face deportation orders. About 29,000 are convicted criminals and 7,000 non-criminal immigration violators, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Two other Cubans who were taken into custody last month after being here for decades are getting the attention of elected officials. They arrived as children in the famous Mariel boatlift in 1980, when Cuba's then-President Fidel Castro allowed the departure of anyone who wanted to leave the Communist nation. About 125,000 "marielitos" crossed the Florida Straits that year.
Both men have criminal convictions but insist they have turned their lives around.
In 1984, the nations agreed on a list of 2,746 Cubans who were alleged criminals and could be returned to the island. When the U.S. abandoned the "wet foot, dry foot" policy in January, the two nations agreed that the list could be revised to add other Cuban "marielitos" who were subject to active deportation orders.
Rudy Blanco was 8 when he was brought from the port of Mariel by his parents in 1980. He now has a family and owns a home-remodeling business in Perry, Florida. But because he was convicted of attempting to sell cocaine in 1998, he wasn't allowed to become a U.S. citizen and instead received an order of deportation by mail in 2005.
Blanco was allowed to stay as long as he made routine visits to ICE. However, he was arrested on May 9 and is now awaiting deportation. An ICE spokeswoman said only that the agency intends to deport him based on the 2005 order.
Blanco's wife, Shelly, said that both Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and the family's congressman, Rep. Neal Dunn, have told her they are trying to gather information on the case. Both men are Republicans.
Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, pardoned another Cuban immigrant for an armed robbery committed 19 years ago, in an effort to stave off his deportation. Rene Lima-Marin, 38, arrived as a toddler in the boatlift and 20 years later received a deportation order after his conviction.
Apart from the Mariel list, Cuba has agreed to review deportations on a case-by-case basis. Fifty-seven Cubans have been deported since October, while 335 were arrested between Jan. 22 and April 29.
Susan Eckstein, a sociology professor at Boston University, argues that Cubans' immigration privileges should end to make immigration policy more equitable for all foreign nationals.
"I would be very surprised if Trump changes Obama's policy because it is so consistent with his stance on immigration in general," she said.
KINGSPORT — Two Lady Indians put the pen to paper this afternoon when Lauren Salyer signed with Emory & Henry.
Salyer tore her ACL in Dobyns-Bennett's first game of the season, but the Wasps liked what they had seen in her previous years, dropping 662 careers points with 353 rebounds.
Her teammate Sydney breeding signed with Milligan College. Breeding tore her ACL last summer, but was able to comeback and play the second half of her senior year.
Breeding dropped 438 career points with 230 assists, she also holds the team's single game assist record with 13 in her junior year against Cleveland.
B&C Tikka T3 fit Hey guys, first of all, I love my b&c medalist on my t3. However, I have noticed that there seems to be a lot of contact at the tang with the fiberglass material of the stock. The area I'm referring to is right behind the rear action screw. It's hard for me to tell, but I find it hard to believe that the action is even making contact with the aluminum bedding block at the rear action screw like it's supposed to. I definitely can't slide paper under the tang. My initial thought was to dremel until I can get paper under it. But wanted to run it by you guys first. Also was curious if anybody with same setup had the same issue.
Thanks

Querrey hadn't even won a single match at Roland Garros since 2014 until beating Frances Tiafoe in the first round.
Querrey has been as far as the third round in Paris just once in 12 appearances.

A young American man trying an underhanded serve while cramping during a five-setter at the French Open. Hmmmm. Seen that before, haven't we? Except, unlike for 1989 champion Michael Chang, the unusual strategy didn't help result in a victory for Jared Donaldson against Grigor Dimitrov.
The fourth-seeded Dimitrov came back to beat the 21-year-old Donaldson 6-7 (2), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 10-8 in a second-round marathon that lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes on Court 18 at Roland Garros.
When it ended, Dimitrov leaned forward while raising each knee to give it a kiss — perhaps thanking his legs for carrying him to the win while Donaldson's gave way.
Donaldson, who is ranked 57th, was actually two points from winning when he led 6-5 in the fifth and got to love-30 on Dimitrov's serve. But Dimitrov took the next four points to hold for 6-all.
Dimitrov broke to lead 8-7 and served for the victory, but Donaldson broke right back.
In the next game, though, Donaldson could barely stand, let alone move well.
He double-faulted. Then he tried an underhand serve — not his first of the match, either — and lost the point.
Dimitrov hit a winner to break for a 9-8 edge, Donaldson slowly limped to the sideline for the changeover, and soon enough, it was over.
Chang famously used an underhand service motion while cramping during a fourth-round win against Ivan Lendl on the way to the French Open title 29 years ago.

Kei Nishikori has rallied past local favourite Benoit Paire to reach the third round of the French Open for the fourth consecutive year.
The 19th-seeded Japanese player needed nearly three hours on Court Philippe Chatrier to win 6-3, 2-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 against the Frenchman.
"He was attacking every shot," Nishikori said. "He has one of the best touches on the Tour, it was fun to play him and also a difficult match today."

Second-seeded Alexander Zverev trailed by a set and a break — and was down a broken racket, too — before eventually collecting himself and coming back to beat 60th-ranked Dusan Lajovic of Serbia 2-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 in the French Open's second round.
Zverev equaled his best showing at Roland Garros; he also reached the third round two years ago.
If the 21-year-old German is going to get to the round of 16 he'll need to do something he never has at a Grand Slam tournament: defeat a player ranked in the top 50. Zverev's next match comes against 26th-seeded Damir Dzumhur.
Lajovic lost his eighth consecutive match that stretched to five sets.

Serena and Venus Williams have won their first Grand Slam doubles match in nearly two years.
The sisters moved into the second round of the French Open by coming back for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over the 14th-seeded Japanese pairing of Shuko Aoyama and Miyu Kato in front of a Court 3 crowd that raucously supported the Americans.
The Williams-Williams duo last competed at a major tournament together at Wimbledon in 2016. They won their 14th Grand Slam title in women's doubles at the England Club.
This return to doubles came a day after Serena Williams participated in Grand Slam singles for the first time in 16 months, winning her first-round match at Roland Garros. Venus Williams lost in the first round of singles on Sunday.

Jeremy Chardy first wasted a two-set lead and then bounced back to beat 17th-seeded Tomas Berdych to reach the second round of the French Open.
Chardy led by two sets when their match was stopped by darkness on Tuesday, but Berdych mounted a comeback when they returned. Chardy played well in the decider and broke Berdych twice to advance with a 7-6 (5), 7-6 (8), 1-6, 5-7, 6-2 win.
"At two sets all, it was difficult in my head, and physically, too," said Chardy, who had never beaten Berdych in five previous matches. "I fought hard, all my body was shaking."

Former French Open champion Novak Djokovic posted another straight-set win to reach the third round of the clay-court tournament.
Facing Spanish qualifier Jaume Munar, the Serb delivered a solid display to prevail 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-4 and move into the third round for the 13th time.
Djokovic, who underwent right elbow surgery earlier this year, is the 20th-seeded player in Paris, his lowest Grand Slam seeding since the 2006 U.S. Open.

The Williams sisters are back in Grand Slam doubles action for the first time in nearly two years.
A day after Serena Williams made her return to singles play at a major following a 16-month absence, winning her first-round match at the French Open, she is out on Court 3 at Roland Garros alongside her older sister, Venus.
They are facing the 14th-seeded pairing of Shuko Aoyama and Miyu Kato of Japan.
The American siblings, owners of 14 Grand Slam doubles titles, received a wild-card entry. They haven't played doubles together at a major since winning Wimbledon in 2016.
Serena Williams hadn't competed at any Grand Slam tournament since the Australian Open in January 2017. She gave birth to a daughter last September.

Marco Trungelliti's long, strange trip as a French Open "lucky loser" has come to an end with a second-round exit.
Trungelliti is the 190th-ranked Argentine who headed home to Barcelona after losing in qualifying at Roland Garros, then drew headlines for making the 10-hour, 650-mile (1,000-kilometre) drive back to Paris in a rental car with his 88-year-old grandmother, mother and brother once he found out he could get into the main draw.
He then won his first-round match.
But Trungelliti was beaten Wednesday by 72nd-ranked Marco Cecchinato of Italy 6-1, 7-6 (1), 6-1 in a match that lasted just under 2 hours.
Still, Trungelliti leaves with 79,000 euros (about $90,000) in prize money — and a great story to tell.

Top-ranked Simona Halep put aside a terrible start and came back to claim 12 of the last 14 games, beating 83rd-ranked Alison Riske of the United States 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 to reach the second round of the French Open.
It was the last match of the tournament's opening round.
Halep, the runner-up at Roland Garros in 2014 and a year ago, played poorly in the first set, with only four winners and 16 unforced errors. But she had 16 winners and 12 unforced errors the rest of the way, while Riske made more and more mistakes.

Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova is through to the third round of the French Open, making light work of 91st-ranked Lara Arruabarrena of Spain in a 6-0, 6-4 win on Court 1.
The eighth-seeded Kvitova lost in the second round last year when she was coming back to the tour after a knife attack in her home in 2016 that left her needing surgery on her left hand, her playing hand.
The Czech player made the semifinals at Roland Garros in 2012.

Simona Halep has turned things around in her first-round match at the French Open and is headed to a third set against 83rd-ranked Alison Riske of the United States.
After dropping the first set 6-2 at Court Philippe Chatrier, Halep grabbed 19 of the first 22 points en route to a 5-0 lead in the second, which she eventually took 6-1.
Halep, the runner-up at Roland Garros in 2014 and a year ago, cleaned up her game in the second set, with only five unforced errors after making 16 in the opener. Riske, meanwhile, had only two winners and 12 unforced errors in the second set.

12 p.m.
Top-seeded Simona Halep is in trouble in her weather-delayed first-round match at the French Open, losing the first set 6-2 to 83rd-ranked Alison Riske of the United States.
Riske raced to a 5-0 lead and then broke Halep again in the eighth game to take the set.
In their only previous meeting on clay, in Rome in 2015, Halep dropped only three games in a 6-3, 6-0 victory. But Riske is giving the Romanian a far tougher test this time.
___
11:20 a.m.
Play is underway on Day 4 of the French Open, with top-seeded Simona Halep facing 83rd-ranked Alison Riske of the United States in the last remaining match of the women's first round.
The encounter on Court Philippe-Chatrier was postponed from Tuesday amid gathering evening storms.
Halep, a two-time finalist at Roland Garros, needs to reach the semifinals or better this year to have a chance of holding onto her No. 1 ranking. She won both of her previous matches against Riske.
On the men's side, 2016 champion Novak Djokovic will face qualifier Jaume Munar of Spain in the second round.
The second-seeded players in both the men's and women's draws, Alexander Zverev and Caroline Wozniacki, will also be in action.

BERLIN (AP) — Police say a burning bird falling from an overhead electric line set fire to a field in northern Germany that was parched by dry weather, torching some 7 hectares (17 acres) of land.
Police in the Baltic Sea port city of Rostock said witnesses reported that the bird caused a short-circuit in a railway power line and fell to the ground in flames. The neighboring field then caught fire, and more than 50 firefighters were deployed to tackle the blaze on Tuesday evening.
Farmers in northeastern Germany have been complaining of the effects of a persistent lack of rain over the past two months.
Our antiques expert takes a look at ice staking memorabilia...
This week all I've heard about is the ITV programme Dancing on Ice that's back on Sunday nights. It's four years since it was last on television, and it's all the staff here are talking about.
READ MORE: Pub-related collectables https://www.lep.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/pub-related-collectables-are-becoming-more-popular-in-lancashire-1-8979128
Programmes like this and Strictly Come Dancing motivate people to take up the sport or hobby, and I'll bet the ice rink at Blackpool has been inundated with phone calls in the last few weeks!
When one thinks of collectables, one often thinks of Royal Doulton, clocks or stamps! But sporting collectables are hugely popular and some collectors seek out specific items. Ice skating, whilst not an “everyday” sport like football or tennis, still has its fans and followers, and I know a few people in the North West who collect old roller skates and ice skates. They'd love these!
Ice skating dates back to at least 5,000 B.C.
The first pair of skates we have were found at the bottom of a lake in Switzerland, dated to 3,000 B.C.
They were made from the leg bones of large animals such as horse, ox or deer. Holes were bored through each end with leather straps to tie the skates on.
Around 200 A.D. the first metal skates replaced bone with a thin copper strip, and in the 14th Century, the Dutch developed wooden platforms with iron bottoms, still attached with leather straps. Similar to skiing, poles were needed to propel yourself along.
In 1914, a blade-maker from Minnesota created the ‘modern' skate, with an integral shoe and closed-toe blade making skates lighter and faster. While the materials have improved over the years, the design has barely changed.
The popularity of ice-skating and related sports today – including Dancing on Ice – means celebrities, and therefore collectables.
Figure skating is the oldest Olympic Winter Games sport, since 1908, and signed memorabilia by competitors such as British champions Torville and Dean are very popular.
Unusually for a ‘tidal' river, there are records of the Lune at Lancaster being frozen solid in 1739 and 1820.
In 1963 I was at school in Cambridge and the River Cam froze for 3 months.
We all skated on it then, but I don't think I'd cut a very elegant figure on the ice nowadays, were it to happen again.
“Good morning all! Have a nice day!”
The seven words stopped Lina Shah as she scurried through the subway turnstiles under Times Square on a recent morning, in the thick of rush hour. The words are more typically heard when entering a department store, the automaton drone of a hired greeter. But they seemed so incongruent in the dour tunnels of the New York City subway that Ms. Shah paused in the middle of her commute to find their source.
Then she heard the voice again: “Good morning to you! Have a good day, now!”
There, standing on a busy passageway connecting the Port Authority Bus Terminal with the A, C and E lines was Tonya M. Cooper, a longtime employee of the agency that runs the subways, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, rattling off good morning salutations at a rate of 32 a minute.
Since November, Ms. Cooper and 40 other transit workers have been shifted into a job that is based largely on the notion that being unrelentingly nice can go a long way to help bolster the image of a flagging, frequently curse-inducing subway system.
“You're so friendly!” Ms. Shah, an accountant, told Ms. Cooper, after watching her direct a man to the A train, and kneel to tell a little boy, and his mother, which exit to use. “It's nice to know somebody cares.”

The position, officially a Customer Service Ambassador, or Wayfinder, is a pilot program introduced as part of the Subway Action Plan, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's $863 million initiative to begin addressing the problems riddling the subway system. The plan, which followed Mr. Cuomo's declaration of a subway emergency last year, focuses on substance, like repairs to infrastructure signals and tracks, as well as on less-tangible elements, like the system's ambience.

Do you have some extra weight around your waist that you're having trouble getting rid of? Imagine treating that fat over your lunch hour.A new device promises to do just that in about 25 minutes.Jennifer loves to hike the trails around her Marin County home. "I usually do like 5 to 7 miles, three times a week," she said.But even with all that exercise, Jennifer said she's frustrated with bulges that won't go away. "Around my belly and the sides of my waist. And finding that my clothes don't fit as well as they used to," she said.Now she's turning to Doctor Keith Denkler and a new treatment called SculpSure , which promises to dissolve away areas of fat without surgery."It's not strictly a melting. It's actually you're damaging the fat with heat, light energy. It's light energy," Denkler said.First, Denkler's team places brackets around Jennifer's waist. Then they'll attack multiple applicators that will deliver laser light. He said they're designed to heat the fat cells beneath the skin while keeping the surface cooler to minimize pain.According to the manufacturer, the heat destroys roughly a quarter of the fat cells in under half an hour, as seen in a company animation."And the fat cell dies. Then the body goes and metabolizes the site which is the cell and it takes away the fat," Denkler said.The manufacturer said patients typically see results at somewhere between 6 to 12 weeks. Before and after photos show Jennifer's results after a little more than a month."It's very suitable for people who have diet-resistant fat pads. These are thinner people that may have some love handles or lower abdominal areas that they can't get rid of," he said.Jennifer said she isn't expecting the treatment to reshape her body but simply tighten up her waist."I'm just looking forward to having my jeans fit really well, really well,' she said.Denkler said a small percentage of patients may have trouble tolerating the heat and he said the treatment is meant for patients with healthy skin.
SYDNEY (AP) — Paul Gray, lead singer of the 1980s Australian pop band Wa Wa Née, has died of cancer. He was 54 years old.
His brother and fellow band member Mark Gray said in a statement on Wednesday that Paul Gray died on Tuesday of multiple myeloma.
Wa Wa Née formed in the early 1980s and had an Australian hit with their single, "Stimulation," in 1986.
The band later charted in the United States with the song "Sugar Free."
The band's broke up in 1989, but reformed recently in recent years to perform at 1980s revival concerts and to support British group The Human League on their Australian tour last year.
Honoring the birthplace of barbecue this Saturday
When we sit down for a meal, we usually don't wonder how long ago the first meatloaf was made, or the first time someone mashed potatoes. A delicacy's history is often forgotten and we're left with just a delicious dish. But to know the origins of something as Southern as barbeque should be something we take pride in.
The legend of Lamar Johnson's famous barbeque dates back to the turn of the century, when back in 1903 Johnson was smoking whole hogs in a pit in the ground in Ooltewah and serving it with an elixir mixture of his own making that is known today as honey barbeque sauce.
Historians claim this to be the first barbeque sauce, and whether or not it's true, from the smoking pit we've gained a Southern staple most of us couldn't bear to live without.
In honor of Johnson's namesake, this weekend will be the second annual Lamar Johnson Classic at Cambridge Square in Ooltewah, a barbeque smoking event for the best smokers in town to show off their skills and compete for the Grand Championship with their sticky sweet meats.
Starting at 7 a.m., barbeques will be fired up and meats will be prepped for a day of smoking. Come out this Saturday for all the smells, sights, and tastes.
Max Muncy also hit a home run for the Dodgers, his seventh, just two batters before Kemp went deep against Eflin. Over his last three starts, Eflin has been unable to get through five innings.
"They took advantage of my bad pitches and they hit some good pitches," Eflin said. "It was just one of those days where I got hit around."
The Dodgers have won five of their last six games against the Phillies at Dodger Stadium, going back to April of last season. Since the start of 2015, the Dodgers have won 10 of 13 against the Phillies in Los Angeles.
Cody Bellinger had two hits for the Dodgers, his first multi-hit game since May 8.
SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY
Stripling got his chance to start after a bevy of injuries in the rotation. Clayton Kershaw (biceps tendinitis), Rich Hill (blister), Hyun-Jin Ryu (groin) and Kenta Maeda (hip) are all currently on the DL.
Stripling gave up four runs over four innings in a start at Arizona on April 30, but since then he has not given up more than two earned runs in any outing. He even helped himself on offence in this game, delivering an RBI single in the fifth inning. It was just his second career RBI after also recording one in 2016.
"That was just kind of a step in the bucket and flair it the other way," Stripling said of his third career hit. "It was cool to get an RBI."
WILLIAMS GOES DEEP AGAIN
Williams' home run that spoiled the Dodgers' potential shutout bid gave him home runs in consecutive games for the first time in his career. It also is helping to distance himself from a rough end to April when he was in an 0-for-20 dry spell.
Four of Williams' six home runs have come over his last nine games and he has a .741 slugging percentage over that stretch.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Phillies: A further examination on the jaw of OF Rhys Hoskins revealed a fracture, after he was hit in the face by his own foul ball Monday. Hoskins is expected to go on the DL. ... Pedro Florimon, who was placed on the DL with a fracture in his left foot, will need to undergo a surgical procedure, Kapler said.
Dodgers: LHP Hill participated in his second simulated game since Saturday, pitching three innings with a protective covering over the blister on his left middle finger. There remains no timetable for Hill's return. ... A day after leaving his outing in the second inning, RHP Maeda was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a mild hip strain. ... INF Chase Utley also went on the 10-day disabled list with a left thumb sprain.
ROSTER SHUFFLE
With Maeda and Utley each going on the disabled list, the Dodgers recalled RHP Dennis Santana and ambidextrous pitcher Pat Venditte. It is Santana's first time on a major league roster. He will be available out of the bullpen for now, but could start in the upcoming weekend series at Colorado.
The Phillies also added to their roster, recalling infielder Mitch Walding. He replaced Florimon, who fractured his foot in Tuesday's game.
UP NEXT
LHP Kershaw (1-4, 2.86 ERA) is expected to return from the disabled list and start in the series finale. RHP Aaron Nola (6-2, 2.27), who has given up one earned run of less in four of his five May starts, is set to make his second career start against the Dodgers.

The video pokes fun at Israelis passion for food, tendency to underdress, speak loudly, use the words "nu," "sababa" and "walla," and busy news cycle.

Brian Orser, figure skating coach extraordinaire, took a break from his first class: adults ranging from middle age into their 80s.
"Actually, it's my favorite thing I do," the two-time Olympic silver medalist says with a laugh.
Orser will be taking a lengthy break from teaching those folks in Toronto. He has some business to attend to in South Korea: the Pyeongchang Games, where he'll have three gold medal threats in his charge.
His resume as a coach is as sterling as it was as a competitor in the 1980s. Eight years ago, in Vancouver, he guided Yuna Kim to the women's title. The image of Orser behind the end boards, twisting and turning to Kim's every move, is as indelible as the South Korean's own brilliant performances.
Then, at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, he worked with Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu, who like Kim won his country's first gold medal in his discipline. Hanyu will be back again, though he has been battling a serious ankle injury.
Orser could help another skater break through at the games: Spain's Javier Fernandez, a six-time European champion and two-time world winner whose country never has medaled in figure skating.
And just to make sure he stays busy, Orser also will work with Canadian champ Gabrielle Daleman.
How does he manage it?
"I think the secret is we have to treat everybody as individuals," Orser says. "Different personalities and different cultures. We do have a plan for everybody on paper and we try to follow that best as we can.
"They walk into the rink and there is an energy we have to gauge, and then based on the plan, maybe get the energy level up. Sometimes we can't ... we're not doing it cookie-cutter style."
Orser hardly is alone as he works with both world-class and lower-level skaters.
"No one can do this without a great support team," he notes, mentioning in particular Tracy Wilson, an Olympic and world medalist when she competed. "There's so much that goes into it, on the ice and off the ice."
On the ice is where the spotlight shines, of course. This is, as Orser explains, "a really delicate time."
An Olympic season is different from others in the sport. Not only is the timing of events skewed — U.S. nationals were held three weeks early in 2018 — but the pressure ratchets up throughout the end of the calendar for one year and the beginning of a new one.
Simply putting yourself in position to get on the national team for the Olympics is difficult. Then comes the intense stress of actually qualifying.
If you make it, well, then there's the buildup to the big one.
"For me, I think this is where we are on kind of on high alert as far as our awareness goes," Orser says. "You can't peak too soon, but this is also a good time to do a little bit of a test run.
"We have those three or four days before competing when we are at the Olympics and you must rev it up. And this is the time to begin to rev it up and see if we can do it — mentally, physically. If we achieve it, then we go back to our regular programming. If not, then we work on making it work.
"With Yuzuru and Javi, they are kind of coming into the Olympics from a different angle. Obviously due to circumstance," Orser says, referring to Hanyu's injury. "Javi has just been going along at his own pace."
Orser sat down with his medal contenders in October to offer them some advice. He says, with no trace of bitterness or regret, that he was ready too early for the 1984 and '88 Olympics, when he finished second to Scott Hamilton and then to Brian Boitano.
"Sometimes we have to guide them along the way," he says.
Daleman might be his most impressive project this season. She underwent surgery last May for an abdominal cyst and entered the Olympic campaign with some huge question marks. She's answered them so well that she now must be considered a threat to the Russian and Japanese women in Pyeongchang.
"Gaby had a slow start, surgery, and she has revved it up," Orser says. "She needed a good skate at nationals, and now has a good skip to her step."
Orser likely will be seen skipping and stepping at the end boards again in South Korea. He wasn't sure he'd take well to coaching. Today, he recognizes that he has, and he finds it fulfilling.
"I have to say now, I have a lot of confidence in what I am doing and relying on my team," he concludes. "It was not anything specific with Yuna or Yuzuru, I believe in what I am doing and who I am working with. There is the odd time I would second-guess some things, but I look around and see we are doing good stuff.
"People see the star skaters in the forefront. But we look out on the ice with the novice and intermediate skaters and their progression. That gives me confidence and it gives me great satisfaction. I worked hard when I was a skater, I was on time and focused, and that is something that never changes.
"I love skating and love seeing skaters do well."

Pixar's new animated movie “Coco” is a sumptuous portrait of Mexico's infatuation with the afterlife. Hollywood has gotten Mexican life wrong so many times — think “Under the Volcano” and “Traffic” — that Mexicans have stopped caring. But “Coco” feels fresh and authentic, perhaps the most sophisticated representation of Mexican popular culture ever produced for the big screen. It makes no excuses about Mexicans' intimacy with death. On the contrary, it turns death into an amusement-park ride.
Most of the plot takes place during the Día de los Muertos, a holiday when Mexicans spend 24 hours in the cemetery, making “ofrendas” (gifts) to deceased family members. I have participated in this celebration several times, in Mexico as well as in border towns on the American side. The most striking element is the omnipresence of ghosts.
In Anglo-Protestant culture, ghosts are menacing types who come with an unwelcome message (like Hamlet's father). In Mexico, spirits are gentle, even lovable, always ready to offer counsel. No fright, no haunted houses. We greet them with music and dance and plenty of conversation.

This is not to say that death in Mexico is innocuous. In Aztec mythology, two deities of death, Mictlantecuhtli and Mictecacihuatl, rule the underworld, which is known as Mictlan. A recently deceased person navigates through the nine levels of Mictlan with the help of Xolotl, a kind of Virgil who is the double of the powerful deity Quetzalcoatl and also has the job of protecting the sun in the underworld.
The odyssey takes four years and presents all sorts of challenges, including passing through a place where the wind blows knives and another with a river of blood surrounded by jaguars. It is a purifying journey across the landscape of memory, a search for one's lineage and a dialogue with the dead.
Miguel, the 12-year-old protagonist of “Coco,” embarks on such a quest. Along with his companion, a stray dog fittingly named Dante, he treks through the underworld while facing obstacles and bad omens that pop up constantly. (In Spanish “coco” means “boogeyman,” which is a nickname for the devil.) But since this is a children's movie, the challenges bring laughter, which isn't altogether alien to Mexico's approach to death. To laugh at death in Mexico is to be courageous.
Miguel's ordeal is about sacrifice — one of the most important ways that Mexicans engage with the idea of the end of life. One sacrifices for all sorts of things: the good of the family, the good of the nation and the good of the almighty. An honorable life for Mexicans is a life of sacrifice, even martyrdom. Through sacrifice, Miguel learns not to silence death, not to be ashamed of it.

The ultimate symbol of Mexico's intimacy with death are the “calaveras” — depictions of skulls (and sometimes skeletons) — and “Coco” pays tribute to this rich artistic tradition. Calaveras' roots date back to pre-Columbian civilizations, who included skulls and skeletons in temples, sculptures, architecture, and even on currency.
In modern times, the man credited for popularizing them is José Guadalupe Posada, a famous late-19th-century engraver. During the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Posada poked fun at dictators and the bourgeoisie in general, most often by depicting calaveras dressed up as tyrants and wealthy people, while portraying the downtrodden in a dignified fashion.
Mexican artists have built on Posada's work. Diego Rivera, for instance, included skeletons in his murals (such as “Dream of a Sunday Afternoon at the Alameda Central Park,” where Posada himself makes a cameo) and other paintings. And of course, calaveras are the leitmotif in Frida Kahlo's self-portraits. Today, it is next to impossible to enter a supermarket, a restaurant, a school or any other public space in Mexico without being greeted by them.
Along with the film's embrace of the afterlife, the use of Spanglish dialogue is a refreshing surprise. Even indigenous terms like “chamaco” (rascal), which has Aztec roots, felt natural in the New York theater where I saw it. The actors rolled their r's without hesitation. In short, instead of hiding their heritage, the characters emphasize and even make fun of it.
This is particularly welcome at a time when President Trump disparages Mexicans to score political points and when Mexico-United States relations are at a low point. Maybe it's a sign that the dead are looking out for us.
OHIO VALLEY — Gallia County bees are on the road again heading to California.
Frederick Burdell, a local bee and honey farmer, began shipping his bees to California in the winter time three years ago to help in almond pollination.
According to Burdell, California's 900,000 acres of almond trees account for 80 percent of all almonds produced in the world. 80 percent of those almonds are exported, making it an important industry.
“The farm gate price for almonds is four billion dollars a year,” said Burdell. “It takes about one and one half million beehives to pollinate, we send about 700 beehives.”
Burdell explained that almonds are 90 percent reliant on insect pollination, carrying pollen from one variety to another in order to produce a crop. The almond trees start blooming about Valentines Day and finish about the second week of March, according to Burdell.
The is mutually beneficial as California almond farmers get their trees pollinated and beekeepers across the country earn financial income as well as excellent food source for their bees. According to Burdell, the beehives are in California for about three to four weeks, earning about $200 for a good hive.
“That's what it costs to keep the hive alive for a year. Bees do great on almonds, the pollen is good and the nectar is slightly toxic, but they do well on it,” said Burdell.”The almond story to me, is exciting. It is what's keeping beekeeping alive in the United States today.”
Each year almost 27,000 truckloads of beehives will arrive on California farms for pollination. Each truck has to be inspected upon arrival for cleanliness and other species of insects, and some are turned away despite the high demand for beehives.
“It took us almost two months to go through all our hives and determine which ones were good for sale and get them ready and on pallets,” said Burdell. “It costs about $14,000 to ship them out and back each year.”
Normally the bees make the trip out, pollinate in California and possibly a few other places, and then return to Gallia County. This year, they will be sold out west, as Burdell is seeking to exit the beekeeping world. Burdell has been keeping bees in some form or fashion since the mid 1950's. He was a honey producer until 2000 when he transitioned into growing and selling bees when the nectar flows slowed significantly.
“Bee keeping is very highly specialized, I read two hundred pages of magazines a month trying to stay up on it,” said Burdell. “I'm 75 years old. Two thirds of my expenses go to labor.”

Italian police on Wednesday said an international criminal gang who stole artifacts from Sicilian archaeological sites had been dismantled with scores of arrests made.
The group "illegally exported" many of the stolen artifacts to Germany where they were granted fake certificates of origin and sold by auction houses in Munich, the Carabinieri art heritage police said.

Some of the 20,000 objects recovered included ancient coins, statues and pottery, as well as fake artifacts, and police said the haul was estimated to be worth more than €40 million ($46.5 million).
Arrests across several countries
A total of 23 people have been arrested in relation to the gang, with eight in custody, seven under house arrest in Italy, and three subject to European arrest warrants in Germany, Spain and Britain.
A 61-year-old Italian was arrested in Ehingen, in the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg, and €30,000 ($35,000 dollars) in cash was seized from his home.

A British art dealer was arrested in London and another Italian was arrested in Barcelona.
The group's alleged leader is a 76-year-old man known as "Zu Gino" (Uncle Gino), who worked out of the Sicilian town of Riesi.
Police are also investigating two Munich auction houses.
Another five suspects were not detained, but have been ordered to report regularly to police, the art heritage squad said.

U.S. citizen William Dathan Holbert was sentenced to 47 years in prison by a court in Panama for robbing and killing five other Americans in a Caribbean tourist destination, authorities said Monday.
Holbert's ex-wife Laura Reese was sentenced to 26 years for her role.
Authorities said Holbert admitted killing five people between 2007 and 2010 in Bocas del Toro province in order to steal their property.
Holbert's lawyer, Claudia Alvarado, suggested an appeal was likely.
Holbert and Reese were arrested while trying to enter Nicaragua from Costa Rica in 2010.
That year, the bodies of four adults and one child were found buried on the property of a hostel that Holbert owned.
Holbert killed a U.S. citizen named Mike Brown, his wife and young son in 2007. Authorities have said Brown may have been living under an alias and they don't know where he was from. In 2010, Holbert killed Cheryl Lynn Hughes, a native of St. Louis, Missouri, who ran a small hotel in Panama, and Bo Icelar, former owner of a gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Holbert had left North Carolina after he went through a divorce to a previous wife, sold his landscaping business and filed for bankruptcy. He met Reese in North Carolina.
In Montana, Holbert stole a car and sold it. Back in North Carolina he sold a $200,000 home that he didn't own. Authorities pursued him across a half dozen states that included a high-speed chase in Wyoming.
He and Reese had been living in Panama under the alias Cortez. They were fleeing a Panamanian investigation when they were arrested in Nicaragua.
One of the most challenging tasks on an admin's list is the management of projects and tickets. This can be especially overwhelming when you have a larger IT department and a staff working on numerous projects at once. But the management of projects and ticket issues doesn't just fall on the heads of large companies. Even if you're a one-person shop consultancy, it can be easy to drown in a quagmire of projects.
Thankfully, there are a lot of tools available to help you with that. If you happen to be a fan of open source (and who isn't?), those tools are not only readily available, they are free and (generally speaking) easy to set up. I want to walk you through the installation of one such tool: Trac. Trac can be used as a wiki, a project management system, and for tracking bugs in software development. I'll be demonstrating the installation on a Ubuntu Server 16.04. And so, let's get to it.
Installation
The installation isn't terribly challenging, but does require a bit of typing. Log into your Ubuntu server and let's take care of the dependencies.
If your Ubuntu Server platform is without Apache, install it with the command:
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
Once that completes, install Trac with the command:
sudo apt-get install trac libapache2-mod-wsgi -y
Next, the auth_digest module must be enabled with the command:
sudo a2enmod auth_digest
Now we create the necessary document root for Trac (and give it the correct permissions) with the following commands:
sudo mkdir /var/lib/trac sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/trac sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/trac
For our next trick, we create a Trac project directory (we'll call it test) with the command:
sudo trac-admin /var/lib/trac/test initenv test sqlite:db/trac.db
Time to give that new directory the proper permissions. This is done by issuing the following commands:
sudo trac-admin /var/lib/trac/test deploy /var/www/html/trac/test sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/trac/test sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/trac/test
Finally, we create both an admin user and a standard user with the commands:
sudo htdigest -c /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest "test" admin sudo htdigest /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest "test" USER
Where USER is the name of the user you prefere.
After both of the above commands, you'll be prompted to type (and confirm) a password. Remember these passwords.
Configure Apache
Create an Apache .conf file for Trac with the following command:
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/trac.conf
Add the following content to the new file:
WSGIScriptAlias /trac/test /var/www/html/trac/test/cgi-bin/trac.wsgi AuthType Digest AuthName "test" AuthUserFile /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest Require valid-user
Save and close that file.
Enable our new site (and restart Apache) with the following commands:
sudo a2ensite trac sudo systemctl restart apache2
Accessing Trac
Open a web browser and point it to http://SERVER_IP/trac/test (where SERVER_IP is the IP address of your server). You will be prompted for login credentials. Log in with the user admin and the password you set when you created admin user earlier. You can also login with the non-admin user you created. There is actually no difference between the users (which could be a deal-breaker for some). One thing to note: If you need more users, you'll create them from the command line (in similar fashion as you did above). For every user you need to add to Trac, issue the command:
sudo htdigest /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest "test" USER
Where USER is the username. The above command will add the user to the project test. If you need to create more projects, you must go back through the process of creating a new project directory and then add users to it.
Once you've successfully authenticated, you'll be presented with the Trac web interface, were you can begin working (Figure A).
Figure A
You can now go to Preferences and configure your installation of Trac. Once you've completed that, you can begin creating new tickets. If you get the (please configure the [header_logo] section in trac.ini) error, you can configure this with the command:
sudo nano /var/lib/trac/test/conf/trac.ini
In that file, you'll see the section:
[header_logo] alt = (please configure the [header_logo] section in trac.ini) height = -1 link = src = site/your_project_logo.png width = -1
That is where you'll configure a header logo to suit your company.
SEE: IT project management: 10 ways to stay under budget (free PDF) (TechRepublic)
Congratulations
You now have your Trac system up and running. Although you might find systems with more features (and a more powerful configuration system), Trac is very simple to set up and use. If you're looking for a basic ticketing system that can serve as a project management tool, Trac just might fit the bill.

Spain has extradited to the United States a Russian citizen who is suspected of being one of the world's most notorious spammers.
Pyotr Levashov, a 37-year-old from St. Petersburg, was arrested in April while vacationing with his family in Barcelona.
U.S. authorities had asked for him to be detained on charges of fraud and unauthorized interception of electronic communications. He was arraigned late Friday in a federal courthouse in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where a grand jury indicted him last year. Levashov pleaded not guilty and remains in detention.
A statement from Spain's National Police said officers handed Levashov over to U.S. marshals on Friday. The extradition was approved in October by Spain's National Court, which rejected a counter-extradition request from Russia.
The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Authorities in the U.S. say they have linked Levashov to a series of powerful botnets, or networks of hijacked computers, that were capable of pumping out billions of spam emails. An indictment unsealed last year said he commanded the sprawling Kelihos botnet, which at times allegedly involved more than 100,000 compromised computers that sent phony emails advertising counterfeit drugs, harvested users' logins and installed malware that intercepted bank account passwords.
On a typical day, the network would generate and distribute more than 2,500 spam emails, according to the indictment.
Levashov's lawyers have alleged the case is politically motivated and that the U.S. wants him for reasons beyond his alleged cybercrimes. They had argued that he should be tried in Spain instead, and pointed to evidence showing that he gained access to Russian state secrets while studying in St. Petersburg.
Levashov's U.S.-based lawyer, Igor Litvak, didn't return emails or calls seeking comment Friday.
AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — The Barrett brothers will become the first trio of siblings to play in a rugby test for New Zealand when they line up in Friday's Pacific Challenge match against Samoa.
Flyhalf Beauden will play his 50th test while utility back Jordie is set to make his debut from the bench, where he has been named beside lock Scott.
Ben Smith will captain New Zealand for the first time in the absence of Kieran Read, who is recovering from a broken thumb. He will become New Zealand's 68th test captain and the first fullback to lead the All Blacks since Mils Muliaina in 2009.
Sonny Bill Williams will start at inside center in his first test since the 2015 Rugby World Cup final, combining in midfield with Anton Lienert Brown.
Julian Savea and Israel Dagg have been named on the wings, holding out Waisake Naholo who starred in the Highlanders win over the British and Irish Lions on Tuesday.
Ardie Savea takes Read's place at No. 8 while Jerome Kaino returns from knee surgery to take his usual place on the blindside flank.
Codie Taylor will start at hooker in the absence of Dane Coles, who is recovering from concussion.
Uncapped lock Vaea Fifita has been named on the bench, also providing backrow cover, while Lima Sopoaga provides backup to Beauden Barrett at flyhalf as Aaron Cruden recovers from a knee injury.
Head coach Steve Hansen congratulated Smith on his appointment as captain.
"He's been our vice-captain for a few years now and captain of the Highlanders where he's been doing a fantastic job so was the logical choice," Hansen said. "He leads by example and is an inspiration to his teammates."
Hansen said while the match was planned to help the All Blacks prepare for the three-test series against the Lions, it was important in its own right.
"This is a test match against a quality and very capable opponent," he said. "Samoa is about to kick off the qualifying stage of their Rugby World Cup campaign so this will make them even more dangerous."
New Zealand and Samoa have met in seven previous tests, most recently in Apia in 2016 when the All Blacks won 25-16.
Wales will also play Tonga in the Pacific Challenge doubleheader at Eden Park on Friday.

Black Cats fans are being invited to have their say with Sunderland fans and former players, at free talk-ins ahead of every weekend home game.
Wise Men Say, run by two Sunderland AFC supporters, Gareth Barker and Stephen Goldsmith, will be speaking at The Peacock to share their thoughts ahead of every weekend Championship home match.
Gareth and Stephen, whose podcast has gained a loyal following, will be using the upstairs space in The Peacock to host free-to-attend live pre-match shows, that will give fans the chance to hear expert opinions from former players, and to take part in a Q&A session, where they can have their say and hear from other fans.
The talk-ins, which are family-friendly, will run three hours ahead of kick off, with 90 minutes of live chat, Q&As and the chance to win a range of prizes from signed shirts to football memorabilia.
Gareth said: “This season is set to be a rollercoaster ride – anyone who follows football knows just what a tough and unpredictable place the Championship can be.
“We had a rocky ride during pre-season but have managed to get four points from two games. It will be interesting to see how this plays out across the season as we try to bounce back under Simon Grayson. There will be much to discuss, I am sure, and we look forward to seeing Sunderland's loyal fans every weekend home match this season.”
He added: “We'll be following the same format that fans of the podcast will be used to, with a different expert on hand each week to give their opinions. And there will be plenty of opportunities for discussion with fans to see what they think. We'll be sticking around until an hour before kick-off, so there should be time to reflect on the teamsheet too.”
The first Wise Men Say talk in at The Peacock will be held ahead of Sunderland's 5.30pm clash against Leeds on August 19.
Dan Luke, general manager at The Peacock, said: “The Peacock is perfectly placed to attract football fans, with the Stadium of Light a stone's throw from the pub.”
The first meeting of the Pakistan-Afghanistan Joint Working Groups will be held in Kabul on Saturday, an official said. Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua will lead the country's delegation, Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said on Friday. He said Islamabad had proposed five joint working groups focussing on ensuring comprehensive engagement for countering terrorism, intelligence sharing, military, economy, trade and transit interaction, refugee repatriation as well as connectivity.
The meeting comes in the backdrop of a series of deadly attacks that rattled Kabul, after which a high-level delegation from Afghanistan comprising the Interior Minister and spy chief had visited Pakistan earlier this week with a “personal message” from President Ashraf Ghani. Afghan officials had said that their delegation handed over to Islamabad “undeniable” evidence that the spate of deadly attacks in Afghanistan was planned in Pakistan.
Faisal said “there were no terrorist safe havens anywhere in Pakistan” and also rejected accusations of Pakistani cooperation with the Haqqani network. He stressed that Kabul should ensure better border management in order to check cross-border terrorism into Pakistan, and focus on eliminating Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) safe havens on its own territory. Recently, a suicide attack killed more than 100 people and injured many in the centre of Afghanistan capital, Kabul, terrorists blew up an ambulance laden with explosives. At least 11 soldiers and four militants were killed on Monday after the Islamic State attacked an army camp in western Kabul, the seventh major attack in the country this month. The attack, for which the Taliban claimed responsibility, followed another assault by their militants on a luxury hotel in Kabul a week ago that killed 22 people.

2016 was a bad year for Facebook as it struggled to keep up with a tidal wave of fake news and sketchy political advertising. And as it's tried to contain the problem, mostly what's happened is revelations that it's much worse than we thought. Now, problems Facebook claimed were addressed are cropping up again, and clearly haven't been fixed at all.
Among other solutions, Facebook promised to make it easier for users to find and call out sketchy advertisers of all stripes, including their physical locations. Turns out, according to the Daily Beast, that Facebook hasn't implemented those features yet, and shadowy political action groups are acting anonymously while they still can:
The Facebook CEO promised to “roll this out over the coming months, and we will work with others to create a new standard for transparency in online political ads.” None of those features are currently accessible to Alabamians being served ads by both pro-Roy Moore PACs, like America First Action, and, ostensibly, groups backing Democratic candidate Doug Jones, such as one called Alabama Values.
Apparently, Facebook is still testing these features; a spokesman pointed the Daily Beast to a blog post detailing that, currently, this is being tried out in Canada:
We know how important it is to our community that we get this feature just right — and so we're first rolling it out in only one country. Testing in one market allows us to learn the various ways an entire population uses the feature at a scale that allows us to learn and iterate. Starting in Canada was a natural choice as this effort aligns with our election integrity work already underway there.
To be fair, there's only so far Facebook can go, here. It can tell you the name and address on the check that bought the ad, but there are plenty of legal ways for foreign donors to put money into an election. That said, the Daily Beast does note that the pro-Roy-Moore PAC that it themes the article around is getting obliterated by a far more direct form of democracy: Alabamians showing up on its Facebook page and raking it over the coals:

ROANOKE, Va. (AP) – Law enforcement agencies across Virginia are hosting events this month for people to dispose of unneeded prescription drugs.The National Drug Take Back Day will take place at dozens of Virginia locations on April 29. The Roanoke Times reports pills and patches will be accepted, but not sharp objects such as needles and syringes.Appointments are not needed and no questions will be asked.The newspaper reports Virginians disposed of more than 22,000 pounds of prescription drugs through the program last year.Virginia is dealing with an opioid crisis that has been declared a public health emergency. Officials say addiction can start from prescription pain medication.Take back events can also help prevent drug theft.
If you ask Bank of America Corp (ticker: BAC) shareholders how they feel about the past half-year or so, you're sure to get an answer that can only be described as "hedged happiness."
After all, BAC stock has run up some 35 percent since the November presidential election, running circles around the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which is up 12 percent since then. But the dual narrative of President Donald Trump's anti-regulation regime and Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes sending Bank of America to the moon hasn't quite materialized -- at least not nearly enough to match months' worth of hype.
Bank of America, as a result, finds itself entering its first-quarter earnings report in a double-digit slide since its early March highs that has eaten all but 1 percent of its gains in 2017, versus a respectable 4 percent performance by the broader market.
The question now is: What can BAC do to rekindle the kinds of go-go gains it earned in the "Trump Bump"?
[See: 11 Ways to Buy Bank Stocks.]
The headline numbers: Wall Street has some pretty optimistic views of what Bank of America will bring to the table for Tuesday's first-quarter earnings report. Revenues are expected to expand 9.6 percent from last year's quarter to $21.6 billion, while earnings should sprout by 25 percent to 35 cents per share.
A beat should be ... well, money in the bank.
BAC has posted earnings beats for seven consecutive quarters, so it's managing expectations well on its own. But Wall Street also appears to have laid down a low bar for big-bank earnings this quarter. Citigroup ( C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM) beat first-quarter estimates by roughly 9 percent, and even beleaguered Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC) managed to come in 3 percent ahead of the consensus mark.
The flip side? Those three performances, all released last Thursday morning, were wasted as the U.S. dropped the "mother of all bombs" on Afghanistan in a strike against ISIS, sending markets (including bank stocks) into reverse.
Bank of America's secret Is out: Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz articulated the biggest problem for BAC shares going forward in an April 4 note:
"Since the election, BAC has outperformed and has substantially closed that gap with JPM. ... We believe that the benefit of higher rates, the potential post-election improvement in regulatory and economic outlook are reflected in the current valuation. We continue to believe the group is fully valued. So, we do not see a lot left to play for." Horowitz wrote this in conjunction with a downgrade to BAC shares from "buy" to "neutral."
Bank of America's valuation metrics really don't stand out at first glance. It's trading at roughly 15 times trailing earnings and at less than 10 times forward earnings, versus about 24 and 18, respectively, for the S&P 500. Meanwhile, BAC stock trades at a slight discount to book, whereas JPM and WFC command premiums at the moment.
But everything is relative, and so it goes with Bank of America. Its price-to-book of 0.93, while attractive in a bubble, is less than where it traded a few weeks ago, but also still higher than at any other point since prices were tumbling in the 2008-09 bear market.
That's not to say BofA shares couldn't keep rising despite lofty (by its own standards) valuations, but the story is out and well-worn: Everyone knows that BAC and most other banking stocks will benefit from any Trump action against Dodd-Frank and other financial regulations, and everyone knows that Fed interest-rate increases will help the cause, too -- in Bank of America's case, a 25-basis-point rate hike can generate $600 million in additional profits per quarter.
Wall Street was happy to buy the rumor from early November through mid-December. But twice now -- after December's rate hike, then after March's rate hike -- investors have sold the news.
A second hope. Bank of America still looks like a coin flip heading into Tuesday's earnings. Yes, expectations are high and investors have been almost cynical in selling off any piece of actual, hard news that paints BofA in a good light.
However, investors were mostly encouraged by the results of the other three banks -- it was news of America's military actions that shook the morning's gains apart. Also, just last week, Trump began to rattle the Dodd-Frank saber again, promising to knock down the law and other financial regulations. And while BAC's valuation isn't stellar, it has become more appealing -- compared to many of its mega-cap compatriots -- in the wake of its double-digit cool-off.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Typewriter enthusiasts gather at an Albuquerque restaurant to experiment with vintage Smith Coronas. Fans in Boston kneel in a city square and type stories about their lives during a pro-immigration demonstration. A documentary on typewriters featuring Tom Hanks and musician John Mayer is set for release this summer.
In the age of smartphones, social media and cyber hacking fears, vintage typewriters that once gathered dust in attics and basements are attracting a new generation of fans across the U.S.
From public "type-ins" at bars to street poets selling personalized, typewritten poems on the spot, typewriters have emerged as popular items with aficionados hunting for them in thrift stores, online auction sites and antique shops. Some buys antique Underwoods to add to a growing collection. Others search for a midcentury Royal Quiet De Luxe — like a model author Ernest Hemingway used — to work on that simmering novel.
The rescued machines often need servicing, and fans are forced to seek out the few remaining typewriter repair shops.
"I haven't seen business like this in years," said John Lewis, a typewriter repairman who has operated out of his Albuquerque shop for four decades. "There's definitely a new interest, and it's keeping me very busy."
Renewed interest began around 10 years ago when small pockets of typewriter enthusiasts came together online, said Richard Polt, a Xavier University philosophy professor and author of "The Typewriter Revolution: A Typist's Companion for the 21st Century." Since then, the base of fans has dramatically grown, and various public events have been organized around the typewriter.
"It's beyond the phase where this is just a fad," Polt said.
It's almost impossible to gauge recent typewriter sales. Almost all of the original manufacturers are out of business or have been bought out and become different companies. The Moonachie, New Jersey-based Swintec appears to be one of the world's last typewriter makers, selling translucent electronic machines largely to jails and prisons.
But operators of thrift stores and estate sales say typewriters are some of the quickest items to go.
"That's part of the fun: the hunt," said Joe Van Cleave, an Albuquerque resident who owns more than a dozen typewriters and runs a popular YouTube channel on restoring the machines. "Sometimes, like a little luck, you might find something from the 1920s in great condition."
Doug Nichol, director of the upcoming documentary California Typewriter, said the interest stems from "digital burnout" and people wanting a connection to the past. That interest seems to transcend age, he said.
"Kids who grew up knowing only mobile phones and the computer are excited to see a letter typed with your own hand," said Nichol, who owns 85 typewriters. "It's a one-on-one interaction that doesn't get interrupted by Twitter alerts."
In his film, set for release in August, Nichol interviews Hanks, who said he uses a typewriter almost every day to send memos and letters.
"I hate getting email thank-yous from folks," Hanks says in the film. "Now, if they take 70 seconds to type me out something on a piece of paper and send to me, well, I'll keep that forever. I'll just delete that email."
Hank owns about 270 typewriters but often gives them away to people who show an interest. "No one is ever going to make the great typewriter ever, ever, ever again," he said.
One way the typewriter craze is growing is through organized "type-ins" — meet-ups in public places where typewriter fans try different vintage machines. Such events have been held in Phoenix, Philadelphia, Seattle, Los Angeles and Cincinnati.
During a recent type-in at Albuquerque soul food restaurant Nexus Brewery, around three dozen fans took turns clicking the keys of an Italian-made 1964 Olivetti Lettera 32 and a 1947 Royal KMM, among others.
Rich Boucher, a slam poet, spent most of his time on a 1960s-era Hermes 3000 crafting poetry and pausing while trying to figure out when to return the carriage for a next line.
"I haven't used a typewriter in forever," Boucher said. "This is a real refreshing way to spend a summer afternoon."
After finishing his work, Boucher grabbed his phone and sent a Facebook status update about the experience. He then started looking online for a Hermes 3000.
"That's the typewriter I want," he said. "I'm going to find one."

Success at the 2017 Canadian Championship will definitely be relative for the St. Catharines Boxing Club.
With Daniel Ryan, 19, and younger brother Gerard, 16, about to make their third trip to nationals and cousin James Hughes, also 16, going to the Canadian championships for the first time, how could it not be a family affair?
Inexperience hurt Daniel Ryan in his first appearances at nationals three years ago. He finished one and out, losing his only fight after opening the competition with the bye.
“I didn't throw enough punches,” he said. “It was my first experience fighting three-minute rounds.”
The five-year club member fared much better on the return trip. After opening with a victory, the elder Ryan lost his second flight by a close, split decision that required a countback.
“I just could have pushed it a little more,” he said. “I might have moved on to the finals.”
This year he won all four of his fights at the Ontario championships, including two by knockouts, to once again clinch a berth to nationals in the 165-lb. Division.
“I feel pretty good about my chances in Quebec,” he said. “I felt really good, really untouchable at the provincials.”
“I was just getting ‘that feeling' back, and I think I can do that and do it again.”
The Jamie Janzen Plumbing and Heating employee attributed his success at the provincial qualifier to “finding a really good rhythm in my training.”
“I was in good shape,” he said. “Everything was going well. My warmup felt good, I felt good in the ring, I felt outside the ring.”
Daniel Ryan, who estimates that he was won “about two thirds” of his 53 fights, will be one of three boxers representing Ontario in the division in Quebec City.
Mississauga's Kingsley Alexander automatically qualified as the reigning national champion. Also going will be the bronze medallist at provincials.
Gerard Ryan has compiled a 43-10 record in six years with the St. Catharines club, and he is the most successful of the three local fighters who are going to nationals.
His goal of coming home with the gold medal in the youth 141-lb. Division only sounds immodest to people who don't know about his Canadian championship in 2015 and the silver medal he settled for last year.
He was able to skip the Ontario qualifier thanks to a top-two finish at last year's national championships, also held in Quebec City.
For Gerard Ryan, that sets the stage for bouts against boxers who might get a boost from the experience of recent fights at qualifiers in their respective provinces.
He concedes that could give his competition an advantage, “but I'll also be fresher.”
Hughes, a Grade 11 student at Saint Francis Catholic Secondary School, qualified to compete in the 152-lb. youth class at the event taking place April 24-30 in Quebec City despite losing his lone fight at provincials. While the decisive loss to Windsor's Hunter Lee in the Ontario final dropped Hughes' record to 14-3, the two-year club veteran nonetheless had his ticket to nationals punched on the strength of a second-place showing.
“Gold and silver go to nationals, I lost in the final,” said Hughes, who received a bye into the bout against Lee.
Though coming off a loss in his last fight, Hughes said he feels more confident heading into the Canadian championships than he did on the eve of provincials.
“Better than Ontarios, I've been training harder.”
In addition to focusing on developing his fighting style, Hughes devoted time in the gym between fights on cardio training.

The city pied-à-terre of one of the country's leading interior designers is as chic, polished and refined as you'd expect
Next year, Karen Howes will celebrate a quarter of a century in the interior design busi­ness. It's a significant milestone for someone who was just 21 when she set up Taylor Howes in London's Chelsea Harbour with her co-founder Gail Taylor. Karen took sole control of the business soon after, and today Taylor Howes is known as one of the best interior design consultancies in the country, with a worldwide reputation as a professional, innovative outfit with a superlative eye for high glamour.
The practice – which operates out of a converted Aston Martin garage in Knightsbridge – works primarily on residential interior projects (of which it has completed over a thousand), mainly for private clients and property developers. As well as tackling some of the most exclusive addresses in Mayfair, Kensington and Belgravia, it also has clients in the South of France, the Middle East and the United States. Over the years, as its portfolio has grown, it has expanded its reach: from the initial two-person outfit, the company now has more than 30 members of staff. It has also developed its own bespoke lighting range, will be launching a capsule furniture collection later this year, and has recently made a first successful foray into the world of designing yacht cabins.
Interior design has been in Karen's blood ever since her student days, when she recalls endlessly rearranging her bedroom furniture; this was followed by long conversations with her first landlord, Martin Waller, co-founder of the Andrew Martin brand, who passed on his passion for collecting.
Karen's own home is as polished as you'd expect from someone with her level of expertise and experience. In fact, her Knightsbridge apartment is a lesson in quiet sophistication, where moments of drama are juxtaposed with a subtle palette of modest tones that epitomise her hallmark approach to domestic interiors.
“The devil is in the detail,” remarks this seasoned designer, as she takes in her city pied-à-terre. It's a compact space, covering just 1,100 sq ft, but she has brought clever design touches together with high-end furnishings and accessories to create a grand scheme that belies the diminutive footprint.
There's no signature look when you employ the services of Taylor Howes, she explains; its designers are too focused on working out the desires of their clients to be hogging the limelight with their own fripperies.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A group of former students defrauded by for-profit colleges is claiming in court that the Education Department illegally obtained and used their Social Security data to limit their student loan relief.
The Education Department announced in December that it will start granting some former students at the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges only partial federal student loan forgiveness in part to save taxpayers' money. The agency said it will use students' earnings data to determine how much of their loans to forgive.
Some students have already received noticed from the department they will see only 50 percent or less of their loan wiped out, the Associated Press reported last week.
But a motion filed by several former Corinthian students over the weekend claims that the agency had obtained the figures from the Social Security Administration in violation of several laws as well as the Constitution. Attorneys with the Project on Predatory Student Lending at Harvard University representing the students say the agency should have turned to the students for their data as well as notified them of its actions in order to give them a chance to react.
The department "has secretly and illegally coopted Social Security data to try to argue for something less than the complete cancellation and refund that these borrowers are due," said attorney Joshua Rovenger.
The motion, filed in federal court in California, is asking that the notices of partial relief be rescinded. The filing is part of a larger suit against the department.
The Education Department declined to comment on pending litigation.
The Social Security Administration did not return requests for comment.
The Obama administration went hard after for-profit colleges accused of fraud, closing down Corinthian and other major chains and tightening regulations for those schools. The administration also spent $550 million to fully forgive student loans for tens of thousands of students.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has set out to overhaul the sector. She says the Obama regulations were unfair and is writing new ones. She says her new system of partial loan forgiveness will be fairer to students and taxpayers.
Tens of thousands more students are currently waiting for the agency to decide their cases.

Jason Greenblatt, U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Representative for International Negotiations, on Monday evening denounced Palestinian Authority (PA) chairman Mahmoud Abbas, after he called U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman the "son of a dog".
“The time has come for President Abbas to choose between hateful rhetoric and concrete and practical efforts to improve the quality of life of his people and lead them to peace and prosperity,” said Greenblatt.
When Michael Tansley came to Niagara, he meant it to be a time of easing into retirement.
He had found a beautiful house he loved in St. Davids, and was planning where to put the furniture, but he needed a job. He heard about an opening for organist and music director at St. Mark's Anglican Church.
After nine years of what turned out to be a highlight of a long and varied musical career, working with Rev. Bob Wright who was dedicated to bringing arts, especially music, to the historic church, Tansley is ready for the next stage.
He's calling it retirement, knowing it will still mean keeping busy and, of course, playing music for others.
He gave the church lots of notice to find a successor, so he would feel comfortable knowing the church music would be in good hands.
Although he has no definite plans for retirement, he knows he won't be idle.
“I've thoroughly enjoyed these years. I couldn't have been happier. Will I miss it? Of course I will, but I'm not leaving the area and the friends I've made. That's a bonus.”
Unlike many retirees, travel isn't at the top of his list — he has lived in many places and travelled with choirs, and doesn't feel the pull of seeing new places.
“I will keep my hand in music somehow, and I hope to do a bit of composing, maybe take a course at Brock and do some volunteering. I'll also be available to fill in when an organist is needed. And I'll have the freedom to do some other things that I haven't had time to do.”
He plans to take a break of a few months from St. Mark's to give his replacement time to get comfortable “without me breathing down their neck.”
Tansley will present his final concert at St. Mark's Church Friday with favourite musical selections he's chosen.
“I'm being very selfish with this Christmas concert,” he says. “It's all music I'd like to do, and I'll have people around me who have been part of the musical programs of St. Marks.”
He has invited as a special guest opera singer David Pike, who was a student of Tansley when he taught at Albert College in Belleville.
“I started him off with his first singing lesson, and he's done very well. He has a great career going. I'll be happy to have him at St. Mark's.”
The baritone sang at the church in June, said Tansley, “and it was a great success.”
“People loved having him here.”
With a busy schedule of European performances, Pike is in Canada this month, and he agreed to come and sing for the church.
“The program features him and is built around the fact that he's here.”
It also features Michael Abbott on trumpet, Debbie Braun on harp, Lynne Honsberger on organ and cellist Helen Kopec, with music by Britten, Vaughan Williams, Rutter, two excerpts from Handel's Messiah, Lauridsen and Sirett.
There will be some non-secular Christmas carols in new arrangements, said Tansley.
The 45-member St. Mark's choir will be joined by friends of Tansley who have sung with him over the years, he said.
Tickets are $20, and are available through the parish office at 905-468-3123. The concert starts at 7 p.m. with a reception to follow.
