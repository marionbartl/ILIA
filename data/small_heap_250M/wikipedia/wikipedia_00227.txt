John Austin or Austen (born 1613 at Walpole, Suffolk, England; died London, 1669) was an English lawyer, controversial writer, and one of the founding Fellows of the Royal Society.
Life
He was a student of St. John's College, Cambridge, and of Lincoln's Inn, and about 1640 became a Catholic. He was well regarded in his profession and was looked on as a master of English style.
His time was entirely devoted to books and literary pursuits. He enjoyed the friendship of such scholars as the antiquary Thomas Blount, Christopher Davenport (Franciscus a Santa Clara), John Sergeant, and others.
Works
The Christian Moderator; or Persecution for Religion condemned by the Light of Nature, by the Law of God, the Evidence of our Principles, but not by the Practice of our Commissioners for Sequestrations—In Four Parts (London, 1652, 4to.) Published under the pseudonym of William Birchley, and in it he disclaims the papal deposing power. "In his work, Austin assuming the disguise of an independent, shows that Catholics did not really hold the odious doctrines vulgarly attributed to them, and makes an energetic appeal to the independents to extend to the adherents of the persecuted church such rights and privileges as were granted to other religious bodies"
The Catholique's Plea; or an Explanation of the Roman Catholik Belief, concerning their Church, Manner of Worship, Justification, Civil Government, Together with a Catalogue of all the Poenal Statutes against popish Recusants, all which is humbly submitted to serious consideration, By a Catholick Gentleman (London, 1659, 18mo.) also under the pseudonym of William Birchley.
Reflections upon the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; or the Christian Moderator, The Fourth Part, By a Catholick Gentleman, an obedient son of the Church and loyal subject of his Majesty (London, 1661)
A Punctual Answer to Doctor John Tillotson's book called 'The Rule of Faith'. (unfinished)
Devotions, First Part: In the Ancient Way of Offices, With Psalms, Hymns, and Prayers for every Day in the Week, and every Holiday in the Year. It is not known when and where the first edition appeared; the second, a duodecimo, is dated 1672. An edition printed at Edinburgh, 1789, contains a life of the author, presumably by Charles Dodd. This work was adapted to the uses of the Anglican Church in George Hickes's Harmony of the Gospels, etc., (London, 1701), and was often reprinted as a stock book as "Hicks' Devotions".
Devotions, Second Part, The Four Gospels in one, broken into Lessons, with Responsories, To be used with the Offices, Printed Anno Domini 1675 (2 vols.,Paris, 12mo), a posthumous work, divided into short chapters with a verse and prayer at the end of each. The prayers, says Joseph Gillow, "gave rise to offense under the impression that they favoured Blackloe's doctrine concerning the middle state of souls, and on account of this the work was not republished". A third part of the "Devotions" was never printed; it contained, according to the author's own statement "Prayers for all occasions framed by an intimate friend according to his (Austin's) directions, and overlooked by himself".
Austin also wrote several anonymous pamphlets against the theologians who sat in the Westminster Assembly.

The Realencyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, commonly called the Pauly–Wissowa or simply RE, or PW, is a German encyclopedia of classical scholarship. With its supplements it comprises over eighty volumes.
The RE is a complete revision of an older series of which the first volume was published by August Pauly in 1839. Pauly died in 1845, his work unfinished; Christian Waltz and Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel completed it in 1852. This first edition comprised six volumes. A second edition of the first volume was worked on from 1861 to 1866.
In 1890 Georg Wissowa started on the new and more ambitious edition. He expected it to be done in 10 years, but the last of its 83 volumes did not appear until 1978, and the index volume came out in 1980.
Each article was written by a recognized specialist in the relevant field, but unsurprisingly for a work spanning three generations, the underlying assumptions vary radically with the age of the article. Many early biographies for instance were written by Elimar Klebs, Paul von Rohden, Friedrich Münzer and Otto Seeck.
List of volumes
Der Kleine Pauly, Der Neue Pauly and Brill's New Pauly
The price and size of Pauly–Wissowa have always been daunting, and so between 1964 and 1975 the J. B. Metzler'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung put out Der Kleine Pauly in five volumes.
An updated version called Der Neue Pauly, consisting of 18 volumes (although only 15 volumes were planned) and an index, appeared gradually from 1996 to 2003. Between 2004 and 2012 seven supplement volumes appeared.
An English edition, Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World was published between 2002 and 2014 in 28 volumes (15 volumes in the main series on "Antiquity"; 5 volumes in the secondary series on "Classical Tradition"; an index volume for each of these series; and 6 Supplements).
The index to Pauly–Wissowa is available on CD-ROM.

The Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee (ARSAC) is an advisory non-departmental public body of the government of the United Kingdom. It is sponsored by the Department of Health.
The committee advises government on the certification of doctors and dentists who want to use radioactive medicinal products on people.
Doctors and dentists who use radioactive medicinal products (radiopharmaceuticals) on people must get a certificate from health ministers. This certificate allows them to use radioactive medicinal products in diagnosis, therapy and research.
ARSAC was set up to advise health ministers with respect to the grant, renewal, suspension, revocation and variation of certificates and generally in connection with the system of prior authorisation required by Article 5(a) of Council Directive 76/579/Euratom.
The majority of ARSAC's members are medical doctors who are appointed to the committee as independent experts in their field (for example nuclear medicine). The committee comments on applications in confidence to the ARSAC Support Unit, Public Health England. No individual committee member approves any single application.
An official from the Department of Health authorises successful applications on behalf of the Secretary of State.

The Royal Automobile Club International Grand Prix was a motor race held on 2 October 1948, at Silverstone Airfield, Northamptonshire, UK. It is commonly cited as the first British Grand Prix of the modern era.
Held two years before the inauguration of the FIA World Championship of Drivers, the 65-lap race was run under the new Formula One regulations which effectively replaced the pre-war Grand Prix motor racing standards. Winner was the Italian Luigi Villoresi, in a Maserati 4CLT/48. A 13-lap 500 cc race, preceding the Grand Prix, was won by Spike Rhiando in a Cooper. Stirling Moss failed to finish after mechanical problems.
The race meeting marked the opening of the Silverstone Circuit, although at the time the site was only on a one-year loan to the RAC from the Air Ministry, having been a bomber station during World War II.
Background
The Royal Automobile Club had previously run two International Grands Prix at the banked Brooklands circuit, in Surrey, in 1926 and 1927, and the Donington Park circuit had hosted four non-ranking Grands Prix between 1935 and 1939, but with the hiatus caused by the Second World War motorsport in Britain had lost ground to continental countries. Its two major race circuits were unusable, with Donington still littered with detritus from its wartime role as a supply depot, while the Brooklands circuit had been a major centre for aircraft development during the war and much of the track had been built over. With the abundance of redundant airfields in the years following the end of hostilities, however, there were plenty of potential venues for new race circuits. One such was at RAF Silverstone, a former bomber station.
The circuit
The Royal Automobile Club took a one-year lease on the Silverstone airfield site in early 1948 and set about creating a race track. The airfield conformed to the standard model for WWII RAF sites: three long, wide runways formed a triangle, their ends joined by a narrow perimeter roadway. In this inaugural year the RAC decided to lay out a relatively long circuit, using the full lengths of the two longest runways, as well as large portions of the perimeter road.
The competitors started on the western perimeter road and headed north towards a right-hand turn, the high-speed Woodcote Corner. From there the track used the northern edge of the perimeter to a sharp right turn onto the main runway at Copse Corner. Then came the main runway, known for the race as Segrave Straight, with the track continuing to the point at which the two largest runways intersected. Here, in an attempt to better emulate a true road circuit, the course designers narrowed the track with straw bales, which funnelled the cars into a 130° left hairpin bend onto the second runway. At the end of the second runway the cars rejoined the perimeter road, just before the old Becketts Corner, before continuing on the long straight road in front of the main aircraft hangar complex, known appropriately as Hangar Straight.
At the end of the straight at what is now Stowe Corner, competitors rejoined the main runway (this southern portion now named the Seaman Straight), and headed back towards the central hairpin complex. Once again, at the intersection of the two runways the track was narrowed, before a left-hand hairpin onto the second runway, heading back out to the perimeter road. The perimeter road was rejoined at Club Corner. From this point the track once again headed north towards the finish line, passing through the flat-out Abbey Curve en route. Total track length was approximately 3.7 miles (5.9 km), substantially longer than the 2.9 miles (4.7 km) of Silverstone's classic layout, and longer even than the current 3.2-mile (5.1 km) circuit design. This was the only Grand Prix event ever held on this track layout, as from 1949 onward Silverstone circuits used only the perimeter roads. To commemorate the opening of this new circuit, all drivers completing either the Grand Prix or 500 cc race received the RAC Silverstone Plaque. Despite the interim and improvised nature of the Silverstone site, the event attracted in excess of 100,000 spectators.
Grand Prix entrants
The entry list for the 65-lap Grand Prix was very mixed. Brand new, full works cars were entered by Maserati, Talbot-Lago and Ferrari, while the majority of the remaining field was made up of privateer entrants, mostly running pre-war cars. The organisers were particularly pleased to have attracted entries from leading continental firm Maserati; two of their brand new 4CLT/48 Sanremo models were entered: a works car for Luigi Villoresi, and one by British privateer Reg Parnell. A third 4CLT/48 was later entered for a second factory driver, Alberto Ascari, and a fourth as a reserve in the hands of local driver Leslie Brooke. Four Talbot-Lago T26C cars were also entered, including one for pre-war star driver Louis Chiron, and a fifth held in reserve, entered by Lord Selsdon. Although Scuderia Ferrari entered two of its Ferrari 125s, the team decided at the last minute to concentrate their efforts on mainland Europe and did not arrive.
Of the older vehicles, two of the most notable were the Maserati 4CLs from the Scuderia Platé and White Mouse Stable teams. These cars were to be driven by Toulo de Graffenried and Prince Bira respectively, both previously winners of major races. The ERA marque, well represented among the local privateers, was bolstered by a factory entry from the firm's progenitor Raymond Mays. Another significant ERA entry was that of David Hampshire who drove R1A, the first ERA car to be constructed, dating from 1934. Leslie Johnson, owner of ERA in 1948, entered and drove one of the firm's 1939 E-type models. Although Peter Walker was also entered in an E-type, the car was unavailable on race day so he reverted to his own B-type, R10B.
Notable by their absence were the Alfa Romeo works team, who decided not to attend with their dominant 158 Alfetta cars. One Alfa oddity was on show, however: the 1935 Bimotore, albeit with only one of its two engines in operation, was driven by Tony Rolt, an ex-Colditz prisoner of war and the future developer of four-wheel drive.

RAC 500 cc race
The main Grand Prix event was supported by a race for 500 cc (later to become Formula 3) cars. It was dominated by privateer Cooper entries that included future Grand Prix star Stirling Moss and John Cooper himself, both driving the new MkII. Future four-time British Hill Climb Champion Ken Wharton was also in the running, driving his self-built 500 cc special, in a strong field of well over 30 cars.
Despite the prestigious occasion – running two hours before the main Grand Prix event, the 500 cc race was actually the first ever competitive race on the Silverstone Circuit – the start was something of a shambles. When British Racing Drivers' Club President Lord Howe dropped the starting flag only two of the 34 drivers were ready to begin. Eric Brandon – an experienced 500 cc driver, and the first to win a 500 cc race in Britain – was not even seated in his car, but recovered to finish fifth. Moss had dominated the British 500 cc race season up to this point, but his car lost drive during the race and challenger Spike Rhiando won in his Cooper MkII. John Cooper was second, and the 58-year-old Baronet of Bodicote, Sir Francis Samuelson (also a Cooper MkII driver) took third.
Grand Prix
Qualifying
The works Maserati 4CLTs were delayed on their way to Silverstone, and in their absence qualifying was dominated by Monegasque driver Chiron, in his Ecurie France-run Talbot-Lago. He took pole position with a time of 2:56.0, a second clear of de Graffenried's Maserati in second place. Third was the Talbot-Lago of Philippe Étancelin, a further second behind de Graffenried. Despite driving a car a decade older than those in front of him, Bob Gerard managed to put his ERA R14B into fourth position, only two-tenths of a second behind Étancelin, with Johnson's ERA E-type in fifth. Having missed official practice, the Maseratis of Villoresi and Ascari were forced to start at the back of the field, in 24th and 25th positions respectively, but in unofficial practice immediately before the race Ascari posted a lap of 2:54.6, over a second faster than Chiron's pole position time.
Race
At the start, de Graffenried got away from the line fastest, but he was passed by Chiron, Parnell and Johnson before the first corner at Woodcote. This group was followed by Bira, Étancelin and Gerard. As the leaders entered Woodcote Johnson drew level with the leader, Chiron, but at that moment the driveshaft on Johnson's ERA failed, causing its immediate retirement. Further back in the field, Salvadori went straight to his pit box from the start, to attend to an oiled spark plug. The stop cost him half a lap, and put him into last position. In the early corners Parnell was close behind Chiron, in second place, but his month-old Maserati dropped out on the first lap after a flying stone tore out the drain plug of his fuel tank.
By the end of the second lap the Maseratis of Villoresi and Ascari, showing their superior pace and benefiting from retirements, had made their way through the field and were close on Chiron's tail. On lap three both passed Chiron, and Villoresi took the lead. Later on the same lap Italian privateer Gianfranco Comotti joined the early retirees, when his Talbot's brakes failed. Another driver whose brakes fared badly was B. Bira, who dropped back into the pack because of them, after having pressed the leaders in the opening few laps. Rolt's single-engined Bimotore Alfa Romeo lost the use of that remaining motor on lap 6, and Rolt was forced to retire. Geoffrey Ansell's ERA R9B rolled on lap 23, throwing Ansell out of the car. He was unscathed.
As the race progressed de Graffenried dropped yet further back, as his engine went out of tune and started to overheat, and he eventually finished six laps behind the winners. The other early leader, Chiron, started to suffer from a lack of performance in his Talbot on lap 17, and Bira slipped ahead of him into third place. Gerard sat in fifth place, after Étancelin's engine began to overheat, which dropped him back down the field as he was forced to make successive pit stops to top up his radiator fluid, and he eventually retired on lap 22. Chiron dropped even further back after spending 45 seconds in the pits investigating the poor handling of his Talbot, and he eventually retired with a seized gearbox on lap 37. Gerard passed Bira during refuelling pit stops, his pit crew completing the task four seconds faster than Bira's. However, Louis Rosier slipped past both of them as he did not need to stop for fuel. Gerard eventually caught Rosier again on lap 52, and passed him to take third place.
The works Maseratis were never more than a few seconds apart, and they regularly swapped the lead between them. On laps 27 and 29, respectively, Villoresi and Ascari came into the pits to refuel. During his stop, Ascari also replaced both rear wheels of his Maserati, and the extra time taken for this stop put him 50 seconds behind his teammate, but he retained second place. He lost a further 16 seconds to Villoresi during the second round of pit stops, putting him almost a full minute behind the leader at that point. However, Villoresi, who posted the fastest lap of the race (2:52.0), suffered an unusual mishap when his tachometer's fixings failed and the unit fell out of the Maserati's dashboard. In addition to not now knowing the speed of his engine, the tachometer lodged underneath Villoresi's clutch pedal and prevented him from using the clutch for the remainder of the race. Despite this, Villoresi managed to hold on to the lead and proved the eventual winner, 14 seconds ahead of Ascari and half a lap ahead of Gerard. The only other finisher on the same lap as the leaders, but only a few seconds from being lapped, was Rosier's Talbot-Lago.

Mizithra or myzithra ( ) is a Greek whey cheese or mixed milk-whey cheese from sheep or goats, or both. It is sold both as a fresh cheese, similar to Italian ricotta, and as a salt-dried grating cheese, similar to Italian ricotta salata. The ratio of milk to whey usually is 7 to 3.
It is primarily produced on the island of Crete but is widespread throughout Greece. It is essentially the same as Anthotyros though the latter may contain some cow's milk. In Cyprus a similar cheese is known as "Anari" (Αναρή in Greek, Nor in Cypriot Turkish, Lor in Turkish).
Production
Mizithra is made from raw, whole ewe's or goat's milk in the simplest way possible: milk is brought to a slow boil for a few minutes and then curdled by adding rennet or whey from a previous batch (see below) or else some acidic substance such as lemon juice, vinegar or even a fresh broken fig tree sprig. As soon as curds have formed they are poured into a cheesecloth bag and hung to drain. The whey dripping out of the bag can be used to curdle the next batch of mizithra. After a few days mizithra forms a sweet, moist, soft mass molded in the shape of the hanging bag with a rounded bottom and a conical, wrinkly top. At this stage it is called "sweet" or "fresh mizithra" and may be eaten or, often, baked in pies.
Xynomizithra
Mizithra that is salted and aged becomes dryer, denser, saltier and more sour. This xynomizithra 'sour mizithra' is often grated.
Serving
The cheese is soft, snow-white, creamy, and moist. Since no salt is added to mizithra it has an almost sweet and milky taste. It is eaten as dessert with honey or as mezes with olives and tomato. It is used as a table cheese, as well as in salads, pastries and in baking, notably in little cheese pies (handful size) and Sfakiani pita (pie from the Sfakia region).
In its salted, aged form it is considered the grating cheese par excellence of Greek cuisine, and is especially suited for sprinkling over hot pasta.
Toponymy
The town of Mystras takes its name from a cone-shaped hill, called Mizithra from its resemblance to the cheese (Steven Runciman, A Traveller's Alphabet, "Morea").

Esk War Memorial is a heritage-listed memorial at Ipswich Street, Esk, Somerset Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by George Brockwell Gill and built in 1920 by Frank Williams & Co. It is also known as Esk Memorial Park. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.
History
Esk Memorial Park was proclaimed a reserve for memorial purposes in 1979, but a First World War memorial has stood on the site, at the intersection of Highland and Ipswich Streets, since 1921.
The memorial was commissioned by the Esk Patriotic Committee on behalf of the Shire of Esk. Subscriptions commenced in 1916, and tenders were called in April 1919 by prominent Ipswich architect George Brockwell Gill. The foundation stone was laid on 30 November 1920, and the memorial was unveiled on 28 September 1921 by General Lachlan Chisholm Wilson. The masonry work was carried out by the Ipswich firm of Frank Williams & Co., and the art metalwork was supplied by Wunderlich Ltd of Sydney. It cost .
This was not the first war memorial in the shire. Colinton had erected an honour board at the local School of Arts building in 1916, and a stone memorial in 1917. The Toogoolawah War Memorial had been unveiled in March 1917.
In 1983 the memorial park was extended, and a stone memorial to Captain Patrick Logan, commandant of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement who was murdered while exploring the Brisbane Valley in 1830, was erected in the park in 1984. The site was landscaped in 1985.
In 1988 some of the lettering on the First World War memorial was restored, and two plaques commemorating Australian sacrifice in post-1945 conflicts were affixed. In 1991 another plaque was attached, honouring those who fell in the Second World War.
Description
Esk Memorial Park, which contains two stone monuments and landscaped paths and gardens, is located in the main street of Esk.
The First World War memorial consists of a sandstone plinth with four ionic corner pilasters and an entablature sheeted in bronze. Recessed into each of the four faces is a marble tiled panel with a bronze honour roll of 462 shire residents who enlisted together with the letters AIF and its emblem. The memorial sits on a stepped base of concrete aggregate.
Three bronze honour rolls bearing the names of 83 local men who fell during the First World War are fixed to the side and rear of the plinth. Four commemorative plaques bearing inscriptions 1939 – World War II 1945, 1914 – The Great War – In Honour Of Our Boys – 1919, Korea – Malaya, and Borneo – Vietnam are fixed to the front of the plinth.
Also located within the park is a memorial to Captain Logan. This consists of a single, upright sandstone block. Fixed to the northern face is a bronze plaque bearing an inscription in white lettering.
The park is landscaped with native trees and palms, and includes pathways, a barbecue area, seating and a children's playground.
Heritage listing
Esk War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
Esk War Memorial, erected in 1921, is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being evidence of a widespread social movement expressing Australian patriotism and nationalism during and immediately following the First World War [1914–18].

Controversies have surrounded bikeways, particularly in North America and the United Kingdom and specifically between those who prefer to focus on education rather than separated cycling infrastructure and those who prefer to create dedicated facilities to make cyclists safer and make it more inviting to a wider public. Other dissenters say safety is better served by using the road space for parking.
Context controversy
Some detractors argue that one must be careful in interpreting the operation of dedicated or segregated bikeways/cycle facilities across different designs and contexts; what works for the Netherlands won't necessarily work elsewhere. Proponents argue that segregated cycle facilities have been implemented in many jurisdictions and are both popular and safe.
The Netherlands, detractors argue, is a flat country and the compact design of Dutch towns keeps cycling distances short as reflected in the Dutch people's choice of bicycle, i.e. the typical Dutch roadster, which has either no gears or a three-speed hub gear and back pedal brakes. Other countries may have different common urban designs, such as sprawling suburbs, and different cycling cultures where riders may ride bicycles with a wider range of gears and like to travel more quickly, such as those who cycle regularly for sport and exercise, who may choose to ride to incorporate some aerobic exercise into their day. So, while a sidepath system may work for slower cyclists, detractors argue, they might not work for cyclists using faster bicycle types who cannot use such a system safely at their higher normal cycling speeds. However, this is contradicted by members of the Royal Dutch Cycling Union, who state that Dutch competitive cyclists have no problems with training in the Netherlands. The Danish Roads Directorate state that the cycle track system "functions best when cyclists travel at relatively low speeds" but what is meant by 'relatively low speeds' is not made clear. There are instances where cycle tracks / sidepaths can accommodate fast cycling as evidenced in this video of a velomobile on a Dutch cycle track.
As more cycle tracks are built in North American cities, more research is being conducted on the uptake and safety of cycle tracks. North American cities that have recently installed cycle tracks have seen significant growth in cyclists using these roads. It is useful, therefore, to use North American examples of cycle tracks/side paths and compare them to similar roads used by cyclists. This will provide better data using cyclists on similar terrain and presumably similar bicycles and experience.
Cycling activists in favour of vehicular cycling have opposed cycle tracks and paths on the principle that they might not be created with the "fast cyclist type" in mind. The UK's Sustrans guidelines for the National Cycle Network are based on recreational use with a design user who is an unaccompanied twelve-year-old. The Dublin Transportation Office has advertised their cycle facilities as being based on an unaccompanied ten-year-old design user. This raises the issue of what happens if different cyclist types find themselves forced onto such devices either by legal coercion or as a result of motorist aggression. This issue is captured in a 1996 review of the Sustrans approach from the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers. The fast cycle commuter must not be driven off the highway onto a route that is designed for a 12-year-old or a novice on a leisure trip, because if that happens, the whole attempt to enlarge the use of the bicycle will have failed
Maintenance controversy
Facilities must be made wide enough for the street sweepers and snow plows typically used in a locale, or the locale will need to ensure that they are regularly swept or plowed by machines that will fit.
Some locales have issues with road debris in the cycle paths, such as Milton Keynes, UK, finding that cycle path users are seven times more likely to get punctures than are road cyclists. In Ireland some cyclists have demanded simultaneous commitment to maintenance and sweeping as cycle paths are built.
In areas subject to high leaf-fall in autumn, or high snowfall in winter, any cycle facilities must be subject to regular clearing if they are to remain usable. Danish guidance specifies three different categories of cycle track. Category "A" tracks must be kept clear of snow 24 hours a day, category "B" tracks are swept or cleared daily, and category "C" receive less regular winter maintenance. In 2007 the city of Copenhagen spent DKK 9.9 million (US$1.72 million, €1.33 million) annually on maintaining its cycle track network. German federal law requires local authorities to declassify cycle tracks that do not conform to strict design and maintenance criteria. In the UK, facilities for non-motorized traffic are not normally salted or gritted in icy conditions, potentially making them dangerous or unrideable.
Cycle lanes avoid this problem, as they are part of the road and can be easily accessed by maintenance vehicles operating on that road, incurring no extra cost. They only become filled with debris if the road is not maintained or the lane is purposely avoided.
Tracks used at night can be illuminated by conventional means, or by paving with glowing material.
Usage controversy
There are many factors, such as cycle tracks and other cycling infrastructure, which contribute to cycling levels. A number of cities have demonstrated that particular cycle tracks will increase bike traffic on those routes, as shown, for example, in Montreal, New York City and Copenhagen. Bike usage increased by 40% in areas of Montreal where the city invested in bike paths and lanes. In Copenhagen bike traffic increased by about 20% because of the construction of cycle tracks. The construction of separated bike lanes on Dunsmuir Street and Viaduct in Vancouver, Canada, saw bike traffic volumes on the street more than double from before the construction. NYC likewise saw cycling rates nearly triple on weekdays and doubled on weekends when the bike path was installed alongside Prospect Park West.
Seville, Spain, is an example of what is possible on a city scale when a large investment is made in cycling infrastructure over a short period of time. In 2006 there were around 6000 bike trips made daily in the city of around 700,000. By 2009 there were about 50,000 daily bike trips. During those three years 8 urban bike paths totaling 70 km were built; the city centre was closed to motorised traffic; school projects were funded to create safe school paths; traffic calming measures were provided in school districts and the bicycle sharing system ‘Sevici' was launched. The combination of all these factors helped to create a dramatic change in cycling rates.
After a certain trip modal share it may take more than just installing cycle tracks to create large increases in cycle rates. Cycling rates in the Netherlands peaked in the 1960s and dropped dramatically until the mid-1970s. The decline in bicycle use was "not only caused by mass motorization but also by the related, fairly unco-ordinated process of urbanization and by scores of social, spatial and economic developments", such as a decrease in population density and increased travel distances. The bicycle was almost completely left out of the national government's vision. Certain cities, however, such as Amsterdam and Eindhoven, were slowly implementing more bicycle-positive policies: for example, bike-only streets and allowing cyclists to ignore one way streets. Throughout the 70s cycling rates increased, but the investments in bike paths made in the subsequent period had less effect. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s the Netherlands spent 1.5 billion guilders (US$945 million) on cycling infrastructure, yet cycling levels stayed practically the same.
When the flagship Delft Bicycle Route project was evaluated, the Institute for Road Safety Research claimed that the results were "not very positive: bicycle use had not increased, neither had the road safety. A route network of bicycle facilities has, apparently, no added value for bicycle use or road safety". The study by Louisse, C.J. et al. however, did find that "[a]lthough the total number of victims among cyclists did not decline, the percentage of fatalities and severely injured did drop dramatically." A more comprehensive policy change in addition to bicycle routes, on the other hand, helped to raise the cycling rates in Groningen where 75% of all traffic is by bike or foot. Groningen focused on land use policy, city planning and economic
policy changes to achieve very high cycling rates.
In the UK, a ten-year study of the effect of cycle facilities in eight towns and cities found no evidence that they had resulted in any diversion from other transport modes. The construction of of "Strategic cycle network" in Dublin has been accompanied by a 15% fall in commuter cycling and 40% falls in cycling by second and third level students.
In some locales bike traffic increases first and bike paths and lanes are installed in order to catch up to the demand. For instance, bike planning in Davis, California was driven by the prior existence of a "dramatic volume" of cyclists in the 1960s. Research on the German bicycle boom of the 1980s paints a picture of German local authorities struggling to keep up with the growth of cycling rather than this growth being driven by their interventions. In relation to the UK, it has been argued that locally high levels of cycling are more likely to result from factors other than cycle facilities. These include an existing cycling culture and historically high levels of cycle use, compact urban forms, lack of hills and lack of barriers such as high speed intersections.
However, Pucher and Buehler, U.S.-based researchers, have stated that "the provision of separate cycling facilities" appears to be one of the keys to the achieving of high levels of cycling in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. Furthermore, urban planners in some cities in the U.S. have started to use predictive analytics to estimate the extent to which usage of proposed bicycle paths will improve health outcomes in specific neighborhoods.
Segregating cyclists controversy
In some cases, cycle paths have been constructed so bicycles could be prohibited from the main roadway. There is a debate among cyclists as to whether this is for the benefit of motorists or bicyclists.
In 1996 the UK Cyclists' Touring Club and the Institute of Highways and Transportation jointly produced a set of Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure guidelines that placed segregated cycling facilities at the bottom of the hierarchy of measures designed to promote cycling. Planners at the Directorate Infrastructure Traffic and Transport in Amsterdam place cyclists and motorists together on roads with speed limits at or below , and segregate them through bicycle lanes at higher limits. This is in a context where most of the measures prioritised by Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure (HGV restrictions, area-wide traffic calming, speed limit enforcement etc.) are already in place – see Utility cycling for more detail.

Kurmangazy District (, , ) is a district of Atyrau Region in Kazakhstan. The administrative center of the district is the selo of Kurmangazy. Population:
History
Bukeevskaya province () is an administrative-territorial unit within the Russian Republic and the RSFSR. The center is the city of Urda (until 1918 - the village of Khanskaya Headquarters; in 1918-1920 - the Kirghiz steppe).
The province was formed on July 1, 1917 on the territory of the Bukey Horde, which until then had been de facto administratively subordinate to the Astrakhan province (de jure administered through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). By 1919, it was divided into Kalmyk, Kamysh-Samar, Naryn, I Primorsky, II Primorsky, Talovsky and Torgunsky districts, as well as the region of the Volga-Caspian Kyrgyzstan.
In 1920, when the Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed, the Bukeev province became part of it.
In 1921, the region of the Volga-Caspian Kirghizia was abolished, and its territory became part of the 2nd Primorsky district.
In 1922, Dengiz, Dzhangalinsky, and Urdinsky uyezds were formed. Kalmyk, Kamysh-Samar, Naryn, Torgun, 1st and 2nd Primorsky counties were abolished.
June 6, 1925 Bukeevskaya province was included in the Ural province of the Kazakh ASSR.
The district was formed in 1928 under the name of Dengiz district. On September 9, 1993, it was renamed Kurmangazinsky district in honor of Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly.

Nancy Conz (May 1, 1957 in Southampton, Massachusetts – February 8, 2017 in Southampton) was an American long distance runner and "pioneer" marathoner.
Early life
Conz grew up in Southampton, Massachusetts. In 1975, Conz graduated from Hampshire Regional High School in Massachusetts.
Career
Conz held four American long distance running records set in the early 1980s. Three of those records, 15,000 meters, 10 miles and the one hour run were set in one track race at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts on June 25, 1981; but these 3 all were broken by Molly Huddle in a 1 Nov 2020 event.
In 1980, Conz won her first attempt at the marathon in the Five College Marathon in South Hadley, Massachusetts. This was a qualifier for the marathon in London, England.
In August 1980, Conz ran her first international race and won second place at the Avon International Marathon for Women in London, England. Conz wore bib number 184. Conz finished in 2:36:02, and it was also the #2 time in the world that year. She returned the following year to win Avon, this time in Ottawa, beating her friend and future; winning the first ever women's Olympic gold medalist in the marathon, Joan Benoit. She also won Freihofer's Run for Women that same year. In 1982, she won the Chicago Marathon in a personal best of 2:33:22.
Conz was self-coached, her only previous coaching coming from her days at Hampshire Regional High School.
Personal life
In 1979 Conz married Paul Conz, a former blues drummer. They have two children, Derek Conz and Jarryd Conz.
On February 8, 2017, Conz died in Southampton, Massachusetts after a near 20 year battle with adenoid cystic carcinoma. She was 59.

Brown is often recalled for an event on September 2, 1934, in which he accidentally shot and killed his friend, crooner Russ Columbo, when an antique pistol discharged and the bullet ricocheted into Columbo's skull.
After Columbo's death, Brown was cleared of all charges, but he remained deeply affected by the incident.
Brown served in the military during World War II as a photography instructor. He died of a stroke at the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Hospital.

In enzymology, an adenosylmethionine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
S-adenosyl-L-methionine + H2O L-homoserine + methylthioadenosine
Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl-L-methionine and H2O, whereas its two products are L-homoserine and methylthioadenosine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on ether bonds involving sulfur (thioether and trialkylsulfonium hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine hydrolase. Other names in common use include S-adenosylmethionine cleaving enzyme, methylmethionine-sulfonium-salt hydrolase, and adenosylmethionine lyase.

Clement Lim (Lim Yong En, ; born 5 April 1993) is a Singaporean swimmer who competed in the 50m and 100m freestyle, the 50m breaststroke, the 4x100m medley relay, and the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relay. Lim represented Singapore at the 2010 Youth Olympics Games (YOG). In 2012, Lim was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), an incurable genetic disease that affects the spin and causes stiff and sore back, but went on to capture 4 gold medals at the 2013 and 2015 Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games).
Career
At the 2009 SEA Games in Vientiane, Laos, Lim captured his first gold medal at the games with a game record time of 7:30.73s in the 4x200m freestyle relay event with teammates Marcus Cheah, Joshua Lim and Zach Ong. At the next meet in 2011, Lim captured two more gold medals in Palembang, Indonesia, in the 4x100m and the 4x200m freestyle relay events.
At the 2013 SEA Games in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, Lim once again set a game record, this time in the 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3:21.74s, with teammates Danny Yeo, Darren Lim and Joseph Schooling. He also captured a gold in the 4x100m medley relay with a time of 3:43.62s by swimming the final leg in 50.24s.
In his final SEA games appearance in 2015, Lim captured two more gold medals in Singapore, both in new game record time. In the 4x100m freestyle relay, Lim swam the third leg in 49.81s to help his team, which consisted of Joseph Schooling, Danny Yeo and Quah Zheng Wen, finish the race in 3:19.59s. Together with Quah Zheng Wen, Lionel Khoo and Joseph Schooling, Lim then swam the freestyle final leg of the 4x100m medley in 49.61s to complete the race in 3:38.25s.
Lim also participated in the 2014 Commonwealth Games and 2014 Asian Games, and recorded his personal best of 23.26s in 50m freestyle that year. He represented Singapore in the 2010 Youth Olympics Games.
Personal life
In 2012, while serving his National Service, Lim lost vision in his right eye and was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). The genetic disease caused inflammation of his spinal joints and gave him perpetual stiff and sore back. As a result of his condition, Lim has to rely on drugs approved by sports medical body to cope with the pain. In 2014, Lim's condition flared up and left him unable to swim for a month. The incident made him more eager to return to sports and motivated him to clock his personal best timing for 50m and 100m freestyle a few months later at the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the 2014 Asian Games.
Lim studied sports science and management at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
Charity
Lim participated in the inaugural Swim for Rheumatology event organized by the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) to create awareness for rheumatism and raise fund for rheumatology research in Singapore. The event helped raise S$103,000 for the cause.

The Gabon woodpecker (Dendropicos gabonensis) is a species of small woodpecker in the family Picidae which occurs in western central Africa.
Description
The Gabon woodpecker is a small woodpecker with a short bill which is quite broad at the base. It has plain green upperparts, a plain dark tail and heavily spotted underparts with a yellowish background colour. The crown is brownish but the males have a red hindcrown and nape, as well as an indistinct, narrow moustachial. The adult females lack red on the head, however both sexes of juveniles have red on the centre of the crown. The subspecies D.g. reichenowihas a more distinct moustachial stripe, broader underpart streaking and a lesser extent of red on the adult male's head than the nominate subspecies. They are 16–17 cm in length and weigh 24–30 g.
Distribution, subspecies and taxonomy
There are two currently recognised subspecies, they and their distribution are:
Dendropicos gabonensis reichenowi Sjöstedt, 1893: Southern Nigeria to south-western Cameroon.
Dendropicos gabonensis gabonensis (J. P. Verreaux & J. B. É. Verreaux, 1851): Southern Cameroon. except the south-west, and south-western Central African Republic south to southern Republic of Congo, and east across northern and central Democratic Republic of Congo, east to the western slopes of the Ruwenzori Mountains and south to western Kasai to extreme western Uganda; reports from Cabinda the exclave of Angola are considered dubious.
The melancholy woodpecker Dendropicos lugubris which breeds from Sierra Leone east to Nigeria, is sometimes considered a subspecies of Gabon woodpecker and D.g. reichenowi is intermediate in appearance between lugubris and gabonensis.
Habitat
The Gabon woodpecker occurs in forest edge, tall secondary growth and the wooded edges of farmland, normally lower than 1400m above sea level. It avoids dense forest and savannas.
Habits
The Gabon woodpecker breeds in September and October in the west and June in Uganda. It forages by probing into and gleaning from bark, as well as pecking at and prising off pieces of bark and soft wood.

was a prominent post-World War II Japanese novelist, short-story writer, essayist, literary critic, and television documentary writer. He was distinguished by his knowledge, intellect, sense of humor and conversational skills, and although his style has been criticized as wordy and obtuse, he was one of the more popular Japanese writers in the late Shōwa period.
Early life
Kaikō was born in the Tennoji Ward of Osaka as the son of an elementary school teacher. In 1948, he enrolled in the Law Department of Osaka City University, but was often absent from class, as he had to take a variety of part-time jobs in order to pay for his tuition. While in school, rather than study law he was sidetracked by the works of Motojirō Kajii, Mitsuharu Kaneko and Atsushi Nakajima. He also translated the works of Sherwood Anderson and Louis Aragon into Japanese. He graduated in 1953 and moved to Tokyo, where he took a job with Kotobukiya (the present Suntory), where he worked in the public-relations department.
He married Yōko Maki, a poet.
Literary career
Kaikō published his first work, Na no nai machi (Nameless City, 1953) in the literary magazine Kindai Bungaku soon after his move to Tokyo. It was largely ignored by critics. However, his second work, a short story titled Panniku (Panic, 1957) published in the Shin Nippon Bunkaku, caused a sensation for its unusual concept and style. It was a story about a dedicated forester in a rural prefecture of Japan, who struggles against government incompetence and corruption. Kaikō wrote the story as a satirical allegory comparing human beings to mice.
Kaikō won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize in 1957 with his Hadaka no ōsama (The Naked King), a story critical of the pressures placed on school children by Japan's educational system.
Kaikō is considered a leftist activist, respected in many Indochinese countries, in particular, for his vocal opposition to Japan's support of the United States' policies in Indochina in the 1960s. He was one of the founders of the Beheiren (Betonamu ni heiwa o! Shimin rengo), or the League for Peace in Vietnam. This activity was related to his experience as a war correspondent in Vietnam with the Asahi Shimbun; he was briefly imprisoned by the Viet Cong. These experiences translated into his novel, Kagayakeru yami (Into a Black Sun, 1968), an account of a Japanese journalist experiencing first-hand the life of the Americans and South Vietnamese troops in Vietnam. The novel won the prestigious Mainichi Book Award.
However, Kaikō had a wide range of topics in his repertory. Natsu no yami (Darkness in Summer, 1971) was essentially a romance between a reporter and an expatriate Japanese woman living in Europe.
Kaikō enriched the Japanese language with the word "apache", to denote scavengers of recyclables, described in his novel, Japan's Threepenny Opera.
Considered a gourmet, in his later years, Kaikō wrote numerous essays on food and drink, as well as appearing on food-related or fishing-related TV shows and in TV commercials.
He died of esophageal cancer. His grave is at the Shorei-in sub-temple of the Engaku-ji Temple complex, Kamakura, Kanagawa.
Legacy
His former house in Chigasaki, Kanagawa has been preserved as a memorial museum.

At the Grand Final Jones performed eighteenth in the running order and then, in the second half of the final, went on to score 111 points through combined voting from the jury vote and the popular vote. Jones also managed to score 12 points from the Australia professional Jury. An article in the International Business Times stated that she blamed Brexit for the "disappointing" result though Jones said in a televised interview with the BBC that she had noticed no effect from Brexit in the attitude towards her from fellow contestants and fans of the show.

American patriotic music is a part of the culture and history of the United States since its founding in the 18th century and has served to encourage feelings of honor for the country's forefathers and for national unity. These songs include hymns, military themes, national songs, and music from stage and screen, as well as songs adapted from poems. Much of American patriotic music owes its origins to six main wars—the American Revolution, the American Indian Wars, the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, the American Civil War, and the Spanish–American War. During the period prior to American independence, much of America's patriotic music was aligned with the political ambitions of the British in the new land and so several songs are tied with the country's British origin.
Colonial era
"The Liberty Song", written by Founding Father John Dickinson in 1768 to the music of William Boyce's "Heart of Oak", is perhaps the first patriotic song written in America. The song contains the line "by uniting we stand, by dividing we fall", which was an overture to the feelings of common blood and origin the Americans had whilst fighting the French and Indian War, and is also the first recorded use of the sentiment. Additionally, other songs gained prominence in keeping with British and American unity namely "The British Grenadiers," and "God Save the King". However, with the War of Independence the tunes of the last two were combined with new words while "Yankee Doodle", long a tune and lyric addressed to the unique American population descended from the British became widely popular. Political and cultural links between the colony and Great Britain can perhaps explain the ongoing popularity of the two former tunes, despite the war for independence. Hail Columbia was written for Washington's nomination and was the de facto national anthem until 1931. It is still the vice presidential anthem today.
Nineteenth century
In 1814, Washington lawyer Francis Scott Key wrote a poem, "Defence of Fort McHenry," after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry in the Chesapeake Bay during the War of 1812. Once again, owing to the origin of America from British nationals, the lyrics were later set to music common to British and American sailors, but eventually became world-famous as "The Star-Spangled Banner," and was designated the United States' official national anthem in 1931.
After centuries of struggling and fighting hostile Native Americans, diseases, and nature, Americans had breached the Appalachian mountain chain and pushed into the wide open areas of the far west. Thus, songs such as "My Country, 'Tis of Thee," composed in 1831, have as themes natural wonder combined with freedom and liberty. Others, such as "America the Beautiful," express appreciation for the natural beauty of the United States and the hope for a better nation, wrote one hymn editor. However, in contrast to "My Country, 'Tis of Thee" and the "Star Spangled Banner", "America the Beautiful" does not have the triumphalism found in many patriotic American songs. It was originally a poem composed by Katharine Lee Bates after she had experienced the view from Pikes Peak of fertile ground as far as the eye could see, and was sung to a variety of tunes until the present one, written as a hymn tune in 1882 by Samuel Ward, became associated with it.
In 1843, the song Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean was written and was most popular during the civil war. The song mostly praises the army and navy in a rousing manner. It later was commonly used in Popeye Cartoons and in the 21st century the melody is occasionally used and the lyrics rarely.
During the events leading up to the American Civil War, both the North and the South generated a number of songs to stir up patriotic sentiments such as "Battle Hymn of the Republic", and "Dixie". However, after the Civil War, the sentiments of most patriotic songs were geared to rebuilding and consolidating the United States. During the Spanish–American War in the 1890s, songwriters continued to write patriotic tunes that honored America's soldiers and rallied citizens in support of the war. Songs such as "Brave Dewey and His Men" and "The Charge of the Roosevelt Riders" lauded Commodore George Dewey and Theodore Roosevelt. Around this time, John Philip Sousa began composing many of his famous patriotic marches, including "The Stars and Stripes Forever" and "The Washington Post March." Songs such as "The Black KPs", likely labelled racist and offensive by modern listeners, were intended to rally the public behind the war effort.
Twentieth and twenty-first centuries
World War I produced patriotic American songs such as "Over There" by popular songwriter George M. Cohan. Cohan composed the song April 6, 1917, when he saw headlines announcing the U.S. had entered World War I. Cohan also is famous for penning "Yankee Doodle Dandy," an over-the-top parody of patriotic music. A 1918 Irving Berlin composition, "God Bless America", is sometimes considered an unofficial national anthem of the United States and is often performed at sporting events alongside (or, in some rare cases, such as Ronan Tynan, in place of) "The Star-Spangled Banner." In 1940, Woody Guthrie wrote "This Land Is Your Land" in response to his dislike of "God Bless America", calling it unrealistic and complacent. The World War II era produced a significant number of patriotic songs in the Big Band and Swing format. Popular patriotic songs of the time included "Remember Pearl Harbor" and "God Bless America". Patriotic songs in the later half of the 20th century included "Ballad of the Green Berets" during the Vietnam War, Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the USA" during the years of the first Gulf War and again after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Meri Durga (translation: My Durga) is an Indian television series on Star Plus produced by Ravindra Gautam and Pradeep Kumar under the banner Paperback Films. It starred Ananya Agarwal, Vicky Ahuja, Srishti Jain and Paras Kalnawat. The show premiered on 26 January 2017 and went off air on 17 March 2018. The series is digitally available on Disney+ Hotstar.
Plot
The story traces the journey of Durga, a girl from Barwala, who aspires to become a runner. It revolves around the sensitive relationship of a father and his daughter. Highlighting the realities of life, Durga's father, Yashpal Choudhary works as a peon in a school in Haryana. His only dream is to educate his daughter Durga for a better future despite the odds. But despite trying hard to study and prove herself, Durga can't reach Yashpal's expectations. Yashpal works as a school peon and has a progressive viewpoint when it comes to educating a girl or a boy – unlike his relatives. Durga, on the other hand, is a lively, positive twelve-year-old who is enjoys her childhood in and around the corners of Haryana. She loves running behind kites and climbing on the mango tree. Besides enjoying her childhood, Durga strives to fulfill her father's dream. But she cannot understand the calculations and hence finds herself confused between alphabets and numbers. Influenced by her coach, Rana sir, Yaspal allows Durga to become an athlete and has her admitted to a school in Hisar. Durga emerges as the winner in the national race but the runnerup, Arti, has drugs mixed in her food. So Durga tests positive for drugs when she is tested and is expelled from running for five years. So her family faces the villagers' ire and even her best friend Sanjay Singh Ahlawat (SP) believes Arti and shuns Durga, stunning Durga, who then quits running forever.
5 years later
After five years Durga is now grown up and is responsible for the care of her family as well as her dreams. She meets SP again in college in Hisar. When SP finds out that Durga has joined the same college as him, he threatens her to leave the college as he still believes that Durga really consumed drugs to win the race, but the situation normalises when SP discovers the truth and they fall in love. Later Durga learns that SP's mother, Gayatri Devi, a politician and businesswoman from Hisar, had put drugs in her food five years earlier and exposes her to the media. So Gayatri misleads SP, turning him against Durga. SP and Arti then plot against Durga. Amidst this, SP and Durga marry each other and Durga moves in with the Ahlawat family in Hisar. After being tortured by SP and his family, Durga learns that Gayatri was a national athlete Jassi who was expelled from the sports academy and helps her to keep it a secret. Arti tries to frame Durga in charges of sexual abuse of a doctor appointed by the sports authority but SP discovers this and takes the blame to save both Durga and Arti's dignity and in a weak moment Durga and SP consummate their marriage. SP meets with a deadly accident while dropping Durga at her state championship post, so he suspects Gayatri of foul play as she lies that she brought him to hospital (which actually Durga did and the former partially remembers because of his unconscious state due to severe head injury and bleeding at that time). He feigns insanity, then realises Durga's innocence and his mother's involvement in their suffering. He initially breaks all ties with his mother but reconciles after she realises her mistakes and encourages Durga to fulfill her dreams. The family coalesces and Durga begins to train for the nationals. Arti's father threatens to destroy Durga's family if she participates in the national race. He kidnaps her family on the day of the race but SP and Durga rescue them and Durga wins the race. Durga is admitted to the academy in Rohtak for being qualified for international championships. There SP is hired as a security guard due to their business being taken over by Arti's father in revenge. However a new competitor, Tanvi, the niece of the head director of the sports academy, plots to oust Durga from the academy to secure her first position. She even tries to defame Durga and SP for having an extramarital affair and tries to show Durga pregnant after learning of SP and Durga being married to each other as her final attempt. However Arti has a change of heart after her defeat at nationals and exposes her father's involvement with Tanvi as his attempt to retaliate against Durga. The series concludes with Durga succeeding in her attempts and SP and Durga regaining their family business and home from Purushottam's ownership and both the Chaudhary and Ahlawat families celebrating their victory in Hisar.

Production
Speaking about the series, producer Ravindra Gautham said, "Meri Durga is the introspection of a father's mind and heart. We very rarely see the father's side onscreen. And the show also supports girl education which I feel is the need of the hour." Before its premiere, the series was promoted by the main cast in Ludhiana, Punjab on 16 January 2017.
The series was mainly filmed at Powai. However some scenes were also filmed at Haryana and Punjab.
In June 2017, the storyline took a leap of five years. Initially it starred Ananya Agarwal and Vicky Ahuja as young Durga and Yashpal. After the leap, it starred Srishti Jain as adult Durga, Paras Kalnawat as adult SP opposite Jain along with Ahuja.
Initially, Aalisha Panwar was cast to play adult Durga after the leap. But, on the last moment as she joined another show, Jain was cast. Vishal Bharadwaj was supposed to play Madhav. However as he was considered not suitable for the character in his first scene itself, Adhvik Mahajan was cast.

You are a 2009 American drama film directed by and starring Melora Hardin (in her directorial debut). The film also stars Gildart Jackson (who also wrote the film), Brenda Strong, Allison Mack, Amy Pietz, Jerry Hardin, Don Michael Paul, and Joely Fisher.
Plot
Husband and wife Rawdon and Miranda are soulmates. Their love for each other is palpable as they lie in bed treasuring their 6 month old daughter Quincey. Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding.
Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life.
Staying as strong as he can Rawdon takes Quincey to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel. It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel.
Rawdon continues to see visions of her. Initially these visions help him—at home she gives him advice about parenting; in Portugal she softens his hardness; when he hides in the closet to isolate himself she snaps some sense into him and insists that Rawdon keep her mother, father and brother—Quincey's grandparents and Uncle Jack – firmly in Quincey's life.
Rawdon explains these visions to his therapist Paula as she helps him with the long grieving process and over a period of years, with Quincey growing before our eyes, Rawdon tries to move on with his life.
He tries to date other women. Disastrously. He falls instantly in love with Sam who ends up becoming his good friend and a surrogate Aunt to Quincey. He dates a woman named Kimberly who Quincey wisely suggests is far better suited to her Uncle Jack. And she is right. When Jack and Kimberly get married, Rawdon is their best man.
All the while Miranda's metaphysical presence is with him. He goes from needing her, to blaming her, to being angry at her. But for a long, long time he won't let her go away. Part of him wants her to stay alive in his imagination forever and gradually this presence that helped him initially becomes an impediment to his moving on with life.
In contrast to her Dad's stagnation, Quincey is growing up fast, and in no time she is dating, stealing cars, trying to set her Dad up with her best friend's divorced Moms, going off to University and falling in love with a Frenchman named Philippe.
It is not until Rawdon finally plucks up the courage to ask out somebody who might just be right for him that he finally, tearfully, asks Miranda to leave him.
This is ultimately a coming of age story. We watch Quincey literally come of age whilst her father, emotionally, comes of age. He eventually gives up the now stultifying memory of his dead wife and arrives at a new beginning.
The end of this story is also the beginning of another where Rawdon, surrounded by the people he loves—but without Miranda—finds himself giving Quincey away at her wedding to Philippe. And here he makes the speech that Miranda made in bed with him and Quincey so many years before.

In 1831, a famous Armenian merchant in Batavia, Jacob Arrathoon, who represented the firm of Shamirians in India, erected a wooden church calling it the Church of St Hripsima, later renamed the Church of Holy Resurrection. The wooden church was damaged by fire in early 1844. Jacob Arrathoon quickly repaired the damage, but died shortly after on January 19. His widow Mary replaced the wooden church with one of stone and mortar; it was completed in 1854, and was renamed the Church of St John.
Mrs Mary Arrathoon and by her maiden sister Thagoohie Manook supported the church financially. Both sisters inherited the entire wealth of their bachelor brother George Manook, who had devoted a part of this legacy towards construction of this stone church. The church was situated in a very central part of Batavia (Jakarta), on the crossroads of the famous Royal Park renamed Medan Merdeka. In 1961, the new Indonesian government claimed the ground on which the Armenian church stood since 1831, and the church was demolished. Only 20 people were left in Batavia (Jakarta) of the Armenian community after the exodus. The last church service was offered by Rev Aramais Mirzaian, who had come from Sydney.
The Surabaya church was built by the same benefactors who built the Armenian church of St. John in Batavia. It was the centre of religious, social, educational, and national life of Armenians in Surabaya. Beside the church, there were living quarters for the priest and his family. There was the Edgar Hall with a stage for performing stage plays, concerts, lecturers and singers coming sometimes from overseas. The Manook Arrathoon school had three classrooms where Armenian religion history was taught twice a week on Mondays, and Thursdays from 4 to 6 in the afternoons. Sunday school was also held there.
World War II and the Battle of Surabaya
During the Japanese occupation, many Armenians were imprisoned, harassed and killed. Some were arrested by the Kempeitai, tortured and later released.
The British with the Gurkhas bombarded Surabaya, causing the Indonesians to rebel. In the suburb of Kranggan many people were killed and their bodies not found. Among them were five Armenian men who were beheaded with bamboo spears.
Many Armenians were taken by ship to Singapore and accommodated in camps. After six months they were sent back to their homeland in Indonesia, but many chose to relocate. Many went to the Netherlands and from there they moved to the United States, U.K. and Australia.
The families of those Armenians who stayed behind took shelter in the church hall and schoolrooms because it was not safe. They received help and encouragement from then Rev. Khoren Kirakosian.
Religious beliefs and festivals
The Armenians observe Christmas on 6 January.
Armenian and Eastern Orthodox churches consider Easter a greater festival than Christmas, and have certain holiday traditions.
Many members of the Armenian Church fast for 40 days before Easter. Dairy and meat products are prohibited and a strict vegetarian and vegan diet is followed.
The traditional Easter Eve meal consists of pilaf, herb omelet, and nazook (a kind of pastry) yogurt, and coloured eggs. Cracking eggs this means new life that symbolizes the resurrection of Christ from the tombs. The holy week starts on Palm Sunday, with large events on the following Monday and Thursday when the priest will wash the feet of children like Christ did before the last Supper. This occurs during a mass which spans for almost four hours.
The Armenian Apostolic Church has seven sacraments, namely:
Baptism
Conformation
Penance
Holy Eucharist
Holy Matrimony
Holy Orders
Sacraments of the sick
Education
The first principal of the Manook Arrathoon School was Mr. T. C. Jordan a studious person, mastery in Armenian had a good knowledge of Dutch, English and a fair bit of German and French. Author of the 'Armenians in the Netherlands Indies', written in Armenian vernacular printed in 1937 in Jerusalem. He was 76 yrs old when he wrote this book. It is pity, due to niggling dissensions this first and only edition of the book was not distributed or sold.
Mr. M. S. Marcar, president of the General Board of the Armenian community to Java, was in charge of the whole stock of the books and died in the Japanese concentration camp at Bandung. Some say that the books were lost during the Japanese occupation; others say that they were burnt before or during that occupation. There remains however some slight consolation in the fact that a few copies which the author had presented to his intimate friends have been treasured, Mr. J. C. Jordan was married but had no children. Aged 80, he died on 7 October.
The three classrooms of the Manook Arrathoon School were erected by Mr. Lucas M Sarkies at his own expense in memory of his deceased brother Thomas. Mr. Sarkies was also the owner of the well-known Oranje hotel later renamed L.M.S hotel and hotel Sarkies which he took over from his brother Mr. John. M. Sarkies who went back to Julfa, Iran. There were other Armenians who had small boarding houses.
Sports
The Armenian Sports Club (ASC) in Surabaya was established by Mr. Mac Hacobian in 1923. Through the intermediary of close friend Dr Dykerman, Lord Mayor of Surabaya, he was able to secure the extensive sporting grounds at Karang Menjangan and organized the Ninehole Course Golf Club, one of the leading golf clubs in Java. It had prominent Dutch, Danish, British and Japanese members besides the Armenians. The colony's governor was its patron and Surabaya's lord mayor was the honorary president. The club was very successful and prospered.
The ASC also hosted other activities: golf basketball, tennis, hockey, football, bridge, and backgammon. Mr. Hacobian also organized the dramatic society of Surabaya and a branch committee of the Armenian benevolent society and helped with erection of the Armenian church of St George in Surabaya. He received the order of deacon by the venerable archbishop Mesrobe Magistros D.D. who was on a pastoral visit. This allowed him to preach and hold church services.

Kathryn Ellen O'Loughlin (April 24, 1894 – January 16, 1952) was a U.S. Representative from Kansas. After her election, she was married to Daniel M. McCarthy, who served in the Kansas State Senate, and thereupon served under the name of Kathryn O'Loughlin McCarthy. She was the first woman elected to Congress from Kansas.
Born near Hays, Kansas, O'Loughlin attended rural schools. She graduated from the Hays (Kansas) High School in 1913, from the Kansas State Teachers College in 1917, and from the law school of the University of Chicago in 1920.
She was admitted to the bar in 1921 and commenced practice in Chicago, but she returned to Kansas in 1928 and continued the practice of law in Hays. She served as a delegate to the State Democratic conventions in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, and 1936, and she served the Democratic National Conventions in 1940 and 1944. She also served as a member of the Kansas House of Representatives in 1931 and 1932.
O'Loughlin was elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-third Congress (March 4, 1933 – January 3, 1935), defeating Clyde Short in the primary and Charles I. Sparks in the general election. She was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the Seventy-fourth Congress. Her support for the New Deal angered Kansas Republicans, including Governor Alf Landon, who promised to have her defeated. Public opinion in Kansas had shifted against the New Deal, especially the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which McCarthy strongly supported. The GOP nominated Frank Carlson, the chair of the Kansas Republican Party and close ally of Governor Landon. McCarthy was narrowly defeated by Carlson by a margin of 51%-49%, or just under 2,800 votes. Carlson would go on to become one of the most powerful politicians in Kansas history, serving as Governor and later representing the state in the US Senate.
After this, she resumed the practice of law. She also owned and operated a large ranch and was part owner of an automobile agency at Hays and Ellis, Kansas. O'Loughlin died in Hays, Kansas, and she was interred in St. Joseph's Cemetery.

The 2020 United States presidential election in Hawaii was held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020, as part of the 2020 United States presidential election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia participated. Hawaii voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, incumbent President Donald Trump, and running mate Vice President Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his running mate California Senator Kamala Harris. Hawaii has four electoral votes in the Electoral College.
Hawaii was the first state in the 2020 election cycle to exceed the voter turnout in 2016, causing the state to attract attention as a representation of an overall trend in increased early voting during the general election.
Biden won Hawaii with 63.7% of the vote and a 29.5% margin over Trump, who earned 34.3%. Both major parties improved over 2016, when third parties earned nearly 8% of the vote; Biden's percentage of the vote was slightly higher than Hillary Clinton's 62.9%, while Trump improved over his 30.3% share of the 2016 vote. However, Biden's margin of victory was smaller than Clinton's 32.5%. Hawaii was one of only seven states and the District of Columbia where Trump's margin increased from 2016, and its 2.7% shift was the largest. Trump won more precincts than he did in 2016, winning more of the west coast of Oahu than he did before and every single vote on Niihau. Trump won more votes in Hawaii than any Republican in history (but not a larger percentage), narrowly beating George W. Bush's performance in 2004. Despite this modest pro-Trump margin swing, Biden won the state by more votes than Clinton, as was the case for the four other states (California, Nevada, New York, and Illinois) and the District of Columbia that he won.
Hawaii was one of three states where Biden won every county, the other two being Massachusetts and Rhode Island. It was the eighth consecutive election that the Democratic nominee carried every county in the state. Despite his overwhelming victory here, this was the first election since 2004 in which Hawaii was not the most Democratic state in terms of margin or percentage; that title went to Vermont instead, with Massachusetts and Maryland also being ahead of Hawaii.
Per exit polls by the Associated Press, Biden had support in Hawaii across different ethnic groups, with 63% of whites and 66% of Asians voting for him. Japanese Americans make up a large percentage of the Hawaiian population, and they are among the most Democratic constituencies. Hawaii was the only state in which the electorate was majority-minority in 2020, with whites comprising only 29% of the electorate.
Primary elections
Canceled Republican primary
On December 11, 2019, the Hawaii Republican Party became one of several state GOP parties to officially cancel their respective primaries and caucuses. Donald Trump's re-election campaign and GOP officials have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush sought a second term in 1992 and 2004, respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were seeking re-election in 1996 and 2012, respectively. Because this was the first of the cancelled Republican state races to directly bind its delegates to the national convention (as opposed to a walking subcaucus-type system), Trump automatically was awarded his first 19 pledged delegates of the nomination campaign.
Democratic primary
The Hawaii Democratic primary was originally scheduled for April 4, 2020. On March 20, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hawaii Democratic Party canceled in-person voting in favor of mail-in voting. The deadline was then extended to May 22.

Leontopodium nivale, commonly called edelweiss (, English pronunciation ), is a mountain flower belonging to the daisy or sunflower family Asteraceae. The plant prefers rocky limestone places at about altitude. It is non-toxic and has been used in traditional medicine as a remedy against abdominal and respiratory diseases. Its leaves and flowers are covered with dense hairs, which appear to protect the plant from cold, aridity, and ultraviolet radiation. It is a scarce, short-lived flower found in remote mountain areas and has been used as a symbol for alpinism, for rugged beauty and purity associated with the Alps and Carpathians. It is a national symbol, especially of Romania, Austria, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Switzerland, and Italy. According to folk tradition, giving this flower to a loved one is a promise of dedication.
Names
The flower's common name Edelweiß is German, and is a compound of edel "noble" and weiß "white". Slovenian name is planika, meaning mountain girl. In Romania it is known as floare de colț which means 'cliffhanger's flower'. The flower is referred to as stella alpina in the Italian speaking Alps and étoile des Alpes in the French Alps, both names meaning 'star of the Alps'.
Edelweiß was one of several regional names for the plant and achieved wide usage during the first half of the 19th century, in the context of early Alpine tourism. Alternative names include Chatzen-Talpen ("cat's paws"), and the older Wullbluomen ("wool flower", attested in the 16th century).
The scientific name Leontopodium is a latinisation of the Greek leontopódion, "lion's paw". The Latin specific epithet nivale means "white".
Taxonomy
Since 1822, Leontopodium has no longer been considered part of the genus Gnaphalium, but classified alongside it as a distinct genus within the tribe Gnaphalieae. In 2003, Leontopodium alpinum was re-classified as a subspecies of Leontopodium nivale. Thus, the alpine edelweiss is currently recognized as being divided into two subspecies, Leontopodium nivale subsp. alpinum (Cass.) Greuter and Leontopodium nivale subsp. nivale.
Description
The plant's leaves and flowers are covered with white hairs, and appear woolly (tomentose). Flowering stalks of edelweiss can grow to a size of in the wild, or, up to in cultivation. Each bloom consists of five to six small yellow clustered spikelet-florets () surrounded by fuzzy white "petals" (technically, bracts) in a double-star formation. The flowers bloom between July and September.
Conservation
Leontopodium nivale is considered the least concern species by the IUCN. The population of this species declined due to overcollection, but is now protected by laws, ex situ conservation and occurrence in national parks.
Cultivation
Leontopodium nivale is grown in gardens for its interesting inflorescence and silver foliage. It grows in the end of May The plants are short lived and can be grown from seed.
Chemical constituents
Compounds of different classes, such as terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, fatty acids and polyacetylenes are reported in various parts of edelweiss plants. Leoligin was reported as the major lignan constituent.
The edelweiss has been used in traditional folk medicine in the Alps for centuries. Extracts from different parts of plants have been used to treat abdominal pain, respiratory diseases, heart disease, and against diarrhea. That is why it was also known as the bellyache flower for a long time. It was also used by the mountain people as a durable flower ("eternal flower") in dry bouquets. The cosmetics industry became aware of the plant and its extracts a few years ago.
Symbolic uses
In the 19th century, the edelweiss became a symbol of the rugged purity of the Alpine region and of its native inhabitants.
The passion for edelweiss, which had previously been neglected, began in the middle of the 19th century. The focus is on an incident from 1856, when the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I went on a mountain hike to the Pasterzen Glacier on the Großglockner with his wife Sisi. There the emperor picked his wife an edelweiss from the steep rock with the words "The first in my life that I picked myself". The affection for edelweiss was a common feature of the famous couple and this well-known story raised people's attention to this alpine plant.
The plant became known as a symbol of the Austrian Empress Elisabeth. A portrait by the painter Franz Xaver Winterhalter painted in 1865 shows Empress Elisabeth with nine artificial edelweiss stars braided in her hair. The jewelry made of precious metal and diamonds was designed in the years after 1850 by the then court and chamber jeweler Alexander Emanuel Köchert.
With the rise of mountain tourism at the end of the 19th century, the edelweiss became the badge and symbol of alpinists and mountaineers. In order to prevent the extinction of the often picked symbolic species, it was placed under nature protection early on. The edelweiss was soon adopted as a symbol in the logo of numerous alpine clubs and associations. In the Austro-Hungarian Army in particular, the symbolic relationship between defiant, frugal and resilient alpine plants or the required perseverance, agility and cutting edge of the alpine troops was recognized and emphasized and often promoted by badges and designations. The Alpen-Edelweiss was assigned as a badge by Emperor Franz Joseph to troops (three regiments) of the Austro-Hungarian Army intended for use in the mountains. It was worn on the collar of the uniform skirt.
In Berthold Auerbach's novel Edelweiss (1861), the difficulty for an alpinist to acquire an edelweiss flower was exaggerated to the point of claiming: "the possession of one is a proof of unusual daring." This idea at the time was becoming part of the popular mythology of early alpinism. Auerbach's novel appeared in English translation in 1869, prefaced with a quote attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson:
Together with the alpine gentian, the edelweiss is also a symbol of lonely peaks and pure air in the Alps today. These plants are celebrated with songs and many souvenirs related to them are sold.
Before 1914
The edelweiss was established in 1907 as the sign of the Imperial-Royal Mountain Troops by Emperor Franz Joseph I. These original three Regiments wore their edelweiss on the collar of their uniform. Before 1918 there were also innumerable edelweiss badges in the Habsburg army. These include, for example, the military mountain guide award (ice ax with edelweiss and winding mountain rope), edelweiss emblems on the collar and cap or badges from alpine patrol companies. Many alpine units, commandos and soldiers proudly wore unofficial edelweiss badges.
The edelweiss also played a role in the troop designation, which also reflected the special relationship with the mountains. In addition to the "Edelweiss Corps" (k.u.k. XIV. Corps) of Archduke Joseph Ferdinand, an "Edelweiss Division" was formed in the course of the First World War. It essentially consisted of Kaiserjäger of the 3rd and 4th regiments, the Salzburg infantry regiment "Archduke Rainer" No. 59 and the Upper Austrian infantry regiment "Grand Duke of Hesse and the Rhine" No. 14. In 1915, World War I, the edelweiss was granted to the German alpine troops for their bravery. Today, it is still the insignia of the Austrian, French, Slovenian, Polish, Romanian, and German alpine troops.
In the Swiss Army, the highest ranks (brigadier general and higher) have badges in the form of edelweiss flowers, where other military branch badges would have stars.
World Wars
The song Stelutis alpinis (Friulian for "alpine edelweiss"), written by Arturo Zardini when he was an evacuee due to World War I, is now considered the unofficial anthem of Friuli
The soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian army named a position right next to the Valparola Pass as the "Edelweiss position" during World War I.
The song was written by Herms Niel for soldiers during World War II
The edelweiss was a badge of the Edelweiss Pirates, anti-Nazi youth groups in the Third Reich, and was worn on clothes (such as a blouse or a suit).
The edelweiss was the symbol of Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS Gebirgsjäger, or mountain rangers worn as a metal pin on the left side of the mountain cap, on the band of the service dress cap, and as a patch on the right sleeve. It is still the symbol of the mountain brigade in the German Army.
The World War II Luftwaffe unit (51st Bomber Wing) was known as the Edelweiss Wing.
Operation "Edelweiss" was a project of the US Office of Strategic Services to get information about Hitler's Alpine Fortress in 1945.
After 1945
The edelweiss is worn by troops in the 1st Battalion of the United States Army's 10th Special Forces Group, who adopted the symbol under the command of Colonel Aaron Bank after it had occupied a Waffen SS officer school (Junkerschule) at Flint Kaserne.
A song, "Edelweiss", was written for Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical The Sound of Music (1959).
Since 2002, the Austrian 2 euro cent coin has depicted an edelweiss. From 1959 to 2001, the one-schilling coin depicted a bunch of three flowers.
It is the symbol of the Bulgarian Tourist Union and the Bulgarian Mountain Control and Lifeguard Service.
It is also the symbol of the Swiss national tourism organisation.
It is featured on the Romanian fifty-lei note.
An Austrian brand of beer is Edelweiß.
The edelweiss is used in the logotypes of several alpine clubs such as the Deutscher Alpenverein (German Alpine Club), the Österreichischer Alpenverein (Austrian Alpine Club), the Societá Alpina Friulana (Friulian Alpine Club) or the Alpenverein Südtirol (South Tyrol Alpine Club). The edelweiss is also used in the logotype of the Union of International Mountain Leader Associations (UIMLA).
The Südtiroler Volkspartei (South Tyrolean People's Party) uses the flower as its logo.
In Asterix in Switzerland (1970), the plot is driven by a quest to find edelweiss in the Swiss mountains and bring a bloom back to Gaul to cure a poisoned Roman quaestor.
Edelweiss Air, an international airline based in Switzerland, is named after the flower, which also appears in its logo.

The (New Energy Train) was an experimental railcar which has been used to test a number of alternative power sources by the Railway Technical Research Institute (RTRI) and East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in Japan since 2003.
History
KiYa E991 diesel/battery hybrid railcar
The "NE Train" was first delivered from Tokyu Car Corporation in April 2003, configured as the world's first hybrid diesel/battery railcar and classified as KiYa E991-1. The stainless steel bodyshell was derived from the E127-100 series EMU design, with cabs at either end and no gangways. From 6 May 2003, it was tested on the Nikkō and Karasuyama Lines. Data obtained from these trials was used to develop the KiHa E200 DMU, which entered service on the Koumi Line from July 2007. The train used small lithium-ion batteries and high powered cells as would be used in a hybrid automobile.
KuMoYa E995 fuel-cell/battery hybrid railcar
The "NE Train" underwent modifications in 2006 to replace the diesel generator with a hydrogen fuel cell, becoming the world's first fuel-cell/battery hybrid railway vehicle, classified KuMoYa E995-1. The vehicle was fitted with six hydrogen tanks (with total capacity of 270 L) and lithium-ion batteries with increased storage capacity (19 kWh) compared with the earlier KiYa E991 hybrid version. These powered two 95 kW traction motors. The railcar was based at Nagano depot, and tested on JR East main lines in the Nagano area during fiscal 2007 at speeds of up to 100 km/h.
KuMoYa E995 series battery railcar
The "NE Train" again underwent modifications at Tokyu Car Corporation's factory in Yokohama in 2009 to become a battery electric multiple unit with the addition of a pantograph and storage batteries replacing the earlier fuel cell, and rebranded . This railcar has a maximum service speed of and can operate on battery power alone a distance of up to 50 km away from an overhead power supply.
The railcar was test-run within Ōmiya Works from October 2009, with test running on the Utsunomiya Line under consideration from January 2010.
The unit was modified in August 2011, with one of the four lithium battery units relocated beneath the passenger seats, increasing available space.
In February and March 2012, the programme entered its final phase. Nighttime trial runs were conducted on the non-electrified Karasuyama Line outside operating hours. A recharging facility was built at the line terminus Karasuyama Station. It consists of a rigid overhead conductor bar which recharges the train via its pantograph. The overhead conductor bar is rated at 1,500 V DC, powered by local electricity grid at 6,600 V AC. A single charge of 10 minutes gives a range of approximately .
The programme eventually developed into the EV-E301 series, a two-car battery electric multiple unit. The series entered passenger service on the Karasuyama Line and Tohoku Main Line in March 2014.

Everlasting Blossoms 「永春花」 is one brand of Artificial flower in Taiwan. It was created by the Chinese lady named Mrs. Anna Ho (何連郁文) ever since 1967.
Anna's masterpiece on Lotus Bonsai (one of the Everlasting Blossom brilliant handicraft created by Mrs. Anna Ho
Origins
The very first Everlasting Blossoms originated came from an idea "I need to preserve something precious and lasting for Paul (Anna's husband) in case I die before him."
Anna utilized her creativity and Chinese handicraft heritage to make the knitting wool flower blossoms forever.
Paul in return to show his appreciation named the chef-d'oeuvre as "Everlasting Blossoms".
Contribution
Since Anna keeps promoting the traditional Chinese hand-made arts for years, she successfully enlightens the young generation to refocus on the knitting handicraft in Taiwan.
The reason why Anna regain people's attention on traditional Chinese embroidery is because she made the real flower look-like artworks with 3D layout by knitting wool only. The visitors from all everlasting blossoms exhibitions agree it is barely to recognize the flowers on the table are not real, the only difference between everlasting blossoms and real flower is scent.
The notability on art for everlasting blossoms is no high-tech nor plastic material inside the embroidery but innovation from traditional Chinese needleworks.
Anna trained a lot of Taiwanese artists before she died and the everlasting blossoms are not only the training material but an art masterpiece and part of Chinese culture already.
Notability
Everlasting Blossoms shimmered her glory for the people who endeavor to Chinese culture in late 20th century. There were a lot of newspaper reported this unique cultural heritage back to those days.
Anna also conducted several classes in order to fulfill her commitment :"To share the embroidery skill to all the people who want to learn the way to sew an everlasting blossoms".
One of the famous Chinese writer 謝冰瑩 Hsieh Ping-ying described how she admired Everlasting Blossoms when she was in San Francisco: "There is no any exhibition induce me to conduct second visit, however, Everlasting Blossoms made me visit three times."

The character was the subject of a 2015 "whitewashing" controversy on the covers of Kane Chronicles novels, particularly foreign language editions.
Background
Carter is the eldest child of Julius and Ruby Kane, who were descendants of Ancient Egyptian pharaohs Narmer and Ramesses the Great, respectively. Carter was named after Howard Carter, the archaeologist who discovered Tutankhamun's tomb. Carter and his little sister Sadie (about one and a half years younger than him) were unaware that their parents were magicians of the Per Ankh until the events of The Red Pyramid. The family lived in Los Angeles, California until Ruby's death when Carter was eight years old.
As Carter and Sadie learn later, Ruby divined that Iskandar's decision to persecute magicians who "hosted" gods would hasten Apophis's escape from his magical prison. Ruby and Julius decided to illegally gather the gods in preparation for his eventual escape, starting with Bast, a goddess tasked with fighting Apophis for eternity. The Kanes were successful in freeing Bast, but when Apophis tried to escape as well, Ruby chose to sacrifice herself to keep him contained. A shattered Julius swore to find a way to reunite with her and finish their mission to bring the gods back into the word.
Carter's maternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Faust, later took Julius to court and won custody of Sadie. Carter was left to be raised by his father. He was allowed to see his sister twice a year, but was otherwise constantly on the move as his father evaded magicians from the House of Life seeking to arrest him. Carter sometimes regretted his father's strict parenting style, but strove to emulate him. He acquired the habits of always dressing "like a junior professor", living out of a single suitcase, following basketball (especially the LA Lakers), and reading avidly.
The Red Pyramid
Six years after Ruby Kane's death, Carter and his sister become unknowing hosts to the gods Horus and Isis when their father releases these gods into the mortal world. Over the course of the novel, Carter and Sadie work to foil the evil plans of another freed god, Set. After the capture and later death of their father, their paternal uncle Amos takes the siblings into his custody; his mental illness at the end of the novel leaves the siblings with only the goddess Bast as a guardian. Over the course of the novel, Carter is forced to assume the role of older brother and take on a greater level of independence than he has previously experienced. As Elizabeth Bush says in a review of the novel, the "bittersweet ending lays the foundation for subsequent titles" and character growth.
Carter also learns to accept the facets of his personality which make him similar to Horus—namely, his ability to lead and his courage in the face of danger—and learns that it is not disrespectful to his father to relax his standards a little and become his own person. Despite his newfound individuality, he retains many of his father's values and attributes. He vows to find the real Zia Rashid ( a young girl to whom he is attracted) over her dying shabti "body", much as his father did for his mother. Carter acquires a khopesh in Amos's mansion which becomes his weapon of choice throughout the series. He begins to specialize in combat magic, and inherits his father's magic kit.
The Throne of Fire
Three months after the defeat of Set, Carter, Sadie, and Bast have begun to educate a group of about twenty initiates about the Path of the Gods.
In this novel, the trio and their trainees work to find Ra, a powerful god who will help them in their upcoming fight with Apophis. Carter experiences a number of traumatic experiences in the novel, including the near death of himself and (separately) a trainee named Jaz; the loss of a close friend, Bes; and the disappointment of Ra's inadequacy coupled with his former enemy Michel Desjardins's ultimate sacrifice to protect the Kanes from Apophis.
The novel is characterized by Carter's eye-opening experiences and his "becoming the [hero] that destiny demands". When he is poisoned by a tjesu heru (Egyptian pushmi-pullyu), Sadie is forced to analyze his ren to learn his secret name -- "the sum of [his] experiences, even those [he'd] never want to share". He says this event "felt like [Sadie had] opened me up on the surgery table, examined me, and sewn me back together". Carter also struggles with his new and almost-obsessive love for Zia Rashid, and has to balance his desire to protect her with his duty to the rest of the world; and cope when she admits that she does not feel the same for him. On top of all this, Carter is also learning to be a leader for children his own age and older, annoyed by his sister's rebellious nature and occasional lack of responsibility. His visit to the palace of Osiris in the underworld, where he sees his deceased parents, comforts him but reinforces the knowledge that he will never be able to live with them.
The Serpent's Shadow
The 21st Nome's situation is dire in the opening of the final book, as Apophis is soon to escape and the magicians are still searching for a way to defeat him. The Kanes spend the course of the book recruiting all the Egyptian gods and gathering information about a dnagerous spell to execrate the dangerous Apophis. For a short while, Carter struggles to channel Horus because the war god believes they should try an all-out assault on Apophis, rather than risk hunting for the spell and its ingredients. The magicians manage to banish Apophis, but this disruption of the balance between Order (Ma'at) and Chaos (Isfet) forces the gods to retreat from the world, including Horus, Isis, Ra, and Carter's father Julius (host to Osiris).
The Serpent's Shadow represents Carter's final transformation into a leader and the head of his family (with his mother and father now completely out of the picture). Because of his victory over the serpent, Carter is named pharaoh of the House of Life, though he chooses not to exercise this power until he has matured. He decides to continue life as a "normal" high school student while living at the Brooklyn House with his trainees. Carter also begins a romantic relationship with Zia Rashid.
Description
Carter is an African American teenager and closely resembles his father, Julius, in appearance. He bears little to no resemblance to his sister and mother, both of whom are Caucasian in appearance. Because of this difference in appearance, few people initially realize that he and Sadie are siblings, something Carter has grown used to. Carter typically carries an Eye of Horus symbol, a gift from his father. Later, some of Horus's essence is left in the symbol and he removes it so as not to be tempted to use the power. Carter's ba is a falcon with a human head, recalling Horus.
Cover art controversy
Carter has frequently been "whitewashed" on covers of Kane Chronicles non-English edition novels, such as in Russia, the Netherlands, Italy, and more. Even the American covers depict Carter in a way that makes it difficult to tell if he has the "dark brown skin" he is said to have in the series, though he still appears more African American than on many other editions. Riordan complained about the issue on both his Twitter and Tumblr pages repeatedly, saying, "... the whitewashing of Carter Kane continues. Ugh." and "Pretty art but I'm not amused how they whitewash Carter." He later announced that the Dutch and Russian editions had fixed covers.
Personality
Carter Kane is very protective of his family and friends (especially Zia Rashid), and will do anything to ensure their safety. He tends to be a gentleman because of the way his father raised him, and is always thinking of how to solve their next problem. He is described as nerdy, bookish, and formal.
Powers and abilities
Magic: Carter is a very powerful magician, though is not formally trained. He has more experience than the initiates of the other Nomes, and his progress is quickened due to the Path of the Gods. Carter's specialty is combat magic although he can use other techniques granted by the Path of Horus. He can also use hieroglyphic spells and has been known to be able to speak about half a dozen Divine Words. Carter also has the ability to transform into a falcon. Whilst being the Eye of Horus, Carter had the ability to transform other beings into animals for a short duration.
Combat Skills: During The Red Pyramid, Carter shows superhuman reflexes whilst in a battle. He deflects daggers at remarkable speeds and even dodges a dagger. Although he usually uses combat magic, Carter was once forced to use pure combat skills against opponents due to his link with Horus not being very strong. He managed to hold his own against Sobek's crocodiles, and was able to hold his own against Percy Jackson, despite the latter being the better sword fighter. Percy himself told Carter that he was one of the few people to fight him well.
Animal Charming: As a result of following the Path of Horus, Carter has the ability to control the god's sacred animals such as falcons, griffins and snakes. He first used this ability to tame Freak the griffin in The Throne of Fire and it has allowed him to control the griffin and understand him to an extent since.
Weapons
Khopesh: Carter used a khopesh from Brooklyn House, during the Red Pyramid and the first part of the Throne of Fire. He later lost his sword while fighting the Tjesu heru and wasn't able to retrieve it. Carter found himself a new khopesh in The Serpent's Shadow, but again lost it in a fight with a massive hippo demon. By the Son of Sobek, he has possession of another khopesh. This is Carter's main offensive weapon.
Wand: Carter used his wand through the Red Pyramid and the Throne of Fire, until his encounter with the water demons. He later used his wand from his father's tool kit and is still using it. He can summon a shield of force around himself, by focusing his will. Carter can also send a burst of magic into anything his wand is in contact with to shock them, however this does not work with Percy Jackson and in extension, to any demigods. This is Carter's main defensive weapon.
Crook and flail: At times, Carter has been able to use the crook and flail of the sun god Ra. This enhances his own abilities to the extent that he can make gods bow to him and in a rage, harm Apophis where nothing else affected him. While Ra gave him the crook and flail to keep, he decided to leave them in the First Nome and only use them in big battles.
Shabti: While Carter was initially not very good at creating magical figurines, he has proven capable of using them, such as using his father's Doughboy in The Red Pyramid and using the shabti of Apophis to destroy him. He has grown better over time with them, now carrying wax to form them in his kit and able to shape a shabti on the fly without even looking. In this case, the shabti was rather deformed, but it was due to a lack of time to finish properly.

Jack Simmons, MBE (b. 28 March 1941) is a former cricketer who played for Lancashire and Tasmania.
Early life
Born 28 March 1941, Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire, Simmons grew up there. He attended Accrington Technical School and then Blackburn Technical College, where he proved to be a gifted cricketer. However he did not show enough consistency at an early stage to attract the attention of County selectors. Instead following leaving school he became a journeyman professional cricketer in the lower Lancashire leagues. However his reputation and ability soon developed, and by his late 20s, Lancashire County Cricket Club had begun to scout him.
First-class career
Simmons was a lower-order right-hand batsman and a right-arm off break bowler who achieved almost iconic status for both the major teams that he played for. Solidly-built, he looked very little like an athlete, yet his close fielding was sharp and he remained fit into his late 40s.
A late arrival in county cricket at the age of 28, Simmons then enjoyed a 20-year career in which he was an integral part of the Lancashire side, though rarely hitting the headlines. His flat bowling trajectory and his accuracy meant that he could be economical in one-day cricket, and he was part of the highly successful Lancashire side under Jack Bond that won the Gillette Cup, the premier one-day competition in England, for three years in a row from 1970 to 1972. Simmons and slow left-arm bowler David Hughes were the first pair of spin bowlers to be used regularly and successfully in one-day cricket, which had previously been the preserve of seam bowling.
In first-class cricket, Simmons reliably contributed more than 500 runs and 50 wickets in most seasons in his career, and at the age of 47, he took 63 wickets in the 1988 season. The affection for "Flat Jack" in Lancashire was shown by his 1980 benefit, which raised £128,000. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1985.
In 1972–73, he was invited to Tasmania to captain the local state side, whose first-class matches were restricted to games against touring sides. In six seasons as captain, Simmons led Tasmania into full first-class status and into the Sheffield Shield competition from 1977–78.
Later life
After half a dozen matches in the 1989 English season, Simmons retired. He has been County Chairman of Lancashire County Cricket Club since 1998 and was elected as the Chairman of Cricket for the England and Wales Cricket Board in January 2008.

Lawyering is a 1976 autobiography by Helene E. Schwartz detailing her first decade as a lawyer. It was published in the United States and Canada.
Summary
Lawyering is an autobiography of Helene Schwartz's first decade as a lawyer, which shows her struggles in what used to be a man-dominated field of work. After graduating from Columbia Law School in 1965, Schwartz had trouble finding a job until she began working part-time in a New York law firm. When the law firm was tasked with helping Republicans defend The National Review from a libel suit by scientist Linus Pauling, Schwartz provided the defense. Due to not having a chance to work in a partnership as a woman lawyer, Schwartz left the law firm and was hired to appeal the Chicago Eight trial. Schwartz defended anti-Vietnam War protestors and those who protested against policies made by the Richard Nixon administration. Much of the book deals with how she and other women lawyers were treated in courtrooms, while also focusing on her becoming interested in the feminist movement.
Publication
The book was published in the United States and Canada in 1976. Schwartz wrote in the book's preface, "My being a woman is not the central focus of this book, but it is necessarily a leitmotif. I can't discuss my cases without writing about the effect that being a woman has had on my career as a lawyer."
Reception
Mike Gigandet, of The Daily News Journal, said that Lawyering "is not a diatribe about her treatment as a lawyer", but that "it is an honest and convincing account" of how Schwartz was treated. The Santa Clara Law Review wrote that the book provides "a fascinating glimpse into the unpublicized procedures of litigation". Ann McGlinn, writing for The Saturday Evening Post, compared Schwartz's writing of "the first seven pages to a Cinderella story by Adela Rogers St. Johns".

Jacob Engle, born Jacob Engel (1753–1854), was the most important leader of the River Brethren in the time of their emergence.
Engle was born in Switzerland as the fourth son of Ulrich Engel and Anna née Brächbühl. As an infant he emigrated with his family from the Corgémont to Pennsylvania to flee religious persecution. They sailed from Rotterdam and arrived in Philadelphia on October 1, 1754. They established a homestead in northwest Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
In the 1770s, a religious awakening swept through the settlements of Mennonites of Swiss and South German origin along the Susquehanna River in Lancaster County, PA, that resulted in the forming of the River Brethren. Jacob Engle, assisted by his brother John, became the leader of the emerging River Brethren. In 1776 the River Brethren group was organized and Jacob was made the first bishop. In the mid 1800s several groups split from the River Brethren and the largest group took the name Brethren in Christ.

Jean de La Taille (c.1540c.1607) was a French poet and dramatist born in Bondaroy.
Life
He studied the humanities in Paris under Muretus, and law at Orléans under Anne de Bourg. He began his career as a Huguenot, but afterwards adopted a mild Catholicism. He was wounded at the Battle of Arnay-le Duc in 1570, and retired to his estate at Bondaroy, where he wrote a political pamphlet entitled Histoire abrégée des singeries de la ligue. His chief poem is a satire on the follies of court life, Le Courtisan retiré; he also wrote a political poem, Le Prince Nécessaire. But his fame rests on his achievements in drama. In 1572 appeared the tragedy of Saül le furieux, with a preface on L'Art de la tragédie. He wrote, not for the general public to which the mysteries and farces had addressed themselves, but for the limited audience of a lettered aristocracy. He therefore depreciated the native drama and insisted on the Senecan model. He objected to deaths on the stage on the ground that the representation is unconvincing.

San Gregorio Magno is a Romanesque-style, Roman Catholic basilica church located in front of the piazza Garibaldi in the town of Spoleto, in the province of Perugia, region of Umbria, Italy.
History
The church was built atop the site of an earlier church during the end the 11th and start of the 12th century, leading to consecration in 1146. Traces of the earlier building exist in the crypt. The bell-tower, embedded with spolia, was begun in the 12th century. Because the site had a nearby cemetery, many of the tombstones were reutilized in the church. The church was refurbished during the 16th and 18th centuries. The main portal (1597) was donated by the bishop Paolo Sanvitale.
To the left of the entrance portico is the Chapel of the Innocents, with frescoes that recall the founding of the church and the Life of Santa Abbondanza, supposedly buried here. It now houses the baptismal font and has a Romanesque architrave. The interior was frescoed in the 15th century.
From one of the exits, one can access the Ancient Roman bridge, Ponte Sanguinario spanning the Tessino stream.

West Beck is the common name given to the upper section of the old River Hull, as it rises in the foothills of the Yorkshire Wolds. After reaching Frodingham Beck at Emmotland, it becomes called the River Hull. It is noteworthy for being the most northerly chalk stream in England. It provides fly fishing for wild brown trout and grayling.
Course
Starting at Elmswell as a spring from a chalk aquifer, it follows a course which takes it past Little Driffield, around the southern edge of Driffield, through Wansford, past Corpslanding, and joins the Driffield Navigation at Emmotland. In the upper reaches it is known as Elmswell Beck, then Driffield Beck and finally West Beck. As it leaves Driffield, it is referred to as the River Hull as well as West Beck on Environment Agency mapping despite the River Hull traditionally being called so when the beck reaches Emmotland and merges with other watercourses. For the last of the river approaching Corpslanding Bridge it is known as Driffield Navigation (West Beck). Because of the abundance of springs that feed the beck in its upper reaches, it has been observed that West Beck contributes over 80% of the inflow to the River Hull.
History
The beck was used to power two corn mills; Kings Mill and Bell Mills, both on the upper reach. Kings Mill is a private residence and Bell Mills are in industrial use. Bell Mills were built in 1792 and there are still sluice gates and a mill race adjacent.
The lower sections of the west beck are navigable, and Yorkshire Keels used to reach Wansford. Due to the shallowness of the river, an Act of Parliament was passed in 1801 to create the Driffield Navigation and other associated works. The main route was made further north using Frodingham Beck, and then a new canal from Fisholme through Wansford to Driffield, but the act included navigation to Corpslanding.
The village of Hutton Cranswick created a wharf at Corpslanding, and this has now become the upper legal limit of navigation on the waterway.
The river is for fly fishing only using either dry flies or nymph imitative patterns. Large stretches of the river are owned by fishing syndicates, however day ticket fishing is available at Mulberry Whin. Mulberry Whin offers over a mile of double bank chalk stream fishing on a day ticket basis.
Ecology
The beck flows past two wetland areas promoted and maintained by Yorkshire Wildlife Trust: Snakeholm Pastures and Skerne Wetlands. The entire headwaters are designated as an SSSI on account of the chalk base, water quality and plant life.

Calhoun County is a rural county in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. Its county seat is Morgan.
History
Calhoun County was named for John C. Calhoun, the seventh Vice President of the United States. It was created from parts of Early and Baker counties on February 20, 1854.
Rival political factions disagreed about whether the county seat should be in Concord, a community north of present-day Leary, or in Dickey, then known as Whitney. As a compromise, a spot halfway between Concord and Whitney was chosen for the county seat, and the town of Morgan was established there.
In 1923 the state legislature moved the county seat to Arlington as directed by a county referendum. This decision was reversed in 1929, restoring Morgan as the county seat.
Calhoun Memorial Hospital, a 25-bed critical access hospital in Arlington originally founded as a Hill-Burton hospital, closed in 2013 after 62 years of operation.
In 2008, members of the Downtown Business Authority in Arlington founded the South Georgia Regional Information Technology Authority (SGRITA) with help from the state government to provide wireless broadband service to several counties in rural southwest Georgia. In 2017 SGRITA moved its office to Blakely in Early County.
Geography
The county seat is Morgan, where the historic Calhoun County Courthouse is located.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.1%) is water.
The vast majority of Calhoun County is in the Ichawaynochaway Creek sub-basin of the ACF River Basin (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin). The county's western and southwestern corner, from Arlington running northwest to west of Edison, is in the Spring Creek sub-basin of the same larger ACF River Basin.
The United States Department of Agriculture has designated most of the county's land as prime farmland. Agricultural, forestry, and wildlife plantations line the county's eastern edge.

The yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes), also known as the long-legged ant or Maldive ant, is a species of ant, thought to be native to West Africa or Asia. They have been accidentally introduced to numerous places in the world's tropics.
The yellow crazy ant has colloquially been given the modifier "crazy" on account of the ant's erratic movements when disturbed. Its long legs and antennae make it one of the largest invasive ant species in the world.
Like several other invasive ants, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), the big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala), the little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata), and the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), the yellow crazy ant is a "tramp ant", a species that easily becomes established and dominant in new habitat due to traits such as aggression toward other ant species, little aggression toward members of its own species, efficient recruitment, and large colony size.
It is on a list of "one hundred of the world's worst invasive species" formulated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having invaded ecosystems from Hawaii to the Seychelles, and formed supercolonies on Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.
Physiology
Anoplolepis gracilipes is a relatively large, yellow to orange ant with long legs, large eyes and extremely long antennal scapes.
Although A. gracilipes is the only invasive species in the genus Anoplolepis, there are several other genera for which it can be mistaken. Both Leptomyrmex and Oecophylla can be confused with Anoplolepis because of their similar sizes and very long limbs. Anoplolepis can be distinguished from Leptomyrmex by the presence of an acidopore, while Anoplolepis can be distinguished from Oecophylla by the more compact petiole. Although both of these genera occur in the Pacific, neither contain any invasive species.
Several species of invasive ants belonging to the genera Camponotus and Paratrechina can appear similar to A. gracilipes. Although several invasive species of Pheidole can also be slender-bodied with long legs and long antennal scapes, they can be separated from A. gracilipes by their two-segmented waists.
A. gracilipes is widespread across the tropics, and populations are especially dense in the Pacific region. The species is most infamous for causing the ecological "meltdown" of Christmas Island. Although widespread across the Pacific, A. gracilipes can cause significant damage to native biological diversity. Strong quarantine measures are encouraged to keep it from spreading to new localities.
Geographical range and dispersal
The yellow crazy ant's natural habitats are the moist tropical lowlands of Southeast Asia, and surrounding areas and islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It has been introduced into a wide range of tropical and subtropical environments including northern Australia, some of the Caribbean islands, some Indian Ocean islands (Seychelles, Madagascar, Mauritius, Réunion, the Cocos Islands and the Christmas Islands) and some Pacific islands (New Caledonia, Hawaii, French Polynesia, Okinawa, Vanuatu, Micronesia, Johnston Atoll, and the Galapagos archipelago). The species has been known to occupy such agricultural systems as cinnamon, citrus, coffee and coconut plantations. Because yellow crazy ants have generalized nesting habits, they are able to disperse via trucks, boats and other forms of human transport.
Crazy ant colonies naturally disperse through "budding", i.e. when mated queens and workers leave the nest to establish a new one, and only rarely through flight via female winged reproductive forms. Generally, colonies that disperse through budding have a lower rate of dispersal, requiring human intervention to reach distant areas. It has been recorded that A. gracilipes moves as much as a year in the Seychelles. A survey on Christmas Island, however, yielded an average spreading speed of per day, the equivalent of one kilometer (0.6 mile) per year.
Diet
A. gracilipes has been described as a "scavenging predator" exhibiting a broad diet, a characteristic of many invasive species. It consumes a wide variety of foods, including grains, seeds, arthropods, and decaying matter such as vertebrate corpses. They have been reported to attack and dismember invertebrates such as small isopods, myriapods, molluscs, arachnids, land crabs, earthworms and insects.
Like all ants, A. gracilipes requires a protein-rich food source for the queen to lay eggs and carbohydrates as energy for the workers. They get their carbohydrates from plant nectar and honeydew producing insects, especially scale insects, aphids, and other Sternorrhyncha. Studies indicate that crazy ants rely so much on scale insects that a scarcity of them can actually limit ant population growth.
Mutualism
Crazy ants obtain much of their food requirements from scale insects, serious plant pests that feed on sap of trees and release honeydew, a sugary liquid. Ants eat honeydew, and in return protect the scale from their enemies and spread them among trees, an example of mutualism. The honeydew not eaten by the ants drips onto the trees and encourages the growth of sooty mold over the leaves and stems. This gives plants an ugly black appearance and reduces their health and vigor.
The ants protect the insects by "nannying" the mobile crawler stages and protecting them against their natural enemies. Experiments have shown that this connection is so strong that, in environments where A. gracilipes was removed, the density of scale insects dropped by 67% within 11 weeks, and to zero after 12 months.
In Australia
In Australia, yellow crazy ants have been found at more than 30 sites in Queensland, and in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, where a large scattered population exists. A single New South Wales infestation was detected and eradicated, and, in Western Australia, yellow crazy ants have been intercepted in shipping freight arriving at Fremantle.
Queensland's main infestation is in and around Wet Tropics of Queensland rainforest, a World Heritage Site. The Northern Territory infestation covers , an area larger than the Australian Capital Territory.
Climate modelling indicates yellow crazy ants could spread across northern Australia from Queensland to Western Australia, across much of Queensland and into coastal and inland parts of New South Wales. Areas with the most ideal habitat and climatic conditions, such as the Wet Tropics of Queensland rainforests, are likely to experience the highest impacts.
A costbenefit analysis by the Queensland government undertaken in 2012 found that yellow crazy ants could cost Australia's economy over A$3 billion if the ants were not treated. This analysis did not take potential impacts on Australia's biodiversity into account. The known impacts of crazy ants in tropical rainforests overseas may provide useful insights into these impacts, bearing in mind that the most significant impacts are associated with relatively small islands, such as Christmas Island.
Impact on Christmas Island
Crazy ants have had a profound impact on the biodiversity of Christmas Island.
The crazy ant has a significant destructive impact on the island's ecosystem, killing and displacing crabs on the forest floor. The super-colonies also devastate crab numbers migrating to the coast. This has seen a rapid depletion in the number of land crabs — killing up to 20 million of them — which are vital to Christmas Island's biodiversity; land crabs are a keystone species in the forest ecology: they dig burrows, turn over the soil, and fertilize it with their droppings.
Seedlings that were previously eaten by crabs started to grow and, as a result, changed the structure of the forest. Weeds have spread into the rainforest because there are no crabs to control them. One of the most noticeable changes in the forest is the increased numbers of the stinging tree Dendrocnide peltata, which now flourishes in many areas frequently visited by humans. The forest canopy also changed as the scale insects tended by yellow crazy ants multiplied and killed mature trees.
Christmas Island red crabs are completely wiped out in infested areas. Populations of other ground and canopy dwelling animals, such as reptiles and other leaf litter fauna, have also decreased. During crab migrations, many crabs move through areas infested with ants and are killed. Studies show that the ant has displaced an estimated 15–20 million crabs by occupying their burrows, killing and eating resident crabs, and using their burrows as nest sites. This factor has greatly depleted red crabs, and made their annual land migrations far more perilous.
Although crazy ants do not bite or sting, they spray formic acid as a defence mechanism and to subdue their prey. In areas of high ant density, the movement of a land crab disturbs the ants and, as a result, the ants instinctively spray formic acid as a form of defence. The high levels of formic acid at ground level eventually overwhelm the crabs, and they are usually blinded then eventually die from dehydration (while attempting to flush off the formic acid) and exhaustion. As the dead crabs decay, the protein becomes available to the ants.
Crazy ants kill fauna, but encourage scale insects. Increased densities of scale insects cause forest die back, and even the death of large forest trees. These changes create a cascade of negative impacts, including weed invasion, significantly altering the forest landscape.
Supercolonies
Christmas Island is a focal point for international control efforts. These supercolonies spread farther and cause more damage than single colonies, and they pose the single greatest known threat to the island's biodiversity.
Staff from Christmas Island National Park have worked in recent years to keep ant numbers in check. With help from the Christmas Island Crazy Ant Scientific Advisory Panel and support from the Australian Government they are holding ground.
Another supercolony nearly devastated the bird fauna of Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The single massive colony was found to occupy nearly a quarter of the island, with up to 1,000 queens in a plot of land wide. The infestation is thought to have been eradicated.
Control measures
To reduce the impacts of crazy ants on red crabs and Christmas Island's ecosystems the Parks Australia carried out a major aerial baiting program in 2009, to follow up the first aerial baiting conducted in 2002. The first step was conducting an extensive island-wide survey to determine the exact locations of the supercolonies. For several months, staff traversed the island surveying over 900 sites. The result was a map of crazy ant supercolonies and red crab burrow densities, together with other biodiversity data.
In September 2009, a helicopter was used to precisely bait crazy ant supercolonies, which covered of the island. A very low concentration of fipronil bait (0.1%) was used to control the ants. Monthly monitoring of these baited supercolony sites shows that crazy ant densities were reduced by 99%.
Park staff placed a high emphasis on minimising non-target impact of baiting. Food lures were dropped from a helicopter to attract robber crabs away from areas that were about to be baited. This technique, combined with the low concentration fipronil bait, proved to be highly successful with extremely low numbers of robber crabs and no red crabs known to be killed by the baiting.
While baiting has slowed the decline of the red crab, its effects on the crazy ant populations are only temporary, as escaping colonies invade the treated areas again, and it is expensive, requiring much man power. In an effort to find a better control, after research, Australian Parks in December 2016 imported Tachardiaephagus somervillei, a small () wasp and began breeding them for release. The wasp, which attacks only scale insects, is a voracious predator of what is believed to be one of the crazy ant's largest source of honeydew on Christmas Island, the yellow lac scale insect.
Researchers from La Trobe University in Melbourne, funded by Parks Australia, began looking for biological controls in 2009. While the ants are omnivores, studies have shown honeydew is an important part of the diet of Christmas Island crazy ants. Samples of ants taken from colonies that are growing rapidly have more honeydew in their diet than when the colonies decline. Further, restricting access to honeydew, by binding trees where the scale insects feed, dramatically reduced the colony as ant activity on the ground fell by 95% in just four weeks. In the laboratory, colonies with limited sources of sugar were compared to colonies with access to abundant sugar. Those with abundant sugar had more fertile queens and lower death rates among workers. The workers were also more aggressive toward other ant species and explored their environments more. This is believed to show why the ants decline when deprived of access to scale insects in the field, and confirm reduced honeydew will greatly reduce the ants' ability to form super colonies.
While controlling the yellow lac scale insect is expected to control the yellow crazy ant on Christmas Island, on mainland Australia it is thought this would not help. There are at least a dozen honeydew producing insects as well as extrafloral nectar from native acacia trees, all of which fuel yellow crazy ants.
Experts continue to call for a fully funded, long term baiting program on mainland Australia.

The Lully Foothills () are a large group of peaks and nunataks extending in a northeast–southwest direction between Vivaldi Glacier and the LeMay Range in the west-central part of Alexander Island, Antarctica. Apparently first seen from the air and roughly mapped by the United States Antarctic Service in 1940, they were remapped in detail from air photos taken by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition, 1947–48, by D. Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1960. The foothills were named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after Jean-Baptiste Lully, a French composer.

The spotted tanager (Ixothraupis punctata) is a species of bird in the tanager family Thraupidae.
It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.
Taxonomy
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the spotted tanager in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in the West Indies. He used the French name Le tangara verd piqueté des Indes and the Latin name Tangara viridis indica punctulata. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the spotted tanager. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name Tanagra punctata and cited Brisson's work. The specific name punctata is Latin for "spotted". The spotted tanager is now placed in the genus Ixothraupis.
Five subspecies are recognised:
I. p. punctata (Linnaeus, 1766) – south Venezuela, the Guianas and north Brazil
I. p. zamorae (Chapman, 1925) – central Ecuador and north Peru
I. p. perenensis (Chapman, 1925) – central Peru
I. p. annectens (Zimmer, JT, 1943) – southeast Peru
I. p. punctulata (Sclater, PL & Salvin, 1876) – west-central Bolivia

James Maxwell, 1st Earl of Dirletoun (died 1650) was a Scottish courtier and landowner, and Black Rod. He was involved in selling royal jewels.
James VI and I
Maxwell was the son of Robert Maxwell of Kirkhouse (d. 1583) and Nichola[s] Murray, daughter of Charles Murray of Cockpool. His mother was a sister of John Murray of the bedchamber who became Earl of Annandale.
Maxwell was made an usher daily waiter in the household of King James in 1603. A younger brother, Robert Maxwell (d. 1627) was a sergeant-at-arms.
Maxwell was appointed Black Rod in 1620 on the death of Sir Richard Coningsby in February 1620. The Black Rod officiated at the annual feast of the Order of the Garter at Windsor Castle and Maxwell was given a house there, and in 1629 he was made Keeper of the little park at Windsor.
In May 1609 James VI and I wrote to his advocate in Edinburgh Thomas Haddington to favour the lawsuit of Sir Robert Douglas and Maxwell against the Lord Herries.
James Maxwell injured the ear of barrister James (or Edward) Hawley at a masque or reception for the Duke of Bouillon at court in May 1612, when he dragged Hawley from a room by his ear string. This became a more serious affair after Hawley threatened to fight a duel, and his lawyer friends at the Inns of Court took his side, only resolved by the intervention of the king. There was adverse feeling in London against the Scots in the court of King James which this incident reflected, and subsequently there was discussion in 1620 if a Scot could be Black Rod, and Maxwell found it difficult to be naturalized as a denizen of England until 1622.
King James sent him to Heidelberg with presents for Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia in May 1614.
In 1616 the Privy Council of Scotland enforced the eviction of several people from Maxwell's lands in Dumfries and Galloway.
In July 1622 Thomas Erskine, Earl of Kellie recommended him to the Earl of Mar writing that he was probably more useful to Mar than his kinsman John Murray, 1st Earl of Annandale. Previously Kellie had written how Maxwell had tried to get King Charles to read a letter from Mar, and would encourage Archibald Primrose to further Mar's business with the king.
Charles I
In 1625 he became a groom of the bedchamber to King Charles. As a gentleman in the king's household he was able to access the king and gain patronage for others. He acquired estates in England including, Wanborough Manor, Guildford Priory House, and Kidland Manor, and obtained patents for iron-making and pipe-clay.
In March 1630 Maxwell, by now wealthy, was involved in the sale of older crown jewels with Francis Cottington and acquired a number of pieces himself including the two pearls remaining from the Mirror of Great Britain and Anne of Denmark's gold circlet set with diamonds, emeralds, rubies and pearls, which had been made for her coronation in England by Spilman and Herrick. There was also a head attire with nine great round pearls.
Maxwell acquired Innerwick Castle, and was known as "Maxwell of Innerwick". He bought the lordship of Dirleton and Dirleton Castle in 1631, and was made Earl of Dirletoun around 1646, though as in the case his courtier of William Murray, Earl of Dysart and Patrick Maule, Earl of Panmure, the process of granting and confirming these peerages is obscure.
James Maxwell died at Holyrood Palace in April 1650, and was buried at Dirleton Kirk.
Family
In 1619 Maxwell married Elizabeth de Boussy, or Bousson de Podolsko (d. 1659), from Antwerp, who had been Anne of Denmark's laundry woman and was the widow of William Ryder (d. 1617), a harbinger or clerk of the royal stables. She owned a miniature portrait of Anna of Denmark's brother, the Duke of Holstein, set with diamonds. The Royalist agent Jane Whorwood was her daughter from her marriage to Ryder.
Their daughter Diana Maxwell married Charles Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, and Elizabeth Maxwell married the Duke of Hamilton.
Robert Maxwell, his brother, died in 1627 leaving an embroidered scarf and £50 for a gown to his niece Elizabeth, and a pair of embroidered slippers and £50 to Diana. Another brother, Charles, may have been the Charles Maxwell killed by Sir Robert Ker in a duel at Cambridge in 1620.

Two human polls comprised the 1963 NCAA University Division football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.
Legend
AP Poll
The final AP Poll was released on December 9, at the end of the 1963 regular season, weeks before the bowls. (The season had been extended due to postponements after the assassination of President Kennedy.)The poll ranked only the top ten teams from 1962 through 1967.
Final Coaches' poll
The final UPI Coaches Poll was released prior to the bowl games, on December 3.
Texas received 31 of the 35 first-place votes and Navy received the other four.

Manlio Graziano is an Italian scholar specializing in geopolitics and geopolitics of religions. He lives in Paris.
Life
Graziano graduated with first-class honors in French literature from the University of Turin, the city in which he then taught for several years. After moving to France, he obtained his doctorate in Italian studies from the University Stendhal-Grenoble III, defending a thesis about Italian political identity.
Thanks to the French geopolitician Michel Korinman and to Lucio Caracciolo, editor of the Italian geopolitical journal Limes, he entered the world of geopolitical studies, in which he specializes in geopolitics of religions.
He teaches at the Paris Institute of International Affairs, Sciences Po, at the Sorbonne and at the College of Europe. He regularly publishes in Limes, and he has also collaborated with the journals Modern Italy, Geopolitical Affairs, International Affairs Forum, Heartland, Outre-Terre, as well as with the Corriere della Sera and Il Sole 24 Ore. The American edition of his book on Italian political identity, The Failure of Italian Nationhood, was reviewed by The New Yorker and The Economist. In June 2015 he was invited by the UN Correspondents Association to discuss his thesis about the geopolitics of religion at the United Nations headquarters in New York City.
In 2021 he published Mondo birbetta!, a literary entertainment.
Academic career
Besides Paris IV-La Sorbonne and the College of Europe, Graziano teaches at the École des hautes études commerciales de Paris (HEC), and at the Geneva Institute of Geopolitics. He also gives lectures at the Bicocca University (Milan) and at the universities of Évry and Versailles, in the Parisian region. Previously, he worked at the American Graduate School in Paris, at the four campuses of the Skema Business School (Paris, Sophia Antipolis, Lille, Suzhou), at the École supérieure de traduction et relations internationales (ESTRI) in Lyon, at la Sorbonne-Nouvelle, and at the universities of Nanterre, Grenoble III, Tours, and Lyon II. He has given lectures and courses at the University of Turin, at the İstanbul Bilgi Üniversitesi, at Hofstra University, at Stony Brook University, at Brooklyn College, at the University of Glasgow, at the KU Leuven, at the Stockholms universitet, at the University of Bath and at the Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali (LUISS) in Rome.

Chapman's antshrike (Thamnophilus zarumae) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is found in Ecuador and Peru. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests.
Diet and foraging behavior
Chapman's antshrike's are insectivorous and their diet consists of caterpillars (larval Lepidoptera) and berries from the Meliaceae tree.
Forages from low near the ground up to 15 m above the ground inside forest. Forages in typical antshrike fashion: moves through foliage with a series of short hops, pausing between moves to scan surrounding vegetation for prey. Gleans prey from leaves, stems, vines and branches. One pair repeatedly probed small epiphytic bromeliads.
Song
The song lacks the characteristic terminal "bark" of the song of the barred antshrike Thamnophilus doliatus. The song consists of three elements: it begins with an accelerating series of 12-14 nasal notes, followed by three higher pitched, broad amplitude notes and then ending in a short rattle or trill. Calls include an "abrupt 'chup' " and "a high, descending, mewing whistle: 'peew' "
Conservation status
The Chapman's antshrike has a very restricted geographic distribution. Nonetheless, its conservation status is rated by BirdLife International as Least Concern. On the other hand, considered its conservation priority to be High.
Effects of human activity on populations
A considerable amount of suitable habitat has been lost to agriculture, especially within the Ecuador portion of its range. The Chapman's Antshrike occurs in the Reserva Nacional Tumbes in Peru, which protects a significant amount of habitat for this species.

Inverted relief, inverted topography, or topographic inversion refers to landscape features that have reversed their elevation relative to other features. It most often occurs when low areas of a landscape become filled with lava or sediment that hardens into material that is more resistant to erosion than the material that surrounds it. Differential erosion then removes the less resistant surrounding material, leaving behind the younger resistant material, which may then appear as a ridge where previously there was a valley. Terms such as "inverted valley" or "inverted channel" are used to describe such features. Inverted relief has been observed on the surfaces of other planets as well as on Earth. For example, well-documented inverted topographies have been discovered on Mars.
Formation
Several processes can cause the floor of a depression to become more resistant to erosion than its surrounding slopes and uplands:
First, coarse-grained sediment, such as gravel, accumulates in the depression, i.e., a stream valley or lake basin. Next, wind erosion removes fine-grained sediments in areas adjacent to the depression. This leaves behind the more resistant coarse-grained sediments as a hill or ridge, while the channel switches to a lower lying area.
A fluvial valley might fill with volcanic material such as lava or welded tuff pouring into it. This would resist erosion while the surrounding surface is eroded away to create a ridge.
Cementation of underlying sediments by minerals dissolved in water may occur in a depression. On Earth, this often happens in stream valleys as the result of the formation of duricrusts, i.e., silcrete or ferricrete, by pedogenesis. Minerals for cementation can come from groundwater. It is thought that a low point like a valley focuses groundflow, so more water and cements move into it, and this results in a greater degree of cementation. Again, the cemented sediments would resist erosion while the surrounding terrain is eroded away to create a ridge or hill.
Erosion of the resistant upper strata of the anticlines of a folded region, exposing less resistant underlying strata, which then erode relatively rapidly leaving the syncline as the top of a mesa or ridge.
An example
A classic example of inverted relief is Table Mountain, Tuolumne County, California. Multiple lava flows filled an ancient fluvial valley that cut westward through the central Sierra Nevada range to the Central Valley about 10.5 million years ago. These Miocene lava flows filled this ancient river valley with a thick sequence of potassium-rich trachyandesite lavas that are significantly more resistant to erosion than the Mesozoic siltstone and other rock in which the valley was cut. Thus, subsequent differential erosion left these volcanic rocks as a sinuous ridge, which now stands well above landscape underlain by more deeply eroded Mesozoic rocks.
Another example is Table Mountain, Cape Town, where the original high ridges of resistant quartzitic sandstone of the Cape Fold Belt were eroded away first, exposing less resistant rock, which eroded faster, leaving the original valley bottom at the top of the residual mountain.
On Mars
Inverted relief in the form of sinuous and meandering ridges, which are indicative of ancient, inverted fluvial channels, is argued to be evidence of water channels on the Martian surface in the past. An example is Miyamoto Crater, which was proposed in 2010 as a potential location to be searched for evidence of life on Mars.
Other examples are shown in the photographs below.

Dendrobium trilamellatum, commonly known as the fragrant tea tree orchid or large tea tree orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid found in northern Australia and New Guinea. It has spindle-shaped pseudobulbs, between three and seven leathery, dark green leaves and between three and fifteen yellow, yellowish brown or brown flowers with a mauve to purple labellum.
Description
Dendrobium trilamellatum is an epiphytic herb with spindle-shaped, cane-like, green pseudobulbs long and wide. There are between three and seven leathery, linear to lance-shaped, dark green leaves, long and wide. Between three and fifteen pleasantly-scented flowers are borne on a flowering stem long. The flowers are yellow, yellowish brown or brown with darker stripes, long and wide. The sepals and petals are strongly twisted, thick and shiny. The sepals are long, the dorsal sepal wide and the lateral sepal wide. The petals are a similar length to the sepals but only about half as wide. The labellum is mauve to purple with a cream-coloured to yellow centre, long, wide and has three lobes. The side lobes are erect and middle lobe is arrowhead-shaped and curved with three ridges along its midline. Flowering occurs from July to November.
Dendrobium trilamellatum has apparently been frequently confused with D. johannis. They are, however, easy to tell apart if flowering: D. trilamellatum flowers in the spring while D. johannis flowers in the autumn. The former has a delightful scent, while the latter smells unpleasant.
Taxonomy
Dendrobium trilamellatum was first formally described in 1908 by Johannes Jacobus Smith and the description was published in Nova Guinea : Résultats de l'expédition scientifique Néerlandaise à la Nouvelle-Guinée. Smith noted "This species is closely related to D. johannis Rchb.f.".
In 2002, Mark Clements and David Jones included this orchid in the genus Cepobaculum as C. trilamellatum. They also raised Dendrobium johannis var. semifuscum, which had been described in 1883 by Reichenbach, to species level as Cepobaculum semifuscum. The splitting of Dendrobium into numerous genera has not typically been accepted and both C. trilamellatum and C. semifuscum are regarded by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as synonyms of D. trilamellatum.
Distribution and habitat
The fragrant tea tree orchid grows on paperbark and rough-barked trees mainly in open forest, woodland. It is found on Cape York Peninsula from the Iron Range to Cooktown and the McIlwraith Range, on some Torres Strait Islands and on the coast of New Guinea.
Use in horticulture
The orchid needs good light. It grows well on a slab and needs a dry winter but frequent watering in summer.

William Bryan (17251781) was a Brigadier General over the New Bern District Brigade in the North Carolina militia during the American Revolution. He was also active in North Carolina politics and was a delegate to North Carolina's Third Provincial Congress in Hillsborough in August 1775 and represented Johnston County, North Carolina in the North Carolina House of Commons in 17781779.
Early life
He was born on October 23, 1724, in Bertie Precinct, North Carolina. His parents were Needham Bryan and Anne Rombeau. In 1744, he married Elizabeth Smith with whom he had nine children: Lewis, William M., Arthur, Elizabeth, Hardy, Blake, Esther, Susannah, and John.
He was a delegate to the North Carolina Provincial Congress when it met in Hillsborough in August 1775. He was later elected to represent Johnston County in the North Carolina House of Commons in the 17781779 legislative session. He served on the Committee of Correspondence of the legislature and was also a local justice of the peace.
Military service
He was appointed as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Johnston County Regiment of the North Carolina militia under Colonel Needham Bryan on September 9, 1775. He saw action at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge on February 27, 1776, with this regiment. On April 22, 1776, he was promoted to colonel as commandant of the Johnston County Regiment after Colonel Needham Bryan resigned his commission.
On April 22, 1776, he was appointed as brigadier general and commander of the New Bern District Brigade when General Richard Caswell left this position to become the first governor of North Carolina. He led the brigade at the Battle of Brier Creek in Georgia on March 3, 1779. He resigned his commission on April 27, 1779, and returned to life as a civilian politician, except for a short re-activation as commander of the Johnston County Regiment at the Battle of Guilford Court House on March 15, 1781.
Death
He died in Johnston County, North Carolina, on November 28, 1781. Some biographers say that he and his son Lewis were poisoned by one of his slaves. The Johnston County Court minutes for November 1780 give an account of the trial and conviction of a slave named Jenny, who poisoned Needham Bryan and other members of his family. Jenny was burned at the stake in Smithfield, North Carolina, for the murders of three members of the Bryan family.

James Aloysius Martin (August 30, 1902 – October 1, 2007) was an American Jesuit priest, professor and athletic director. Martin was the world's oldest Jesuit priest at the time of his death at the age of 105 at the Georgetown University Jesuit Residence in Washington, DC
Early life
James A. Martin was born on August 30, 1902, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. His father worked as a musical director at the family's local Roman Catholic church. All three of Martin's sisters eventually became Catholic nuns.
Martin was described as an accomplished youth athlete and was offered several college athletic scholarships. He was also offered the chance to play baseball on the professional level. However, Martin chose instead to study to become a Catholic priest in the Society of Jesus religious order, which is more commonly called the Jesuits. Martin began his studies to become a priest in the early 1920s. He initially entered a seminary in Yonkers, New York, before transferring later to another seminary in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts.
Martin received a Master's degree in theology from Weston College, which is now called the Weston Jesuit School of Theology, in 1926. However, he did not receive his bachelor's degree from Weston College until 1927, a year after earning his master's.
In the Philippines
From 1928 to 1931, Martin taught English, Latin and Greek at the Ateneo de Manila High School, a Jesuit-run school in Manila, the Philippines. He is credited with introducing modern basketball to the Philippines, and coaching the Ateneo Blue Eagles basketball team to two NCAA championships, an accomplishment he spoke of fondly until near the end of his life. Among the players Martin coached on the Ateneo Blue Eagles was the future Senator Ambrosio Padilla. He also coached the Ateneo de Manila High School's baseball team.
He returned to the United States in 1931 to study theology at Woodstock College in Maryland from 1931 until 1934.
Jesuits
James A. Martin was officially ordained a Jesuit priest in 1934. In 1939, Martin was appointed the assistant athletic director and assistant dean of men at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He left Georgetown after one year to take the position of athletic director at St. Joseph's College, now called St. Joseph's University, in Philadelphia for two years.
Martin left St. Joseph's College after two years to serve as a chaplain for the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. He served with the Army Air Forces in Italy, North Africa and France. He remained in Europe after World War II to help raise money to rebuild damaged or destroyed Jesuit schools and churches.
Martin returned to the United States in 1946. He worked as the chairman of the Department of Theology at the University of Scranton from 1946 until 1949. He simultaneously worked as a University of Scranton student counselor during this same time.
He moved to back Washington in 1949 where he became a religion teacher and guidance counselor at Gonzaga College High School. Martin led spiritual retreat programs and meetings at churches around the Washington metropolitan area as part of a Jesuit "mission band" during the early 1950s.
Martin became the founding director of the Loyola Retreat House, which overlooks the Potomac River in Charles County, Maryland, from 1955 to 1964. He oversaw the planning and building of the retreat house, which sits on of land. He spent much of the rest of his priesthood conducting Jesuit led spiritual retreats and outreach programs.
Martin lived at the Jesuit residence on the campus of Georgetown University from 1974 until his death in 2007.
He worked as the director of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington's Apostleship of Prayer, which encourages daily prayer, from 1975 until 1983. He also worked as a consultant for the Christian Family Movement.
His last official assignment was as at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Alexandria, Virginia, as a pastoral assistant in 1983. Martin retired in 1989.
Martin, along with 41 other centenarians, were honored in 2006 at the city of Washington's annual celebration of residents over the age of 100.
Death
James A. Martin died of pneumonia at the Jesuit Residence at Georgetown University on October 1, 2007.
He was 105 years old.
Just two weeks before Martin's death, he was visited by Ateneo de Manila University president Bienvenido Nebres, who gave him a jacket of the Ateneo basketball team that he had coached some 70 years earlier. Martin was said to have worn the jacket to the evening community Mass.

La Salle Academy is a private, Catholic all-boys high school run by the Eastern North American District of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in the borough of Manhattan, New York City. It was founded by the Christian Brothers in 1848. The school was first named Saint Vincent's School when it opened on Canal Street. It moved to Second Avenue in 1856 and changed its name to La Salle Academy in 1887. In 2010 La Salle relocated to 215 East 6th Street, sharing the building with St. George Ukrainian Catholic School. Various offices are still located in the Second Street building. Throughout its history, La Salle has been home to thousands of "Brothers' boys".
Early years
La Salle Academy was founded in 1848 when John Hughes, then Bishop of New York, invited the Christian Brothers to establish a school in the city. They opened St. Vincent's School in a church basement on Canal Street. In 1856, St. Vincent's School moved to East Second Street and Second Avenue, a plot of land that once belonged to Washington Irving. The brothers renamed the school La Salle Academy in 1887. The New York State Board of Regents granted La Salle a charter in 1896. In 1936, the brothers built a five-story building in order to accommodate increasing enrollment. Over the first half of the 20th century, La Salle Academy's enrollment grew immensely, from 98 in 1906 to 950 in 1948.
Later 20th century
In 1966 the school purchased the Moskowitz and Lupowitz Restaurant on the corner of Second Avenue and 2nd Street. This became the school's annex that housed the Guidance Department, the Academic Support Center, the Art Department, Drama Club activities, Music Department and more classrooms. Today, the annex currently houses the offices of the President, Development, Recruitment & Admissions and the Christian Brothers' residential community.
In 1997, La Salle received accreditation from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and in 1998 celebrated its 150th Anniversary. In 2000, La Salle was named a Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education for excellence in education. La Salle received an “exceeding national expectations” evaluation in its 2018 report in fall 2017, followed by a Certificate of Accreditation in May 2018 from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools on Elementary and Secondary Schools accreditation team. On assessing the school's Catholic charism, La Salle Academy was blessed to have been given an exceptionally positive review (“with commendation”) by the Christian Brothers of the District of Eastern North America.
Dr. Catherine Guerriero became La Salle's first female President in 2014.
Notable alumni
Both Patrick Hayes and George Mundelein graduated from La Salle Academy in 1887 and became the Archbishops of New York and Chicago, respectively. For this reason, La Salle Academy's mascot became the Cardinals.
La Salle Academy's rich athletic programs have produced many successful athletes. Metta World Peace (formerly Ron Artest) '97 is a former basketball player for various NBA teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers. James Bouknight was the 11th pick in the 2021 NBA Draft by the Charlotte Hornets. Bakary Soumare '05 is a retired professional soccer player who played for the Chicago Fire of Major League Soccer and the Mali national soccer team. In addition, God Shammgod '95, Eddie Elisma '93, John Roche '67, Tom Owens '67, and John Candelaria '72 are all notable alumni of La Salle Academy.
In addition, film, television and Broadway actor Barnard Hughes '33 also attended La Salle Academy. Director of the cult classic film Mr. Hush, David Lee Madison was a graduate of the class of 1989.
Extracurricular activities
The school's Forensic Society won the 1945 state championship. La Salle's Glee Club, which was directed by Phil Carney, performed for Martin Luther King Jr. at New York City Hall in 1965.

The concept of the soft path was first used for energy resource management and was developed by Amory Lovins shortly after the shock of the 1973 energy crisis in the United States. This concept has now been refined and applied to water, most notably by water expert Peter Gleick and David Brooks. The soft path is often framed as a more integrated and effective alternative to supply-side water resource management. Supply-side water management focuses on meeting demands for water through centralized, large-scale physical infrastructure, and centralized water management systems. In the 20th century, this approach focused on constructing bigger dams and drilling deeper wells to access more water to meet projected demands of consumers. More recently, a focus on demand-side management has emerged in regions where water supply is increasingly constrained (see, for example, Peak water), and it focuses on managing demand and making current practices more efficient. The soft path integrates both supply and demand concepts but in a broader context by recognizing that water is a means to satisfy demands for goods and services and asking how much water, of what qualities, is actually required to satisfy those demands efficiently and sustainably. Soft path water planning also requires broader institutional approaches to water management including the application of smart economics, the potential for distributed rather than centralized water systems, and more democratic participation in water policy decisions. Others have described the soft path as "unleashing the full potential of demand-side management.",

Ted-Jan Bloemen (born 16 August 1986) is a Dutch-Canadian long track speed skater. He started competing for the Canadian national speed skating team during the 2014–15 season, but prior to that he competed for the Netherlands in international competitions. Bloemen primarily competes in the long-distance events as well as the team pursuit event. He is a former world record holder for the 5,000 m (6:01.86), set in Salt Lake City, and the Olympic record holder for the 10,000 m (12:39.77), set winning gold at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Bloemen also won a silver medal in the 5,000 m at the Pyeongchang Olympics, the first Canadian male to medal in the distance since 1932. He has won a silver in 10,000 m and one bronze and silver in the team pursuit at the World Speed Skating Championships.
Career
Bloemen started skating at a young age in his hometown of Gouda. He participated at the 2006 World Junior Speed Skating Championships in Erfurt, where he came in 5th. In the 2007/2008 season he first participated in the Speed Skating World Cup at the long distances, winning the Team pursuit with the Dutch team. He also reached 4th place at that season's Dutch Allround Championships and 8th place at the 2008 European Speed Skating Championships. The 2009/2010 season was his best up to that point, coming in second at the Dutch Allround and 4th at the World Allround Championships. Following a less successful next season, he retired as a professional skater, but still participated in championships as an amateur operating from Friesland. Remarkably, he qualified for the 2012 European (9th place) and World Championships (14th place) and won the National Championships. Though somewhat aided by the absence of Jan Blokhuijsen and Sven Kramer, this was the first time that an amateur won this Dutch National Championships since the introduction of professional skating. He joined the (professional) BAM skating team the next season, but disappointing results (15th at the European Championships) caused his contract not to be extended.
Bloemen moved to Canada to compete for the Canadian national team in the summer of 2014. He won a silver medal as part of the team pursuit with Canada at the 2015 World Single Distance Speed Skating Championships. There Canada's Denny Morrison and teammate said of the team's silver that "With (Bloemen) coming over this summer, it was a new team, and we struggled early on this season. So we had to communicate, find out what our flaws were, correct our flaws, and we had better results... And today, it all came together. This is just the beginning for us, on the road to the 2018 Olympics."
He set a world record in the 10,000 metres on 21 November 2015 with a time of 12 minutes 36.30 seconds at an ISU World Cup event. This was more than five seconds faster than the previous mark of 12:41.69 set by Sven Kramer of the Netherlands on 10 March 2007; both men set their times at Salt Lake City's Utah Olympic Oval. After the race he said, "I've dreamt of this record for a long time. It was a perfect race. All through the race, I heard the P.A. announcer and the crowd go wild when they saw my times and realized I was close to a world record. But I was quick to ignore it all and I was able to refocus on my technique, which was key to having a good race – as well as being consistent, physically and mentally." Two years later Bloemen also beat the 5,000 m world record, again pipping Kramer to the feat, overcoming the ten-year old time that Kramer put up, with a time of 6:01.86.
The 2018 Winter Olympics took place in Pyeongchang, Korea and there Bloemen competed for Canada in his first Olympics at the age of 31. In the 5,000 m race, his first event, he skated to a silver medal. Trailing his skating partner Sverre Lunde Pedersen on the final lap by nearly a second, Bloemen was able to tie Pedersen in a photo finish. Photo technology would later reveal that he had beat Pedersen by two thousandths of a second. This was the first medal for Canada in the men's 5,000 m since Willy Logan won bronze in Lake Placid at the 1932 Winter Olympics. In the 10,000 m race, Bloemen won the gold medal to become the first non-Dutch skater to win a speed-skating event at the 2018 Games. He also set the new Olympic Record for that distance. Bloemen finished off the season by winning the annual World Cup 5,000/10,000-metre classification championship.
On February 13, 2020, Bloemen won the gold medal in the 5000 m event at the 2020 World Single Distances Speed Skating Championships skated at the Utah Olympic Oval in Salt Lake City; Canadian teammate Graeme Fish took the bronze. The next day he finished second in the 10,000 m race in which Fish broke Bloemen's 2015 world record to take the gold medal.
Personal
Bloemen's father, Gerhard-Jan Bloemen, is a retired general practitioner in Gouda and has dual Dutch-Canadian citizenship, being born in Bathurst, New Brunswick, a few years before his Dutch parents returned with him to the Netherlands. This made Bloemen also a dual citizen through his Canadian-born father.
Personal records
As of 10 March 2019, Bloemen is in 7th position in the adelskalender with 145.841 points. Between 12 October 2017 and 2 March 2019 he held a personal best 5th place.

Pacificus was a disciple of St. Francis of Assisi, born probably near Ascoli, Italy, in the second half of the twelfth century; died, it is thought, at Lens, France, around 1234.
Poet Laureate
Local authors identify him with a certain William of Lisciano, who joined the court of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Before becoming Friar Minor (Franciscan) he had been poet laureate at the Court of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.
Around 1212 St. Francis preached at San Severino, in the Marches; the poet had a vision of two resplendent swords crossed on the saint's breast. He was deeply impressed by this vision.
In a preface to a book by Cardinal Cantalamessa about St. Francis, Pope Francis wrote, "When Brother Pacificus, then known as William of Lisciano, met St. Francis, 'he saw the splendor of his holiness and through him saw the beauty of God's face. That which he always sought, he finally found and found thanks to a holy man.'"
William asked to be received into the new order. St. Francis gladly complied, giving him the name of Pacificus. In the Speculum perfectionis, attributed to Brother Leo, Pacificus is said to have experienced a vision at San Pietro in Bovara of Francis in heaven.
Introduced Friars Minor into France
Francis summoned Brother Pacificus and sent him, with other friars, throughout the world, preaching the praises of God. In 1217 he was sent to France, where he is said to have become the founder, and first provincial, of the Friars Minor.
In the Spring of 1226 Pacificus witnessed the holy "Stigmata of St. Francis". The last certain date we have in the life of Brother Pacificus is that of the Papal Bull, 12 August 1227, in which Pope Gregory IX recommends the Poor Clares of Siena to Pacificus' care. Cf "Magna sicut dicitur", 1227 (Bullarium Franciscanum volume I, 33-34)
Return to France
Pacificus was sent back to France, where he later died.
It has long been mooted that Pacificus' poetic abilities were put to use turning Saint Francis' songs into verse, however there is no evidence to support this.

Sir Herbert James Huntington-Whiteley, 1st Baronet (8 December 1857 – 22 January 1936) was a British Conservative politician.
He was born as Herbert James Whiteley, and was the younger son of George Whiteley of Blackburn, Lancashire. His elder brother, George, was a prominent Conservative, later Liberal politician, and was later created Baron Marchamley. Herbert, however, remained a Conservative in politics. He became a member of Blackburn town council, and in 1892 was mayor of the borough.
In 1895 he married Florence Kate Huntington, the eldest daughter of William Balle Huntington of Darwen, Lancashire. They had two sons.
In 1895 he was elected as Member of Parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne, and held the seat for eleven years until defeated in the Liberal landslide election in 1906.
Whiteley moved to Thorngrove, near Worcester, and in 1913 was High Sheriff of the county. In 1916 he returned to The Commons at by-election for Droitwich.
In March 1918 Whiteley was granted a royal licence allowing him to add the surname and coat of arms of his late father in law to his own. In the same month he was created a baronet, "of Grimley in the County of Worcester". The Droitwich constituency was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1918, and Huntington Whiteley retired from parliament.
He died at his Worcestershire home in January 1936, aged 78.
He is the great-great grandfather of model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. His grandson, Herbert Oliver ("Peter") Huntington-Whiteley, was a Captain in Ian Fleming's famed 30 Assault Unit during World War II. The latter's maternal grandfather was Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, whose mother Louisa (née Macdonald) was aunt of the poet Rudyard Kipling and sister-in-law of painters Sir Edward Burne-Jones and Sir Edward Poynter.

Ottawa's Chinatown is located along Somerset Street west of downtown Ottawa. It runs from Bay Street in the east to Preston Street in the west (according to the Chinatown BIA). Signs for Chinatown continue along Somerset until Preston Street, and Chinese/Asian restaurants can be found even farther west.
The BIA was designated in 1989 and was named Somerset Heights until it was renamed Chinatown in 2005.
While officially designated "Chinatown," the area is home to businesses from many Asian cultures, such as Vietnamese, Korean and Thai. Restaurants specializing in Phở and dim sum are quite common. The Ottawa Chinatown has on one hand an urban character as it is not a cluster of strip malls, but on the other hand, it is focused on one commercial street, surrounded exclusively by residential areas.
A traditional Paifang archway has been built upon the entrance to the western section of Chinatown over Somerset Street, west of Bronson Avenue. It was unveiled in the early Fall of 2010.
History
Although Chinese had been in Ottawa in the early part of the 20th century (first census reporting Chinese residents in 1911), the official existence of Chinatown began in 1931 on Albert Street from Kent Street to O'Connor Street. This first Chinatown began to decline beginning in the 1940s and ceased to exist on Albert Street by the 1970s, but the second and current Chinatown had begun to rise in the 1960s on Somerset Street West and finally displaced the old area by 1982.

The Danville Artillery was a field artillery company in the Confederate States Army, Army of Northern Virginia during the American Civil War. It was also referred to informally as a battery, although this reference was only infrequently used during the war.
Formed originally in Danville and the surrounding Pittsylvania County region in Virginia under the command of Captain Lindsay M. Shumaker, the Danville Artillery came into service April 22, 1861. Receiving its baptism of fire in the unsuccessful West Virginia Campaign, the company participated in General Robert E. Lee's Cheat Mountain Campaign and General Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign, and then served with Major L.M. Shumaker's and Major D.G. McIntosh's Battalion, Army of Northern Virginia.
Reorganized on April 21, 1862, with Captain George W. Wooding as its commander, the battery first fought under Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley. After the Valley Campaign, the battery followed Jackson through another year of battles.
Following the Battle of Sharpsburg, the ranks of the battery were revitalized when the men and equipment of the disbanded Eighth Star New Market Artillery joined the ranks. Following the reorganization, the battery was in action again at Fredericksburg, where Captain Wooding was killed, and up to Stonewall Jackson's last great tactical feat at Chancellorsville.
Under the command of Robert S. Rice, the battery continued to suffer heavier casualties with each battle as the war continued. The battery took an active part in the campaigns of the army from the Seven Days Battles to Cold Harbor and the Battle of Gettysburg, where it engaged Federal forces with its Napoleon and Whitworth artillery pieces on both the first and the second day of the battle.
At Gettysburg, the Danville Artillery was the first battery on the left with McIntosh's Artillery Battalion, Colonel Walker's Artillery Reserve, Pender's Division, Lieutenant General A.P. Hill's Third Army Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. It was also involved in the Petersburg siege south of the James River. The battery closed out its days under the command of Captain Berryman Z. Price.
On April 9, 1865, it surrendered 4 officers and 79 men at Appomattox.
It reported 1 killed and 3 wounded at Gaines' Mill and Malvern Hill, had 2 killed and 3 wounded during the Maryland Campaign (Sharpsburg), and lost 13 wounded at Fredericksburg. The unit had 3 wounded of the 114 engaged at Gettysburg and 8 wounded during the Briscoe Campaign. Captains Berryman Z. Price, R. Sidney Rice, Lindsay M. Shumaker, and George W. Wooding were its commanders.
The current Danville Artillery Battery has been in existence since the summer of 2003, and is composed of 3 field guns and camp equipment, over 20 reenactors and the M109A3 Deuce and a half truck Pandora's Box.

Jan Claudius de Cock (Brussels, baptized on 2 June 1667 – Antwerp, 1735) was a Flemish painter, sculptor, print artist and writer. De Cock produced both religious and secular sculpture on a small as well as monumental scale. De Cock completed many commissions in the Dutch Republic. He worked on decorations for the courtyard of the Breda Palace for William III, King of England, Ireland, and Scotland and stadtholder. He is credited with introducing neoclassicism in Flemish sculpture. He was a prolific draughtsman and designed prints for the Antwerp publishers. As a writer, he wrote a poem about the 1718 fire in the Jesuit Church in Antwerp and a book of instructions on the art of sculpture.
Life
De Cock was the son of the sculptor Claudius de Cock and Magdalena van Havré. In the guild year 1682-1683 he was registered at the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a pupil of Pieter Verbrugghen the Elder. Verbrugghen operated one of the foremost sculpture workshops of Antwerp, which supplied local churches and international clients with a variety of statuary, church furniture and architectural decorations.
He was admitted as a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in the guild year 1688-1689. Nevertheless, Joannes Claudius de Cock continued to work for some time in the studio of Peter Verbrugghen the Younger (c. 1640-1691), son of his master Pieter the Elder and brother of Hendrik Frans Verbruggen (1654-1724). Only after the death of Peter Verbrugghen the Younger in 1691 did he establish himself as an independent sculptor.
From 1692 onwards, he was commissioned by King and Stadholder William III to execute the sculpture for the interior and exterior of the Prinsenhof in Breda, a project which was under the direction of Jacob Romans. De Cock decorated an interior staircase with foliage and animal figures, created two fireplaces, a mirror frame and a statue of Mars. In addition, stone and wooden sculptures by his hand were placed in various apartments. During his activities in Breda, he was given temporary residence and working space at the local government's location. There he also gave lessons in drawing. He carved the 'William and Mary' ceiling and made a series of busts of the Princes of Orange, including of Prince Philip William and Prince Maurice. As far as is known, nothing has been preserved of de Cock's works at Breda Castle.
On 13 January 1693, he married Maria Clara Serlippens, the daughter of a merchant. In 1694 the couple's first child was born in Breda, followed by a second in 1696. More children were born of whom 3 died in childhood. De Cock was reportedly small in stature. In his sketch regarding de Cock included in his biographies on Dutch and Flemish artists, the serial vilifier Jacob Campo Weyerman went so far as to compare him to a dwarf. Weyermans also alleges without evidence that the de Cocks had a troubled marriage. Nevertheless, at their 25th wedding anniversary de Cock published a eulogy to marriage. While living in Breda, de Cock worked on the decorations of the courtyard of the Breda Palace for King William III with the assistance of his brother-in-law Melchior Serlippens and seven or eight pupils.
By around 1697, Jan Claudius de Cock had moved back to Antwerp, where he resided for the rest of his life. He operated a large workshop where he employed many assistants and trained 16 pupils in sculpture and drawing. The latter also studies modeling with the aim of a career as a silversmith.
He had close contacts with the Antwerp printers as shown by the bust he made of Balthasar III Moretus, the manager of the Plantin Press and the designs he made for the Plantin Press.
After a productive career, De Cock died in Antwerp in early 1735. It is likely that his estate was insolvent as his daughter soon after his death travelled to The Hague to sell, with mixed feelings, some of his marble sculptures and models.
Work
General
De Cock was a prolific and versatile artist who worked on a wide range of church furniture such as altars, choir stalls, confessionals, pulpits and tombs, as well as secular items such as garden statues and vases, designs for cradles, clocks, floats, reliquaries and monuments. In addition, he also produced smaller scale sculptures and portrait busts. He was a prolific draftsman and was sought after as a teacher of drawing and sculpting. He created designs for the frontispieces and illustration of publications of the Antwerp printers. He produced a few prints of his own. While he was described by Weyermans as a painter, no known paintings by his hand are known. He wrote poems on occasional subjects as well as a manual of sculpture in rhyme.
Sculpture
De Cock worked in many materials including marble, stone, bronze, wood and terracotta. His style shows the influence of the late Baroque works produced by the workshop of his master Verbrugghen. He also admired sculpture from the Antique and the work of his compatriots François Duquesnoy and Artus Quellinus the Elder. This is reflected in the tendency towards Classicism in his work.
He has known for his allegorical representations of children. An example are a pair of terracotta figures representing Air and Fire. The Africa boy stands for the element Fire because of the association of black people with the heat of the African sun. The statues may also be allegorical representations of the continents Europe and Africa. They were likely created as workshop models for larger stone and marble compositions. These terracotta models appealed as individual works of art and were collected by contemporary collectors. Among his allegorical representations of children are a few busts and statues of African boys, such as the African boy with a crown in the form of a fortress (1704, Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam), the marble Bust of a black boy (1705–10, Victoria and Albert Museum) and the bronze Bust of an African Boy (Walters Museum). There have also been a number of similar busts attributed to de Cock sold on the art market. These busts may have been based on a particular individual but were also intended to represent a general type of the African boys typically wear on their chest a medallion, showing a portrait or a symbol. These were likely connected with the particular preference of the patron for whom the sculpture was produced. For instance, the medallion on the bust in the Victoria and Albert Museum represents a cardinal's hat. This suggests that the boy represented a cleric's page and that the bust was likely commissioned by a cardinal.
De Cock also made a set of four sculpture groups representing the four continents (Princeton University Art Museum). The set once were in the collection of the American statesman Elias Boudinot IV (1740–1821). The continents are personified by women shown with bear attributes characterizing each continent and its peoples. Europe features a domed temple, papal crown, books, arms and armor, grains, flowers and a horse. These symbolized Europe's religious, cultural and military achievements and its abundant resources, which in the European ideology of that time was deemed to reflect the Christian God's favor. Another allegorical group is the Allegory of War and Peace (Stedelijk Museum Breda), a terracotta sculpture, which was possibly created at the time of the peace talks in the War of the Spanish Succession held in 1710 in Geertruidenberg. An example of the work he did for the Princes of Orange in the Dutch Republic is the bas reliefs with the mythological scenes of Alpheius and Arethusa and Apollo en Daphne, both signed and dated 1707. They are located in the house at the Korte Vijverberg 3, The Hague, where the Dutch cabinet holds its meetings. These companion pieces depict scenes of mythological lovers taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses.
Many of de Cock's commissions were for church furniture and decoration as well as tomb monuments. He made in 1713 Caryatids for the choir stalls of the former priory of Corsendonk in Oud-Turnhout, today partially displayed in the collegiate St. Peter's Church in Turnhout. They are the most striking example of the classicist streak in de Cock's work. He was able to incorporate his medallions and caryatids into the back panel in a soberly harmonious manner, so that the balance between architecture and sculpture was restored. Some of the elegant figures in the choir stall are executed in the late Baroque style, others in a restrained classical manner.
De Cock was one of the artists who worked on the creation of a group of statues referred to as the Calvary on the outside of the St. Paul's Church in Antwerp. Its overall design dates from 1697. In 1734 construction of the Calvary was completed but further statues were added up to 1747. It is built as a courtyard and leans on one side against the south aisle of the church and the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament. The structure includes 63 life-size statues and nine reliefs executed in a popular and theatrical style. The statues are arranged into four groups: the angel path, which ascends to the Holy Sepulcher, the garden of the prophets on the left, the garden of the evangelists on the right and the Calvary itself, which consists of an elevated artificial rock, divided into three terraces, on which statues are placed with Christ on the cross at the top. Most statues are of white stone with some made of wood. Some statues are dated or signed. The principal sculptors were de Cock, Michiel van der Voort the Elder and Alexander van Papenhoven with some statues by the hand of Jan Pieter van Baurscheit de Elder, Willem Kerricx and his son Willem Ignatius Kerricx and anonymous collaborators. De Cock also sculpted a number of the statues, 12 of which are signed and 5 of which are attributions. These include various angels carrying symbols of Christ's Passion, various biblical figures as well as a penitent Maria Magdalen.
Graphic work
De Cock was a prolific draughtsman who left an extensive body of drawings. Many of these were studies for his sculptures or other objects such as garden vases and cradles. Some were artworks in their own right such as the Burning city by a river (Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum). Others were designs for illustrations made for the Antwerp printers. We now know that no fewer than five engravers turned his designs into prints, including Jan Antoni de Pooter,, Petrus Balthasar Bouttats, Hendrik Frans Diamaer, Jan Baptist Jongelinck and Norbert Heylbrouck the Elder.
He designed the title page and 17 illustrations for the Breviarium Romanum published by Balthasar IV Moretus first in 1707. The Antwerp engraver cut the plates for the publication. In 1706 and 1708 he provided the design for the title page of the Syntagma de annulis historico-symbolicum. Authore R.P.

He made several prints of which only two are known, one an etching of the Martyrdom of Saint Quirin of Neuss and the other a woodcut representing Psyche in clair obscur. He had apparently learned his printmaking techniques from his study of the, which appeared in Dutch translation of Abraham Bosse's 1645 Traité des manières de graver en taille-douce (Treatise on Line Engraving) published in Amsterdam in 1662 as Tractaet in wat manieren men op root koper snijden ofte etzen zal (…). A copy of the book with de Cock's name inscribed in it was found in his collection.
Writings
He also wrote treatises on art and poems. In 1720 he wrote a treatise on sculpture entitled Eenighe voornaemste en noodighe regels van de beeldhouwerye om metter tydt een goet meester te worden (Some principal and necessary rules of sculpture to become a good master with time). This manual was written in verse and contained practical instructions for sculptors aiming become a good master over time. In the book he also takes the opportunity to criticize the training at the academy of Antwerp. The question is, however, whether this was merely based on the quality of the teaching, are been also driven by selfish motives. Master sculptors often relied on apprentices to help in the projects of their workshops. By educating new sculptors in the academy, this important resource was lost to the master sculptors.

Asp House was a minor Hudson's Bay Company post on the Rainy River. It was built at the time when the HBC was pushing inland to regain the trade that had been diverted to Montreal by the Northwest Company.
In 1793 John McKay (fur trader) of the Hudson's Bay Company left Fort Albany, Ontario on James Bay and went south to compete with the Northwest Company. In September he went up the Rainy River and built an unnamed post below Manitou Falls and 12 miles below the NWC post at Fort Lac la Pluie. It was supplied from Fort Albany but needed supplements from local hunting and fishing. Trade produced only 18 packs of fur.
In 1794 he built a second post upstream from the mouth of Rainy River since the Indians of Lake of the Woods did not wish to travel upriver. It was called Asp House. In October of that year Charles Boyer came down from Lac la Pluie and built a competing house 200 years away. Boyer had a difficult time had closed his post the following April. In 1797 it was left unoccupied and was subsequently pillaged and burned by rivals from Montreal. In 1825 the Hudson's Bay Company built Hungry Hall close to the location of the former Asp House. The site is at the current Oak Grove Camp. There is a historical marker on the riverbank.

Rainbow Chasers are an English folk band, formed in 2004 by Ashley Hutchings. They play traditional and original compositions largely on acoustic instruments and have gathered a reputation for their quality of their musicianship, arrangements and live performances.
History
Origin
After the suspension of Ashley Hutchings' long running focus the Albion Band in 2002, he ceased to have a full-time touring and recording project. In 2004, he decided to put together a small group based around talented young musicians. The original lineup besides Hutchings on bass was: Mark Hutchinson on guitar, Ruth Angell on violin and guitar and Jo Hamilton on viola, and guitar. All four members contribute vocals to the sound of the band, which combines folk with classical sensibilities. In 2008 Mark Hutchinson left the band and was replaced by guitarist/singer-songwriter Joe Topping.
Recordings and performances
After a short tour in 2004, the first album, Some Colours Fly was released early in 2005. This was followed by a DVD of their performance at Huntingdon Hall in Worcester, and a shortened CD version as A Brilliant Light (2005). A third album Fortune Never Sleeps was released in 2006 to coincide with their first performance at Fairport Convention's Cropredy Festival that year, where they played to 20,000 people.

Fioretta Gorini (1453/60 – possibly 1478) was the mistress of Giuliano de' Medici and the probable mother of Giulio de' Medici, the future Pope Clement VII. Gorini was the daughter of a professor, Antonio Gorini. Her actual name was Antonia or Antonietta, while Fioretta was a nickname given to her.
On 26 May 1478, a month after the assassination of Giuliano in the Pazzi conspiracy, Fioretta gave birth to his illegitimate son, Giulio. Not much of Gorini's life after her son's birth is known, and some records have her dying that same year. Giulio spent the first seven years of life with his godfather, architect Antonio da Sangallo the Elder.
The female figure of Fioretta may be represented in Ritratto di giovane donna (1475), of Sandro Botticelli, which is preserved in Palazzo Pitti, although it may equally represent Simonetta Vespucci, Clarice Orsini, Alfonsina Orsini or Lucrezia Tornabuoni. The woman sculpted on Dama col mazzolino (1475), of Andrea del Verrocchio, which is preserved in Museo Nazionale del Bargello, could be Fioretta Gorini. There has also been speculation that Gorini was the inspiration behind the Mona Lisa.
Fictional depictions
Fioretta is portrayed by Chiara Baschetti in the 2016 television series, Medici: The Magnificent.

Diyodar, also spelled Diodar or Deodar, is a town and former princely state in Diyodar Taluka of Banaskantha district in Gujarat, western India.
History
Diyodar was ruled by the Bhilria Vaghela Rajput dynasty, who, on the overthrow of Rajput power in Patan, took (1297) Bhildi, near Palanpur, and for some generations held it. Driven out by the Muslims, they, in turn, held Samav in Kankrej, Munjpur in Radhanpur, and Tervada in Tharad, and, again ousted by the Muslims, took Diyodar. Once an estate of eighty-four villages, Diyodar reduced to half of its size as it lost areas to the Kankrej and Bhabhar Kolis. In the famine of 1786 the district was deserted, the chief with his family seeking a maintenance elsewhere.
Punjaji, one of the Bhayad, took service with the Nawab of Radhanpur, and giving much satisfaction, was helped by the Nawab to win back the Diyodar district from the Kolis, who had taken it when the Vaghelas left. Punjaji, at considerable expense, re-established some of the villages, and, in the absence of the elder branch, usurped its rights, and refused to restore them on the return of the chief.
The district was shared by the two sons of Punjabi, Akhesing and Chandaji, who were considered the chiefs of Diyodar, in supersession of the elder branch. Akhesing and Chandaji have died, and Maluji, son of Akhesing, and Bhupatsing, grandson of Chandaji, became the Thakors.
Diyodar entered into agreements with the British Government in the 1820s. It was under Palanpur Agency of Bombay Presidency, which in 1925 became the Banas Kantha Agency. After Independence of India in 1947, Bombay Presidency was reorganized in Bombay State. When Gujarat state was formed in 1960 from Bombay State, it fell under Banaskantha district of Gujarat.

The Historic Formula One Championship, previously known as the Thoroughbred Grand Prix Championship, was a championship for Formula One cars from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s which is sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile. The motor sport's world governing body. The championship was recognised by the FIA in 1994 as the only official FIA Historic Formula One Championship and its first season was in 1995. For 2013, the series was absorbed by Masters Racing to create the FIA Masters Historic Formula One Championship.
Regulations
Class system
The championship is split into four classes according to the vehicle's age and technical specification.
The HFO Competition features classic Grand Prix racing cars from the 20-year period between 1966 and 1985. During that period, there were design innovations and regulatory changes which resulted in significant performance differences and there is a vast speed differential between the elder cars such as Jackie Stewart's Tyrrell 001 and the latter machines like the Steffan Johannsen Tyrrell 012 and Brabham BT49.
To level the playing field, the championship is split into four classes according to age and design characteristics of the car. Drivers score points within their particular car's class and all have the chance to claim the overall FIA trophy at the end of the season.
Points
Effectively, there are four competitions going on within every race and each provides points for the driver based on his or her placing in the car's class and the number of competing cars in that class.
An additional point will be awarded to the drivers who achieve the fastest lap in each class during the race.
Championship awards
The Champion is the driver who scores the greatest points total, regardless of the class in which he or she competes and it is possible for a driver to switch classes during the season. In addition to overall champion, awards also go to drivers with the highest total of points in each class excluding the overall champion, as follows:
Historic Formula One Historic Cup – The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class A.
Historic Formula One Classic Cup – The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class B.
Historic Formula One Cup – The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class C.
Historic Formula One Sporting Cup – The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class D.
These are all FIA awards which are presented at an official FIA Historic Awards event.
Additional awards
HFO also presents its own awards at a slightly less formal and usually much more boisterous event as follows:
The Chairman's Trophy – Introduced in 2009 Tony Smith, this is awarded to the competitor who, in the chairman's opinion, best exhibits the "Spirit of the Championship".
The Geoff Richardson Trophy – Provided by an engine builder, the trophy is awarded to the best newcomer.
The Nicholson McLaren Trophy – Provided by another engine builder. This 'trophy' is awarded to the 'best' team.
The Ensign Trophy – Provided by the former CEO of HFO, Mike Wheatley, who is something of an Ensign fan, having 'raced' an example in HFO very successfully. Although never a winner, the marque was at its peak during the class B period and this trophy goes to the winner of Class B.
The Colin Chapman Trophy – provided by Clive Chapman and Classic Team Lotus. It is hard to imagine any historic category without a Colin Chapman Trophy but, as in HFO's case, it is equally hard to determine which period it might be applied to since Chapman was responsible for so many 'innovations'.
After considering that Class C covers the period when ground effects, carbon fibre chassis and the controversial twin chassis Lotus Type 88 all emerged from Chapman's expertise, it was agreed that this trophy would go to the winner of Class C.

My Son Hunter is a film directed by Robert Davi and starring Laurence Fox, Gina Carano and John James. The film centers on Hunter Biden, the son of US president Joe Biden. In 2021, Donald Trump accused Hunter Biden of corruption. It is, according to The Guardians Catherine Shoard, the "debut fiction attempt" of documentarians Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer. Spectator Australia called the movie a "socially dangerous, ego-damaging, and down-right delicious exposé of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal". The film is being distributed by American far-right media company Breitbart News, and released on September 7, 2022.
Synopsis
According to the British online newspaper The Independent, the film will center on "allegations made by Trump allies" about Hunter Biden's foreign business deals. The producers stated that the film will depict the alleged "business dealings and lifestyle of Hunter Biden".

Development and filming
Two conservative Irish filmmakers, Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer, are developing the film while attempting to raise its budget. When the film was first announced, it introduced its attempt to raise 2.5 million dollars via a private crowdfunding site. Currently, the project has raised over 2.5 million dollars from crowdfunding on its official site. Pre-production started as early as February 2021 according to star Gina Carano. The movie's crew includes Robert Davi as director, and Phelim McAleer & Ann McElhinney as producers.
Gina Carano, who will be playing a "world-weary" secret service agent in the film stated: "The script was instantly intriguing and side achingly hilarious to me, especially after being newly exposed to the political realm in 2020. Robert Davi is someone who reached out to me as soon as I was 'canceled' in Feb. 2021. I signed on in support of him and one of my favorite humans, Laurence Fox."
Production began in October 2021 in Serbia, and lasted for four weeks. During filming John James, who portrayed Joe Biden, had an off-set injury and was rushed to the hospital, though he continued filming after treatment saying that "the show must go on".

Eleanor of Provence (c. 1223 – 24/25 June 1291) was a French noblewoman who became Queen of England as the wife of King Henry III from 1236 until his death in 1272. She served as regent of England during the absence of her spouse in 1253.
Although she was completely devoted to her husband and staunchly defended him against the rebel Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, she was very much hated by the Londoners. This was because she had brought many relatives with her to England in her retinue; these were known as "the Savoyards", and they were given influential positions in the government and realm. On one occasion, Eleanor's barge was attacked by angry Londoners who pelted her with stones, mud, pieces of paving, rotten eggs and vegetables.
Eleanor had five children, including the future King Edward I of England. She also was renowned for her cleverness, skill at writing poetry, and as a leader of fashion.
Early life
Born in the city of Aix-en-Provence in southern France, she was the second daughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence (1198–1245) and Beatrice of Savoy (1198–1267), the daughter of Thomas I of Savoy and his wife Margaret of Geneva. She was well educated as a child and developed a strong love of reading. Her three sisters also married kings. After her elder sister Margaret married Louis IX of France, their uncle William corresponded with Henry III of England to persuade him to marry Eleanor. Henry sought a dowry of up to twenty thousand silver marks to help offset the dowry he had just paid for his sister Isabella, but Eleanor's father was able to negotiate this down to no dowry, just a promise to leave her ten thousand marks when he died.
Like her mother, grandmother, and sisters, Eleanor was renowned for her beauty. She was a dark-haired brunette with fine eyes. Piers Langtoft speaks of her as "The erle's daughter, the fairest may of life". On 22 June 1235, Eleanor was betrothed to King Henry III (1207–1272). Eleanor was probably born latest in 1223; Matthew Paris describes her as being "jamque duodennem" (already twelve) when she arrived in the Kingdom of England for her marriage.
Queen consort
Eleanor was married to King Henry III of England on 14 January 1236. She had never seen him prior to the wedding at Canterbury Cathedral and had never set foot in his kingdom. Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. She was dressed in a shimmering golden dress that fitted tightly at the waist and flared out to wide pleats at her feet. The sleeves were long and lined with ermine. After riding to London the same day where a procession of citizens greeted the bridal pair, Eleanor was crowned queen consort of England in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey which was followed by a magnificent banquet with the entire nobility in full attendance. Her love for her husband grew significantly from 1236 onward.
Unpopularity
Eleanor was a loyal and faithful consort to Henry, but she brought in her retinue a large number of uncles and cousins, "the Savoyards", and her influence with the King and her unpopularity with the English barons created friction during Henry's reign. Her uncle William of Savoy became a close advisor of her husband, displacing and displeasing English barons.
Though Eleanor and Henry supported different factions at times, she was made regent of England when her husband left for Gascony in 1253. Eleanor was devoted to her husband's cause, stoutly contested Simon de Montfort, and raised troops in France for Henry.
On 13 July 1263, she was sailing down the Thames when her barge was attacked by citizens of London. Eleanor stoutly hated the Londoners, who returned her hatred; in revenge for their dislike, Eleanor had demanded from the city all the back payments due on the monetary tribute known as queen-gold, by which she received a tenth of all fines which came to the Crown. In addition to the queen-gold, other such fines were levied on the citizens by the Queen on the thinnest of pretexts. In fear for her life as she was pelted with stones, loose pieces of paving, dried mud, rotten eggs and vegetables, Eleanor was rescued by Thomas Fitzthomas, the Mayor of London, and took refuge at the bishop of London's home.
Queen dowager and death
In 1272, Henry died, and her son Edward, who was 33 years old, became king of England. She remained in England as queen dowager and raised several of her grandchildren: Edward's son Henry and daughter Eleanor and Beatrice's son John. When her grandson Henry died in her care in 1274, Eleanor went into mourning and gave orders for his heart to be buried at the priory at Guildford, which she founded in his memory. In January 1275, she expelled the Jews from all of her lands. Eleanor's two remaining daughters died in 1275, Margaret on 26 February and Beatrice on 24 March.
She retired in 1286 to Amesbury Priory in Wiltshire, eight miles north of Salisbury, where she was visited by her son, King Edward. Two of her granddaughters – Mary of Woodstock (daughter of Edward) and Eleanor of Brittany – were already nuns there, each having entered the priory on reaching the age of seven.
Eleanor died on 24/25 June 1291 at the priory and was buried there. The site of her grave is unknown, making her the only English queen without a marked grave. Her heart was taken to London where it was buried at the Franciscan priory of Greyfriars.
Cultural legacy
Eleanor was renowned for her learning, cleverness, and skill at writing poetry, as well as her beauty; she was also known as a leader of fashion, continually importing clothes from France. She favoured red silk damask and often wore parti-coloured cottes (a type of tunic), gold or silver girdles into which a dagger was casually thrust, and decorations of gilt quatrefoil. To cover her dark hair, she wore jaunty pillbox caps. Eleanor introduced a new type of wimple to England, which was high, "into which the head receded until the face seemed like a flower in an enveloping spathe".
She had developed a love for the songs of the troubadours as a child and continued this interest into adulthood. She bought many romantic and historical books that included stories from ancient times to contemporary romances written in the period (13th century).
Eleanor is the protagonist of The Queen From Provence, a historical romance by British novelist Jean Plaidy which was published in 1979. Eleanor is a main character in the novel Four Sisters, All Queens by author Sherry Jones, as well as the novels The Sister Queens by Sophie Perinot, and "My Fair Lady: A Story of Henry III's Lost Queen" by J. P. Reedman. She is also the subject of Norwegian Symphonic metal band Leave's Eyes in their song "Eleonore De Provence" from their album Symphonies of the Night.
Issue
Eleanor and Henry had five children together. Eleanor seems to have been especially devoted to her eldest son, Edward; when he was deathly ill in 1246, she stayed with him at the abbey at Beaulieu in Hampshire for three weeks, long past the time allowed by monastic rules. She personally supervised Edward's upbringing and education. It was because of her influence that King Henry granted the duchy of Gascony to Edward in 1249. Her youngest child, Katherine, seems to have had a degenerative disease that rendered her deaf. When the little girl died at the age of three, both her royal parents suffered overwhelming grief. Eleanor possibly had four other sons who also died in childhood, but their existence is in doubt as there is no contemporary record of them.
Edward I (1239–1307), married Eleanor of Castile (1241–1290) in 1254, by whom he had issue, including his heir Edward II. His second wife was Margaret of France, by whom he had issue.
Margaret (1240–1275), married King Alexander III of Scotland, by whom she had issue.
Beatrice (1242–1275), married John II, Duke of Brittany, by whom she had issue.
Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster (1245–1296), married Aveline de Forz in 1269, who died four years later without issue; married Blanche of Artois in 1276, by whom he had issue.
Katherine (25 November 1253 – 3 May 1257)

Portland Bill is a narrow promontory (or bill) at the southern end of the Isle of Portland, and the southernmost point of Dorset, England. One of Portland's most popular destinations is Portland Bill Lighthouse. Portland's coast has been notorious for the number of shipwrecked vessels over the centuries. The dangerous coastline features shallow reefs and the Shambles sandbank, made more hazardous due to the strong Portland tidal race.
The Bill is an important way-point for coastal traffic, and three lighthouses have been built to protect shipping. The original two worked as a pair from 1716, and they were replaced in 1906 by the current one.
History
From Roman times, beacon fires were lit to warn ships of the danger of the Bill. A petition to Trinity House was put forward for a lighthouse in the early 18th century, but Trinity House opposed it. They later conceded that a lighthouse was needed and George I granted the patent on 26 May 1716. Trinity House issued a lease to William Barrett and Francis Browne to build and maintain one or more lighthouses.
One lighthouse was built at Branscombe Hill, while the other was situated on lower land nearer the coast. The two lighthouses were lit for the first time on 29 September 1716. The lights were poorly maintained, and Trinity House terminated the lease after an inspection in 1752. In 1789, the Old Lower Lighthouse was demolished and rebuilt. In 1844, Trinity House erected a stone obelisk at the southern tip of the Bill as a daymark, and the first lightship was placed at the Shambles sandbank in 1859. In 1869, Trinity House had both lighthouses rebuilt.
Pulpit Rock is an artificial stack of rock that was formed in the 1870s by quarrying operations at the Bill. At the turn of the 20th-century, Trinity House put forward plans for a new lighthouse which was completed in 1905 and first shone on 11 January 1906. The original two lighthouses were decommissioned and sold. The Old Lower Lighthouse later became a bird observatory in 1961. The Old Higher Lighthouse was owned by Marie Stopes from 1923 to 1958 and is now a holiday let. A proper road to Portland Bill was laid in 1922 and this helped the Bill become a tourist destination.
A coastguard lookout at Portland Bill was built in 1934. It closed in the 1990s but was taken over by the National Coastwatch Institution, which rebuilt the station in the 21st century. During the 1960s, the Ministry of Defence Magnetic Range was built at the Bill. Farther up the hill at Branscombe was a Royal Navy Wireless telegraphy station which was established in the early 20th century and closed in the 1990s. The Shambles lightship was permanently withdrawn in 1976 and replaced by automatic buoys. The current lighthouse was unmanned in 1996 and all monitoring and control transferred to the Trinity House Operations & Planning Centre in Harwich. The lighthouse has a visitor centre, while tours are conducted to take visitors to the top of the lighthouse.
Features
The lighthouses, Pulpit Rock and the Trinity House Obelisk are Portland Bill's key attractions. Close to the Ministry of Defence range at the Bill is Portland's main Raised Beach, and close to the Old Higher Lighthouse is NCI Portland Bill, a National Coastwatch Institution lookout station.
A fishing crane, known as Red Crane, is situated on the cliff edge at Portland Bill. The area holds many beach huts. There are a few commercial businesses in the area, including a restaurant - The Lobster Pot - and a pub - The Pulpit Inn.
Portland Bill has a number of listed buildings. The current lighthouse, along with its boundary walls, is Grade II Listed. The Old Lower Lighthouse, including its boundary walls and coastguard house, is also Grade II Listed, as is the Old Higher Lighthouse, its four cottages and boundary walls. A 19th-century Fisherman's hut is Grade II Listed, while Red Crane, part of a disused stone loading quay, which is protected as a scheduled monument.
The surrounding fields between the Bill and Southwell are made up of an ancient strip field system, once found all over the island, dating from Anglo-Saxon times. The nearby Culverwell Mesolithic Site is a Mesolithic settlement, located along the Portland Bill Road. The site is said to be circa 7500–8500 years old and has also become a scheduled monument. This includes surrounding fields, also relating to the Mesolithic period, and these fields lead across to the coastline.

Lufthansa CityLine GmbH is a German airline with its headquarters on the grounds of Munich Airport. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lufthansa and maintains hubs at Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport, from where it operates a dense domestic and European network as a member of Lufthansa Regional.
History
Early years
The airline was founded as Ostfriesische Lufttaxi (OLT) in 1958 and became Ostfriesische Lufttransport (OLT) in 1970 - which existed until 2013 as a separate airline - in Emden. It was reorganised and renamed as DLT Luftverkehrsgesellschaft mbH on 1 October 1974 and began cooperation with Lufthansa in 1978 with short-range international routes.
By 1989 all operations were on behalf of Lufthansa. In March 1992 DLT became a wholly owned subsidiary of Lufthansa and was renamed Lufthansa CityLine. Lufthansa CityLine employs 2,332 people, of whom 664 are cockpit crew, 849 cabin crew and 819 work in the technical and administrative areas as of 31 December 2011.
Lufthansa placed an order on 17 April 2007 for 30 Embraer E190/E195 and 15 Bombardier CRJ-900 aircraft to directly replace LH CityLine's fleet of BAe 146 and Avro RJ aircraft. The last Avro RJ85 took off from Cologne Bonn Airport on 27 August 2012 as LH1985.
Development since 2014
In late 2014, parent company Lufthansa announced it would begin transferring eight of its Airbus A340-300 aircraft to CityLine. After reconfiguration to a high-density configuration, these aircraft would be owned by CityLine and operated by CityLine pilots, but wet-leased back to Lufthansa to be used on leisure routes and serviced by Lufthansa cabin crews starting in 2015. The first destinations to be served by the new Bombardier CRJ-700s which left CityLine's fleet by March 2015.
In October 2017, a new labour agreement between Lufthansa and its pilot unions was reached. As part of this agreement, the wetlease operations of Lufthansa CityLine on behalf of Lufthansa consisting of eight Airbus A340s were gradually terminated.
As part of Lufthansa's new corporate design introduced in early 2018, Lufthansa Regional aircraft operated by Lufthansa CityLine are also receiving the new livery, with the Lufthansa Regional titles being removed from the fuselage and replaced by Lufthansa.
In August 2020, Lufthansa CityLine handed back six Airbus A340-300 longhaul aircraft it operated for parent Lufthansa as part of their revised leisure route strategy. In spring 2022, the airline transferred their last two remaining Embraer 195 to Air Dolomiti. In the same time, they were given operations of two Airbus A321P2F converted freighter aircraft on behalf of Lufthansa Cargo as well as several Airbus A319-100 to be flown for Lufthansa mainline.
Corporate affairs
The airline was previously headquartered at Cologne Bonn Airport. In 1998 the airline moved its offices to the security area of that airport; several of its departments however were in Munich. In 2009 the airline moved its head office into the former Cologne/Bonn Airport administrative building. In May 2013 it was announced that the management and administration offices of CityLine would be relocated from Cologne to Munich. The move was completed as of September 2014. Its corporate headquarters are now at the Flight Operations Center (FOC) at Munich Airport.

Accidents and incidents
On 6 January 1993, Lufthansa Flight 5634 from Bremen to Paris, which was carried out under the Lufthansa CityLine brand using a Contact Air Dash 8-300 (registered D-BEAT), hit the ground 1800 metres short of the runway of Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, resulting in the death of four out of the 23 passengers on board. The four crew members survived. The accident occurred after the pilot had to abort the final approach to the airport because the runway had been closed due to the aircraft ahead, a Korean Air Boeing 747, suffering a blown tire upon landing.
On 28 December 1999, a passenger on board Lufthansa Flight 5293 from Prague to Düsseldorf, which was operated by Lufthansa CityLine using a Bombardier CRJ100 aircraft (registered D-ACJA), claimed to have a bomb on board and demanded the flight be diverted to the United Kingdom. The pilots convinced him to have a fuel stop at Düsseldorf Airport, where all passengers left the plane (many of them unaware of the hijacking attempt), and the perpetrator was arrested.
On 5 July 2014, Lufthansa Flight 1360 from Frankfurt to Katowice, operated by Lufthansa CityLine using a Bombardier CRJ700 aircraft (registered D-ACPJ), landed on an unopened and under construction runway at Katowice International Airport. The pilots performed a normal approach from the East in good conditions and visibility before landing on the closed runway. No one was hurt, and the aircraft later made a technical flight to land on the correct runway. The Polish State Commission on Aircraft Accidents Investigation made recommendations to add additional markings to the runway (in the form of red X shapes on the runway), and to modify the ATIS to include warnings about the closed runway. The CAT I ILS was disabled due to the construction, and the aircraft featured an older EGPWS that lacked a "Smart Landing" mode and high resolution map of the area which prevented it from informing the crew of the situation. During the approach, PAPI and threshold lights were set to maximum brightness. The incident is still being investigated by Polish authorities.

The 1996–97 Coppin State Eagles men's basketball team represented Coppin State University during the 1996–97 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Eagles, led by 11th year head coach Fang Mitchell, played their home games at the Coppin Center and were members of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. They finished the season 22–9, 15–3 in MEAC play to win the conference regular season title. The Eagles then went on to win the MEAC Tournament title to receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as No. 15 seed in the East region. In the opening round, Coppin State became the third No. 15 seed to win an NCAA Tournament game, and the first to do so by double digits, as they defeated No. 2 seed South Carolina 78–65. The Eagles narrowly missed out on becoming the first No. 15 seed to reach the Sweet Sixteen when they lost in the second round to No. 2 seed Texas, 82–81.

The Sanskrit play (अागमडम्बर) satirizes various religions in Kashmir and their place in the politics of King Shankaravarman (883–902).
Bhatta Jayanta's strategy is to take a characteristic figure of the target religion and show that he is a rogue, using reasoning or some fundamental ideas connected with the doctrines of that very religion. This way he makes a laughingstock of both its followers and their tenets. The leading character, Sankarshana, is a young and dynamic orthodox graduate of Vedic studies, whose career starts as a glorious campaign against the heretic Buddhists, Jains and other heterodox sects. By the end of the play he realizes that the interests of the monarch do not encourage such inquisitional rigor and the story ends in a great festival of tolerance and compromise.

Digby Marritt Jones, Baron Jones of Birmingham, (born 28 October 1955), known as Sir Digby Jones between 2005 and 2007, is a British businessman and politician who has served as Director General of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) from 2000 to 2006, and Minister of State for Trade and Investment from 2007 to 2008. He sat in the House of Lords as a non-aligned active crossbencher until 2020.
Career
Education and business career
Jones was born on 28 October 1955 in Birmingham, England. He was educated at Bromsgrove School where he was Head Boy. From 1974 until 1977, Jones read Law at University College London on a Royal Navy University Cadetship as a Sub-Lieutenant, graduating with upper second class honours. After graduation, Jones worked for 20 years at Edge & Ellison, a firm of lawyers based in Birmingham, culminating in serving as Senior Partner from 1995 to 1998.
Jones was Chairman of the West Midlands Regional Council of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), and became the first serving regional chairman to be appointed CBI's Director-General, serving from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2006. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2005 New Year Honours for services to Business. He then acted as an adviser to Barclays Capital, Ford Motor Company, Deloitte and JCB. In November 2006, Jones was appointed "Business Adviser" to the Duke of York, receiving £1,000 a month from the royal payroll for working one day a month. This position ended upon his appointment as a Minister in July 2007.
Jones was a non-executive director for the IT contractor iSOFT from 2000 until his resignation in July 2005, when he stayed on for one year as an adviser.
Government appointments and peerage
Jones served as the unpaid UK Skills Envoy from 2006 to 2007, before taking up the role of Minister of State for Trade and Investment 29 June 2007. The post was situated in both the newly created Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Foreign Office. He was appointed as a Government Minister in a move to create a government "of all the talents". As he was not a parliamentarian at the time, Jones was made a life peer, and became a member of the House of Lords. It was suggested that he was taking the Labour whip in the House of Lords, but he chose not to join the Labour Party. He was gazetted as a peer on 10 July 2007 as Baron Jones of Birmingham, of Alvechurch and of Bromsgrove in the County of Worcestershire, and took his seat in the House of Lords that same day.
Formally styled The Lord Jones of Birmingham, he sat as a Crossbencher in the House of Lords.
Jones had considered running for Mayor of London after being encouraged by a group of prominent businessmen. He was also approached by the Conservative Party about becoming its candidate, but rejected this idea.
In April 2008, Jones announced his intention to resign as Minister of Trade and Investment later in the year. He resigned in October 2008 and was appointed to be a UK Business Ambassador for UK Trade & Investment. In testimony to the Public Administration Committee he said that his time as a junior minister was "one of the most dehumanising and depersonalising experiences" anyone could have and that he had been amazed by how many civil servants he thought deserved the sack.
Subsequent political career and retirement
On 20 September 2013, Jones spoke at the UK Independence Party conference in London as a guest speaker, addressing the conference on business and economic matters.
On 29 September 2014, it was rumoured that Jones might defect to the Conservative Party after he introduced the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, before his keynote speech at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. He said that Osborne "deserves a personal pat on the back" for having "stuck to your guns and did what was right for our country." In response to any rumour regarding a possible defection, Jones stated: "I don't do party politics" and "business is my constituency."
In March 2020, Jones moved permanently to Guernsey, serving as Chairman of the Guernsey Policy & Economics Group. Shortly thereafter, on 31 August 2020, he retired from the House of Lords.
Views on trade unions
In 2006, Jones said of trade unions: "They are in danger of withering on the vine of irrelevance. They are backward looking and not on today's agenda. The trade unions put their members first and not the country. Labour is always in thrall to the unions. People keep banging on about cash for peerages, but the unions have bunged money to the government for years."
Brexit
In July 2016, shortly after the Brexit referendum, Jones – a vocal supporter of Brexit – argued that the process of exiting the European Union would have minimal impact on the economy and employment, stating: "There's not going to be any economic pain. If there are job losses, they will be very few." According to The New European, he later contradicted this statement, declaring in January 2019 that he had "made it very clear in every speech I gave we would be economically worse off."
Media appearances
Jones was the guest on BBC Radio's Desert Island Discs, broadcast on 21 May 2006. He won BBC One's Celebrity Mastermind with a 9-point margin finishing on 33 points on 5 January 2011. Jones nominated Winston Churchill on BBC Radio 4 Great Lives.
He presented the BBC Two programme The New Troubleshooter where he "helps businesses realise their potential, ruffling feathers and bruising egos along the way as he gets stuck in and delivers his analysis and advice", taking over the mantle of John Harvey-Jones who presented the original series Troubleshooter.
In July 2014 he presented a programme on BBC Radio 4, The Business Covenant.
In 2020 presented a programme looking at how businesses are getting ready for Brexit on Times Radio.
Books
In 2011 Jones published his first book, Fixing Britain: The Business of Reshaping Our Nation (Wiley), which was shortlisted for the 2012 CMI Management Book of the Year.
In 2017 Fixing Business: Making Profitable Business Work for the Good of All, was published in April 2017, also with Wiley.
Honorary fellowships and doctorates
Jones is an Honorary Fellow of Cardiff University and University College London (2004); and an Honorary Doctor of the University of Central England (2002), the University of Birmingham (2002), the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (2003), the University of Hertfordshire (2004), Middlesex University (2005), Sheffield Hallam University (2005), Aston University (2006), the University of Hull (2006), Queen's University, Belfast (2006), Warwick University (2006), Bradford University (2006), Thames Valley University (2006), Wolverhampton University (2006), the University of Nottingham, Loughborough University (2007) and Honorary Fellow of Cardiff Metropolitan University (2013).

Statistics of North American Soccer League in season 1972. This was the 5th season of the NASL.
Overview
Eight teams took part in the league with the New York Cosmos winning the championship.
Changes from previous season
Rules changes
The league changed its offside rule during the season on June 26. They created a "Blue Line" which was an offside line across the field, 35 yards from the goal line. Thereafter, no player could be offside unless he had crossed the 35-yard line. This made the NASL unique in the soccer world; the league received temporary approval for the change from FIFA on an experimental basis only. The league also switched the playoff format to single-match elimination contests rather than series.

The Port Joli River (in French: rivière Port Joli) is a tributary of the south shore of the St. Lawrence River where it flows southwest of the village of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli and north-east of the village of L'Islet-sur-Mer.
The Port Joli river flows through the municipalities of Saint-Damase-de-L'Islet, Sainte-Louise and Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, in the L'Islet Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Chaudière-Appalaches, in Quebec, in Canada.
Geography
The Port Joli river takes its source from agricultural streams, located in the municipality of Saint-Damase-de-L'Islet. This spring is located at southeast of the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, at east of the center of the village of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli and south of the center of the village of Saint-Roch-des-Aulnaies. Trois Saumons Lake flows through its northeast end.
From its source, the Port Joli River flows over , divided into the following segments:
south-west in Saint-Damase-de-L'Islet, to the Sainte-Louise limit;
west in Sainte-Louise, to the limit of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli;
southwest, to route 204;
southwest, to highway 20;
to the southwest, to its confluence.
At the end of its course, the Trois Saumons river flows onto the long shore (at low tide) in Anse Port Joli, on the south shore of the middle St. Lawrence estuary. This confluence is located north-east of the village of L'Islet-sur-Mer and to the south-west of the village of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli.
Toponymy
The toponym Rivière Port Joli was formalized on December 2, 1975, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

The Walls of Padua (Italian: cinta muraria di Padova) are a complex of defensive works around the Italian city of Padua, designed to defend it from hostile attack. It was built in 4 phases.
Phases
Roman
Of the walls built during the ancient Roman era, the only traces to survive are those incorporated into the foundations of certain palazzi. The route of this wall corresponded to a meander of the river Medoacus (now the Brenta River) in which developed Padua's first urban centre.
13th century
The Mura Duecentesche ("13th century walls"; also known as the mura comunali or mura medievali) were built at the start of the 13th century by the Comune of Padua. Their route was delimited by the two branches of the Bacchiglione, the Tronco Maestro and the Naviglio Interno, which came to be used as defensive ditches. There are several remains of them around the Castello and near Porta Molino. More minor remains are to be found in the Riviera Tito Livio and Riviera Albertino Mussato; the only gates to remain from this wall are the main north gate, Porta Molino (or Molini, after several mills in the area which functioned up to the early 20th century), and the main west gate, Porta Altinate (named after the road to Altino which began here).
The Porta Molino's upper stories were used at the end of the 19th century as a reservoir the town's first drinking water system, though tales of the tower being used as an observatory by Galileo Galilei during his time in the city are probably false. The Porta Altinate fronted onto the Naviglio Interno, crossed by an ancient Roman three-arch bridge (the Naviglio and the bridge were buried in the 1960s), and in 1256 this gate was stormed and destroyed by crusaders fighting against Ezzelino da Romano (as recorded in an inscription recorded by Carlo Leoni). It was rebuilt in 1286.
14th century
The Mura Carraresi ("Carraresi's Walls") were built by the Carraresi in the 14th century and followed a route which corresponds almost entirely to that of the later 16th century wall. Almost nothing remains of them, since they were demolished during the War of the League of Cambrai to create the Renaissance wall - some sections can be seen in via delle Dimesse, near the Prato della Valle.
16th century
The Mura Cinquecentesche ("16th-century Walls"; also known as the Mura rinascimentali or Veneziane) were built during the first decades of the 16th century by the Venetian Republic under the local leadership of the condottiero Bartolomeo d'Alviano. The west flank was protected by the canal still known as the fossa Bastioni. Most of the walls and nearly all the gates survive unbroken apart from sections demolished in the 1960s to build the new Ospedale Civile. The gates include:
Porta Savonarola - Completed in 1530. Designed by the architect Giovanni Maria Falconetto, this gate was built with a frieze showing the Lion of Saint Mark, symbol of the Venetian Republic, which still survives.
Porta san Giovanni - Completed in 1528. Designed by the architect Giovanni Maria Falconetto, this gate originally had a frieze showing the Lion of Saint Mark, symbol of the Venetian Republic (the frieze here was destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars).
(or Portello, Portello Nuovo or Portello Venezia) - Originally entitled Portello or Little Port, the gate was built at the terminus for the river trade along the Brenta between Padua and Venice. The present building replaces the Portello Vecchio, on what is now via San Massimo, but is different from the city's other contemporary gates - the external facade is adorned with white Istrian marble, with four pairs of columns surmounted by an architrave embellished with four trachyte cannonballs. The three-arch bridge carrying the road over the Canale Piovego and through the gate is guarded by two white stone lions. This conceals the gate's true tactical nature. Stones in the gate (still legible today) commemorate the ancient origins of the town, eulogising its good governance. Since 1535 a clock stands out from the gate on a sort of "torrino" (vaguely like that on the Quirinal), in Nanto stone, atop the gate. Traces of frescoes can also be seen inside the gate.
Porta Liviana - Begun in 1509, it was completed in 1517 and named in honour of Bartolomeo d'Alviano himself.
Porta Santa Croce - On the site of a gate in the Carraresi wall, the present gate was begun in 1509 and was originally defended by a tower, demolished in 1632.
Later use of the walls
Recent discussions about the city walls have discussed creating a green ring around them, a green lung as envisioned by the town planner Luigi Piccinato, though recent works seem to be moving in the opposite direction (including the controversial monument "Memory and Light" by the architect Daniel Libeskind in the golena of the Porte Contarine).

Diacerein (INN), also known as diacetylrhein, is a slow-acting medicine of the class anthraquinone used to treat joint diseases such as osteoarthritis (swelling and pain in the joints). It works by inhibiting interleukin-1 beta. An updated 2014 Cochrane review found diacerein had a small beneficial effect on pain. Diacerein-containing medications are registered in some European Union and Asian countries and included as a treatment option on several international therapeutic guidelines.
Pharmacology
Diacerein works by blocking the actions of interleukin-1 beta, a protein involved in the inflammation and destruction of cartilage that plays a role in the development of symptoms of degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis. Due to its specific mode of action, which does not involve the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, diacerein has been shown to have anti-osteoarthritis and cartilage stimulating properties in vitro and animal models.
Side effects
The most common side effects of diacerein treatment are gastrointestinal symptoms including soft stools and diarrhea. These are generally mild to moderate and occur more frequently in the first 2 weeks, and lessen with continued treatment. Based on review by European Medicines Agency (EMA), diacerein-containing medicines use is restricted due to severe diarrhoea and liver disorders in patients.
An uncommon side effect is hepatic adverse events (most frequently reported as liver function test abnormalities). These have been described as mild/moderate cases of elevated liver enzymes in the blood.
Mild skin reactions (rash, pruritus and eczema) have also been reported with diacerein treatment.
Discoloration of urine (yellow or pink) is another side effect of diacerein. This effect is due to the elimination of rhein metabolites via the urine and no clinical significance has been found; it may also be dependent on general fluid intake.
Special warning
In 2014 the European Medicines Agency (EMA's) Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) performed a review of diacerein-containing medicines over concerns about its gastrointestinal and liver effects. As a result, the PRAC has introduced additional proposals to manage diacerein's risks and was satisfied that with new restrictions diacerein's benefit on pain outweighs the side effects for osteoarthritis treatment. The following recommendations have been made around the use of diacerein:
Due to the potential complications that can occur as a result of diarrhea in older adults, diacerein is no longer recommended in patients aged 65 years and above.
It is also advised that patients start treatment on half the normal dose (i.e. 50 mg daily instead of 100 mg daily), and should stop taking diacerein if diarrhea occurs.
It should not be used in any patient with liver disease or a history of liver disease, and doctors should be monitoring their patients for early signs of liver problems.
The use of diacerein is to be limited to treating symptoms of osteoarthritis affecting the hip or knee.
Diacerein should not be administered during pregnancy and lactation.
The PRAC concluded that the benefit-risk balance of diacerein-containing medicinal products remained favourable in the symptomatic treatment osteoarthritis, subject to the agreed changes to the product information and conditions.
Dosage and administration
The recommended starting dose is 50 mg once daily with evening meal for the first 2 to 4 weeks of treatment, after which the recommended daily dose is 50 mg twice daily.
The treatment should be taken with food, one with breakfast and the other with evening meal. The capsules must be swallowed intact, without opening them, together with a glass of water.

Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA), also called combined malonic and methylmalonic acidemia is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of malonic acid and methylmalonic acid. Some researchers have hypothesized that CMAMMA might be one of the most common forms of methylmalonic acidemia, and possibly one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism. Due to being infrequently diagnosed, it most often goes undetected.
Symptoms and signs
The clinical phenotypes of CMAMMA are highly heterogeneous and range from asymptomatic, mild to severe symptoms. The underlying pathophysiology is not yet understood. The following symptoms are reported in the literature:
metabolic acidosis
coma
hypoglycemia
seizures
gastrointestinal disease
developmental delay
speech delay
failure to thrive
psychiatric disease
memory problems
cognitive decline
encephalopathy
cardiomyopathy
dysmorphic features
When the first symptoms appear in childhood, they are more likely to be intermediary metabolic disorders, whereas in adults they are usually neurological symptoms.
Causes
CMAMMA can be divided by causation into two separate inherited disorders: one is a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3, encoded by the ACSF3 gene (OMIM#614265); the other disorder is a malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency encoded by the MLYCD gene (OMIM#248360).
ACSF3 deficiency
CMAMMA due to ACSF3 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The ACSF3 gene is located on chromosome 16 locus q24.3 and consists of 11 exons and encodes a 576-amino-acid protein. CMAMMA can be caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in the ACSF3 gene. Based on minor allele frequency (MAF), a population incidence of ~ 1: 30 000 can be predicted for CMAMMA due to ACSF3.
Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency
CMAMMA due to malonyl-CoA decarboxylase is also inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The MLYCD gene is located on chromosome 16 locus q23.3.
Pathophysiology
ACSF3
ACSF3 encodes an acyl-CoA synthetase, which is localized in the mitochondria and has a high specificity for malonic acid and methylmalonic acid. Thus, the synthetase catalyzes the synthesis of malonyl-CoA as well as methylmalonyl-CoA.
Malonic acid
The conversion of malonic acid to malonyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthetase represents the first step in the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII) pathway, which plays an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism and which should not be confused with the more familiar fatty acid synthesis that occurs in the cytoplasm. The dysfunctional mtFASII pathway leads to an accumulation of malonic acid, which has a competitive inhibitory effect on complex II, and also leads to a deficiency of malonyl-CoA. These deficiencies can be continued to the end-product of the mtFASII pathway, octanoyl-ACP. The consequences of this are diminished oxidative phosphorylation and major alterations in complex lipids, such as increased levels of sphingomyelins and cardiolipins and lower levels of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylglycerol and ceramides. Since octanoyl-ACP is the direct precursor in lipoic acid synthesis, this results in diminished lipoylation, since lipoic acid acts as an essential cofactor for several mitochondrial multienzyme complexes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-KGDHC), among others. This diminished lipoylation also leads to a reduced glycolytic flux. To likely compensate for the cell's energy demand, an upregulation of fatty acid β-oxidation and a decreased concentration of certain amino acids that feed anaplerotically into the citrate cycle, such as glutamine (via the fifth site of the citrate cycle), leucine, isoleucine, threonine (all via the sixth site of the citrate cycle) and aspartate (via the 10th site of the citrate cycle), could be detected. In summary, this reduced mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic flux results in impaired mitochondrial flexibility with a large dependence on fatty acid β-oxidation.
However, neurons, with the exception of hypothalamic neurons, are not capable of satisfying their large energy demands by degrading fatty acids. It is speculated that an upregulation of β-oxidation also occurs in brain cells due to the hypofunctional mtFASII pathway. The consequence would be an increased risk for hypoxia and oxidative stress, which may contribute to neurological symptoms in the long term.
Methylmalonic acid
Methylmalonic acid is formed from the essential amino acids valine, methionine, threonine and isoleucine, from odd-chained fatty acids, from propionate and from cholesterol side chain, on the degradation path into the citrate cycle. In this process, the last intermediate methylmalony-CoA can be converted to methymalonic acid by a deacylase before incorporation at the succinyl-CoA site of the citrate cycle. At this point, the acyl-CoA synthease encoded by ACSF3 could convert the methylmalonic acid back to methylmalonyl-CoA and then feed it to the citrate cycle with the help of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and its cofactor vitamin B12. However, intracellular esterases are also capable of cleaving the methyl group of methylmalonic acid and generating the parent molecule malonic acid.
Bacterial fermentation in the gut is a quantitatively significant source of propionate, which is a precursor for methylmalonic acid. Alongside this, propionic acid is also absorbed through the diet, as it is naturally present in certain foods or is added as a preservative by the food industry, especially in baked goods and dairy products. In addition, methylmalonate is formed during catabolism of thymine.
In a study with fibroblasts, increased accumulations of triglycerides, an altered profile of fatty acid chain length and the presence of odd chain fatty acids were detected. A partial degradation due to accumulated methylmalonic acid and the use of propionyl-CoA as a starter unit for fatty acid synthesis is suggested as a possible cause, supported by the observation of a higher expression of CD36, which imports fatty acids into the cell.
In vitro, a connection between free methylmalonic acid and malonic acid to neurotoxicity could be established.
Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency
Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase acts as a catalyst in the conversion of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and CO2. It is speculated that in MCD deficiency, the excess of mitochondrial malonyl-CoA increases methylmalonic acid levels, as a result of an inhibitory effect on methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. In the cytoplasm, malonyl-CoA acts as an inhibitor of the mitochondrial outer membrane enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), which consequently inhibits fatty acid oxidation. The inhibitory effect of cytoplastic malonyl-CoA on CPT1 varies, so it inhibits roughly 100-fold greater in cardiac and skeletal muscles than in the liver.
Diagnosis
Due to a wide range of clinical symptoms and largely slipping through newborn screening programs, CMAMMA is thought to be an under-recognized condition.
Newborn screening programs
Because CMAMMA due to ACSF3 does not result in accumulation of methylmalonyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, or propionyl-CoA, nor are abnormalities seen in the acylcarnitine profile, CMAMMA is not detected by standard blood-based newborn screening programs.
A special case is the province of Quebec, which, in addition to the blood test, also screens urine on the 21st day after birth with the Quebec Neonatal Blood and Urine Screening Program. This makes Quebec province interesting for CMAMMA research, as it represents the only patient cohort in the world without selection bias. Between 1975 and 2010, an estimated 2 695 000 newborns were thus screened, with 3 detections of CMAMMA due to ACSF3. However, based on this lower detection rate to the predicted rate by heterozygous frequencies, it is likely that not all newborns with this biochemical phenotype were detected by the screening program. A 2019 study then identified as many as 25 CMAMMA due to ACSF3 patients in the province of Quebec. All but one came to clinical attention through the Provincial Neonatal Urine Screening Program, 20 of them directly and 4 after the diagnosis of an older sibling.
Malonic acid to methylmalonic acid ratio
The use of plasma rather than urine is recommended for determining the ratio of malonic acid to methylmalonic acid. Since even with an increase in sensitivity for malonic acid (MA), concentrations in urine samples can be so subtle that they are easily missed. In contrast, if only urinary methylmalonic acid (MAA) is used as the sole matrix, then CMAMMA due to ACSF3 may be misdiagnosed as classic methylmalonic acidemia. Also the calculation of the MA/MAA ratio in urine is not useful, because due to overlapping, healthy individuals cannot be clearly distinguished from CMAMMA affected individuals. Whereas, by calculating the MA/MMA ratio in plasma, a CMAMMA can be clearly distinguished from a classic methylmalonic acidemia. This is true for both, vitamin B12 responders and non-responders in methylmalonic acidemia.
In CMAMMA due to ACSF3, methylamlonic acid levels exceed those of malonic acid. In contrast, in CMAMMA due to malonyl-CoA deficiency, the MMA/MA ratio is less than 1.
Genetic testing
Extended carrier screening (ECS) in the course of fertility treatment can also identify carriers of mutations in the ACSF3 gene.
Treatments
Dietary
One approach to reduce the accumulating amount of malonic acid and methylmalonic acid is diet. Here, a diet high in carbohydrate and low in protein has been shown to be best. Changes in malonic acid and methylmalonic acid excretion can be seen as early as 24-36 h after a change in diet.
Bacteria-reducing measures
Another quantitatively significant source of malonic acid and methylmalonic acid, in addition to dietary protein intake, is bacterial fermentation. This leads to treatment measure such as the administration of antibiotics and laxatives.
Vitamin B12
Since some forms of methylmalonic acidemia respond to vitamin B12, treatment attempts in CMAMMA due to ACSF3 with vitamin B12 have been made, also in the form of hydroxocobalamin injections, which, however did not lead to any clinical or biochemical effects.
L-Carnitin
One study also mentions treatment with L-carnitine in patients with CMAMMA due to ACSF3, but only retrospectively and without mentioning results.
messenger RNA
Preclinical proof of concept studies in animal models have shown that messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy is also suitable for use in rare metabolic diseases. In this regard, the phase 1/2 study (mRNA-3704 & mRNA-3705) for the treatment of isolated methylmalonic acidemia, which has been ongoing since 2019 by the biotechnology company Moderna, is worth mentioning.
Research
In 1984, CMAMMA (due to malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency) was described for the first time in a scientific study. Further studies on this form of CMAMMA followed until 1994, when another form of CMAMMA with normal malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity was discovered. In 2011, genetic research through exome sequencing identified the ACSF3 gene as a cause of CMAMMA with normal malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. With a study published in 2016, calculation of the MA/MAA ratio in plasma presented a new possibility for rapid, metabolic diagnosis of CMAMMA.

Notes
The term combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria with the suffix -uria (from Greek ouron, urine) has become established in the scientific literature in contrast to the other term combined malonic and methylmalonic acedemia with the suffix -emia (from Greek aima, blood). However, in the context of CMAMMA, no clear distinction is made, since malonic acid and methylmalonic acid are elevated in both blood and urine.

Ratha Yatra (), or Chariot festival, is any public procession in a chariot. The term particularly refers to the annual Ratha Yatra in Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal and other East Indian states, particularly the Odia festival that involve a public procession with a chariot with deities Jagannath (Vishnu avatar), Balabhadra (his brother), Subhadra (his sister) and Sudarshana Chakra (his weapon) on a ratha, a wooden deula-shaped chariot. Ratha Yatra processions have been historically common in Vishnu-related (Jagannath, Rama, Krishna) traditions in Hinduism across India, in Shiva-related traditions, saints and goddesses in Nepal, with Tirthankaras in Jainism, as well as tribal folk religions found in the eastern states of India. Notable Ratha Yatras in India include the Ratha Yatra of Puri, the Dhamrai Ratha Yatra and the Ratha Yatra of Mahesh.
Ratha Yatra of Guptipara and Santipur Hindu communities outside India, such as in Singapore, celebrate Ratha Yatra such as those associated with Jagannath, Krishna, Shiva and Mariamman. According to Knut Jacobsen, a Ratha Yatra has religious origins and meaning, but the events have a major community heritage, social sharing and cultural significance to the organizers and participants.
Western impressions of the Jagannath Ratha Yatra in Puri as a display of unstoppable force are the origin of the English word juggernaut.
Etymology
Ratha Yatra is derived from two Sanskrit words, Ratha, which means chariot or carriage, and Yatra which means journey or pilgrimage. In other Indian languages such as Odia, the phonetic equivalents are used, such as jatra.
Description
Ratha Yatra is a journey in a chariot accompanied by the public. It typically refers to a procession (journey) of deities, people dressed like deities, or simply religious saints and political leaders. The term appears in medieval texts of India such as the Puranas, which mention the Ratha Yatra of Surya (Sun god), of Devi (Mother goddess), and of Vishnu. These chariot journeys have elaborate celebrations where the individuals or the deities come out of a temple accompanied by the public journeying with them through the Ksetra (region, streets) to another temple or to the river or the sea. Sometimes the festivities include returning to the sacrosanctum of the temple.
Places
Jagannath Ratha Yatra, Puri
During the Jagannath Ratha Yatra, the triads are usually worshiped in the sanctum of the temple at Puri, but once during the month of Asadha (Rainy Season of Odisha, usually falling in month of June or July), they are brought out onto the Bada Danda (main street of Puri) and travel (3 km) to the Shri Gundicha Temple, in huge chariots (ratha), allowing the public to have darśana (Holy view). This festival is known as Ratha Yatra, meaning the journey (yatra) of the chariots (ratha). The Rathas are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 45 feet high and 35 feet square . The artists and painters of Puri decorate the chariots and paint flower petals and other designs on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne. The Ratha Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha Yatra.
The most significant ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra is the chhera pahara. During the festival, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the Chera Pahara (sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati King cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion. As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign Gajapati King and the most humble devotee.
Chera pahara is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, when the deities are taken to garden house at Mausi Maa Temple and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.
As per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the Chariots in Pahandi Vijay.
In the Ratha Yatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the Gundicha Temple, where they stay for nine days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in bahuda jatra. On the way back, the three chariots halt at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered Poda Pitha, a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the people of Odisha.
The observance of the Ratha Yatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas. Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in Brahma Purana, Padma Purana, and Skanda Purana. Kapila Samhita also refers to Ratha Yatra. In Moghul period also, King Ramsingh of Jaipur, Rajasthan has been described as organizing the Ratha Yatra in the 18th Century. In Odisha, Kings of Mayurbhanj and Parlakhemundi were organizing the Ratha Yatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri.
Moreover, Starza notes that the ruling Ganga dynasty instituted the Ratha Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. Friar Odoric of Pordenone visited India in 1316–1318, some 20 years after Marco Polo had dictated the account of his travels while in a Genoese prison. In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the "idols" on chariots, and the King and Queen and all the people drew them from the "church" with song and music.
International Jagannath Ratha Yatra
The Ratha Yatra festival has become a common sight in most major cities of the world since 1968 through the Hare Krishna movement. Local chapters put on the festival annually in over a hundred cities worldwide.
Dhamrai Jagannath Rathayatra
Dhamrai Jagannath Ratha is a chariot temple, a Roth, dedicated to the Hindu God Jagannath located in Dhamrai, Bangladesh. The annual Jagannath Ratha Yatra is a famous Hindu festival attracting thousands of people. The Ratha Yatra in Dhamrai is one of the most important events for the Hindu community of Bangladesh. The original historical Roth was burnt down by the Pakistan Army in 1971 The Roth has since been rebuilt with Indian assistance.
Rathayatra of Mahesh
The Rathayatra of Mahesh is the second oldest chariot festival in India (after the Rath Yatra]] at Puri) and the oldest in Bengal, having been celebrated since 1396 CE. It is a month-long festival held at Mahesh in Serampore of West Bengal and a grand fair is held at that time. People throng to have a share in pulling the long ropes (Roshi) attached to the chariots of Lord Jagannath, Balarama and Subhadra on the journey from the temple to Gundicha Bari (Masir bari) and back. Subhadra is worshipped with Krishna in Jagannath Yatra.
Manipur
The practice of Ratha Yatra in Manipur was introduced in the nineteenth century. The Khaki Ngamba chronicle mentions that on a Monday in either April or May 1829, the King of Manipur Gambhir Singh was passing through Sylhet whilst on a British expedition against the Khasis. Two processions were being prepared by Sylhet's Muslim and Hindu communities respectively. The Islamic month of Muharram in the history of Sylhet was a lively time during which tazia processions were common. This happened to fall on the same day as Ratha Yatra. Sensing possible communal violence, the Faujdar of Sylhet, Ganar Khan, requested the Hindu community to delay their festival by one day. Contrary to the Nawab's statement, a riot emerged between the two communities. As a Hindu himself, Singh managed to defend the Hindus and disperse the Muslim rioters with his Manipuri troops. The Ratha Yatra was not delayed, and Singh stayed to take part in it. Revered by the Hindu community as a defender of their faith, he enjoyed the procession and initiated the practice of celebrating Ratha Yatra and worshipping Jagannath in his own homeland of Manipur.

"Untouched" is a song by Australian duo the Veronicas, which is featured on their second studio album Hook Me Up (2007). Toby Gad assisted the duo in writing the song and is also the producer. It was released as the second single from the band's album in Australia on 10 December 2007, and the first single in the UK and US.
"Untouched" received generally positive reviews from music critics, which applauded the departure from their previous music, with some highlighting it as the album's standout track and comparing it to the work of Pink and Avril Lavigne. The song was commercially successful worldwide, as the song reached number seventeen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, becoming the group's only top twenty there and was known as their breakthrough single. The song also peaked at number eight in the United Kingdom, number two in their native Australia, number nine in New Zealand and at number one in Ireland. The song was certified platinum by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over one million shipments there.
An accompanying music video was released for the single, directed by Anthony Rose, where it was shot in Sydney, Australia. The video starts with a lot of pictures in the hallway. The video received generally positive reviews, having over 60 million hits on YouTube. The song was featured in 90210, The Hills and then in Hellcats and also featured in EA Sports game, FIFA 09. The song has also been nominated for different awards, being nominated for Highest Selling Single at the ARIA Music Awards and nominated for Favorite Song at the Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards.
Background and composition
"Untouched" was written by the Veronicas twins Jessica Origliasso and Lisa Origliasso along with Toby Gad, the track's producer. Writing and recording of the song took place at Jessica and Lisa's home in Los Angeles, California. The song relates to Jessica and Lisa's feelings of separation from loved ones. In an interview with Rachel Jones of Female First, Lisa explained the theme of "Untouched": "It's about not physically being able to touch someone or be with them but kind of needing that person".
"Untouched" is an electropop and power pop song set in common time with an energy-filled fast tempo of 176 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of F-sharp minor. The song begins with strings, which are sometimes performed by a real string section in live performances, followed by guitars and synthesized drums. Lisa and Jess's vocal ranges span from A3-E5.
Critical reception
Ben Norman from About.com said "Untouched" is fast, both in BPM and in the way the twins vocally present the song, yet it proves once again that speed and pain are not mutually exclusive ideas.". K. Ross Hoffman from AllMusic had highlighted the track as an album standout, saying " "Untouched" bursts out of the gate with majestic, menacing string stabs and a driving synth-rock pulse beneath its stuttered verses and breathlessly obsessive refrain." Emily Mackay from NME gave it a positive remark from the album review as she described the song as "raunchy". Evan Sawdey from PopMatters highlighted "Untouched" as a standout, saying "some of the best tracks the girls have ever made, some of which ("Untouched", "Revenge Is Sweeter") even outclass previous high points like Secret Life's flawless anthem "When It All Falls Apart"."
David Balls from Digital Spy gave it three stars out of five. He said "Though it's been knocking about for a while, it's 'Untouched' that The Veronicas are touting as their breakthrough single over here." He concluded saying "There's little in the way of originality here, but the girls' vampish style and quirky charm should work in their favour." He had compared the song to the music of Pink and Avril Lavigne. FemaleFirst.co.uk gave the song four-and-a-half out of five stars, saying "Other than that, this looks set to be an epic dance floor tune over the summer of 2009, it's definitely finding a place on my iPod that's for sure!".
Chart performance
In their native Australia, the song debuted at number four, and rose to its peak of number two a week later. It remained there for three consecutive weeks, and stayed in the top ten for thirteen weeks and in the charts for a total of 29 weeks. It was certified platinum by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for selling over 70,000 copies there, and ranked at numbers 78 and 21 on the list of the best-selling songs of Australia in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The song debuted at number 34 on the New Zealand Singles Chart and peaked at number nine, charting for a total of 29 weeks. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), shipping over 7,500 copies there.
"Untouched" made its debut on the US Billboard charts at number 16 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, but eventually dropped off the charts until the week dated 13 December 2008, when it debuted at number 62 on the Hot 100, due to radio play, and became their first Hot 100 entry. The song entered the top forty two weeks later at number 40, and peaked at number 17 on the week dated 7 February 2009, making it their first and only top 20 hit in the US. It was present on the chart for a total of 20 weeks, spending its final week on the chart at number 81 on the week dated 25 April 2009. The single has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for sales of over one million units in the US. In neighbouring Canada, the song entered the Canadian Hot 100 at number 68 in June 2008, but dropped to number 88 a week later, and fell off the chart the following week. It re-entered the chart for one week at number 97 in November, but fell off again a week later. For the week dated 20 December 2008, "Untouched" re-entered the Canadian Hot 100 at number 85, climbing to a new peak of 59 the following week. Nine weeks later, it entered the top ten at number eight, becoming the group's first top ten hit there, and peaked at number five in its seventeenth week. It spent a total of two weeks in the top ten, and was present on the chart for 24 weeks.
"Untouched" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at 92. "Untouched" received an "MTV Push" and large amounts of airplay on music channels when it was officially released on 25 May 2009. On 31 May 2009, "Untouched" re-entered the chart at number eight, becoming its British chart peak. It stayed in the top ten for five consecutive weeks. In Ireland, the song initially entered the chart at a lower position, but re-entered the chart at number two in the Irish Singles Chart in the week dated 29 May 2009. After two weeks at number two, in the week dated 12 June 2009 "Untouched" climbed to the top of the Irish Singles Chart, making "Untouched" The Veronicas' first number-one single outside of Australia. It spent one week at number one and eight consecutive weeks in the top ten.
Music video
The music video for the song was filmed at the Marble Bar in Sydney's Hilton Building and it took eighteen hours to film with fifty extras dressed in gothic glamour. The video starts with a lot of pictures in the hallway. It goes to the band performing with a crowd in front of them. Jess and Lisa are in the hallway singing. They meet a man later. In the chorus, Jess and Lisa perform with the rest of the group. Jess is hanging around with the man and after a while, she goes to get something. The man then sees Lisa walking around in the crowd, and, since they are twins, he thinks that she is Jess. So he follows her and brings her back to the couch where he was sitting. In a little bit, Jess comes back to the couch. She sees that the man is kissing Lisa, and is offended. They see that he is trying to make a move with both of them, so together, they walk away. The music video was released on 3 December 2007 to Australian music channel shows. The video made its debut on MTV's TRL as a first look on 9 July 2008, and a week later made its debut on the countdown at #10.
Live performance
The Veronicas performed the song live at the ARIA Music Awards in 2008.

Betty Jane Williams (1919 – December 8, 2008) was an American aviator. She worked in various fields in the aviation industry throughout her life and became a Lieutenant Colonel by the time she retired from the United States Airforce Reserves in 1979. Williams also served as one of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) in 1944. She was also noted for her military and industrial film-work.
Biography
Williams was born in Kingston, Pennsylvania in 1919. She became interested in flying after witnessing a barnstorming pilot perform a stunt in 1939.
Williams earned her pilot's license in June 1941 from the Civilian Pilot Training Program. After the United States entered World War II, she was unable to fly and went on to be a flight attendant with the Canadian Colonial Airlines. The company sent her to train at the University of Vermont and then Williams went on to teach both instrument flight techniques to pilots in the Navy and in the civilian sector. In January 1944, she joined the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) where she was a test pilot, flying fixed aircraft to see if they were airworthy again. Williams was stationed at Randolph Field until the deactivation of the WASP on December 20, 1944. Williams continued to train both military and civilian pilots between 1945 and 1947.
Williams developed a show for CBS-TV called Let's Go Flying, which was broadcast in 1947. Between 1948 and 1952, she worked as a technical writer in the aerospace engineering field and wrote flight operations manuals and visual instruction charts for military aircraft. She also created training films for military planes.
When the Korean War broke out, Williams signed up to serve in 1952. She was one of only 2 women who were selected to work on the 1354th Video Production Squadron. After the war, Williams stayed in the Air Force Reserves.
She worked as a motion picture coordinator for the Lockheed California Company between 1954 and 1974. In 1966, Williams was honored by the California Federation of Business and Professional Women for her work writing, producing and directing both industrial and military films. Williams continued to serve in the military for 28 years, attaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel by the time she retired in 1979.
In 2006, Williams was inducted into the Women in Aviation International Pioneer Hall of Fame. Williams died on December 8, 2008 from complications related to a stroke at the Providence Tarzana Medical Center.

"Time Won't Let Me" is a garage rock song that was recorded by the Outsiders in September 1965. The song became a major hit in the United States in 1966, reaching #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week of April 16 of that year. It is ranked as the 42nd biggest American hit of 1966.
In Canada, the song also reached #5 in the weekly charts.
History
Background
In contrast to the numerous American bands that formed in the wake of the British Invasion, the musicians who became the Outsiders had been active in the Cleveland music scene since 1958, when fifteen year old guitarist and saxophonist Tom King founded the band as a rhythm & blues combo called the Starfires.
By early 1965 the band's membership consisted of King on rhythm guitar, Al Austin on lead guitar (later substituted by Bill Bruno), Mert Madsen on bass, and Jim Fox on drums. Later that year, Fox departed for college and was replaced by Ronnie Harkai, who would play drums on "Time Won't Let Me." Around the same time, the band recruited Sonny Geraci to handle the lead vocals.
The group was under contract with Pama Records, which was owned by King's uncle, Patrick Connelly. In late 1965 the band recorded "Time Won't Let Me" locally at Cleveland Recording Company for Pama. Sufficiently impressed upon hearing it, Capitol Records signed the band on the strength of the song, and shortly thereafter King changed the band's name from the Starfires to the Outsiders, possibly at the urging of the new label. One account of the change was that King and Kelley had become "outsiders" within the family as a result of the label switch.
Composition
The song was composed by the band's guitarist Tom King and Chet Kelley. A simple, catchy, and danceable tune, the song's basic arrangement is augmented by a horn section, applied in an unobtrusive manner so as not to detract from the band's fundamental sound, which on this occasion features a signature riff from a twelve-string electric guitar. The song also features an electric organ with vibrato, heard in the verses, and a complex counterpoint melody in the other vocals in the coda section, where the scream trumpet is heard before the song's fade.
The song's lyrics are about rejecting a love relationship, the lead singer stating that he cannot wait forever, even though his love interest wants him to wait, because time won't let him be involved in the waiting game.
Release
"Time Won't Let Me" was released as a single on Capitol Records in January 1966 and was backed with "Was it Really Real" on the flipside. King produced the record and, along with Tommy Baker, was instrumental in the horn arrangements. The song went on to become a huge nationwide hit for the group, reaching #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the week of April 16. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc—a feat the band would never again be able to match.
In 1966 the Outsiders recorded their debut album for Capitol, Time Won't Let Me, titled after the hit song. Produced by Tom King, the album included five original songs written by King and Kelley. They proved to be a formidable songwriting team, and the band was also adept at handling covers of R&B songs. Drummer Ronnie Harkai departed shortly after the recording of "Time Won't Let Me" to join the Air Force, and Jim Fox returned briefly to fill in, playing on most of the remaining cuts recorded for the album. Following the recording of the album, Bennie Benson became the group's drummer, later to be replaced by Ricky Baker.
The Outsiders promoted their hit single with almost a year of nationwide touring, as "Time Won't Let Me" stayed on the national charts for 15 weeks. The band first toured with Paul Revere and the Raiders and then with Chad and Jeremy, and later were part of a six-week tour of one-night stands headed by Gene Pitney, and which included seven or eight other acts, among them Len Barry, B.J. Thomas, and Bobby Goldsboro. Afterwards, the Outsiders joined a four-week tour with several garage rock and psychedelic rock bands, such as the Seeds and the Shadows of Knight. They also made a national television appearance on Hullabaloo.

The Shirley Towers Fire occurred in a tower block on 6 April 2010 in Southampton, Hampshire, England. Two firefighters were killed when a fire developed and spread from the 9th floor. The investigations and inquiries following the fire led to changes in fire safety rules nationally, particularly the regulations around electrical wiring.
Background
Shirley Towers is a 15-storey concrete tower block of 150 apartments located in the Shirley area of Southampton and is home to about 400 people. The building dates from the mid-1960s and is of the unusual scissor section construction where each apartment is spread over several floors in an interlocking design.
The fire
The fire started when curtains in the lounge of the flat caught fire from being on top of an uplighter lamp (light fitting.) Emergency crews were called at 20:10 on 6 April 2010. The fire response teams were confused by the complex layout of the building and of the flat itself. The flat was very smoky with zero visibility and firefighters did not locate the fire in the lounge. The flat rapidly became very hot - more than 1,000°C. The firefighters tried to escape through the flat's fire exit on the 11th floor. Two firefighters managed to escape but needed hospital treatment for burns. Firefighters James Shears and Alan Bannon were overcome by sudden exposure to intense heat and died at the top landing of the flat. The escaping firefighters got tangled in cables that fell from the roof, both inside and outside the flat, after the heat from the fire melted the plastic trunking they were contained in.
Inquest and Inquiry
The Coroner's inquest highlighted the "extremely difficult and dangerous" conditions in the fire, but noted that "numerous factors" led to the eventual tragedy which could be addressed to stop a similar future tragedy. After the inquest the coroner issued a "Rule 43 letter." This is a letter to other statutory authorities designed to prevent future deaths.
The Rule 43 letter made nine recommendations to the Government and fire services. These included:
Improved training for firefighters.
Changing building regulations to ensure fire resistant cable supports.
Fitting of sprinklers to existing residential buildings over 30 metres tall.
Improved escape signage.
Changes to the British Standards electrical wiring regulations finally came into force in July 2015 following the Shirley Towers tragedy, and the previous Harrow Court fire, where similar problems were a factor in firefighter deaths.

Henry Huggins is the first book in the Henry Huggins series of children's novels, written by Beverly Cleary. Henry is an ordinary boy who manages to get into funny scrapes with his dog, Ribsy. First published on September 6, 1950, it was originally illustrated by Louis Darling and later by Tracy Dockray. It has been translated into Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Hebrew, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish, and published as audio books read by Barbara Caruso and Neil Patrick Harris.
The book was a response to a letter from a child saying, "Where are the books about the kids like us?" One critic called the character of "Henry" the "modern Tom Sawyer."
The character of Henry Huggins returned in later books and also in a play which was written by Beverly Cleary and Cynthia J. McGean.

The Hiram Charles Todd House, also known as the Marvin-Sackett-Todd House, is located at 4 Franklin Square in Saratoga Springs, Saratoga County, New York. It is a Greek Revival house built in the 1830s by a local hotelier. Later it was home to Hiram Charles Todd, a descendant of one of the original owners who was active in New York state politics.
The house remains intact today with almost no alterations. In 1972 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the very first listing in Saratoga Springs. Later that year it became a contributing property to the Franklin Square Historic District. Two decades later that district became part of the new West Side Historic District. It is currently used as office space for several local businesses.
Building
The house is located on the corner of Franklin Street just south of the square. The neighborhood is residential, with large trees lining the streets. The other houses are similar in size to the Todd House, either in Greek Revival as well or other Victorian styles. An iron fence runs along the north and east edges of the property; there is a parking lot in the rear.
It is two stories high, with a square three-by-three-bay central block and seven-bay T-shaped rear wing. The siding is clapboard over wood frame with diagonal brick braces. A wide entablature goes down to the middle of the second story windows; fretwork flanks the three on the east (front) facade. The main entrance is flanked by projecting bay windows. The mostly flat roof is pierced by six chimneys.
On that elevation, a full-height pedimented portico with four Doric fluted columns shelters the main entrance. It is one of five porches on the building. Two on the north side, facing Division Street, have colonnades echoing that on the front. On the west (rear), the only portion of the building with a gabled roof, there is a small upstairs porch and larger enclosed one downstairs.
Inside, the central hall has a double staircase that converges into a curved single one. The drawing room runs the length of the south side of the house on the first story. It is divided with a semi-elliptical arch. On the west end of the living room two French doors lead into the music room.
History
The house was built by Thomas Marvin, a nephew of the founder of the United States Hotel, one of Saratoga Springs' early resorts. The exact date is unknown, but it was likely built in 1837, around the time of his marriage. Marvin at the time was co-owner of the hotel along with his brother, and the house faced the rear of the hotel across the square, originally called Marvin Square after the family. The front bay windows were added shortly after it was built.
During the house's construction, in 1833, Marvin heard of the proposed rail link that would connect the village with existing tracks at Ballston Spa. He sold a piece of land to the railroad so that the trains could run past the house and the hotel. The house thus became a landmark of Saratoga Springs to visitors.
It remained with the Marvins and their descendants for a century. Two of them were active in politics. William A. Sackett, Marvin's son-in-law served as a congressman around 1850, and later spent his last years in the house. Hiram Charles Todd, a lawyer and friend of the Sackett family who had served as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, inherited the house in 1927. It has since been reused as private office space.

CEO
Kang launched a vintage fashion brand called Reborn Process in December 2009. She started the business with Yoon Ae-ri, a stylist whom Kang got to know at Ford Modeling competition, and Lee Jun-yeop, a photographer and filmmaker. Instead of showcasing few collections before opening a boutique, Kang first opened her store and started working on the collection after Reborn Process became renowned. Kang redesigns and remakes new pieces with items thrifted mainly from Los Angeles, San Diego, and New York to fit today's style and taste. She wishes to make her collection "one of a kind" and wants Reborn Process to develop into a multi brand shop. Her boutique is located in SoHo, New York.
Designer
Kang collaborated with a South Korean fashion brand called Love Cat. She designed bags under Hyoni-line while she traveled back and forth from New York to Seoul, South Korea. This limited edition bag, which was released in September 2011, was popular as a 'must have it item' because of its chic and romantic design as well as its practical aspect in which one can either adjust the straps to different lengths, use another chain strap that comes with the bag, or even take all the straps off and use the bag as a clutch.
In April 2013, it was announced that Kang would collaborate with a South Korean fashion brand called Lapalette to create a special line of handbags. Bags designed by Kang were scheduled to be released in June 2013. Kang's new line was made available for purchase through Lapalette's website.
Director
Hyoni TV is a fashion film that started in May 2012, written, directed, produced, and hosted by Kang. Hyoni TV was shot in New York and Hyoni explained New Yorker's style and gave styling tips. In her film, Kang also introduced famous fashion people such as Eva Chen, Teen Vogue editor, and Shu Pei Quin, a model.
TV show host
Kang was featured in a South Korean fashion TV show, Get It Style, as a main host. This program that aimed to become "the Style Bible" was first aired on 7 February 2013. It was originally designed to have only four episodes; however, due to its popularity, the directors extended the show to have six additional episodes. In Get It Styles, Kang not only simply stated the general fashion trend of what is in and what is out today, but also introduced items that fits different individual's style and how to style accordingly to different occasions. She also gave advice on how to utilize one's currently-owned item and shop wisely.
Other TV appearances
Before hosting the show Get It Style, Kang appeared in TV few times. She was MC for a show called Trend Report Feel season 6 (In New York) and appeared in an episode of Korean reality TV show, Muhan Dojeon, also known as Infinite Challenge, on 5 December 2009.

The groove-billed toucanet (Aulacorhynchus sulcatus) is a species of bird in the family Ramphastidae. It is found in mountains of north-eastern Colombia and northern Venezuela. Its natural habitat is subtropical and upper tropical humid forest and woodland, occasionally also occurring in gardens.
Taxonomy and systematics
The groove-billed toucanet was originally described in the genus Pteroglossus.
Subspecies
Three subspecies are recognized:
A. s. sulcatus - (Swainson, 1820): Found in northern Venezuela
A. s. erythrognathus - Gould, 1874: Formerly considered as a separate species. Found in north-eastern Venezuela
Yellow-billed toucanet (A. s. calorhynchus) - Gould, 1874: Formerly considered as a separate species until 2012. Some other authorities still treat it as a separate species. Found in north-western Venezuela and north-eastern Colombia
Description
It has a total length ca. and it weighs . It is, as are other members of its genus, mainly green. The throat is white (or pale bluish in the subspecies A. s. erythrognathus) and the ocular skin is blue. The bill is black with maroon markings, but the maroon is replaced by yellow in the yellow-billed toucanet. This distinctive subspecies is found in the western part of the species' range, but is vocally similar to the other subspecies and hybrids are known from the region where it comes into contact with A. s. sulcatus. Genetic evidence suggests they should remain as subspecies of a single species.
It is generally fairly common in its range, and therefore considered Least Concern by BirdLife International. It occurs in several protected areas such as the Henri Pittier National Park in Venezuela.

The Kester Peaks are three aligned rock peaks standing together south of Mount Malville on the east side of the Forrestal Range, in the Pensacola Mountains of Antarctica. They were mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos from 1956 to 1966, and were named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Larry T. Kester, a photographer with U.S. Navy Squadron VX-6 during Operation Deep Freeze in 1964.

The St. Francisville Experiment is a 2000 low-budget found footage horror film directed by Ted Nicolaou. The film was released direct to VHS, and DVD on April 15, 2000, and centers upon a small group of paranormal investigators who spend a night in an old haunted mansion located in St. Francisville, Louisiana. The haunted mansion's backstory was loosely based upon the true story of Delphine LaLaurie, a New Orleans socialite believed to have tortured and perhaps killed slaves in the early 1800s.
Synopsis
A group of paranormal investigators are given video cameras and the opportunity to spend the night in an abandoned house rumored to be haunted. The group finds several strange things, but initially their discoveries are easily explained away. However, as the night progresses they become more and more unsettled and wonder if there is truly a supernatural force in the house.

Production
Filming for The St. Francisville Experiment took place in Louisiana and California, and the filming was actually done in three houses. Author Troy Taylor helped put together the film's concept, which was initially supposed to be a documentary rather than a fictional film, a move that he stated was done mid-production. Taylor also stated that one of the houses wasn't abandoned and that a family was currently living in it. Upon its release the movie was promoted as a real encounter with the supernatural and the names of the film's actors were not disclosed.
Reception
Critical reception for The St. Francisville Experiment was extremely negative. A reviewer for JoBlo.com criticized the film, noting that "there are many scenes where it's impossible that the "actor" filmed himself from that angle", which made it "obvious that there's a cameraman there with his own equipment". Variety gave a mixed review, remarking that it "is ultimately undone by its inability to reconcile its two contradictory impulses — to be the next "Blair Witch" while mocking the hand that feeds it." Sabadino Parker for Pop Matters panned the film saying "Let's cut to the chase: The St. Francisville Experiment is bad" and ultimately advising "This is a warning: Stay away. Do not, I repeat, do not see this movie. Please, save your money and your sanity and do not ever, ever see this film."

The Good Guys is a chain of consumer electronics retail stores in Australia and formerly New Zealand. Its national headquarters is in the Melbourne suburb of Southbank, Victoria. The company was founded by Ian Muir, and following his death in 2009 ownership of the chain remained with the Muir family. In 2016, The Good Guys was purchased by JB Hi-Fi, despite competition concerns.
History
Ian Muir began retailing electrical goods in the Melbourne suburb of Essendon in 1952. Initial growth was slow, with 14 stores across Victoria and Queensland trading under the brand name Mighty Muirs by 1992, when Ian and son Andrew renamed the chain of stores "The Good Guys". A strong advertising campaign in 1998 resulted in increased sales, driving rapid expansion of stores across the country. By 2009, the chain had grown to 89 stores across Australia. In 2016 there were 101 stores.
The company has moved away from its "Pay Less, Pay Cash" slogan, opting for the simple catchphrase "Pay Less Every day".
Business model
Until 2016, Good Guys stores mainly operated as joint venture partnerships between individual store proprietors and the Muir family, although at the time of corporatisation about 40% of the group was corporately owned. The joint venture model had proven successful and operated such that store proprietors owned half the store operation and operated it as their own business. The Good Guys stores are generally large warehouse type stores and rely on volume in sales.
The company also offers a 30-day price guarantee, whereby customers who find a lower advertised price at a competing store after purchasing may be eligible to receive a 120% refund on the price difference between the two products. In 2015 The Good Guys introduced "Concierge" programs across its Australian stores. This was a direct replacement of the old "extended warranties" system that the stores had in place.
In January 2010, the retailer announced plans to expand into the New Zealand market, opening its first store in May at Wairau Valley in North Shore. A second store at Botany Downs opened in July, followed by a third in Manukau. By June 2014, there were five stores across the Auckland Metropolitan Area when the company announced it would pull out of the New Zealand Market citing poor returns. Following the announcement, The Warehouse Group agreed to take over the leases of the Good Guys stores and re-employ most of their local staff.
In 2010, competitor JB Hi-Fi was reported as interested in purchasing the chain for a reported sum of $750 million; however, the parties could not reach agreement and the deal was not finalised. It has also been reported that both Wesfarmers and the US based Blackstone Group had expressed interest in purchasing the chain. Analysts valued the business at close to $600 million, however it was believed the Muir family would not sell for less than $1 billion. The organisation of the company, with stores being held in joint ownership, added complexity to negotiations with potential buyers.
In September 2016 JB Hi-Fi bought The Good Guys for $870 million.
In 2022, The Good Guys celebrated 70 years of operating in Australia.
Community involvement
In 2010, The Good Guys established The Good Foundation and in partnership with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver and the Queensland state government funded the establishment of the first Australian Ministry of Food centre in Ipswich, west of Brisbane. The Foundation aims to encourage and support programs and initiatives that have the potential to improve the health and social welfare of communities across Australia, with particular regard to tackling obesity, poor nutrition and diet by raising awareness of the impact of these issues on the health care system.
All Good Guys stores contribute a percentage of every online and instore transaction to various community organisations in the local area surrounding the store. Each store generally supports more than one organisation and features a token box, where customers are encouraged to vote for their preferred charity by placing a token given with their receipt in a corresponding slot.
Since joining with JB Hi Fi Group in 2016, The Good Guys have been supporting 12 charities through their Doing Good Workplace Giving program. Every dollar donated by team members is matched by The Good Guys, to double the positive impact on the charities and the community.

With Love is a studio album by French singer Amanda Lear, released in 2006 by Dance Street. The album is a collection of covers of songs previously performed by other female vocalists.
Background
The album was recorded at Blue Sound Studio in Levallois-Perret and LR Studio in Villeneuve between May and August 2006. It contains covers of evergreens and jazz standards by the disco diva's own favourite divas, among them Eartha Kitt, Dalida, Peggy Lee, Mae West, Nina Simone, Marlene Dietrich and Juliette Gréco. The album came five years after the album Heart, on which Lear covered three evergreens: "Hier Encore", "The Look of Love" and "Lili Marleen", and only a year after her covers compilation Sings Evergreens. Lear had also released an all-cover EP in 1985, A L.
The album was released by ZYX Music in Germany in 2007 with a bonus live recording of the track "Johnny", and in 2008 in Italy under the title Amour toujours (French for Love Forever) with two re-recordings of Lear's Seventies hits "Queen of Chinatown" and "Tomorrow" as bonus tracks. The album was re-reissued by ZYX Music again in November 2008, then as a mid-price release under the title My Baby Just Cares for Me, with a different artwork and without any of the bonus tracks. The digital version of the album includes both the live version of "Johnny" and new versions of "Queen of Chinatown" and "Tomorrow".
No singles were released from the album, however, a promotional music video was produced, depicting Lear performing excerpts of various songs from the album in the studio, directed by Denis Larrieste.

Hubei Institute of Fine Arts (HIFA, ; colloquially 湖美, pinyin: Húměi) is an art college in China. It is the only top institution of higher learning in fine arts in central China. It is regarded as one of the best and most selective academies of fine arts in China. Its history dates back to 1920, making it the first private art school in modern China. As one of the three oldest art colleges, it is also one of the cradles of higher education of fine arts in modern China. It is located in Hubei Province's capital Wuhan, known as "the thoroughfare leading to nine provinces". Located in Wuhan, the industrial, economic and cultural center of central China, Hubei Institute of Fine Arts is widely regarded as a top academy of multiple disciplines, including watercolor painting, Chinese painting, oil painting, mural painting, mixed media painting, printmaking, sculpture, etc. HIFA has two campuses (Tanhualin campus and Canglongdao campus) and covers more than 488,000 square meters, which hold more than 500 faculty and staff members and more than 7,000 students.
History
The academy dates back to Wuchang Fine Arts School (), which was founded in 1920 by Jiang Lanpu, Tang Yijing and Xu Ziheng. In 1923, it was renamed Wuchang Specialised School of Fine Arts() and became one of the three oldest art academies in modern China. In 1930, it was renamed Private Wu Chang College of Fine Arts (). In the mid-1930s, the college reached the heyday in terms of size, talent training and academic achievements, and became one of the most important art education bases in China. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Wu Chang College of Fine Arts moved to Jiangjin, Sichuan Province in 1938 and returned to Wuhan after the victory. Despite the great difficulties during the anti-Japanese war, the college reached its another peak of development. The college made tremendous contributions to the establishment and development of the modern art education in China and laid the solid foundation for the art education in PRC.
After the founding of PRC in 1949, Wu Chang College of Fine Arts was merged into Central Plains University (), Hubei Education College () and Central China Normal College () successively. In 1977, it developed into an independent college——Hubei Art Academy (), which consisted of the Fine Arts Division and the Music Division. In 1985, with the approval of the then State Education Commission, the Fine Arts Division of Hubei Art Academy became Hubei Institute of Fine Arts, shaping the new setup of higher education of fine arts in contemporary China and opening the new chapter of development in the history of the academy.
Academic profile
Hubei Institute of Fine Arts is an academy combining art education, creation, research and industry, which enjoys a pioneering and representative key place in higher education of fine arts in central China. By the end of 2009, the academy has 12 departments and schools, and they are the Department of Traditional Chinese Painting, the Department of Oil Painting, the Department of Printmaking, the Department of Sculpture, the Department of Mural Painting, the Department of Design, the Department of Industrial Design, the Department of Costume, the Department of Environmental Art and Design, the Department of Fine Arts Education, the Department of Fine Arts Studies and the Animation School. Boasting a complete range of art programs, the academy offers the postgraduate programs, undergraduate ones and junior college ones as well. Hubei Institute of Fine Arts enjoys a high academic status and a constellation of celebrated artists have taught and are teaching here. It has also brought up a great number of well-known artists. In October, 2009, the new campus at Canglongdao, Jiangxia, came into use, standing out as one of the notable landmarks in the history of the academy.
Among all the departments, Department of Watercolor Painting is especially distinctive due to its indelible mark on the domestic development of Chinese watercolor painting. In 2009, watercolor painting was set up by HIFA as an independent major direction, the first time in Chinese history of fine arts education. Since then, Liu Shouxiang, one of the most famous pioneers of Chinese watercolor painting in the 1980s, has been working as the Dean of the Department of Watercolor Painting. Throughout twenty years of development, it now holds a teaching crew of 12 professors, well-equipped teaching facility and a self-constructed teaching discipline called "the course of Watercolor", which was awarded the National Elaborate Course in 2010. The department is known for its progress in exploring a unique style of Chinese watercolor painting by following in the cultural spirits of Chinese traditions as well as situating within the contemporary art environment. Fostered by Department of Watercolor Painting of HIFA, many graduates made contribution to national watercolor institutes, like Watercolor Painting Art Committee of China Artists Association, National Fine Art Exhibition, National Watercolor Painting Exhibition, etc.

The Hawkes Pharmacy, also known recently as the Rockaway Hotel, is a historic commercial building at 7 Main Street in York Beach, Maine. Built in 1902, it is the commercial building in the village of York Beach to retain significant historic features. The Tudor Revival building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
Description and history
The Hawkes Pharmacy building is located on the west side of Main Street (United States Route 1A) in the heart of the village center of York Beach, a summer resort village on the coast of northern York, Maine. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a roofline that has three large gables on the (east-facing) front and two on the south. These gables are all decorated with Tudor Revival half-timbering, vergeboard in the eaves, and finials at the peaks. The central gable on the front has an arch at its center, with a balcony projecting over the building's front entrance. On the ground floor there are two storefronts.
The building was constructed in 1902 by Wilson and Ralph Hawkes, a father-son pair the eldest of whom had operated a pharmacy in York Beach since 1899. The building initially housed the pharmacy in one storefront, and a dry goods store in the other, with the proprietor living upstairs. Ralph Hawkes continued to operate the pharmacy until the 1940s, when a fire extensively damaged the interior. The building was rehabilitated in the 1900s, with the upstairs converted into small hotel. The building is the only known non-residential design of architect Fred Watson, who moved to York Beach from New York City in 1899.

Terhemen Tarzoor (born 26 January 1972) is a Nigerian Economist and Real Estate Developer from Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State in North Central Nigeria. He previously served as Speaker in the Benue State House of Assembly in which he represented his constituency. Tarzoor came to prominence when he ran unsuccessfully for the seat of the Governor of Benue State, losing to Samuel Ortom in the 2015 General Elections. He finished runner-up despite running as a favorite candidate on the platform of the then ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP). He went on to challenge the result of the election in a petition filed to the Benue State Governorship Tribunal claiming that the winner, Governor Samuel Ortom, was not validly nominated to contest for the seat. His claim was however dismissed by the court of appeal on grounds that it lacked merit.
On 30 April 2017 the Daily Trust Newspaper reported that Tarzoor hopes to re-contest for the seat in the on-coming 2019 general elections.
On 12 July 2017, there were newspaper reports that Tarzoor narrowly escaped death in an attack by political thugs at Yandev in Gboko, the home town of his wife Sophie. Other newspapers captured a different version of the story with claims that Tarzoor was involved in the crisis which led to him being summoned for police interrogation.
Early life
He was born to the family of the late Chief Tarzoor Orbiam, immediate past Tyoor Mbawa and Mue Ter Mbawa in Makurdi Local Government Traditional Council and Mama Chive Orbiam of Mbawa, Sherev, Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State. Prince Tarzoor received elementary education at All Saints Anglican Primary School, Makurdi and had a brief stint at Community Secondary School Makurdi where he earned his Junior School Certificate of Education (JSCE) before proceeding to Mount Saint Gabriel's Secondary School to obtain his Senior School Certificate of Education (SSCE) in 1991. Prince Tarzoor secured admission into the School of General and Remedial Studies (now College of Advanced and Professional Studies) from where he proceeded to the then newly established Benue State University Makurdi to undergo a Bachelor of Science Degree in Economics, graduating in 1999. He performed his mandatory National Youth Service Corps service at the Central Bank of Nigeria in Enugu between 2000 and 2001. Tarzoor further obtained a Master of Science Degree in Business Administration (MBA), majoring in Banking and Finance in the year 2003 from the same university. In 2006 he obtained an additional Master of Science (M.Sc.) Degree in Economics with specifics in Monetary economics, completing in 2009. He went on to earn a doctorate degree from the same institution.

The Campbell shag (Leucocarbo campbelli), also known as the Campbell Island shag, is a species of bird in the family Phalacrocoracidae. It is endemic to Campbell Island. Its natural habitats are open seas and rocky shores. It is a medium-sized bird, around 63 cm in length, with a wingspan of 105 cm, weighing between 1.6 – 2 kg. They only breed on Campbell Island and forage within 10 km of the island. Its unique, looped head and elongated beak allows to easily feed on shellfish and marine invertebrates. This is done through foraging dive cycles of high speed and efficiency.
Some taxonomic authorities, including the International Ornithologists' Union, place this species in the genus Leucocarbo. Others place it in the genus Phalacrocorax.

Maddison Gabriel (born 16 September 1994) is an Australian model who gained notoriety when, at the age of 12, she was controversially named the face of the 2007 Gold Coast Fashion Week.
Personal life
Gabriel was born to Brian Gabriel and Michelle Gabriel and has a sister, Brooke. Gabriel was able to travel to New York, Milan and London and also continue her studies at school.
In October 2008, it was reported that convicted American sex predator Martin Robertson had written to Australian newspaper The Sunday Telegraph from his Texas prison cell to request articles about Gabriel for a book he claimed to be writing. Gabriel's mother criticized the media for widely reporting concerns that her daughter was too young to be a catwalk model, resulting in Robertson learning of her daughter.
Gabriel completed Year 12, and a Beauty Therapy diploma while studying Year 12. She worked as a beauty therapist and intended to attend university in 2013. She is taking a break from modeling while she completes her studies.
Career
Gold Coast Fashion Week
Gabriel was 12 when she was named the official face of Australia's annual Gold Coast Fashion Week in September 2007 being chosen ahead of models fifteen years her senior. Child protection groups raised protests over the 12-year-old's participation. Several public figures, including then-Prime Minister John Howard, Anna Bligh, who was Premier of Queensland at the time, and Federal Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd, raised concerns over the Gabriel's age. Gabriel's mother, Michelle Gabriel, later requested an apology from Howard and Rudd for their comments regarding her daughter, and stated that the family was not making money from Gabriel's modelling ventures.
Modeling
Gabriel was signed by agency Ugly People as the prize for being named as the face of the Gold Coast Fashion Week. She later signed with Tamblyn Models, who became her "mother" agency. Following the Gold Coast Fashion Week, Gabriel generated interest from many international modeling agencies including Chadwick's and Ford Models, but signed with Elite Models in July 2008 with the support of Tamblyn Models. She has since signed with Storm in London and Fashion in Milan and is now represented by Dally's in Brisbane and Chic in Sydney.
She has since appeared in editorials in Elle, Dolly, Creme, Girlfriend, Rush, Limewire, Looks Book, Muse, and Bridesmaid.
Other ventures
She was featured, along with other models, in Bryan Ferry's video for "You Can Dance", released during the summer of 2010 from his album Olympia. She also appeared as an extra in the Australian drama Water Police.
She has worked in New York, London, Milan and Sydney in various roles, including catwalk and photographic modeling.

"Your Graduation" is a song recorded by the American rock band Modern Baseball for their second studio album, You're Gonna Miss It All (2014). It was released as its debut single from You're Gonna Miss It All on December 10, 2013, through Run for Cover Records. "Your Graduation" centers on the nostalgia and angst of a high school graduation, with its central narrator struggling to get over a break-up.
"Your Graduation" became the band's most popular song, and music critics commended its sound and tone. The single's music video was directed by Kyle Thrash and filmed at FDR Skatepark in the band's hometown of Philadelphia in the midst of a polar vortex. Vulture put the song on a list of all-time great emo songs.
Background
Modern Baseball emerged in the early 2010s as part of the fourth-wave emo scene in the U.S. The quartet formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the combination of vocalist/guitarists Brendan Lukens and Jacob Ewald, both originally from Maryland. At college, they met and added Sean Huber on drums and Ian Farmer on bass. Their first full-length, Sports (2012), was released through local label Lame-O Records, and showcased a mix of upbeat and catchy lo-fi pop-punk. The group developed a following, particularly on social media, and soon secured a deal with Boston-based independent label Run for Cover, the home of emo luminaries Tigers Jaw, Title Fight, Citizen, and Turnover. In 2014, they released their second LP through the label, titled You're Gonna Miss It All.
"Your Graduation" depicts a narrator at a high school graduation party, mulling over a failed relationship. In the intro, they admit it has been difficult to get over a break-up: "It's been three whole years of me thinkin' bout you everyday / Sometimes for hours, sometimes in passing." Lukens largely carries the vocals throughout the track, with drummer Sean Huber making an appearance for the song's second verse. The song was first made available to stream on December 10, 2013, alongside an announcement of the band's second album.
Music video
The music video for "Your Graduation" was released on March 5, 2014, premiering on the music site Noisey, an offshoot of Vice. The video was directed by Kyle Thrash, who also helmed the band's debut single, "The Weekend". The clip was shot in Philadelphia, with live performance shots filmed at FDR Skatepark, a historic skatepark beneath an overpass of Interstate 95. The band invited fans on their personal Facebook page to take part in the video, with fan-site Property of Zack furthering promotion. It ended up snowing during the video shoot, as it was filmed amid a polar vortex taking the country by hold at the time. "Standing in the rain while it was 17 degrees outside was one of the worst things I have ever experienced, but it was definitely worth it," Lukens admitted. The band posted a behind-the-scenes clip later that month, documenting the video shoot.
John Vettese at local station WXPN opined that "its long shots of a forlorn Brendan Lukens staring off into the distance with various lady friends at his side, the video depicts late-college ennui and post-college depression to a tee." Writer Dan Ozzi at Noisey noted that "The video captures all those nostalgic moments: the long awkward conversations, the crippling isolation, and also the skateboarding and partying with your buds."
Reception
"Your Graduation" received positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Collin Brennan at Consequence called the track a distillation of "everything Modern Baseball does well, with its taut song structure and painfully honest lyrics rising to a climax in Huber's explosive verse." James Rettig at Stereogum concurred, writing that the charms of the band shine best on "Graduation". Kevin McFarland at the A.V. Club said it "captures exactly the right mood for dwelling on the minute details of past regrets." Ian Cohen at Pitchfork compared the sound to fellow Philadelphia punk rock heroes the Dead Milkmen. Fred Thomas at AllMusic singled out the song as the most biting among the album's rush of "peppy and ceaselessly upbeat tunes."
Retrospective reviews have similarly remained positive. In 2017, Rob Arcand at Spin wrote that the song "crystalized a certain adolescent experience with a racing intensity as perfect for partying as it is those late nights alone post-breakup." Vulture later placed the song on its list of the 100 Best Emo Songs at number 72, with columnist Emma Garland writing, "It's such a vivid retelling of unrequited love it almost prompts a smile. [...] A far cry from the revenge fantasy of emo's mainstream tenure in the aughts, Modern Baseball have upgraded the narrative to include not just the sadness of giving up but the release of moving on."

Destiny's Children is a science-fiction series by Stephen Baxter. It takes place within his larger series, the Xeelee Sequence. Like his previous Manifold Trilogy, the books are not direct sequels to one another, but are instead thematically linked by the appearance of concepts, themes, and sometimes characters in multiple books. Examples of this include:
A coalescence is visited in all three novels.
The Kuiper Anomaly, a tetrahedral artifact that appears in the Kuiper belt, is discovered in Coalescent, mentioned briefly in Exultant, and finally explained in Transcendent.
The characters George Poole, Michael Poole, and Rosa Poole appear in both Coalescent and Transcendent.
Each book deals in some way with the future evolution of humans, both physically and sociologically. For example, Coalescent discusses the ability of humans living with limited space and resources to evolve a society that resembles insect hives. Transcendent deals with several post-human forms that are found to have evolved to adapt planets that they colonized. The theme is present in Exultant insofar as the novel deals with humanity as evolved to fight a war that has lasted tens of thousands of years.
Each book further deals in some way with the existence and identity of God. For example, Exultant suggests that there was consciousness present before the universe began that selected this universe for its ability to sustain life. Transcendent discusses a group of humans that have transcended to a higher consciousness as becoming a god, and uses established theology to attempt to dissect the Transcendent's motives.
Books in the series:
Coalescent (2003) - Arthur C. Clarke Award nominee, 2004
Exultant (2004)
Transcendent (2005) - John W. Campbell Memorial award nominee, 2006
Resplendent (2006)

Zhang Cheng (178–244), courtesy name Zhongsi, was a military general of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China.
Life
Zhang Cheng was the elder son of Zhang Zhao, a senior statesman who served under Sun Quan, the founding emperor of Eastern Wu. At a young age, he was known for being well read and talented in scholarly arts. He was also a close friend of Zhuge Jin, Bu Zhi and Yan Jun.
When Sun Quan still held the nominal appointment of General of Chariots of Cavalry () in the late Eastern Han dynasty, he recruited Zhang Cheng to serve as an assistant official in the west bureau of his office. Later, he promoted Zhang Cheng to the position of Commandant of the West Section of Changsha Commandery (). During this time, he pacified some local tribes in Changsha Commandery and managed to recruit 15,000 of them to serve in the Wu army.
Some time later, Zhang Cheng was promoted to General of Vehement Might () and put in command of 5,000 troops. Sun Quan appointed him as the Chief Controller () of Ruxu (), a Wu garrison strategically located along the Yangtze River at the north of present-day Wuwei County, Anhui. He also enfeoffed Zhang Cheng as a Marquis of a Chief District ().
Zhang Cheng was known for his bold, courageous and loyal personality. Apart from these traits, he was also known for being a good judge of character. He spotted talents such as Cai Kuan () and Xie Jing () and promoted them accordingly. Cai Kuan later rose the position of Minister of the Guards () in the Wu government, while Xie Jing became the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi). When Zhuge Ke, the eldest son of Zhang Cheng's friend Zhuge Jin, was still a youth, he received high praise from many people for his extraordinary talents. Zhang Cheng, however, accurately predicted that Zhuge Ke would bring doom to his family one day.
Throughout his life, Zhang Cheng was known for his passion for learning. He constantly sought opportunities to enrich himself with more knowledge and skills, and attracted numerous visitors to his residence. He died in 244 at the age of 66, and was honoured with the posthumous title "Marquis Ding" ().
Family
Zhang Cheng's son, Zhang Zhen (), inherited his father's peerage as a Marquis of a Chief District (). After Zhang Cheng's first wife died, his father Zhang Zhao suggested that he marry his friend Zhuge Jin's daughter. Zhang Cheng initially declined because he felt awkward about becoming his friend's son-in-law, but eventually agreed after Sun Quan persuaded him to do so.
Zhang Cheng and Zhuge Jin's daughter had a daughter, who married Sun He, the third son of Sun Quan. Sun Quan often reminded Sun He to be courteous towards Zhang Cheng and paid due respect as a son-in-law. Zhang Cheng's son, Zhang Zhen, was implicated and purged in the aftermath of Zhuge Ke's downfall because he was a maternal nephew of Zhuge Ke. Zhang Cheng also had another daughter, who married Lu Kang and bore Lu Jing. She was also purged in the aftermath of Zhuge Ke's downfall because she was his maternal niece.

Hendrik van Oort (6 August 1775 in Utrecht – 17 February 1847 in Utrecht) was a 19th-century painter from the Northern Netherlands. Among his best known works are In the Meadow and The Shoemaker, the latter of which is on display at the Northampton Museum and Art Gallery, painted some time between 1800 and 1830.
Mainly a landscape painter, van Oort chose mainly quaint rural villages, small towns and rural folk as his subjects. But he also captured landscapes of cities such as Amsterdam; his landscape View of Canal, Amsterdam sold at the Amsterdam branch of Christie's on September 5, 2000, for $3,353. A View Of The Sint Jan's Kerkhof was painted at Utrecht in 1824. Henrik's son, Pieter van Oort, was also a noted landscape artist and architect. Besides his son he taught the painter David van der Kellen Jr., who became a respected medallist and engraver.

Mystery Chronicle: One Way Heroics is a role-playing video game developed by Spike Chunsoft for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, released in Japan on July 30, 2015. It is a spin-off of the Mystery Dungeon series, and is based on the indie game One Way Heroics.
Gameplay
Like previous Mystery Dungeon titles, Fushigi no Chronicle is a turn-based role-playing game in which players explore randomly-generated dungeons. However, with every turn that passes, the screen will scroll as the game world slowly gets swallowed up by a light.
Development
The game's producers, Yuichiro Saito and Yoshinori Terasawa, found out about the game One Way Heroics at the Japanese indie game developer gathering ; they were intrigued by the idea of combining roguelike gameplay with forced scrolling, and found the game fun to play. At first they considered porting the game to consoles, but as the original version of the game was available to play for free, they instead thought of ways to expand and improve on it; eventually they asked the developer of One Way Heroics for permission to develop a new game from scratch, with One Way Heroics as the foundation.
The game was released for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita by Spike Chunsoft on July 30, 2015 in Japan. To promote it, character classes based on the Spike Chunsoft game series Danganronpa and Shiren the Wanderer were included in the game.
Limited Run Games released physical editions of the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions in the West in September 2016, limited to 5,000 copies for each of the platforms.
Reception
The game was met by "mixed or average" reviews according to the review aggregator Metacritic.

USS Greenling (SSN-614) was a . She was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the greenling, an elongated, fine-scaled fish found from Kamchatka to California. Her keel was laid down on 15 August 1961 by General Dynamics Electric Boat of Groton, Connecticut.
On 10 April 1963, Thresher, the lead ship of [[Thresher class submarine|Greenling'''s class]], was lost due to severe design flaws in her non-nuclear piping systems. Because she was still early in the construction process, Greenling was one of three selected Thresher-class submarines selected for conversion to the "improved Thresher class." (The other two were SSN-613 Flasher and SSN-615 Gato.) She was launched on 4 April 1964 sponsored by Mrs. H.C. Bruton. On 29 April, she was towed to Quincy, Massachusetts, for lengthening and submarine safety program (SUBSAFE) modifications. Modifications included increased buoyancy and adding 13 feet 9 inches of length to the hull, providing improved living and working conditions for the crew and space for additional equipment. Before construction of Greenling was completed, she and her sister ships were redesignated the Permit class, after the eldest surviving member of the class. Greenling was commissioned on 3 November 1967.
Service history
On 27 May 1968, Greenlings fleet training exercise was interrupted by the search and rescue operation for missing submarine . Her commanding officer was designated the Commander of the SAR Task Element, which included of three nuclear and four diesel submarines. That assignment continued until 12 June 1968.Greenling spent most of her career assigned to Submarine Squadron 10 (SUBRON 10) and was homeported in Groton, Connecticut.
On 27 March 1973, Greenling accidentally dived "well below its test depth" during a training dive off the coast of Bermuda due to a faulty depth gauge. A different gauge revealed the error and the submarine returned to the surface safely. Various reports placed Greenling between 150 and 200 feet from crush depth at her deepest point. After returning to port, she was sent to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine for examination, and was returned to service soon after.History to 1994 needed.Greenling was decommissioned on 18 April 1994 and was subsequently disposed through the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 30 September 1994. Equipment from Greenling''s control room was salvaged and used to construct a simulation of a submarine control room as an exhibit at the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, Washington.

Gesner Abelard (born 22 February 1922) was a Haitian painter and sculptor. Born in Port-au-Prince, Abelard began life as a mechanic, then studied painting and sculpture at the Industrial School of Port-au-Prince under the painter Humberman Charles. He became a member of the Haitian Centre d'Art in 1948. In 1949, he received a bronze medal at the International Exposition celebrating the bicentennial of Port-au-Prince. Many of his paintings depict birds, trees and scenes of Haitian life, and he is considered a naïve artist. Abelard is believed to be deceased.

Ghettos were established by Nazi Germany in hundreds of locations across occupied Poland after the German invasion of Poland. Most ghettos were established between October 1939 and July 1942 in order to confine and segregate Poland's Jewish population of about 3.5 million for the purpose of persecution, terror, and exploitation. In smaller towns, ghettos often served as staging points for Jewish and mass deportation actions, while in the urban centers they resembled walled-off prison-islands described by some historians as little more than instruments of "slow, passive murder", with dead bodies littering the streets.
In most cases, the larger ghettos did not correspond to traditional Jewish neighborhoods, and non-Jewish Poles and members of other ethnic groups were ordered to take up residence elsewhere. Smaller Jewish communities with populations under 500 were terminated through expulsion soon after the invasion.
The Holocaust
The liquidation of the Jewish ghettos across occupied Poland was closely connected with the construction of secretive death camps—industrial-scale mass-extermination facilities—built in early 1942 for the sole purpose of murder. The Nazi extermination program depended on rail transport, which enabled the SS to run and, at the same time, openly lie to their victims about the "resettlement program". Jews were transported to their deaths in Holocaust trains from liquidated ghettos of all occupied cities, including Łódź Ghetto, the last in Poland to be liquidated in August 1944. In some larger ghettos there were armed resistance attempts, such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the Białystok Ghetto Uprising, the Będzin and the Łachwa Ghetto uprisings, but in every case they failed against the overwhelming German military force, and the resisting Jews were either executed locally or deported with the rest of prisoners to the extermination camps. By the time Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe was liberated by the Red Army, not a single Jewish ghetto in Poland was left standing. Only about 50,000–120,000 Polish Jews survived the war on native soil, a fraction of their prewar population of 3,500,000.
In total, according to archives of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, "The Germans established at least 1000 ghettos in German-occupied and annexed Poland and the Soviet Union alone." The list of locations of the Jewish ghettos within the borders of pre-war and post-war Poland is compiled with the understanding that their inhabitants were either of Polish nationality from before the invasion, or had strong historical ties with Poland. Also, not all ghettos are listed here due to their transient nature. Permanent ghettos were created only in settlements with rail connections, because the food aid (paid by the Jews themselves) was completely dependent on the Germans, making even the potato-peels a hot commodity. Throughout 1940 and 1941, most ghettos were sealed off from the outside, walled off or enclosed with barbed wire, and any Jews found outside them could be shot on sight. The Warsaw Ghetto was the largest ghetto in all of Nazi-occupied Europe, with over 400,000 Jews crammed into an area of , or 7.2 persons per room. The Łódź Ghetto was the second largest, holding about 160,000 inmates. In documents and signage, the Nazis usually referred to the ghettos they created as Jüdischer Wohnbezirk or Wohngebiet der Juden, meaning "Jewish Quarter". By the end of 1941, most Polish Jews were already ghettoized, even though the Germans knew that the system was unsustainable; most inmates had no chance of earning their own keep, and no savings left to pay the SS for further deliveries. The quagmire was resolved at the Wannsee conference of 20 January 1942 near Berlin, where the "Final Solution" (die Endlösung der Judenfrage) was set in place.
List of Jewish ghettos in occupied Poland
The settlements listed in the Polish language, including major cities, had all been renamed after the 1939 joint invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union. Renaming everything in their own image had been one way in which the invaders sought to redraw Europe's political map. All Polish territories were assigned as either Nazi zones of occupation (i.e. Bezirk Bialystok, Provinz Ostpreußen, etc.), or annexed by the Soviet Union, soon to be overrun again in Operation Barbarossa. The Soviet Ukraine and Byelorussia witnessed the "Polish Operation" of the NKVD, resulting in the virtual absence of ethnic Poles in the USSR along the pre-war border with Poland since the Great Purge.
Aftermath
The ghetto inhabitants – most of whom were murdered during Operation Reinhard – possessed Polish citizenship before the Nazi–Soviet invasion of Poland, which in turn enabled over 150,000 Holocaust survivors registered at CKŻP to take advantage of the later repatriation agreements between the governments of Poland and the Soviet Union, and legally emigrate to the West to help form the nascent State of Israel. Poland was the only Eastern Bloc country to allow free Jewish aliyah without visas or exit permits upon the conclusion of World War II. By contrast, Stalin forcibly brought Soviet Jews back to USSR along with all Soviet citizens, as agreed to in the Yalta Conference.
Some Jewish populations remained in the ghettos after their destruction. The more prominent ghetto being the Warsaw ghetto. Many Jewish people were either too destitute or still surrounded by Germans to be able to leave the ghettos, this resulted in many of the ghettos inhabitants dying from harsh conditions such as exposure, lack of food, and diseases from being unclean. Another issue of the ghettos was where the displaced people who lived there would go next as refugees.

Herbert Brooks (born 1858), was an English rugby union footballer who played in the 1880s, who played in Scotland for Edinburgh University RFC, and was selected to play at a representative level for the British Isles on the 1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia, the first tour by a team representing the British Isles.
Early life and career
Herbert Brooks was born on 1 July 1858 in Holmfirth, Yorkshire, England to Henry Brooks and Mary. His father was from Nailsea, Somerset, whilst his mother was born in Longbenton, Northumberland. Herbert had three older brothers, John, Thomas and Frederick, and an older sister Catherine, as well as a younger sister, Florence. His father was a school master and from 1876 ran his own private school in Darlington called Cleveland College on Milbank Road, near the junction with Carmel Road. The buildings housing the school later became St Joseph's Home. Henry Brook died on 18 March 1897 and the school closed in 1900.
Domestic career
Herbert Brooks started playing rugby at the age of 16 for Darlington RFC as a fullback, and when he was just 17 was selected to play for his county side, Durham County, against Northumberland. The following year he represented Durham once again against Yorkshire at three-quarter back and then retired from the game for a while. Whilst studying medicine at Edinburgh University (from 1878 to 1883) he took up rugby once more and was elected captain of the university side in 1882–83. In that season he was chosen on the East v. West in Scotland. In all, he played six times in the venerable Edinburgh v. Glasgow match, and in the other inter-university matches. In 1884 he was selected to play for the North of England vs the South and was once again called up for Durham County. His career took him abroad but when he returned from Burmah in 1887 he played association football as a right wing forward for Darlington F.C. and played in the final of the Durham Cup, and was in the winning side of the Cleveland Association Cup. He took up rugby once more in 1887/1888 and was immediately selected for the Durham County team, and was chosen captain. His professional duties prevented him playing against Yorkshire and Middlesex, but he was able to play against Cheshire and Northumberland.
British Isles
Brooks played 17 times on the 1888 Lions Tour on the wing or at centre, scoring three tries, while he also refereed several matches.
Later life
For a time Herbert lived in Salford, working as a General Practitioner there in 1891. By 1901, Herbert was living his wife, Bessie, in Rochdale, Lancashire where he was a surgeon.

Prince Rostislav Rostislavovich Romanov () (born 21 May 1985) is an American-born Russian prince living in the UK as an artist. He is a member of the Romanov family. The House of Romanov was the former ruling Russian Imperial dynasty. He is also known by the names "Rosti" and "Misha". As none of the sons of Prince Andrew Romanov have male offspring, Rostislav is likely to one day inherit their claim to the Russian throne.
Early life
Born in 1985 as the second child and the eldest son of Prince Rostislav Rostislavovich Romanov (1938-1999) and his wife, Lady Ampthill (b. 1949).
Education
Rostislav was educated at Brambletye and Milton Abbey Schools, and at Falmouth University where he graduated with a BA in Fine Art.
Work
Rostislav is a landscape artist. He is particularly interested in en plein air painting and much of his artwork depicts the Sussex countryside or is inspired by his travels in Russia and elsewhere. He works primarily with oil and creates sculptural, three-dimensional paintings primarily in impasto. His most significant early work uses pastels. Pastels, or watercolours, is also the medium of studies for his more important paintings.
His work includes relief printing, and dry-point, and soft ground acid etchings.
Exhibitions
His first solo exhibition was in 2011 at the Fabrica Gallery, Coupla in Moscow. He has since participated in numerous exhibitions both in the UK and internationally. He has exhibited twice in the A. Kasteev Art Museum in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and participated in exhibitions in Dubai and Monaco.
In London he has exhibited twice at the Brick Lane Gallery, London. In May 2018 he has a solo exhibition "Way of Life" at The C. John Gallery, Mayfair.
He is represented by the Maison d'Art Gallery in Monaco , and The Martix System in the U.K.
Birth and family
Prince Rostislav Rostislavovich was born in Lake Forest, Illinois, the eldest son and second child of Prince Rostislav Rostislavovich and his second wife, Christia Ipsen (b. 1949). He has an older sister, Princess Alexandra (b. 1983), and a younger brother, Prince Nikita (b. 1987). From his father's first marriage to Stephena Verdel Cook, he has an older half-sister, Princess Stephena (b. 1963).
Prince Rostislav belongs to the Mihailovichi branch of the Romanov family as a male line descendant of Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia, the youngest son of Emperor Nicholas I. He is also a descendant of Emperors Alexander II and Alexander III, being the great grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia (sister of the last Emperor Nicholas II) and her husband Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia. Prince Rostislav has been a member of the Romanov Family Association since 1985 and was a committee member between 2007 and 2013. In addition, through his paternal grandmother, he is also a descendant of Sophia Palaiologina and Ivan III of Russia
The Prince lived in Chicago until he was two months old, when his father moved his family to London. The family then moved to the town of Rye in East Sussex, where he spent his teenage years. Prince Rostislav was educated at Brambletye and Milton Abbey Schools, and at Falmouth University where he read Fine Art.
Prince Rostislav visited Russia in 1998 with his parents and siblings to attend the reburial rites of Emperor Nicholas II and his family. Six months later, on 7 January 1999, his father died during the Russian Christmas celebration. Though he had been treated for cancer, some speculate that he contracted a rare illness from the dust at the church where the Imperial funeral was held. The loss of the late Prince's income left his family facing financial difficulties. In order to provide for the family Princess Romanova started a bed and breakfast in an 18th-century mansion in Rye, East Sussex. The house was in a semi-derelict state, though, and in need of renovation. As there was initially no kitchen, the children had to carry buckets of water up to the bathroom in order to wash the dishes in the bathtub. His mother later married David Whitney Erskine Russell, the heir to the title Baron Ampthill.
Russian prince
On 23 September 2006, Prince Rostislav was a guest at the reburial and memorial service for his great-great grandmother the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna (born Princess Dagmar of Denmark) at Roskilde Cathedral in Denmark. He then attended the reburial of his great-great grandmother's remains in Russia, where he announced that he was considering moving to Russia. The Romanov Family Association considers Rostislav to be fourth in line to the throne, but the line of succession is disputed by another branch of the family. Furthermore, the Romanov Family Association has essentially renounced any claims to the Russian throne upon its formation in 1979.
In November 2007 Prince Rostislav was featured in a documentary produced by France 3 called "Un nom en héritage, les Romanov" where he was filmed visiting St. Petersburg the former Imperial capital. In July 2009 accompanying his cousin Prince Dimitri Romanovich, he attended events in St. Petersburg to commemorate the 91st anniversary of the murder of Nicholas II and his family. It was also announced that he was visiting Russia to learn the language.
Current life
Prince Rostislav was the first Romanov to move back to Russia - in 2009 - where he lived for two years and studied Russian and currently splits his time between the United Kingdom and Russia.
The late president of the Romanov Family Association, Prince Nicholas, appointed him the official representative of the Association in Russia. Rostislav is currently serving as Vice-President of the Romanov Family Association.
In 2010, Prince Rostislav was appointed honorary Director of the Board of Russia's oldest factory, founded by his ancestor Peter the Great: The Petrodvorets Watch Factory – Raketa. He was also advisor to the factory's Creative department. The Prince no longer has ties to the Raketa company.
Prince Rostislav married in October 2019 property consultant Foteini Georganta (born in 1979), of Athens, and they have one son named Rostislav (born in September 2013).

The siege of Curicta was a military confrontation that took place during the early stages of Caesar's Civil War. Occurring in 49 BC, it saw a significant force of Populares commanded by Gaius Antonius besieged on the island of Curicta by an Optimate fleet under Lucius Scribonius Libo and Marcus Octavius. It immediately followed and was the result of a naval defeat by Publius Cornelius Dolabella and Antonius eventually capitulated under prolonged siege. These two defeats were some of the most significant suffered by the Populares during the civil war.
Background
Deteriorating relations between Gaius Julius Caesar and the Roman Senate, with the support of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great"), culminated in Caesar crossing the Rubicon river in January 49BC and thus being labelled as an enemy of the people. Caesar seized numerous cities, towns and settlements such as Arretium, Auximum, Asculum and most significantly Corfinium as he moved down the Italian Peninsula. In response, Pompey evacuated his army across the Adriatic Sea to Greece. Despite failing to stop the evacuation at Brundisium, Caesar had succeeded in gaining full control of the peninsula.
Prelude
Following the Siege of Brundisium, Caesar gave command of a fleet of 40 ships to Publius Cornelius Dolabella and sent him to patrol the coastline of Illyricum in order to protect against the Pompeian fleet. Gaius Antonius, the brother of Marcus Antonius, had also been appointed as Caesar's governor of Illyricum and had a significant force of 15 cohorts stationed on the island of Curicta and along the nearby shoreline.
At some point during 49 BC, Marcus Octavius and Lucius Scribonius Libo were given command of Pompey's large fleet and directed to begin operations against Caesar's forces in the Adriatic Sea.
Siege
The exact date of the siege is unknown, although most sources place it before Gaius Scribonius Curio's expedition to Africa and by taking the poet Lucan's astrological descriptions which he used to date the event in his work Pharsalia, then that would mean that the events likely occurred in June 49 BC.
Dolabella's fleet engaged with the Pompeian fleet nearby to Curicta and, being heavily outnumbered, was thoroughly beaten with the majority of his ships either destroyed or captured. Dolabella himself was also captured. Libo and Octavius then put in place a naval blockade around Curicta which drove Antonius and his men, who had seemingly no chance of relief, to near starvation.
An attempt was made to break out from the siege using rafts which were sent in by Lucius Minucius Basilus on the mainland, however the Optimates managed to capture many of these in nets of Cilician design which rose up from below the water. Aided by the tide, two of these rafts managed to make it past the nets however one of them ran aground in the nearby shallows. On board were a band of 1000 Gallic auxiliaries from Opitergium who engaged in a last stand against the Optimates for a whole day. Upon realising that they were completely surrounded with no chance of escape, they killed one another rather than surrender.
During or shortly after these events, Antonius surrendered the island to the Pompeians.
Aftermath
Following the siege Antonius was captured along with the majority of his men, many of whom would soon switch sides and bolster Pompey's ranks. In fact, one of Caesar's few mentions of these events claims that a centurion named Titus Pullo who was set against him during the Battle of Pharsalus had been instrumental in undermining Gaius Antonius' efforts to defend Curicta.
The battle was regarded as a disaster for the Caesarian cause. It seems to have had considerable significance to Caesar who mentions it alongside the death of Curio as one of the worst setbacks of the civil war. Of the four instances that Suetonius gives of the most disastrous defeats suffered by Populares in the civil war, both the defeat of Dolabella's fleet and the capitulation of the legions at Curicta are listed. It is also noted that all four major defeats were suffered by subordinates and not by Caesar himself.
While the events at Curicta are referred to in Caesar's commentaries they are notably absent from his main narrative; this may be because Caesar had the defeat retroactively expunged or simply that he never got around to writing about it.

The SOECN (Sindicato de Obreros y Empleados Ceramistas de Neuquén) is a ceramist workers' union based in Neuquén province, Argentina. It is known for being one of the first unions in Argentina to employ a method of rank-and-file unionism, representing the workers of the FaSinPat cooperative.
Style of Unionism
SOECN was formed by the workers of the Zanon Ceramics factory in Neuquén in 2000. The SOECN employs a style of class-conscious unionism which seeks a political agenda beyond the workplace. The SOECN's constitution is grounded on three basic principles: worker's democracy, class autonomy, and internationalism and anti-imperialism. It employs a horizontal, minimally bureaucratic, and de-centralized form of organization. The SOECN's constitution affirms that "the working class has no borders", and that it opposes imperialist control over national resources and obstruction of national development.

Francisco González Bocanegra (January 8, 1824 – April 11, 1861) was a Mexican poet who wrote the lyrics of the Mexican National Anthem in 1853.
He was born in San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí to Spanish soldier José María González Yáñez and Francisca Bocanegra y Villalpando, sister of the Foreign Relations Secretary under President Vicente Guerrero, José María Bocanegra. Despite his father being exempted because of being married to a Mexican, in 1827, his family moved to Spain after a law was enacted expelling all remaining Spanish citizens in the country. They settled in the port of Cádiz until the family returned to San Luis Potosí on December 28, 1836.
He died in 1861 and is buried in the Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres (Rotunda of Illustrious Persons) in Mexico City.
Writing of the Mexican national anthem
On November 12, 1853, President Antonio López de Santa Anna announced a competition to write a national anthem for Mexico. The competition offered a prize for the best poetic composition representing patriotic ideals. González, a talented poet, was not interested in participating in the competition. He argued that writing love poems involved very different skills from the ones required to write a national anthem. His fiancée, Guadalupe González del Pino (or Pili), had undaunted faith in her fiancé's poetic skills and was displeased with his constant refusal to participate in spite of her constant prodding and requests from their friends. Under false pretenses, she lured him to a secluded bedroom in her parents' house, locked him into the room, and refused to let him out until he produced an entry for the competition. Inside the room in which he was temporarily imprisoned were pictures depicting various events in Mexican history which helped to inspire his work. After four hours of fluent (albeit forced) inspiration, Francisco regained his freedom by slipping all ten verses of his creation under the door. After Francisco received approval from his fiancée and her father, he submitted the poem and won the competition by unanimous vote. González was announced the winner in the publication Official Journal of the Federation (DOF) on February 3, 1854.
In 1943, six of González's ten verses were cut from the official full national anthem, leaving his chorus and stanzas 1, 5, 6, and 10.

"Black Is Black" is a song by the Spanish rock band Los Bravos, released in 1966 as the group's debut single for Decca Records. Produced by Ivor Raymonde, it reached number two in the UK,
number four in the US,
and number one in Canada.
With the recording's success, Los Bravos became the first Spanish rock band to have an international hit single.
A dance remix was released as a single in 1986.
Background
Four members of Los Bravos — bassist Miguel Vicens Danus, guitarist Tony Martinez, organist Manuel Fernandez, and drummer Pablo Sanllehi — had previously worked together in the Spanish band Los Sonors.
Together with German-born singer Michael Kogel, the group set out to achieve success in the European market making English-language pop music. After signing with the Spanish division of Decca Records, the band went to England to work with Ivor Raymonde, a British producer, arranger, conductor, and composer, who had been involved in making UK hit songs with such artists as Marty Wilde, Billy Fury, and Dave Berry. "Black Is Black" was released in 1966 as the band's first Decca single.
Reception
As lead singer Kogel was not a native English speaker (he had to have the lyrics written out phonetically), his vocals had unusual intonations. By coincidence, they sounded similar to that of Gene Pitney, so much so that many listeners assumed that "Black Is Black" was actually a Pitney single.
In August 1966, the song debuted at number 100 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.
It peaked at number four in October,
and spent 12 weeks on the chart. It reached number one on the Canadian Singles Chart, and peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart. The single also sold two million copies in Spain.
Shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, American media conglomerate company Clear Channel Communications distributed the 2001 Clear Channel memorandum to program directors at the more than 1000 radio stations the company owned.
The memo contained a list of 162 songs with "questionable lyrics" that the stations should avoid playing.
"Black Is Black" was among the songs on the list.
Other versions
A French version of the song, entitled "Noir c'est noir", was recorded by Johnny Hallyday and held the number one spot on France's singles chart for seven weeks in the fall of 1966.
It was also covered by French vocal trio La Belle Epoque as a disco song, and released as a 1976 single. It peaked at number two in the UK, and reached number one in Australia in October 1978.
In 1975 it was sampled in I'm on Fire by the band 5000 Volts.
In 1976, Cerrone released his version as a single from his 3-track LP, Love in C Minor. The track is often mixed into club sets or sampled.

Tendencia Revolucionaria (lit. Revolutionary Tendency) was a group of left-wing Peronist organizations. Tendencia Revolucionaria formalized as an organization in the early 1970s prior to the March 1973 elections. Its objective was to bring Juan Perón back to Argentina and making Argentina socialist. Tendencia Revolucionaria was made up by:
Montonero organizations
Juventud Peronista Regionales
Movimiento Villero Peronista
Juventud Universitaria Peronista
Juventud de Trabajadores Peronistas
Unión de Estudiantes Secundarios
Movimiento de Inquilinos Peronistas
Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
The organization included minority factions from:
Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas
Peronismo de Base
Perón used Chilean President Salvador Allende as a warning example for Tendencia Revolucionaria. In September just a few days before the 1973 Chilean coup d'etat he addressed the organization:
The campaign of Tendencia Revolucionaria is credited for the election of Oscar Bidegain as Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 1973. Bidegain reciprocated by proclaiming amnesty for some incarcerated members of Tendencia Revolucionaria, a move Bidegain's Peronist ally Héctor Cámpora also promised as part of his presidential campaign. However Bidegain's running mate and subsequent vicegovernor Victorio Calabró was disliked by Tendencia Revolucionaria. He was seen as a right-wing bureaucratic syndicalist. One of the first setbacks of Tendencia Revolucionaria was Peróns sacking of Rodolfo Galimberti in April 1973 after the latters call to form militias. As Perón arrived to Argentina in June 1973 Tendencia Revolucionaria suffered a major rift as some considered that any armed struggle was no longer needed while others insisted on its necessity. Another setback came on January 20, 1974 when People's Revolutionary Army attacked the Azul garrison. This resulted in Perón criticizing Bidegain who resigned after facing pressure from the Camber of Deputies. To the dismay of Tendencia Revolucionaria Victorio Calabró succeeded him as governor. After the death of Perón in 1974 Tendencia Revolucionaria lost influence and suffered a series of internal rifts.

Jeremiah Gurney (October 17, 1812 – April 21, 1895), was an American daguerreotype photographer operating in New York.
Biography
Gurney worked in the jewelry trade in Little Falls, New York, but soon moved his business to New York City and shortly after turned to photography, having been instructed and inspired by Samuel Morse. He was one of the pioneering practitioners of the daguerreotype process, opening the first American photo gallery at 189 Broadway in 1840, and charging $5 for a portrait.
He created remarkably detailed portraits, using to the full the remarkable tonal rendition of the process. He selected his clients from New York's society elite, calling them "Distinguished Persons of the Age" and eschewing the political and entertainment figures favoured by his rival, Mathew Brady. The quality of Gurney's portraits soon ensconced him as the finest daguerreotypist in Gotham.
Gurney's photographic skills received numerous accolades, including a write-up in the Scientific American of 5 December 1846. The New York Illustrated News, in an 1853 article, wrote that his establishment at 349 Broadway "consisted of nine spacious rooms, devoted exclusively to this art." In the 1840s Gurney showed his images at numerous exhibitions such as the American Institute Fair and later at the Crystal Palace in London, achieving international renown. His business flourished and in 1858 he built a three-story white marble studio at 707 Broadway to house his pictures, and it was the first building built for the sole purpose of photography in the United States.
Gurney played a leading role in the training of the first wave of pioneering photographers such as Mathew Brady, who made a name for himself as a Civil war photographer. Brady had been employed as a journeyman making jewelry cases for E. Anthony & Co., and also made display cases for Gurney's daguerreotypes.
One of the things Gurney is best known for is having taken the only known photograph of Abraham Lincoln in death.

In popular culture

The Collectors are a thriller novel written by American author David Baldacci. The book was published by Warner Books on October 17, 2006. This is the second installment to feature the Camel Club, a small group of Washington, D.C. civilian misfits led by "Oliver Stone", an ex-Green Beret and a former CIA trained assassin. On November 5, 2006, the novel debuted at No. 2 on The New York Times Best Seller list and remained on the list for seven weeks.
Plot summary
The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and the curator of the rare books collection of the Library of Congress both are found dead. The Speaker has been killed by a sniper at a party while the head of the rare books collection dies from "unknown circumstances." Oliver Stone and the Camel Club become suspicious, although initially they indulge what they believe is his overactive imagination. Stone and his cohorts discover that Seagraves had been selling American intelligence secrets to terrorists in the Middle East, compromising intelligence efforts in the region. However, when they are followed and ask the Secret Service for help, the followers disappear, and the Camel Club becomes interested in their activities. Seagraves kidnaps and subsequently tortures Stone for information. Annabelle Conroy is introduced as a con artist, who after pulling off a 40 million heists against an Atlantic City Casino owner (Jerry Bagger) is on the run for her life. Bagger wants to find and kill Annabelle and her con team. Alex Ford from the previous novel reappears, and in the climax Seagraves is killed by a knife thrown at his carotid artery by Stone who turns out to be an ex-CIA killer. Alex Ford and his agents take Seagrave's remaining collaborators into custody. One of Annabelle Conroy's collaborators in the heist is tortured for information by the angry casino owner, who finds out the general area in which she is living (Washington, D.C.). The novel ends with a set-up for Stone Cold, the third novel of the Camel Club series.
Critical reception
Doug Childers of the Richmond Times said that, while the book had a "splendid opening", the rest of the novel "doesn't take the direction readers might expect". Lee Ann Montanaro of The Times of Malta stated that the novel didn't "qualify as a masterly display of the thriller-writing genre" and that they were "expecting more". A San Antonio Express-News writer, in their title, said that the novel was "predictable and superficial but well-written".

Piotr Konstantinovich Vasiliev (; January 26, 1909 – June 9, 1989) was a Russian Soviet realist painter, who lived and worked in Leningrad. He was a member of the Leningrad Union of Artists and regarded as one of representatives of the Leningrad school of painting.
Biography
Piotr Konstantinovich Vasiliev was born January 26, 1909, in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire in the working-class family.
In 1930, Piotr Vasiliev entered at the first course of Department of Painting at the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, where he studied of noted educators Mikhail Bernshtein, Alexander Lubimov, Vladimir Serov, Arcady Rylov.
In 1938 Piotr Vasiliev graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in Isaak Brodsky studio, together with Alexander Laktionov, Yuri Neprintsev, and other young artists. His graduated work was historical painting named "Farewell member of the Komsomol at the front. 1919.", dedicated to the events of the Civil War in Russia in 1918-1921.
After graduation, Piotr Vasiliev was sent to work for an art teacher in Chuvashia. After returning to Leningrad in the years 1939-1941 he taught painting in the Tavricheskaya Art School.
In June 1941, Piotr Vasiliev was drafted into the Red Army and took part in the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet people against Nazi Germany and its allies. He fought on the Leningrad Front, Karelian Front, and 3rd Ukrainian Front. He was wounded and marked by military awards.
In 1944-1945, Piotr Vasiliev took part in the liberation of the Nazi occupation of Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Austria.
Piotr Vasiliev has participated in art exhibitions since 1938. He painted portraits, landscapes, still lifes, genre and historical paintings. In 1946 Piotr Vasiliev was admitted to the Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists (since 1992 known as the Saint Petersburg Union of Artists).
His picturesque style is typical for students of Isaac Brodsky, and based on the constructive role of drawing, on classically constructed composition and delicate tonal relations, on transfer of lighting and shadow contrasts. The artist used mainly broad painting and a rich palette of colors.
Piotr Konstantinovich Vasiliev died on June 9, 1989, in Leningrad at the eighty-first year of life. His paintings reside in art museums and private collections in Russia, England, in the U.S., Japan, France, and others.

Edward A. L. Dunlop (born 20 October 1968) is a British thoroughbred racehorse trainer.
Dunlop is the son of British champion trainer John Dunlop. He was educated at Sunningdale School and Eton College. He began his career on stud farms in Ireland and Kentucky before completing the National Stud student course in Sydney, Australia.
Upon returning to Britain he spent three years as assistant to Nicky Henderson, then joined Alex Scott at his Newmarket Stables. When Scott was murdered in 1994 Dunlop took over and renamed the business Gainsborough Stables. The new stable had its first winner on 19 October 1994 and since then has sent entrants to races as far-flung as Istanbul, Dubai, Milan, Ireland and the United States. In 2003 alone the stable had 50 winners, and such prestigious owners as Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby, have placed horses to train with Dunlop. Notable horses include Ouija Board (won 47%, £2 million).
Dunlop married in 1996 and has three daughters.

U Pannya Jota Mahathera (Burmese: ဦးပညာဇောတမဟာထေရ်, ; December 22, 1955 – April 13, 2020), locally known as Guru Bhante, was a Bangladeshi Theravada monk. He was born in a Royal Bohmong family at Bandarban, East Pakistan. He served the government of Bangladesh as a judge and magistrate for about eight years prior to becoming a Buddhist monk.
Biography
Early life
U Pannya Jota (Birth name: U Saw Hla, ) was born in Bandarban, East Pakistan, on December 22, 1955 to father Hla Thowai Prue and mother Aung Mra Ching. His grandfather, Kyaw Zaw Than, was King of Royal Bohmong family.
At the age of six or seven, he began to attend school in Bandarban. After high school and college, he was admitted to Dhaka University in the Law department.
University
During his university life, Jota led several organizations in promoting education among the students. He also joined many organizations that worked for the promotion of indigenous cultural heritage. He used to sing traditional songs at functions and composed many popular Marma songs like “Sangrai ma.” He also formed a music band named The Royal Artists Group (). After his graduation, he served the Bangladesh Government as a judge and magistrate for about 8 years. He resigned from his job as a judge and became a Buddhist monk in 1990 at Ching Mrong Bihara. At that time, he changed his name to U Pannya Jota Mahathera.
Life as U Pannya Jota
U Pannya Jota was very keen on learning and practicing Buddhism in depth. He believed Buddhism has the potential to bring peace to the minds of all people. He visited various places and taught Dhamma to the laypeople. He was one of the social reformers who worked on the scientific understanding of Buddhism and denied the superstitions that many in Bangladesh believed. Outside of preaching, he spent most of his free time practicing meditation. He visited various countries and met many meditation teachers such as S.N. Goenka. He learned meditation from many great meditation masters in India and Burma.
Publications
U Pannya Jota was not only a practitioner, but a Buddhist scholar as well, publishing many books on Buddhist topics. His books were highly successful among Bangladeshi Buddhist readers.

Social welfare
All of his organizations were for the purpose of social welfare. He built schools and learning centers especially for children and monks. His aim was to educate the young generation of the society because he believed that the future lies in the hands of the youth. Consequently, he thought the cause of tyranny and conflicts in the society is due to education: people with improper education were the ones creating problems in society in his eyes. They would do foolish things because they hadn't been taught otherwise. The most venerable of his aims was to build an educated society by providing secular and religious studies to all.He also hoped that the children in his institutions would be examples and contributors to society. In his documentary, he said that he wanted to provide education for poor children whose parents are not able to pay education fees to send their children to schools. He also mentioned that some of these children are far from remote and hill areas of Chittagong Hill Tracts where there is not access to modern schools and facilities. Listed below are some of his social institutions for children.

Passionism is a contemporary art movement in Scandinavia, anti-avantgarde in its approach. The term was coined by art critique Merete Sanderhoff in her work Sorte Billeder [Black Pictures] as an attempt to categorise talents outside the avantgarde canon, that did not fit into any known art category. They are referred to as the black sheep of the contemporary art scene.
The passionist artists are concerned with the continuation of pre-avantgarde painting traditions without turning into a repetition of these works. They are not simply postmodernists because they actually take the content and the techniques of these traditional paintings seriously. The content focuses on narratives of riddles, yearning, and solemnity. That does not mean they lack humour, but their paintings are meant to be taken seriously. There is a tendency to create very dark paintings hence the title black pictures. Furthermore, they often comment on the doctrines of the modern and postmodern art and art theories, moving beyond these rigid constraints.

Charles Burgess Kelley (born September 11, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter and lead singer and founding member of the country music trio Lady A, which was formed in 2006 and are signed to Big Machine Records.
Early life and career
Kelley was born in Augusta, Georgia, the youngest of three boys of Gayle and Dr. John W. Kelley, a now retired cardiologist. He began his musical career at the age of 11. His older brother, Josh Kelley, is also a musician and singer. As teenagers, Charles, Josh and oldest brother John formed a band called Inside Blue; the band released a five-song CD that garnered the attention of a major label. In middle school, Kelley met Dave Haywood and, at the age of 14, they wrote their first song. They both graduated from Lakeside High School in Evans, Georgia.
Kelley attended the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, where he was a member of the Nu Zeta chapter of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He graduated in 2004 with a degree in finance.
Before moving to Nashville, Tennessee, in mid-2005 to pursue a musical career, Kelley worked in his brother John's construction business in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as an accountant for an affiliated waste management company. Kelley made the move after his brother Josh, who was a pop musician at the time, bought a house in Nashville and convinced him to come live there so they could write songs together.
Musical career
Lady A
Kelley, Hillary Scott, and Dave Haywood founded the country music group Lady A as Lady Antebellum in 2006 and released their debut album in April 2008. The trio either wrote or co-wrote ten of the eleven songs on the album, which featured production by Paul Worley and Victoria Shaw. The album included the trio's debut hit, "Love Don't Live Here", along with the singles, "Lookin' for a Good Time" and "I Run to You", the latter of which became their first number one hit on Billboard'''s Hot Country Songs chart in July 2009. It was certified platinum by the RIAA in October 2009. In 2008, they returned to Charles' and Dave's former high school alma mater, Lakeside High School, and performed a short concert in the gymnasium.
In January 2010, they released their sophomore album, Need You Now, which was led off by the five-week number one and crossover hit, "Need You Now". It also peaked at number two on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 and is 6x certified Platinum. All three members of the band co-wrote eight of the eleven songs on the album and produced alongside Worley. The album generated the number one hits, "American Honey" and "Our Kind of Love", and the top 10 single, "Hello World", and was certified triple platinum in October 2010.
In May 2011, the group released "Just a Kiss" as the lead single from their third studio album, Own the Night, which was released on September 13, 2011, and became their fifth number one hit on the Hot Country Songs chart. "Just a Kiss" was 2x certified Platinum by the RIAA. It stayed on the Hot 100 for forty-two weeks. The second single "We Owned the Night" also became a number one hit and was certified Gold. The third single "Dancin' Away with My Heart" was also certified Gold and peaked at number two. "Wanted You More" was released as the fourth and final single from the album. It was their first single since "Lookin' For a Good Time" to miss the top 10. The band supported the album with their second headlining tour, the Own the Night Tour which was also their first arena and world tour.
On October 22, 2012, On This Winter's Night, the band's first Christmas album was released. One of the tracks on the album "A Holly Jolly Christmas" was released to Country radio and AC radio. A music video for the single was made.
Shortly after the release of On This Winter's Night, they started working on their fifth studio album. Golden was released on May 7, 2013. "Downtown" was the album's first single and peaked at number two on Country radio and number one on the US Country Airplay chart. It was certified platinum by the RIAA. The second single was "Goodbye Town". In late 2013, the deluxe edition re-issue of Golden was released which included the third single "Compass". "Compass" was met with positive reviews and went number one on the Country Airplay chart. In 2014, the band toured the album on the Take Me Downtown Tour and sold-out shows every night.
In May 2014, "Bartender" was released as the first single off their sixth studio album. "Bartender" became their third number on the Country Airplay chart and is certified Platinum. 747 was released on September 30, 2014. "Freestyle" and "Long Stretch of Love" are the second and third singles off 747 respectively.
In October 2015, the group appeared on Good Morning America to announce they will be taking some downtime after their Wheels Up Tour finishes. They still continued to do shows together throughout 2016.
In January 2017, Lady Antebellum released "You Look Good", the lead single off their upcoming seventh studio album Heart Break. The album will be released on June 9, 2017, and will support it on the Look Good Tour.
In June 2020, the band announced they were changing their name to Lady A in light of the original name's Confederate origins.
Solo career
During the band's break, Kelley focused on a solo project and said that Lady Antebellum is his priority but he wanted to try working alone out. On September 28, 2015, he released his debut solo single "The Driver" which features Dierks Bentley and Eric Paslay. Kelley revealed on GMA that he started working on his solo project six months prior to his single's release. "The Driver" received a Grammy nomination for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. His solo debut studio album The Driver was released on February 5, 2016.
Other projects
Kelley's other works consist of co-writing songs for other artists, mainly with Lady Antebellum bandmate, Dave Haywood. One of those songs was "Do I" on labelmate Luke Bryan's 2009 album, Doin' My Thing. Written in late 2008, the song was released to radio in April 2009 and peaked at No. 2 on Billboards Hot Country Songs chart in December of that year. The song also featured Lady Antebellum's Hillary Scott on background vocals.
In 2006, prior to forming the band, Kelley released a solo album called 2 to 9's. The record met with little mainstream success, but was well-rated by listeners.
In 2009, Kelley and Haywood penned a song called "It's Only" for Danny Gokey's debut album, My Best Days, with "I Run to You" cowriter, Tom Douglas. That same year, the two also wrote "Love Song" with Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert, which Lambert would later record for her third studio album, Revolution, and Kelley would sing background on.
In 2010, Kelley and Haywood wrote "Kiss Me Slowly" with Will Anderson, lead singer of the pop rock band, Parachute. The song made it on to Parachute's second studio album, The Way It Was, and was released to iTunes in the weeks leading up to the release of the album. That same year, Kelley, along with Scott and Haywood, recorded a duet with Maroon 5 called "Out of Goodbyes" as Lady Antebellum. The song was included on Maroon 5's third studio album, Hands All Over, but was never released as a single.
In addition, Kelley has co-written numerous songs for his brother, Josh Kelley. Those songs are "Just Say the Word" and "Pop Game" on Josh's 2006 album, Just Say the Word, which were written by the brothers with Haywood; "Lift Me Up" and "Stay Awake" on 2008's Special Company; and "Georgia Clay" and "Ain't Lettin' Go" on his 2011 country debut, Georgia Clay.
Kelley and Haywood co-wrote the semi-autobiographical track "Better Than This" on (Encore), the 2013 re-issue of rising country star Hunter Hayes' self-titled debut album.
On March 17, 2015, Kelley replaced Willy Moon as a judge on the second season of The X Factor New Zealand after Moon was fired from the show. Kelley mentored the Groups category.
Personal life
Kelley is married to music rep Cassie McConnell. The couple wed in a Nashville courthouse in late June 2009 as a legal formality before having a destination wedding in the Bahamas. After the wedding, Lady A tweeted a photo of Kelley showing off his wedding ring, saying, "What is that you see on Charles' hand... yep a wedding ring!!!" McConnell represents several country musicians, including her brother-in-law, Josh Kelley. Charles and Cassie wed on July 6, 2009. On Aug 7, 2015, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child in February 2016. On August 28, 2015, his wife Cassie appeared on Good Morning America to reveal her fertility struggle and also announced they were expecting a baby boy. The couple welcomed their son, Ward on February 11, 2016.
As a result of his brother Josh Kelley's marriage, Kelley is the brother in-law of actress Katherine Heigl.
Lady A's 2022 Request Line Tour was postponed to 2023 so Kelley can take time to embark on his "journey to sobriety."
Kelley had the lyrics, "All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise," from the Beatles song, "Blackbird", tattooed on his right forearm in early 2009. In 2010, Kelley got a second tattoo, a design of the "flower of life", on his upper left arm.
In addition to being an avid golfer, Kelley is a motorcycle enthusiast and owns a 2006 Harley Softail Custom.
In August 2022, Lady A announced that they were postponing their Request Line Tour' tour to 2023 so that Kelley could focus on his sobriety.

Corporate structure
The group of companies employs some 11,700 employees across the world and operates apart from Switzerland also in Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Spain as well as in Latin America and Asia. Globally, the company works as a special and re-insurer. The parent company of Helvetia Group is Helvetia Holding AG, whose registered shares are listed on the Swiss SIX Swiss Exchange. The biggest shareholder of the insurance group is Patria co-operative with a stake of 34.1 per cent.
Financial results of Helvetia Holding
History
In 1858 Helvetia was established by Eastern Swiss business people and entrepreneurs as Allgemeine Versicherungs-Gesellschaft Helvetia in St Gallen. It was the first company in Switzerland to offer an insurance against risks of transport by land, river and sea. Three years later, an own private fire insurance company was established in St Gallen called Helvetia Feuer. The occasion was the fire of Glarus, which revealed shortcomings in the building insurance system.
Over the course of its history, Helvetia expanded into all five continents and thereby laid the foundation for its business activities outside of Switzerland. In 1862 Helvetia Feuer established its first branches in Germany and expanded from 1876 into the US, where it opened branches in California and New York. Between 1920 and 1962 further Helvetia subsidiaries were set up in France, Italy, Greece (sold in 1997), the Netherlands (sold 1995) and Canada (sold in 1999). In Austria the history of Helvetia goes back to the establishment of Der Anker, Gesellschaft von Lebens- und Rentenversicherung in 1858. Until 2006, Helvetia Austria also operated under this name. The establishment of subsidiaries in Spain, Italy and Germany took place between 1986 and 1988.
In 1968 Allgemeine Versicherungs-Gesellschaft Helvetia merged with Helvetia Unfall and Helvetia Leben. The medium-sized insurance group has offered the entire product range in life and non-life insurance since then. In 1974 Helvetia Feuer and Helvetia Allgemeine merged to form Helvetia Feuer. On 11 October 1988 the shareholders decided in an extraordinary general meeting of Helvetia Feuer and Helvetia Unfall to separate the two partner companies in full. Helvetia Unfall took the name Elvia (belongs to Allianz Global Assistance today), which is subsidiary active as a reinsurer already had. Helvetia Feuer was renamed as Helvetia Versicherungen and given a new mission statement and branding. The three-dimensional triangular symbol was introduced.
Helvetia and Patria
In 1996 the company merged with the long-standing Basel-based life insurer Patria. The beginnings of Patria go back to the establishment of Basler Sterbe- und Alters-Kasse in 1878. The charitable pension fund was the first to insure the life of socially disadvantaged people with the aim of being an actual national insurer. After numerous changes in name and mergers, Schweizerische Lebensversicherungsgesellschaft Patria was established in 1910. In 1992 Helvetia and Patria decide to develop the Swiss market jointly in the future and enter into a strategic alliance. In June 1996 Helvetia Patria Holding is established.
Further development
In 2010 Helvetia bought the Swiss insurers Alba Allgemeine Versicherungs-Gesellschaft AG (Alba) and Phenix Versicherungsgesellschaft AG and Phenix Lebensversicherungsgesellschaft AG'' (Phenix). The purchase price of CHF 302 million was paid with equity capital. The Alba/Phenix range in sickness/accident insurance was sold to the two insurance companies innova and Solida.
In 2014 Nationale Suisse and Austria's subsidiary of Baloise were taken over. For this acquisition, Helvetia increased its stake in Nationale Suisse to more than 98 per cent and then initiated the procedure to declare the remaining shares void. Nationale Suisse also consisted of smile.direct, Switzerland's leading online insurer. It also became part of Helvetia Group with the takeover. The acquisition was one of the biggest insurance takeover in recent years in Switzerland.
In 2016 Helvetia took over 70 per cent of the shares in the online mortgage broker MoneyPark. The purchase price was about 107 million francs. With this majority stake, Helvetia entered the Swiss mortgage business. “In particular, however, the addition is a key step towards digitalisation and more customer focus within the framework of our strategy,” said Helvetia CEO Philipp Gmür.
At the beginning of 2017, the company announced that it would invest in startups via an own venture funds, which support the transformation of the existing core business or develop new business models. The fund is endowed with some CHF 55 million and plans to invest in some 25 new companies. Among other things, the venture fund has invested in Volocopter, flatfox, Pricehubble or in the Insurtech INZMO. Furthermore, Helvetia has established a programme for the development of in-house startups and promotes startups with an accelerator programme.
Group Executive Board and Board of Directors
Helvetia is managed by an Executive Board of eleven people. Philipp Gmür has been its chairman since 1 September 2016. The Board of Directors has eleven members. It is chaired by Doris Russi Schurter. She held the office ad interim already in 2015 before Pierin Vincenz was elected as its Chairman. He resigned in December 2017 due to an investigation by Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA against him into his former activities at Raiffeisen. In April 2018 Doris Russi Schurter was officially elected as the successor to Vincenz at the annual general meeting.
International activities
Helvetia is increasingly positioning itself with a cross-country brand appearance in Western Europe. In the countries of Austria, Germany, Italy and Spain, which are summarised in the Europe segment, Helvetia is organised in own national companies. Here, as in Switzerland, the focus is on the business with private customers and small and medium-sized companies. Helvetia offers all key non-life products in these countries. 32% of the total business volume originates from the Europe segment. In the non-life area, this figure is even 42%.
In the Specialty Markets segment, Helvetia the special insurances of art, engineering and transport as well as active reinsurance solutions around the globe. To this end, Helvetia has branches in Istanbul, in Miami for the Latin American and in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore for the Asia markets. The French subsidiary also offers transport and art insurances.
Art and art award
Helvetia has an art collection of more than 300 contemporary Swiss artists. At the Helvetia Art Foyer in Basel, works from the collection are exhibited and artists invited to provide individual exhibitions. Furthermore, the Helvetia Art Award has been bestowed annually since 2004. The honours the graduate of a Swiss arts college. The award provides the opportunity to exhibit at the LISTE international art fair and prize money of 15,000 francs.

Reporter's privilege in the United States (also journalist's privilege, newsman's privilege, or press privilege), is a "reporter's protection under constitutional or statutory law, from being compelled to testify about confidential information or sources." It may be described in the US as the qualified (limited) First Amendment or statutory right many jurisdictions have given to journalists in protecting their confidential sources from discovery.
The First, Second, Third, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits have all held that a qualified reporter's privilege exists. In the recent case of U.S. v. Sterling, the Fourth expressly denied a reporter's privilege exists under Branzburg. Furthermore, forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes called shield laws protecting journalists' anonymous sources.
United States
Department of Justice guidelines (United States)
The United States Department of Justice created self-imposed guidelines intended to protect the news media by regulating the use of subpoenas against the press. These guidelines state that the government "should have made all reasonable attempts to obtain the information from alternative, non-media sources” before considering issuing a subpoena to a member of the news media. Furthermore, the guidelines require that federal prosecutors negotiate with the press, explaining the specific needs of the case.
Before any subpoena may be issued, the attorney general must approve the issuance. The attorney general's review for a subpoena to a member of the news media shall be based on the following criteria:
In criminal cases, there should be reasonable grounds to believe, based on information obtained from non-media sources, that a crime has occurred, and that the information sought is essential to a successful investigation—particularly with reference to directly establishing guilt or innocence. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.
In civil cases there should be reasonable grounds, based on non-media sources, to believe that the information sought is essential to the successful completion of the litigation in a case of substantial importance. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.
The government should have unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the information from alternative non-media sources.
The use of subpoenas to members of the news media should, except under exigent circumstances, be limited to the verification of published information and to such surrounding circumstances as relate to the accuracy of the published information.
Even subpoena authorization requests for publicly disclosed information should be treated with care to avoid claims of harassment.
Subpoenas should, wherever possible, be directed at material information regarding a limited subject matter, should cover a reasonably limited period of time, and should avoid requiring production of a large volume of unpublished material. They should give reasonable and timely notice of the demand for documents.
While these guidelines seem extremely protective of the press, they explicitly deny the creation of “any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law.” Nor does the policy have any substantive punishment for the federal government violations. If the federal prosecutors fail to obtain approval from the attorney general, the extent of the authorized punishment is “an administrative reprimand or other appropriate disciplinary action.” In fact, some courts have found that the guidelines “create no enforceable right.” Therefore, in circuits taking this approach, the news media have no right to appeal for enforcement of these policies before being compelled to testify.
Judith Miller's attempted use of reporter's privilege
The issue of a reporter's privilege came to the forefront of media attention in the 2005 case In re Miller, involving reporters Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper. Miller and Cooper were both served with grand jury subpoenas for testimony and information, including notes and documents pertaining to conversations with specific and all other official sources relating the Plame affair. Both refused to submit to the subpoenas, claiming a reporter's privilege. The federal district court held both Miller and Cooper in civil contempt of court, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the orders of contempt.
Miller and Cooper, in their appeal to the appellate court pleaded several defenses including a First Amendment reporter's privilege and a common law reporter's privilege. The appellate court rejected both the First Amendment and common law claims for privilege. The court held Miller and Cooper in civil contempt of court and sentenced both to eighteen months of jail time. The sentence was stayed pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
However, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. Judith Miller began serving the remaining four months of the original eighteen-month sentence on July 6, 2005. Matthew Cooper's confidential source released him from their confidentiality agreement, so he chose to comply with the subpoena and has agreed to testify before the grand jury.
Congressional proposals
In 2004, two significant bills were introduced in the United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate to create a federal shield law. The first bill was introduced in identical form in both the Senate and the House by Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Representative Mike Pence (R-IN). Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT) introduced separate legislation that created a seemingly broader protection than the Pence/Lugar bill.
In 2006, Rodney A. Smolla testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the topic of reporter's privilege.
On December 2, 2010, in a reaction to the United States diplomatic cables leak by WikiLeaks, John Ensign (R-NV) introduced S.4004 to amend section 798 of title 18, United States Code, to provide penalties for disclosure of classified information related to certain intelligence activities and for other purposes. While titled the SHIELD Act, the proposed legislation has little in common with shield laws in the United States.

Amghar Mohammed Lhaj Slam Amzian (1925 in Beni Boukhlef, Al Hoceima, Morocco – 9 September 1995, in Bergen op Zoom, The Netherlands) was a Moroccan politician, a member of the Democratic Independence Party and a veteran of the pre-independence guerilla Army of Liberation. He led the Rif Revolt (1958-1959).
Early life
Mohammed Sellam Amezian was born in 1925 in Beni Boukhlef, within the Ait Ouriaghel trip in the Rif region in northern Morocco. He studied at the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fez and graduated from it. At the beginning of the fifties, he was sent to teach in Karia Ba Mohamed, where he remained four years, before moving to Tangier and Tetouan to pursue his teaching career. In parallel with his work, he was politically active as a member of the Moroccan Army of Liberation and the Democratic Independence Party.
The Rif Revolt
In October 1958, riots started in the Rif region, as a result of marginalization of the region by the central authority. Sellam Amezian directed this movement. In fact, he embodied all the frustrations associated with independence. He came from a prestigious Riffian lineage that the new ruling class marginalized, he was a member of the MLA and the DIP, both of which the palace and the Istiqlal Party hoped to eliminate. He was also a victim of extortion at the hands of the authorities, having spent more than two years in prison without being formally charged. In 7 October 1958, the protesters issued a chart with a list of demands including "The immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Morocco, and the return of Abd el-Krim and his family to the country".
The events escalated quickly, and weapons started to be used by both the protesters and the army. The uprising was fiercely oppressed by the army, even using aircraft flown by French pilots. Hundreds were killed and thousands were arrested and wounded. Abd El-Karim estimated the number of detainees in the wake of the Rif uprising at 8420.
Life in exile
After the crush of the Rif Revolt, Sellam Amezian sought initially refuge in Spain before leaving for Egypt then Iraq. He remained in Iraq until 1994 before moving to the Netherlands, where he lived until passing away on 9 September 1995. He was later buried in his hometown of Beni Boukhlef in Morocco.
One of his sons, Mohammed Amezian is a journalist, and worked with Radio Netherlands Worldwide from 2008 to 2017.

Richard de Mille (February 12, 1922 – April 8, 2009) was an American author.
Early life and education
He was born in Monrovia, California, to William C. deMille and the Scottish author and screenwriter Lorna Moon, when William C. was still married to his first wife, Anna George de Mille. His uncle, Cecil B. DeMille, adopted and raised Richard, not telling him of his true parentage until the death of his birth father when Richard was 33 years old.
He first enrolled at Columbia University with the class of 1944, later transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles before graduating.
Writing career
He served with the United States Army Air Corps from 1943 to 1946. That year, he became a writer and director at KTLA, remaining in that position through 1950. Around this time he joined the movement that was to become Scientology leaving KTLA to become an editorial/personal assistant to founder L. Ron Hubbard. De Mille used the nom de plume "D. Folgere" (an Anglo-Saxon phrase meaning "follower") when editing and/or ghost-writing during that time, despite Hubbard's protests that it would appear "Dick de Mille wasn't a true believer". He was attracted to Hubbard because, as he later said, "I thought he was a great man who had made a great discovery, and whatever his shortcomings they must be discounted because he had the answer." On February 24, 1951, De Mille assisted Hubbard in kidnapping the latter's wife, Sara, from her apartment in Los Angeles in an unsuccessful bid to have her declared insane by a psychiatrist. They eventually released her in Yuma, Arizona. The two men had already taken Hubbard's daughter Alexis and a few days later flew together with Alexis to Havana, Cuba. In 1953, he was an associate professor at Sequoia University and taught at the Department of Scientology. It was during this time that he wrote "Introduction to Scientology" published by Scientology Council, at the time an affiliate of Sequoia University. By 1954, however, he had become disillusioned with Scientology and left the organization, explaining that he "didn't like all the contradictions and I was becoming more and more sceptical of the whole thing".
In 1955, he completed his B.A. degree at Pepperdine University and married Margaret Belgrano. He went on to get a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California in 1961. He remained with that institution as a research psychologist until 1962, when he became a lecturer in psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1965, he left that position, becoming editorial director of the Brooks Foundation the following year. He stayed there until 1967, becoming a research psychologist at the General Research Corp. in 1968, where he remained through 1973.
He also wrote a biography of his birth mother, screenwriter Lorna Moon entitled My Secret Mother: Lorna Moon. Fellow writer Carol Easton (author of No Intermission: The Life of Agnes de Mille) remarked: "None of Richard de Mille's extraordinary relatives, not even the legendary Cecil B. de Mille himself, could have invented this riveting true story of celebrity, passion, betrayal, and tragedy".
Writings on Carlos Castaneda
De Mille wrote Castaneda's Journey: The Power and the Allegory in 1976, a book describing the detective work through which he said that Carlos Castaneda was a hoaxer and plagiarist and that don Juan is fictional. He edited a second book on the same subject, The Don Juan Papers in 1980, when he found that his exposé did not lead Casteneda's most ardent followers to fall away. This book contains documents representing views of Castaneda across the spectrum.

Sunshine Follows Rain (Swedish: Driver dagg faller regn) is a 1946 Swedish historical drama film directed by Gustaf Edgren and starring Mai Zetterling, Alf Kjellin and Sten Lindgren. The film is based on a 1943 novel by Margit Söderholm.
Söderholm's novel won an award in a competition, and director Gustaf Edgren who had been on the jury wished to make a film out of it. However Carl-Anders Dymling the head of Svensk Filmindustri, was unimpressed with the story and proved very resistant to the project. However, the film turned out to be the company's most profitable of the sound era. The film's sets were designed by the art director Arne Åkermark. It was made at the Filmstaden in Stockholm with some location shooting around Hälsingland where the film is set. It premiered at the Palladium in Stockholm. It was later released in Germany and Austria by Constantin Film.
Synopsis
In nineteenth century Sweden, a wealthy farmer's daughter engaged to be married, begins a romance with a penniless folk musician.

The Vikings () are Denmark's national Australian rules football team.
The team formed in 1992 to play the North London Lions from the British Australian Rules Football League in Denmark.
The Vikings represent the best Danish born players selected from the clubs of the Danish Australian Football League.
The Vikings wear the national colours of red and white, with the top half of Australian rules football in the shape of a horned "Viking" helmet.
Proper internationals began in 1994 when Denmark played an international in England.
In 1995, the DAFL took a decision to exclude Australians from its national team.
Since then, the Vikings have participated in the inaugural 2002 Australian Football International Cup held in Melbourne (finishing 4th).
The national team was one of two teams (the other being Nauru) that withdrew from the 2005 tournament due to an inability of the Danish league to finance the trip.

Mineral King is a subalpine glacial valley located in the southern part of Sequoia National Park, in the U.S. state of California. The valley lies at the headwaters of the East Fork of the Kaweah River, which rises at the eastern part of the valley and flows northwest. Accessed by a long and narrow winding road, the valley is mostly popular with backpackers and hikers.
Historically, the valley was inhabited by the Yokuts tribe during the summer months. They would come up to escape the high heat of the Central Valley and to hunt and forage. They would also meet with bands coming over from the eastern side of the Sierra to trade. In the 1870s, silver was discovered on the slopes of a mountain overlooking Mineral King. Mineral King Road was built in 1873 and was gradually improved throughout the early 20th century.
On September 19, 1966, Walt Disney Productions announced plans to build a ski resort called "Disney's Mineral King Ski Resort" in the valley. The project was canceled after lengthy opposition by preservationists, including the Sierra Club. In 1978, the valley became part of Sequoia National Park.
The name Mineral King also refers to the historic mining camps and towns in and near the valley, including Silver City and Cabin Cove. The settlements as a whole are referred to as the Mineral King Road Cultural Landscape, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.
Geography
Mineral King is a , glacial valley in the southern Sierra Nevada. The valley floor lies at an elevation of , while the granite peaks rising above the head of the valley reach heights of or more. As the crow flies, Mineral King is located about southeast of Three Rivers, which is near the confluence of the East Fork Kaweah River and Middle Fork Kaweah River.
The valley floor is an expanse of open meadows with a narrow strip of riparian vegetation, including short trees and bushes, along the East Fork Kaweah River. As the flat meadows give way to rocky slopes, there are many congregations of conifers that climb the slopes to the tree line. Above the tree line, there are sheer or almost sheer granite walls that slope up to form Sawtooth Peak, Empire Mountain, Mineral Peak, Hengst Peak, and others. There are two prominent mountain passes leading out of Mineral King: Timber Gap, which leads into the Middle Fork Kaweah River drainage, and Farewell Gap at the valley head, which leads into the Kern River drainage. The first half of the valley runs from south to north and the second half runs from east to west.
Fed by snowmelt, springs, and abundant lakes in granite bowls at the upstream end of the valley, creeks plunge down the steep valley walls as long and twisting waterfalls. These include Tufa Falls, Crystal Creek Falls, and Franklin Falls, in upstream order. This section of the valley is dotted with tributary gorges that fan out from the main canyon. Lakes in this section of the valley include the Mosquito Lakes, Eagle Lake, the Franklin Lakes, and the Crystal Lakes. From the end of the valley, the East Fork Kaweah River drops over Mineral King Falls and East Fork Falls, before continuing down a steep and narrow gorge, following Mineral King Road.
Mineral King is one of the oldest communities in the High Sierra, with many families owning cabins for six or seven generations. Many of the communities date from the 1870s silver boom and have been inhabited since.
History
Evidence suggests that Native Americans long ago used Mineral King to camp and hunt in. These Native American groups included the Wikchúmni Yokuts (or Wukchumni) and the Tübatulabal. The Yokuts' main settlements actually had their main villages in the broad valley adjoining and in the present-day site of Lake Kaweah. They created summer settlements on the valley floor and also around the area that was later to be the site of Atwell Mill. The primary purpose of these summer settlements was hunting and trading with the Paiutes, who lived east of the Sierra Nevada. But prior to contact with white settlers, the valley became taboo to the Wikchúmni Yokuts tribe, and no humans had inhabited it for some time.
The first explorer of European descent known to have visited Mineral King was the Irishman Harry "Parole" O'Farrell, in 1862. While employed as hunters for a trail crew building the Hockett toll trail from Visalia to Independence, O'Farrell and a Paiute companion found the valley from the south, over Farewell Gap. Attracted by the promise of mineral riches, O'Farrell returned to prospect and build a summer settlement on the East Fork of the Kaweah River, which came to be called Harry's Bend.
In the 1870s and 1880s, assays of precious metals in White Chief Canyon and on Empire Mountain led to the boomtown of Beulah. The first discovery of silver in the Mineral King Valley occurred in 1872, below Mineral Peak and Empire Mountain.
Following the discovery, the Mineral King Wagon and Toll Road Company was established in December 1873 to build a wagon road. The first routing of Mineral King Road followed the East Fork Canyon's south side. Until then, access to Mineral King was by rough tracks. A second discovery of silver in 1878 drew more prospectors to the Mineral King area and a second Mineral King Road, following a different route up the north side of the canyon, was constructed in 1879. This created the route for much of the present-day Mineral King Road.
The Mineral King Road passes through two groves of giant sequoias, the Redwood Creek Grove and the Atwell Grove. In 1890 the groves were included in the boundaries of the newly established Sequoia National Park, encompassing the central portion of the road. Mineral King itself was excluded from the new park. The Mineral King entrance was the most heavily used gateway to the park until 1903.
A Tom Fowler purchased the Empire Mine, then the largest mine in the area, and created the Empire Gold and Silver Mining Company. The lowermost part of the road was rebuilt in 1915 to its present-day route. Over time, the minerals were found to be unprofitable to extract from their ore and no significant mining ever took place, but the valley kept its hopeful name: Mineral King.
By the 1920s and as part of the Sequoia National Forest, the area became a recreational center, reinforced by the destruction of most of the mining structures in landslides following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Mineral King was used as a summer camping area. Continuing until 1942, private cabins were built in the Mineral King area, expanding the communities of Cabin Cove, Silver City, and Beulah. (All of these communities, including Silver City, would later become part of the National Register of Historic Places' Mineral King Road Cultural Landscape.) In 1926, Mineral King was declared the Sequoia Game Refuge by the United States Congress.
Disney Ski Resort proposal, and addition to national park
Disney's Mineral King Ski Resort was a project developed by Walt Disney Productions in the 1960s. Disney had become interested in skiing around this time, and decided to build a ski resort in the Mineral King Valley. At the time, many skiers believed this to be the largest potential resort in all of California. Disney's bid won out over those of other developers, having the largest plans. Disney had also met renowned University of Denver and Olympic ski coach Willy Schaeffler, and together they developed the village and mountain resort plans.
Conversely, the Sierra Club supported the ski resort proposal during the embryonic stages of its development. Its original plans then were changed to a proposal involving the construction of 14 ski lifts, and hotels and large parking areas. The final plan called for 27 ski lifts and facilities for two million visitors per year. It was at this time that the Sierra Club announced its opposition to the project. The ski resort was never built, due to environmental concerns raised by a coalition of preservationists, led by the Sierra Club. After years of legal battles between pro-development and preservationist groups, the Mineral King Valley was annexed into Sequoia National Park in 1978 by an act of Congress. That legislation effectively stopped the plan to ever develop the area into a ski resort.
Natural history
Upper Mineral King remains largely in its natural state, while lower Mineral King has been somewhat developed. Wildlife is abundant in the valley, including black bears, mule deer, and yellow-bellied marmots. Mountain lions are sometimes seen as well. The East Fork of the Kaweah River which runs through the valley is a small, high-gradient stream that supports a variety of bird and insect life. Mining activities during the silver boom severely hurt the ecology of the lower East Fork below the Empire mine and White Chief Canyon, but wildlife has slowly rebounded.
Recreation
The Mineral King Valley is accessed by a long, narrow, winding mountain road that leads generally southeast from the junction with Highway 198 near Three Rivers. At the end of the road is the Mosquito-Eagle Trailhead, which allows hikers to access trails leading out of the south end of the valley. There are also hiking trails leading north out of the valley through Timber Gap. Two Sequoia National Park campgrounds are located in Mineral King, Atwell Mill Campground and Cold Springs Campground, with a total of 61 tent campsites.
No commercial services are available in the Mineral King Valley and visitors must bring food, camping supplies, firewood and other essentials with them. None of the cabins have electricity and most use propane for lighting, cooking and fireplaces providing heat. There are a few public telephones scattered throughout the Mineral King Valley, notably at the Cold Springs Campground, a trail head parking lot and at the end of the road. Cell phones do not work in the valley due to the remote location and steep terrain. There are at least two webcams that provide year-round visibility into the Mineral King Valley.
No gasoline is available after leaving State Route 198, 25 miles down the winding Mineral King road (a 90-minute drive). The National Park Service charges fees for using campsites at Cold Springs and Atwell Mill. Bears, marmots and other wild animals abound so campers take precautions to protect their food and vehicles. Suggested precautions are posted by the Park Service at the public campgrounds. Camping is not permitted in any location along the road except in the public campgrounds.
Preservation
The Mineral King road corridor was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 24, 2003. Several significant vacation home settlements are preserved along Mineral King Road.
One mile before reaching the Mineral King cabins is a grouping of 30 or so cabins in an area named Faculty Flat. The Faculty Flat cabins were mostly built in the 1920s and many are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The name Faculty Flat derives from a group of Los Angeles educators that originally populated the area.
The Cabin Cove settlement comprises seven cabins, of which six are historic preserved structures. West Mineral King grew up around a place called Barton's Camp, and comprises 35 cabins, all of which are at their original locations and all of which are considered historic structures. East Mineral King, also known as the Beulah Tract, was built around the site of Crowley's Hotel. There are 24 cabins in East Mineral King.
Cabins are typically simple frame structures with board-and-batten siding and metal roofs. In addition to the cabins, the Atwell Mill ranger residence is preserved, exemplifying the National Park Service rustic style. The Lookout Point entrance station and residence were built in the Mission Revival style. A number of water troughs, sited along the road to provide water for overheated car radiators, are also historic structures.
There are two groups devoted to preserving Mineral King:
The Mineral King District Association, whose main focus is on attaining recognition of Mineral King as a living historic community.
The Mineral King Preservation Society, which is nonprofit, public-benefit corporation dedicated to preserving the natural and historic assets of the Mineral King area. Since its inception in 1986, the society has engaged in research, restoration, and preservation planning. Among its other activities is a new partnership with Sequoia National Park to ensure preservation of all historic resources in the National Register listed area and assist in volunteer projects and educational activities.

The Dragon is a 8,105-foot-elevation summit located in the Grand Canyon, in Coconino County of Arizona, US. It is situated north of the Hindu Amphitheater, and about ~4.5 miles north-northwest of Shiva Temple, and ~2.5 mi north of Dragon Head. Both of the Dragon landforms are on a connected ridgeline, (Dragon Head being the ridgeline terminus), defining two south trending canyon watersheds – Dragon Creek, (east), and (Upper)-Crystal Creek (Arizona), (west).Aerial photos of The Dragon and Dragon Head were taken as Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) studies for public flight-path routes within the entire Grand Canyon.
Geology & biology
The geology of The Dragon prominence is an ~250 to 300 ft layer of cliff-forming, whitish Kaibab Limestone. Its hardness supports an approximately horizontal tableland of Ponderosa Pine forest.
Below the Kaibab is an even larger unit of the slope-forming Toroweap Formation. The slope is modestly vegetated, and has large areas of erosion debris, with no obvious interlaced cliffs. The Toroweap Formation rests upon an ~400+ ft cliff of cliff-former Coconino Sandstone.
The Coconino Sandstone (buff/(reddish-white)), rests upon a relatively massive unit of Hermit Formation (Hermit Shale). The slopes are vegetated, also with large sections of burnt-red-brown Hermit debris.

The Clipper Mountains are located in the eastern Mojave Desert and protected within Mojave Trails National Monument, in San Bernardino County, California.
Geography
The range parallels and is just south of Interstate 40 and the Clipper Valley, between the freeway and the National Old Trails Highway - U.S. Route 66.
Geography
The Clipper Mountains are southeast of the Granite Mountains and Providence Mountains, north of the Old Woman Mountains, and west of the Sacramento Mountains. They are northwest of the small communities of Essex and Goffs.
The range is home to at least three natural springs, and the 'Tom Reed Mine.'
Clipper Mountain Wilderness
The Clipper Mountain Wilderness is on the northern slopes of the range, and also within Mojave Trails National Monument. It includes rugged yellow and dark brown, horizontally striped mesas; narrow canyons with hidden springs; and sparsely vegetated alluvial fans. This small cluster of volcanic mountains is oriented northeast to southwest. In the center, the most prominent ridge, Clipper Mountain, reaches an elevation of before it dramatically drops off in a series of sharp cliffs overlooking the Fenner and Clipper Valleys. Castle Dome, a local landmark, can be clearly seen from Historic Route 66 to the south and east.
The vegetation types are predominantly xeric desert scrub, with creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), and desert wash scrub. In the spring, the alluvial fans turn yellow with brittlebush flowers (Encelia farinosa), as well as wildflowers.
Wildlife includes a herd of 40-50 desert bighorn sheep, coyote, roadrunners, chucker, quail, prairie falcons, red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, black-tailed jackrabbits, rattlesnakes, and several species of lizards. The entire wilderness is considered critical habitat for the threatened desert tortoise.

Imane Khalifeh (1955–1995) was a Lebanese educator and peace activist.
Life
Imane Khalifeh was born in Beirut in 1955. She was educated there and lived through the breakout of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. She was trained in child psychology and taught at the Beirut University College kindergarten. She became a member of the Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World.
In April 1984, nine years into the war, Khalifeh developed the idea of a peace march in which the silent majority of the people of Lebanon would protest and express their opposition to the civil war. She wrote a poem suggesting the march that was published by the majority of Beirut dailies. She spoke out against the evils of war and coined the slogan "No to war. No to the tenth year of war! Yes to peace." Khalifeh joined a peace group that included Nawaf Salam, Maitre Laure Moghaizel and Hani Feghali. They circulated the anti-war petition "The Document of Civil Peace" throughout Beirut, gathering 70,000 signatures. On 6 May 1984, both Muslim and Christian parts of the city were to join for a march at the demarcation line known as "Museum alley" which separated the warring militias and armies. The march was stopped by blind shelling that resulted in many casualties.
Khalifeh continued to work for peace in Lebanon until 1989 when she went into exile in Paris. She was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1984 "for inspiring and organising the Beirut peace movement." She died in 1995.

Alfred Mowbray Hutton was an architect in Australia. Some of his works are heritage-listed.
Early life
Alfred Mowbray Hutton was born in Victoria.
Architectural practice
Hutton practiced in Victoria before moving to Rockhampton, Queensland, in mid-1894 to take over the practice of James Flint, to whom he was related by marriage. He designed a hotel for JM Headrick & Co at Lake's Creek the following year. Hutton practiced widely in Rockhampton, both as a sole practitioner and in partnership with Edwin Morton Hockings, which lasted from 1898 until 1904.
Later life
Hutton died on 26 July 1911 in Rockhampton, QLD.The many friends of Mr. Mowbray Hutton will regret to hear of his death, which occurred early this morning at the residence of Mrs. Flint, Oxford street, The Range. Mr. Hutton has been in failing health for some time past. He has rallied at time, and hopes have been entertained that he might recover but during the past few days it has been apparent that he was hearing the end. Mr. Hutton came to Rockhampton some years ago to practise his profession as an architect. Shortly after coming here he entered into partnership with Mr. E. M. Hockings, a partnership that lasted till about eight years ago, when Mr. Hutton went south. He recently returned to Rockhampton, and his well-known skill as an architect soon brought him plenty of business. Had his health not failed, it is certain that he would have built up a very remunerative connection. Amongst the more important of the buildings erected to his plan and under his supervision is the big warehouse of Messrs. Walter Reid and Company at the corner of East and Derby streets, the design for which was a matter of public competition; Mr. Hutton was in his 43rd year. So that his death is all the more sad from the fact that he passed away at what is usually the prime of a mans life. He was a cousin of Mr. W. Hutton, the Secretary of the Charters Towers Stock Exchange.

CO2SYS is a family of software programs that calculate chemical equilibria for aquatic inorganic carbon species and parameters. Their core function is to use any two of the four central inorganic carbon system parameters (pH, alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide) to calculate various chemical properties of the system. These programs are widely used by oceanographers and limnologists to understand and predict chemical equilibria in natural waters.
History
Chemical equilibria in marine and freshwater systems were calculated according to various conventions for most of the 20th century, which led to discrepancies among laboratories' calculations and limited scientific reproducibility. CO2SYS was first published by Ernie Lewis and Doug Wallace in 1998 as a DOS-interface program written in QBasic. Subsequent developments have included several MATLAB implementations, two Microsoft Excel templates, a Python package "PyCO2SYS", and an R package inspired by CO2SYS, "seacarb". Development of the various CO2SYS programs continues as of 2021 with the addition of more chemical equilibrium parameters and compatibility with a wider range of environments, e.g. anoxic waters.
Chemical Overview
The aquatic inorganic carbon system is composed of the various ionic, dissolved, solid, and/or gaseous forms of carbon dioxide in water. These species include dissolved carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, bicarbonate anion, carbonate anion, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and others. The relative amounts of each species in a body of water depends on physical variables including temperature and salinity, as well as chemical variables like pH and gas partial pressure. Variables like alkalinity and dissolved (or total) inorganic carbon further define a mass and charge balance that constrains the total state of the system.
Given any two of the four central inorganic carbon system parameters (pH, alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, partial pressure of carbon dioxide) the remainder may be derived by solving a system of equations that adhere to the principles of chemical thermodynamics.

Steve Patterson is a Canadian stand-up comedian, actor, writer, television and radio host, and television producer known for his satire and observational comedy.
Career
Patterson has been on the comedy circuit full-time since 1996. He draws material from observation of daily/current events and what goes on in the room during a show. He first set foot on the stage at the age of 18 on a dare from his dorm mates. However, he spent the next few years away from comedy, as he finished his university degree in business from The University of Western Ontario. He then earned a post-graduate diploma in media copywriting. He performed comedy part-time while earning a living as a full-time advertising copywriter from 1994-1996.
Patterson was fired from his copywriting job in 1996. and started performing comedy full-time. Later that year, he joined the touring roster of Canadian comedy booking agency Funny Business, for which he started as the opening act.
In 1999, Patterson got a chance to perform at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal for the first time. His Irish-influenced set made it possible for him to tour Ireland.
Between the years 1999 and 2004, Patterson performed across Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. He also appeared for a few shows in the United States and the United Arab Emirates. In 2004, he made his first Just for Laughs gala appearance. Also in 2004, Patterson performed at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland.
In 2006, Patterson was host of the Just for Laughs Road Tour throughout Ontario, and was part of the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal that summer.
In September 2007, Patterson became a host of CBC Radio One's The Debaters, and gained some notoriety in 2007 as being the first comic to say no to Last Comic Standing when he qualified for their Canadian finals in Montreal. He turned down NBC to honour a local show commitment.
In July 2010, Patterson performed again at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal on a Gala hosted by Steve Martin. Following his performance, Martin said "If I knew he was going to be THAT good, I would have canceled him."
With growing success as host of The Debaters on CBC Radio One, The Debaters began airing on CBC Television in the fall of 2011
Patterson was nominated for a Gemini Award for his JFL performance, on the Steve Martin Gala, and hosted the Industry Gala in 2011. His success continued in October when he was awarded "Best Male Stand-up" at the Canadian Comedy Awards, an industry event which he also hosted.
Publishing rights to Patterson's debut novel, The Book of Letters I Didn't Know Where to Send, were sold to Goose Lane Editions in 2015. Goose Lane published the book in 2016.

Lee Cruce (July 8, 1863 – January 16, 1933) was an American lawyer, banker and the second governor of Oklahoma. Losing to Charles N. Haskell in the 1907 Democratic primary election to serve as the first governor of Oklahoma, Cruce successfully campaigned to succeed Haskell to serve as the second governor of Oklahoma. As governor, Cruce was responsible for the establishment of the Oklahoma Department of Highways and the Oklahoma State Capitol. He worked hard to enforce prohibitions on alcohol and gambling, going so far as to use the state militia to stop horse racing. He was succeeded by Robert L. Williams.
Born in Kentucky, Cruce worked as a lawyer, a banker, and a municipal official before his election as governor. After finishing his term as governor, he worked in the private sector and made an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate. He died in 1933 in Los Angeles, California, and was buried in Ardmore, Oklahoma.
Early life and move to Oklahoma
Lee Cruce was born in the city of Marion in Crittenden County, Kentucky on July 8, 1863. He attended Marion Academy, and subsequently attended Vanderbilt University, receiving a law degree from the latter. Though he passed the Kentucky bar exam in 1888, he did not practice law until he joined his brother's law firm, Johnson, Cruce and Cruce at Ardmore in Indian Territory in 1891.
After ten years of practicing law, Cruce entered the financial world as the first cashier of the Ardmore National Bank, of which he later served as the bank's president. In 1901, Cruce was elected an alderman in the local government of Ardmore.
Gubernatorial campaigns
Through his combined positions of power in the Ardmore National Bank and the movement towards statehood in late 1906, Cruce submitted his name on the Democratic primary for governor of the newly created state of Oklahoma. The popular Charles N. Haskell defeated Cruce for the nomination, but before Haskell's term ended in 1911, Cruce once again sought the Democratic nomination for governor and was successful. He then defeated his Republican opponent in the general election.
Governor of Oklahoma
Cruce was inaugurated as the second Governor of Oklahoma on January 9, 1911. Whereas the state's first governor exercised extensive executive control over the Oklahoma Legislature through his force of personality, Cruce continually struggled for power against the state legislature throughout his term. Despite the power struggles, Cruce did manage to complete many of the projects he initiated. Cruce's first major success came in the realm of automotives. With the increase in automobiles, the state legislature acted upon Cruce's commendation and established the Oklahoma Department of Highways in 1911. Roads were improved with funds generated from an annual $1 license fee.
Next on the governor's agenda was the construction of the Oklahoma State Capitol in the state capital, which Haskell officially moved from Guthrie to Oklahoma City in 1910. Under the supervision of Cruce, the state legislature established the three member State Capitol Commission in 1913. The commission was charged with purchasing land for the state capitol building. After purchasing the desired property in downtown Oklahoma City, on July 20, 1914, groundbreaking began. Then on November 16, 1915 (Oklahoma's 8th birthday) the cornerstone was laid in Masonic fashion and construction began.
Believing the state needed to take on a greater moral role, Cruce supported enforcement of blue laws. Through specific legislation, Cruce and the state legislature closed businesses on Sundays, and declared prize fighting, gambling, bootlegging, and horseracing illegal. This, combined with Haskell's prohibition plan, proved too much for the state to handle. The state legislature did not possess the funds needed to finance the operations and only ended up shifting funds around from one law enforcement agency to another. Cruce, on numerous occasions, in his role as Commander-in-Chief, called out the state militia to enforce his laws. The most famous of these events occurred when Cruce declared martial law in Tulsa to prevent a horserace from taking place. The race was brought to a halt as shots were fired over the heads of the jockeys.
Cruce was an avid abolitionist when it came to the use of capital punishment throughout the state. Pioneering the movement to abolish capital punishment, Cruce commuted twenty-two death sentences to life imprisonment and only one execution took place during his administration. Despite this, he did little to prevent lynchings of non-white people, explaining to the NAACP;
There is a race prejudice that exists between the white and Negro races wherever the Negroes are found in large numbers ... Just this week the announcement comes as a shock to the people of Oklahoma that the Secretary of the Interior ... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them ... If your organization interested itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time ...
Congressional reapportionments nearly resulted in the downfall of Cruce's administration. In 1912, Cruce vetoed a bill to reapportion the state into eight congressional districts designed to minimize Republican voting strength. This veto as well as the Governor's attempts to abolish some public institutions for economic reasons, led the legislature to investigate the executive branch. As a result, the State Auditor, State Insurance Commissioner, and State Printer were impeached. Cruce himself escaped impeachment in the Oklahoma House of Representatives by a single vote.
By the end of his term in 1915, the voters were, for the most part, ready for a change. Looking for a new governor, the voters looked to Oklahoma Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert L. Williams. Elected in 1914 following the end of his only term on the court, Williams became the third governor of Oklahoma.
Late life and legacy
After Cruce left office, he would continue his career as a lawyer and banker through Oklahoma. In 1930, Cruce was defeated in the primary for the United States Senate losing out to Thomas Gore, one of Oklahoma's first Senators. Cruce died January 16, 1933, in Los Angeles, California. He is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in his adopted hometown of Ardmore.

A dead-man's vigilance device (also called the Driver Vigilance Device or DVD for short) is a railroad safety device that operates in the case of incapacitation of the engineer. It is a hybrid between a dead-man's switch and a vigilance control. The main safety failing with the basic dead-man's control system is the possibility of the operating device being permanently held in position, either deliberately or accidentally. The dead-man's vigilance device was developed to detect this condition by requiring that the dead-man's device be released momentarily and re-applied at timed intervals.
Modern practice
Modern locomotive practice is to incorporate the dead-man's and vigilance functions under the control of the alerter or the event recorder. This enables more sophisticated monitoring of the driver's alertness. The vigilance control cycle time can then be speed dependent, varying inversely to train speed in order to reduce the distance the train may travel before a non-response is detected and acted upon.
Warning and braking
If the timer period is beginning to expire, a visual and audible warning is given. If the operator fails to acknowledge the warning, a penalty brake application results.

The lemon-bellied white-eye (Zosterops chloris) is a species of bird in the family Zosteropidae. It is endemic to Indonesia, where it occurs on a number of islands from the Sunda Strait to the Aru Islands. It is present on several of the Lesser Sunda Islands as well as on parts of Sulawesi, as well as many smaller islands, but is absent from the larger islands of Borneo, Java, Sumatra and Timor. Currently (May 2017), HBW describes five sub-species of lemon-bellied white-eye. However, the extensive distribution of Z. c. intermedius (including S. Sulawesi, SE. Sulawesi, C. Lesser Sundas and small islands in between) is likely to contain more than one reproductively isolated population (cf. Z.c. intermedius and Z. c. flavissimus, with the latter now considered a distinct species, the Wakatobi white-eye (Z. flavissimus).
The lemon-bellied white-eye's natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. On the islands of Buton and Kabaena the lemon-bellied white-eye appears limited to coastal regions, perhaps as a result of competition with the pale-bellied white-eye. Observations from Buton suggest that the lemon-bellied white-eye prefers more disturbed habitats. Their diet consists of invertebrates, fruits, and nectar. They have strong dark grey legs, a dark colored beak, and generally range in size from 11–12 cm. They are a yellow-olive color on the dorsal side, with characteristic bright yellow underparts.

What a Time to Be Alive is the debut studio album by Scottish singer-songwriter Tom Walker, released on 1 March 2019 through Relentless Records. It was preceded by the single "Leave a Light On", which reached the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, as well as "My Way" and "Angels". It also includes "Walk Alone", released as a single from Rudimental's 2019 album Toast to Our Differences, and the original acoustic version of "Just You and I", which was re-released in a different version for single release in early 2019, also reaching the top 10 in the UK.
The album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of 37,000.
Background
Walker originally tweeted in July 2018 that the album would be released on 19 October 2018. On its delay, he said to Idolator that he felt like he had "been sat on this album for a little while". He also spoke about the title, and how it is either interpreted as being "depressing" or "hopeful", but that he named it "because we've come so far, the human race, but also, I think we keep making the same mistakes over and over again, and not learning sometimes. It's a thought provoking title, that's why I like it."
Critical reception
Writing for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis scored the album two out of five stars and called Walker "algorithmically designed for our times", comparing his sound to that of Ed Sheeran, in that the two share a "predilection for a percussive style of guitar playing, vaguely hip-hop beats and rap-influenced vocal cadences". Petridis also characterised the songwriting as either being "bullish assertions of Walker's own talent in the face of apathy and adversity ('I'll be dead before they change me, my guitar's the only one that ever paid me') and empathetic I'm-your-mate vignettes involving booze, drugs and lean times." Reviewing the album for Clash, Malvika Padin described it as "an assured, controlled debut album" featuring "a mix of slow instrumentals and soaring vocals, that make an impact track after track", summarising it as a "perfect representation of him – cheerful, genuine, heartfelt and talented". In a two-star review, Will Hodgkinson of The Times also compared Walker to Sheeran and Rag'n'Bone Man, saying that "the public appetite for earnest bearded troubadours who look as if they work in a microbrewery shows no sign of abating". Hodgkinson further noted that the album is "perfectly pleasant" but with its team of songwriters writing for mass audience appeal, "almost wilfully dull".

Win Pe (; born 16 June 1935) is one of Myanmar's most celebrated living artists. Along with his close friends Kin Maung Yin and Paw Oo Thett, Win Pe was a leader of Myanmar's modern art movement in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was a successful film director, winning Myanmar's equivalent of the Academy Award in 1981. He is also a respected short story writer.
Early Training
Win Pe is from Mandalay, the historical and cultural capital of Myanmar and from a prominent Mandalay family. His father, Shwepy U Ba Tin, a famous scholar of Myanmar art, history and culture, was very supportive of Win Pe's artistic development. While his father was an anti-colonialist and preferred traditional Myanmar music, he was open to his son's discovery of American Jazz and European classical music which he heard from Radio Ceylon and American movies and sent him to apprentice with the successful painter, Ba Thet. His friend Paw Oo Thett joined him there and after a while Ba Thet sent both of them to study with Kin Maung to learn modernist, more abstract art trends. Later, both would take Norman Rockwell's correspondence course, the Famous Artist School. The work of one of the School's instructors, Dong Kingman, the Chinese-American watercolorist, was a great influence on Win Pe.
Career
In the early 1960s, Win Pe and Paw Oo Thett left Mandalay for Rangoon where they met Kin Maung Yin, an artist and architect. The three lived together at the architect offices, exchanged ideas, painted together and held many exhibitions especially among the diplomatic community.
In 1966, Win Pe, at age 31, was appointed Dean of the Mandalay State School of Fine Art, Music and Dance. It was his dream job but his vision to mix modern ideas with traditional arts conflicted with the older, conservative teaching staff and he left after four years. He would spend the next 15 years as a film director and short story writer. His first film, Let the Sky Not Fall was well received and in 1981 he won Myanmar's equivalent of the Academy Awards as Best Director for his film, Red Rose Dream.
In 1993, three of Win Pe's short stories were published in the book, Inked Over, Ripped Out. The following year, he attended the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa and earned an Honorary Fellowship there.

Peregrine Michael Hungerford Pollen (24 January 193118 February 2020) was an English auctioneer who headed Parke-Bernet in the 1960s after it was purchased by Sotheby's. He was known for expanding the auction house in North America, and bringing a dramatic flair to auctions.
Early life
Pollen was born to Walter Michael Hungerford Pollen, a steel industrialist, and Rosalind Frances Pollen Benson, the daughter of Robert Henry Benson, a well-known London banker, on 24 January 1931. His grand-uncle was George Holford. He attended Eton College and read modern languages at Christ Church, University of Oxford. Pollen then worked as a Latin teacher, an organist in Australia, warehouse worker in Los Angeles, a gasoline attendant, pantry boy on an ocean liner from London to Las Palmas, aluminium worker in Kitimat, British Columbia, and attendant at a psychiatric hospital. He served his national service in the King's Royal Rifle Corps before becoming an aide-de-camp to the Governor of Kenya, Evelyn Baring, from 1955 to 1957.
Work as auctioneer
Pollen first began working for Sotheby's in 1957, rising to become an aide to the company's chairman, Peter Wilson, before he was made the company's first New York City representative in 1960. After the company purchased Parke-Bernet in 1964at the time the largest auction house in America he became the head of Sotheby Parke-Bernet. He expanded it throughout North America, opening facilities in Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, Buenos Aires, and São Paulo. He also spearheaded the opening of PB 84, a discount store, in New York City in 1968.
As an auctioneer, he was known for having a dramatic flair. At a 1967 auction of treasure from the 1715 Treasure Fleet, Pollen had a talking macaw brought in and projected images of the fleet on the walls of the auction room. In order to get Impressionist paintings out of Buenos Aires, he once concealed them in a Beatles poster. Pollen later had a caique from South America named Papagoya that accompanied him around the city and was reportedly addicted to alcohol. He oversaw auctions of numerous items, including Helena Rubinstein's collection and treasure salvaged from the 1715 Treasure Fleet. Pollen oversaw a dramatic increase in Parke-Bernet's sales; in 1964 when it was purchased, its sales were $11 million. By 1966, the auction houses' sales were $23.5 million, and $38.5 million by 1970.
In 1972, Pollen became vice-chairman of Sotheby's and returned to England. As the largest private shareholder in the company (with five percent), Pollen was considered the likely successor of Wilson until the company began losing money which many blamed on over-expansion. When Gordon Brunton was made the chairman after Wilson's retirement, Pollen left the company, retiring in 1982.
Personal life and death
In 1958, he married Patricia Helen Barry. They had three children, including Arabella Pollen, before divorcing in 1972 and remarrying in 1978. Patricia Barry died in 2016. He lived in Norton Hall, Gloucestershire where he planted between 6,000 and 8,000 trees, and was a trustee of the Westonbirt Arboretum. Pollen died on 18 February 2020.

This film is counted among the 17 consecutive hit films of Rajesh Khanna between 1969 and 1971, by adding the two-hero films Marayada and Andaz to the 15 consecutive solo hits he gave from 1969 to 1971.
Plot
Lalita (Mala Sinha) lives with her widowed mother (Dulari) in a small village in India. One day while traveling by road, she is stranded, and a young man named Raja Babu (Rajesh Khanna) comes to her assistance. Both fall in love with each other. When she informs her mother about her love for Raja, she is met with strong opposition, as her mother knows that Raja Babu is already married and has a son. She also reminds Lalita about her marriage with Diwan (Abhi Bhattacharya). When Lalita meets with Raja, he admits to her that he is not Raja but his real name is Rajan Ram Bahadur, but refuses to divulge any other information to her. She decides that she will have nothing to do with him. The mystery deepens when Pran Bahadur (Pran), the step-brother of Raja Babu returns and wants to confront the young man who has taken over Raja's identity, with results that will change the lives of everyone around them forever.

Maryland Route 925 (MD 925) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Old Washington Road, the state highway runs from Billingsley Road in White Plains north to MD 5 Business in Waldorf. MD 925 and the county-maintained portion of Old Washington Road to the north comprise the old alignment of U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in northern Charles County. Originally constructed as part of MD 3 and MD 5 in the early 1910s, the highway become part of US 301 in the early 1940s, then was bypassed by the present US 301 divided highway in the mid-1950s. The White Plains–Waldorf portion of the old road was renumbered MD 925 in the early 1960s.
Route description
MD 925 begins at an intersection with Billingsley Road in White Plains, just east of the latter highway's intersection with US 301 (Robert Crain Highway). There is no direct access to northbound MD 925 from eastbound Billingsley Road. MD 925 heads northeast as a two-lane undivided road through a residential area, paralleling US 301 to the west and CSX's Popes Creek Subdivision railroad line to the east. The route passes northwest of a park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses before intersecting Smallwood Drive in St. Charles. Shortly after this intersection, the state highway expands to a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and enters a commercial area. MD 925 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with MD 5 Business (Leonardtown Road) in Waldorf. Old Washington Road continues northeast as a county highway, passing through an industrial area before reconnecting with US 301 via Sub-Station Road just south of US 301's intersection with MD 5.
History
Old Washington Road is the original alignment of US 301 from White Plains through Waldorf to the Prince George's County line. The route was marked for improvement as one of the original state roads by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The highway between White Plains and the county line was constructed as a gravel road in 1912. The highway was designated MD 3 for its whole length and MD 5 north of Waldorf in 1927. By 1930, the highway was the most heavily traveled highway in Charles County, so the road was widened to with concrete shoulders and resurfaced with bituminous concrete. Around 1948, the route, now part of US 301, was widened to . The expanded highway still was unable to handle the traffic burden, so in 1952 a divided highway bypass of Old Washington Road was started from the Prince George's County end. The new US 301 divided highway reached Waldorf by 1954 and was completed to White Plains in 1956. Old Washington Road originally kept the MD 3 designation. However, by 1961, Old Washington Road was designated MD 925 south of Waldorf and transferred to county maintenance north of Waldorf.

Y-Zet (; born Htet Nway Oo on 28 May 1989) is a Burmese hip hop singer. He is one of the most popular hip hop singers in Myanmar and rose to fame with his debut album Pyaw San Par which was a duo album with singer Oasix.
Early life and education
Y-Zet was born on 28 May 1989 in Pyin Oo Lwin, Myanmar to parents: Sein Maung and his wife Thet Thet Ye. He is the eldest son of two siblings, having a younger sister. He attended high school at Basic Education High School No. 4 Pyin Oo Lwin and also attended Sar Pann Aein Private School with the goal of graduating from high school. He enrolled for the chemistry major at Yadanabon University, and then he dropped out of university in his second year, back in 2008.
Career
2009–2013: Career beginnings in underground
Y-Zet started out on his music career in 2009, as a singer in the underground music industry. Shortly after, he released a duet mix-tape "The Collaboration" with his friend Alatt in 2010.
In 2011, he joined a native underground hip hop crew Wildboy and released a lot of songs and mix-tapes, collaborating with Wildboy's members. In the meantime, he made a song called "Shwee Die" (Flying fire cracker) collaborating with two of the members from Wildboy who were closest to him, Oasix and Moe Aung, beefing mainstream hip hop singer Hlwan Paing's song "Done Pyan" (Rocket). In 2013, he released his solo mix-tape "My Mistake" and two of the tracks, "Ma Mae Say" and "A Yin Lo" were on top of the charts of underground hip hop. Since then, he gained his first recognition from his fans and he engaged in shooting commercial advertisements, stage performances, and many concerts at various locations throughout Myanmar.
2014–2016: Reached the mainstream and nationwide recognition
Y-Zet started his mainstream movement in 2014. And then he released an album "Pyaw San Par" (Just say it) which was a duo album with singer Oasix in 2015 December. One of the songs from that album, "Yote Thay Yote" (The Puppet) song gained him nationwide recognition and since then, that song has been one of the all-time hits in his career.
2017–present: Solo debut and other activities
In early 2017, Y-Zet started endeavoring to be able to produce and distribute his first solo album. He launched his debut solo album "Za" (Gene) on 10 June 2017 which spawned more huge hits. Many music industry records have followed since then.
In 2018, Y-Zet released two single songs with featured artists, Wyne Lay and NJ.
Death issue in his concert
On June 10, 2017, Y-Zet held a concert for his solo album promotion in Mandalay that was, unsurprisingly, attended by thousands of people, most of whom were teenagers.
During the concert, several fights broke out over the course of the night. Ultimately, the event was shut down for security reasons, but not before one fight in particular got so out of hand that it ended in the death of one 19-year-old attendee.

The Vickers Type 121 Wibault Scout was a British fighter built by Vickers in the 1920s. It was a licensed version of the French Wibault 7 aircraft, with 26 being sold to Chile in 1926, where they served until 1934.
Design and development
Vickers set up a partnership with the French aircraft manufacturer, Société des Avions Michel Wibault to exploit the patented system of all-metal construction developed by Michel Wibault. This used corrugated light alloy skin panels, and made for easy maintenance and inspection. As part of this partnership, Vickers placed an order with Wibault for a single Wibault 7, re-engined with a Bristol Jupiter VI radial engine, to act as a prototype for potential licensed production. The Wibault 7, and therefore the Vickers licensed copy, were single-engine high-wing parasol monoplanes.
The prototype, which differed from the standard Wibault 7 by having a new undercarriage and British instruments, was delivered to Britain in February 1926 and was later fitted by Vickers with strengthened wing struts. The durability of the aircraft's all-metal structure, together with promised good altitude performance, attracted the attention of the Chilean Military Air Service, which, after evaluating the prototype, placed an order for 26 aircraft, known as the Vickers Type 121, or Vickers-Wibault Scout.
The first Vickers built Type 121 flew at the end of June 1926, but crashed following an inverted spin on its first flight. This was found to be due to problems with the aircraft's centre of gravity, which were resolved by modifying the tailplane.
Operational history
The first Type 121s were delivered to Chile in November 1926, partly equipping the Groupo Mixto de Aviación 1, with deliveries continuing until October 1927. Several were lost in accidents, with at least one losing its wing in flight, but it remained in service when the Chilean Air Force was formed from the air components of the Chilean Army and Navy, finally being retired in 1934.

The Journal of the Canadian Dental Association (JCDA) is a bimonthly peer-reviewed dental journal published by the Canadian Dental Association. It is more commonly referred to by its web address JCDA.ca, owing to its evolution into a print and electronic based knowledge network.
History
Published dental literature in Canada was first produced by Dr. W.H. Elliot of Montreal, PQ who published 18 papers in the American Dental Journal starting in 1842. In the 1850s there were several attempts to create a Canadian dental journal (the Family Dentist from Brockville and Journal of the Times from Halifax) but none lasted very long.
In 1868, Dr. W. George Beers of Montreal ("the father of lacrosse") published the Canadian Journal of Dental Science. Dr. Beers later moved to Hamilton, Ontario where he recruited Dr. Curtis Chittenden (a founder of the Ontario Dental Association) as an associate editor. The journal struggled and eventually failed in 1879.
Dr. Beers, returned to Montreal where, in 1889, he launched the Dominion Dental Journal 10 years after the failure of his previous journal. The Dominion Dental Journal became Canada's preeminent dental journal and persisted for more than 46 years. In 1935, it was absorbed by the newly created Journal of the Canadian Dental Association and joined with La Revue dentaire canadienne, a French language dental journal that had been founded in 1915 under the editorship of Honoré Thibault.
JCDA has been published since that time in both English and French.
The modern journal
The modern JCDA has transformed into a network of knowledge delivery vehicles. The printed journal still exists but it is one piece of a system that includes the JCDA.ca website, the JCDA Clinical Q&A blogs, the JCDA Oasis mobile platform and social media bulletins through email (JCDA Express and JCDA Bulletin), Twitter (JCDATweets & JCDAClinicalQA), Facebook and LinkedIn.
Impact
In the 2012 Journal Citation Reports, JCDA had an impact factor of 0.624. JCDA is indexed in Medline, Journal Citation Reports and Science Citation Index.
Publication Model
JCDA has a continuous publication model, where articles are published to JCDA.ca before, or in place, of being published in the printed journal. The printed journal is distributed to all dentists and dental students in Canada as well some colleagues outside of Canada.
Major Delivery Networks
Core Sections of JCDA (print & web)
JCDA has three core sections of material.
Research; A scholarly section of publications that has been peer-reviewed by at least 2 external examiners and consists of information that is novel to the dental literature.
Clinical Dentistry; A clinically focused section in user friendly formats such as case reports, "point-of-care" and diagnostic challenges. Some of the material will be peer-reviewed while others will be informative/opinion pieces.
News & Issues; A section dedicated to the news and issues from the Canadian Dental Association and/or the provincial dental societies.
JCDA Oasis
JCDA Oasis was launched in 2011 to create an area for collaboratively edited content, in the Web 2.0 spirit, where rapid publication, dissemination and open dialogue between contributors and readers are pillars of process. JCDA involves organizations (e.g. Organization for Safety, Asepsis and Prevention), industry partners and dentists (e.g. Coronation Dental Specialty Group) to create content then it is opened to discussion with readers. There are three core sections.
Oasis Discussions; Launched in 2012, Oasis Discussions (previously named Clinical Q&A) is an open forum for discussion of clinical cases, in a blog format with multi-media presentations. Oasis Discussions is hosted at OasisDiscussions.ca. Each week, volunteer specialists from across Canada & the US post open ended questions and research on case management and "hot" topics, the goal of which is to foster lively discussions between professionals.
Oasis Mobile; A resource created through a collaborative effort of dentists and other professionals from across Canada to offer an "Online Advice and Searchable Information System"; OASIS. The site offers concise clinical information and decision supports for everyday practice. The broad categories of information are medical conditions, prescription drugs and dental & medical emergencies
Case Conferences; Webinar discussions of specific clinical cases.
Other Sections

Hedwig Rosenbaum (3 July 1864 – 31 July 1939), née Hedwig Austerlitz, from 1909 on Hedwig Raabe, in Czech from 1945 (sic!) on referred as Hedwiga Rosenbaumová, was a tennis player who was attributed to represent Bohemia. She won two bronze medals in tennis at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, in the women's singles and the mixed doubles with Great Britain's Archibald Warden. She was the first woman to represent Bohemia at the Olympics.
Hedwig Rosenbaum was of German-Jewish origin and lived in Prague all her life. She belonged to the first generation in Prague to play tennis. At least since 1894 she played in singles, doubles and mixed tournaments in Cisleithania and Germany for the Prague Lawn Tennis Club. In 1899 Rosenbaum was number 5 on the Austrian national list. In the same year she won a tournament in Berlin.
In 1900, Rosenbaum took part in the second Summer Olympics in Paris as a private individual from Prague at her own expense for travel, accommodation and entry fees. She belonged neither to the Bohemian nor the Czech nor to the Austrian delegation. Rosenbaum was the first woman ever to represent Bohemia and Austria-Hungary at the Olympics, winning two bronze medals. In the individual tennis competition, she lost in the semifinals to eventual silver medalist Yvonne Prévost in straight sets 6–1, 6–1. In the mixed competition she played together with Briton Archibald Warden. The two were beaten in the semifinals, their second game. They lost to Prévost from France and Harold Mahony from Britain in straight sets 6–3, 6–0. The qualification of both pairs is attributed to mixed teams in Olympic history.
In 1904 she won the title at the Bohemian championships and finished second at the Austrian championships. After that she withdrew from tournament sports due to age.
Hedwig Rosenbaum had been managing director and board member of the Club of German Female Artists in Prague (Klub deutscher Künstlerinnen in Prag) since it was founded in 1905. During World War I, Hedwig Raabe worked as a nurse. She was temporarily employed in the publishing house of her nephew Heinrich Mercy Jr. and ran a handicraft shop from 1921. She translated sports books, plays and fiction from English into German for Prague newspapers and German publishers.

It has been shown to be independent of the standard axiomatic system of set theory known as ZFC: showed that the statement can neither be proven nor disproven from those axioms, assuming ZF is consistent.
(Suslin is also sometimes written with the French transliteration as , from the Cyrillic .)
Formulation
Suslin's problem asks: Given a non-empty totally ordered set R with the four properties
R does not have the least nor the greatest element;
the order on R is dense (between any two distinct elements there is another);
the order on R is complete, in the sense that every non-empty bounded subset has a supremum and an infimum; and
every collection of mutually disjoint non-empty open intervals in R is countable (this is the countable chain condition for the order topology of R),
is R necessarily order-isomorphic to the real line R?
If the requirement for the countable chain condition is replaced with the requirement that R contains a countable dense subset (i.e., R is a separable space), then the answer is indeed yes: any such set R is necessarily order-isomorphic to R (proved by Cantor).
The condition for a topological space that every collection of non-empty disjoint open sets is at most countable is called the Suslin property.
Implications
Any totally ordered set that is not isomorphic to R but satisfies properties 1–4 is known as a Suslin line. The Suslin hypothesis says that there are no Suslin lines: that every countable-chain-condition dense complete linear order without endpoints is isomorphic to the real line. An equivalent statement is that every tree of height ω1 either has a branch of length ω1 or an antichain of cardinality .
The generalized Suslin hypothesis says that for every infinite regular cardinal κ every tree of height κ either has a branch of length κ or an antichain of cardinality κ. The existence of Suslin lines is equivalent to the existence of Suslin trees and to Suslin algebras.
The Suslin hypothesis is independent of ZFC.
and independently used forcing methods to construct models of ZFC in which Suslin lines exist. Jensen later proved that Suslin lines exist if the diamond principle, a consequence of the axiom of constructibility V = L, is assumed. (Jensen's result was a surprise, as it had previously been conjectured that V = L implies that no Suslin lines exist, on the grounds that V = L implies that there are "few" sets.) On the other hand, used forcing to construct a model of ZFC without Suslin lines; more precisely, they showed that Martin's axiom plus the negation of the continuum hypothesis implies the Suslin hypothesis.
The Suslin hypothesis is also independent of both the generalized continuum hypothesis (proved by Ronald Jensen) and of the negation of the continuum hypothesis. It is not known whether the generalized Suslin hypothesis is consistent with the generalized continuum hypothesis; however, since the combination implies the negation of the square principle at a singular strong limit cardinal—in fact, at all singular cardinals and all regular successor cardinals—it implies that the axiom of determinacy holds in L(R) and is believed to imply the existence of an inner model with a superstrong cardinal.

Climacostomum virens is a species of unicellular ciliate protists. It is one of just two formally described species in the genus Climacostomum.
Description
[[File:Climacostomum virens from Kahl.jpg|thumb|left|170 px|Climacostomum virens, from Alfred Kahl, 1932]]Climacostomum virens has a flexible but non-contractile body, long, roughly ovoid or harp-shaped, and flattened from back to front. It has a large posterior contractile vacuole, and a characteristic posterior indentation, or dimple, that is more pronounced in underfed individuals. The posterior vacuole surrounds the cytoproct (anus), through which food waste is eliminated. The macronucleus of Climacostomum virens is normally long and wormlike (vermiform).
The cell's most prominent feature is its large oral apparatus, which occupies most of the anterior region. This structure features an adoral zone of membranelles (AZM) partly encircling a wide buccal cavity (mouth), which opens into the cytopharyngeal pouch where digestive vacuoles are formed before they travel down a distinctive long, bent tube into the body of the cell.
Members of the species are normally green, because of symbiotic algae (zoochlorellae) that live in the cytoplasm. When individuals are grown in the dark, these algal endosymbionts are reduced in number and the cytoplasm may appear colorless.
Classification
The species Climacostomum virens was first described in 1833 by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, under the name Spirostomum virens. In 1859, Samuel Friedrich von Stein moved Spirostomum virens to a new genus, which he named Climacostomum. In his Manual of Infusoria (1880), William Saville-Kent rejected Stein's genus, assigning the species instead to Leucophrys patula, which he described as synonymous with Ehrenberg's Spirostomum virens and Leucophrys patula, as well as the Trichoda patula'' of O.F. Muller. However, the genus was retained by later researchers, including Alfred Kahl.

Taalaibek Baryktabasovich Omuraliev (, ; born 2 May 1965) is a Kyrgyz major general and a former Minister of Defense of Kyrgyzstan. He also served briefly as the Chief of the General Staff twice.
Early life and education
He was born in Naryn on May 2, 1965. From 1982-1986, he was a student at the Alma-Ata Higher All-Arms Command School named after Marshal Ivan Konev. He graduated from the Combined Arms Academy of the Russian Armed Forces in 2000 and in 2009, the Russian General Staff Military Academy.
Career
He was among the many soldiers from the Kyrgyz SSR to have served as part of the Limited Contingent of Soviet Troops in Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.
Between September 1986 and October 2005, he commanded various units in the Soviet Army and the Kyrgyz Army, including Scorpion 25th Special Forces Brigade. He also was a regimental commander in the 8th Guards Motor Rifle Panfilov Division and the Transbaikal Military District. During the Tajikistani Civil War, he commanded a joint border battalion that served in protecting the Afghanistan–Tajikistan border. In 1995, being named the commander of a high ranking, he took part in official events held in Paris on the occasion of the golden jubilee of the Victory in World War II on behalf of the Ministry of Defense. In the summer and autumn of 1999, Omuraliev was directly involved in the Batken Conflict and operations against the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. After serving at border posts in the Frontier Force and a special forces unit from Tokmok, he became the deputy head of the Bishkek Higher Military School of the Armed Forces of the Kyrgyz Republic (now the Military Institute of the Armed Forces of the Kyrgyz Republic), which he would remain as until March 2006.
Higher positions
In November 2009, he was appointed the Commander of the Southern Group of Forces of the Kyrgyz Army. From July 2010 to December 2011, he was the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. It was in this position that he led the army's response to the South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes. On December 26, 2011, Omuraliev was appointed Minister of Defense by president Almazbek Atambayev. He would keep that job until April 4, 2014 being succeeded by Abibilla Kudayberdiev. He was reappointed as Chief of the General Staff by President Sooronbay Jeenbekov during the 2020 Kyrgyzstan protests, replacing General Rayimberdi Duishenbiev. After President Sadyr Japarov order the recreation of the Defence Ministry, Omuraliev was appointed on 3 February 2021 to the post of Defence Minister in the cabinet of Ulukbek Maripov, the first since 2014.
Criminal investigations
In 2014, the Military Prosecutor's Office inspected the distribution of service apartments to servicemen of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff. Based on its results, charges were brought against Omuraliev under the articles abuse of power, forgery and negligence. In December 2017, the Birinchi May District Court issued a court decision to strip him of his rank of general and impose a large fine. In June 2017, the Judicial Collegium for Criminal Cases of the Bishkek City Court revised the previous court decision and restored his rank.

The concept of minimal infective dose (MID) has traditionally been used for bacteria that contaminate foods that cause infection in or from the digestive tract. MID was defined as the number of bacteria ingested (the dose) from which a pathology is observed in the consumer. Examples such as this are found in textbooks: to cause gastrointestinal disorders, the food must contain more than 100,000 Salmonella per gram. However, in such a formulation, we immediately see an inaccuracy: to know the dose ingested, concentration is not enough. It is also necessary to know the mass of the portion:
d\ =\ c \times m
where:
d = number of bacteria i.e. dose
c = concentration of bacteria
m = mass
Nevertheless, this formulation has served as a basis for reasoning to establish the maximum concentrations permitted by the microbiological regulatory criteria intended to protect the health of consumers. Thus in 1992, as the outbreaks previously caused by Listeria monocytogenes involved only food containing more than 1000 L. monocytogenes cells per gram, lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic - keeping a margin of safety - fixed its maximum concentration at 100 L. monocytogenes per gram.
Dose-effect relationship and dose-response relationship
The concept of a dose-response relationship developed from 1995 onward, as quantitative risk assessment matured as a discipline within the field of food safety.
An infectious bacterium in a food can cause various effects: diarrhea, vomiting, sepsis, meningitis, abortion, Guillain-Barré syndrome, death, etc. As the dose increases, the severity of the pathological effects increases, and a "dose-effect relationship" can often be established. For example, the higher the dose of Salmonella, the more diarrhea occurs soon after ingestion and the more stressful it is.
However, among people who have ingested the same dose, not all are affected. The proportion of people affected is called the response. The dose-response relationship for a given effect (e.g., diarrhea) is therefore the relationship between the dose and the likelihood of experiencing this effect. When the response is less than about 10%, it is observed that there is a strictly proportional relationship between dose and response:
P\ \approx\ r \times d
where:
P = probability of the effect considered
r = response
The dose-effect relationship and the dose-response relationship should not be confused.
Consequences
The existence of this relation has a first important consequence: the proportionality factor, symbolized by the letter r, corresponds precisely to the probability of the effect considered when the dose is equal to one bacterial cell. As a result, the minimum infective dose is exactly equal to one bacterial cell: this is far from the traditional notion mentioned at the beginning of this article.
Proportionality has a second consequence, which is obvious: when the dose is divided by ten, the probability of observing the effect is also divided by ten.
There is a third consequence, which is not so obvious: it is a relationship without threshold. Of course, if a portion of food does not contain the bacterium, there will be no effect. But in industrial practice, everything is done to reduce the probability that a serving contains the bacterium. There is therefore on the market food in which, for example, only one serving in a hundred is contaminated. The probability of the effect considered is then r / 100. If one in ten thousand is contaminated, the probability goes to r / 10,000, and so on. The line representing the relation can be extended towards zero: there is no threshold.
If the probability of not being infected when exposed to one bacterium is then the probability of not being infected by bacteria would be so the probability of being infected is
For readers familiar with the notion of D50 (the dose that causes the effect in 50% of consumers exposed to the hazard), in most cases the following relationship thus applies:
D50\ =\ -Ln(0.50)\ / \ r\ \approx 0.7\ / \ r
Comparisons
To compare the dose-response relationships for different effects caused by the same bacterium, or for the same effect caused by different bacteria, we can of course directly compare the values of r. However, experience shows that it may be easier for the mind to compare the doses causing the effect in 50% or 1% of consumers. Here are some values of D1 (dose causing the effect considered in 1% of consumers exposed to the hazard):
Escherichia coli (EHEC), haemolytic-uremic syndrome in children under 6 years: 8.4 bacterial cells;
Escherichia coli (EHEC), haemolytic-uraemic syndrome in children aged 6 to 14 years: 41.9 bacterial cells;
Listeria monocytogenes, severe listeriosis in the general population: 4.2x1011 bacterial cells;
Listeria monocytogenes, severe listeriosis in the susceptible population: 9.5x109 bacterial cells.
These examples highlight two important things:
D1 and r depend not only on the bacterium and the effect considered, but also on the belonging to categories of consumers susceptible to the disease; therefore, there are as many dose-response curves as there are pathogens, health effects and sensitivities of exposed individuals;
For the bacteria of the examples above, the orders of magnitude of the values of D1 are profoundly different. The hygiene practices and control measures that food chain businesses must implement against these bacteria are therefore not comparable.
Risk management
It may seem that if the contamination of food with a pathogenic bacterium is low and infrequent, the risk of becoming ill is such that there will be no public health problem. Such a view is incomplete: admittedly, consuming a low dose of this bacterium is associated with a low probability of disease. But this probability is not zero. This explains the sporadic cases observed in the population. And that is also why there is no concentration in food below which there will be no epidemic.
Toxigenic bacteria
Some food-borne bacteria can cause disease by producing toxins, rather than infection. Some synthesize a toxin only when their concentration in the food before ingestion exceeds a threshold. This is the case of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, for example. The concept of MID does not apply to them, but there is indeed a concentration (not a dose) below which they do not constitute a danger to the health of the consumer.

The Wernau Clay Pit is a nature conservation area in Wernau, Baden-Würtemberg, Germany established by the Stuttgart Regional Commission on April 15, 1986 (NSG 1.143).
Location and purpose of protection
The 5.5 hectare (ha) conservation area is located southeast of Wernau at an elevation of 310 to 320 meters above sea level and belongs to the nature preserve area of Schlierbacher Platte in the central foreland area of the Swabian Jura mountains. It is classified as a secondary biotope (it was not formed naturally, but from a man-made biotope) with an advanced ecological succession containing wet and dry areas, slopes and water surfaces. The former clay pit is ecologically a very valuable, re-naturalized, near-urban area.
The Wernau Clay Pit is also an important environment for various endangered animals, especially for some regionally endangered amphibians, birds and insects in Baden-Württemberg. It provides a habitat for amphibians like the water frog, common frog, common toad, smooth newt and the yellow-bellied toad, and for birds like the yellowhammer, European greenfinch, European serin, Eurasian blackcap, dunnock, Eurasian wren, common chiffchaff and the white wagtail. Particularly noteworthy is the aquatic insect fauna, like the water scorpion, backswimmers, water scavenger beetle and the larvae of several different types of dragonflies.
Since 1986, the Swabian Jura Association in Wernau has been the custodian of the nature conservation area.

Anatoli Mikhailovich Granovsky (Russian: Анатолий Михайлович Грановский, 25 January 1922 – 4 September 1974) was a NKVD agent who defected to the West in 1946 and authored an autobiographical book about his career in Soviet intelligence. Granovsky was the son of a high-ranking Soviet bureaucrat, Mikhail Granovsky, who was a victim of the Stalinist Purges of the late 1930s. To find his father in the Soviet Gulag system, Granovsky allowed himself to be arrested by the NKVD on false charges and interred in the same penal system. As a result of his past friendships with the children of his father's high-ranking former colleagues, Granovsky was recruited as an NKVD agent to spy on those same acquaintances in July 1939. After defecting to Sweden in autumn 1946, Granovsky wrote the book I Was an NKVD Agent.
Early life
Granovsky was born in Ukraine in January 1922. After his father was arrested by the OGPU on November 6, 1937, Granovsky's mother and siblings lived in social isolation and abject poverty, shunned by their neighbors in their Moscow apartment building. Though at first unable to find work, the teenage Granovsky was eventually employed as a turner's assistant in March 1938. In May, however, he was repeatedly questioned by the NKVD about his supervisor. The NKVD apparently wondered why the supervisor would give a job to the son of a man accused of crimes against the State. As a result of the interrogations Granovsky was fired, and in October 1938, his family moved from the apartment building to a room in a ramshackle house.
Joining the NKVD
On January 27, 1939, Anatoli Granovsky loitered slowly around Lenin's mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square and told a plainclothes NKVD officer that he wished to be taken to the local GUGB chief. Placed in Butyrka prison under deplorable conditions, Granovsky was interrogated repeatedly, often being beaten. He was forced sign his name on blank sheets of paper, later to find his "confession" typed above it. On the night of April 20, 1939, Granovsky was transferred to a comfortable cell in Lubianka Prison in Moscow. After indirectly denouncing his father, Granovsky was recruited into the NKVD on July 20, 1939, to spy on his acquaintances among his father's former colleagues. Following the horrifying conditions of the prisons, Granovsky was immediately given money, a salary, and exemplary treatment, including medical operations to undo the effects of illness and injury borne on him by the interrogations and imprisonment.
NKVD Operations
Anatoli Granovsky underwent numerous intensive trainings as an NKVD agent, and was assigned to the army as a cover, serving as an officer in Anti-Aircraft Defense in Moscow. During this time he worked as an NKVD counter-intelligence agent, reporting individuals for corruption or other misuse of State resources. He remained in Moscow during the German invasion of the USSR and met a young woman named Shura during the aftermath of a German bombing raid, quickly becoming infatuated with her. They began a relationship together, with Shura eventually revealed as a fellow NKVD agent. The relationship continued until Granovsky was informed of Shura's death.
As the Soviets went on the offensive in the second half of the war, Granovsky was trained and prepared for an operation to provide false information to the Germans: He would parachute into German territory with other Russian soldiers and then (unbeknownst to his fellows) kill them, surrendering to the Germans as a disillusioned Russian defector, allowing him to deliver misinformation.
The mission never occurred, and Granovsky instead worked with Soviet and Soviet-allied guerillas behind German lines in eastern Europe as an assassin and saboteur, causing havoc.
In spring 1945, Granovsky was assigned to begin preparing to infiltrate the West after the end of World War II, particularly the United States, by posing as a refugee with his wife, an alcoholic restaurateur whom he was to seduce and marry. The woman was eventually deemed an unreliable liability and Granovsky was reassigned to the military front.
When Berlin fell, Granovsky was one of the NKVD men who appropriated files and supplies from the Gestapo and other German agencies and sites, including the Reich Chancellery, transferring such resources back to Moscow and Kiev. Granovsky was appalled at the conditions he saw upon Germany's defeat, especially the treatment of both Germans and captured Russians and eastern Europeans at the hands of the triumphant Soviet military: Germans were beaten and raped and Soviet P.O.W.s were often tyrannized and sent to labour camps for surrendering during the course of the war.
Post-World War II
Granovsky was reassigned to appear as a sympathetic Soviet war veteran "fighter-poet" on tour in London, getting acquainted with the West and spreading pro-Soviet propaganda.
Later, working in Prague, Granovsky was charged with helping ensure de-Nazification and the reliability of the local Communist Party and police apparatus.
Defection
Granovsky, after working in eastern Europe, was reassigned a new cover as a member of the Merchant Navy in summer 1946. In Odessa Granovsky had been approached by the MGB, successor to the NKVD, and asked to be their spy aboard the ship Petrodvorets, with which he would rendezvous in Stockholm after traveling aboard another ship. On July 10, 1946, Granovsky arrived in Stockholm. On July 21, he slipped away from his colleagues in a crowd and went to see the assistant U.S. Military Attache. Because he could not speak English and the American could not speak Russian, they went to the supervisory Military Attache, a colonel who spoke German (in which Granovsky was experienced).
The Americans refused to grant Granovsky asylum and he was arrested by Swedish authorities. On November 8, 1946, shortly before he was to be repatriated to Soviet authorities, which was a veritable death sentence, Granovsky was granted asylum by King Gustaf V of Sweden.
Granovsky wrote his memoirs under the title All Pity Choked [London 1955], but later paperback editions were published under the title I Was An NKVD Agent.
After moving to the United States, he died in Washington, D.C. in September 1974 at the age of 52.

The Sight is a young adult fantasy novel written by British author David Clement-Davies. It is the first novel in The Sight series, with its sequel Fell taking place after. It follows a pack of wolves cursed by a lone wolf, Morgra, whose powers foretell the destiny of one of the mother wolf's pups: Larka, a white wolf gifted with a mysterious power known as The Sight. The story follows Larka's life as she is burdened with pain and terror that comes with the prophecy, as well as seeing the viewpoints of Larka's parents, Huttser and Palla, and her adoptive brother Kar.
Written in 2002, Clement-Davies's was inspired to write The Sight after experiencing Romania in winter of 1990, and was inspired by superstition and folklore, such as Dracula.
The Sight is the first within its own series that follows the wolf pack, but is also implied to be set in the same setting as Fire Bringer, Clement-Davies debut novel.
Plot Introduction
A wolf pack seeks shelter beneath the shadow of an abandoned castle. The she-wolf, Palla, is ready to give birth but fears for their survival against the harsh winter of Transylvania. However, a more dangerous threat comes from a lone wolf named Morgra, who possesses a mysterious and terrifying power known as the Sight. Accompanying her is a raven named Kraar, who feeds on the dead. Morgra's powers foretells the destiny of one of Palla's pups; to possess a power greater than Morgras and potentially have the ability to control the world and the one's to come. Despite Morgra's eerie prophecy, the pack remains undaunted and are willing to do whatever it takes to protect each other. Even it means battling against all nature, the dead and the one creature wolves fear the most — Man.
Characters
Larka is the main character and, like Morgra, has the Sight. At first she is terrified, but as the story progresses she learns to control her power. Because of Morgra's "curse" all her packmates dies except her mother, father, her brother (who in the middle of the book fell through the ice on a river and then lost his memory), and her best friend Kar. She has a pure white pelt and gold eyes. Larka dies alongside Morgra after plummeting from a height and into rocks below, a death of which she foresaw, which greatly distresses her family - especially Fell and Kar. Larka and Kar realised they were in love later in the book when Kar brought Larka back from The Searchers. Without Kar, Larka would've died without completing her mission. She longed to have Cubs with him and start a pack of their own, but died before this could happen and appeared in Kar's dream. Her parents, Huttser and Palla, name grey cub from their next litter after Larka.
Fell is Larka's brother. He has a pure black pelt with yellow eyes with a sliver of green in the right eye. As a pup he pretended he was scared of nothing as a show of courage; he also proved to be a troublemaker and would often tease Kar. He was also jealous of the attention Larka have Kar. After Fell fell through the ice, he was found by Morgra and brainwashed to make him believe he was Wolfbane. Larka brought him back to believe in who he really was and help bring about the Vision. Fell also has the Sight, although this is not clearly stated until Larka confronts him in Harja. After the events of the story, Fell leaves the pack and makes his own journey alone to find his sense of self.His journey is continued in the book Fell.
Morgra is the main antagonist. She possesses the Sight, and is Palla's half sister. She was believed of being a pup killer, which was an accusation brought about by a tragic misunderstanding revealed to the pack by Brassa. Her Helper, a bird companion that helps any wolf with the Sight learn to see through the eyes of birds, is a raven named Kraar. Morgra desired to fulfill the prophecy and bring about the Vision herself to become the Man-Varg. She died by falling off a cliff with Larka, failing to complete her mission.
Huttser is Larka and Fell's father and Dragga of the pack. He is described as a large silver wolf with reddish flecks in his tail. His sister is Kipcha. Huttser is a proud and strong wolf who proves to be a capable leader and fighter. He maintains a shaky relationship with Kar, who he adamantly rejects for being weak and not one of his own, but the two eventually are able to make up and recognise each other as father and son. Palla is his mate whom he loves. He often thanked the wolf gods, Tor and Fenris, for the fact Palla chose him to be her mate and said she was the most brave and beautiful she wolf he ever saw.
Palla is Huttser's mate, and the Drappa of the pack. She is Morgra's half sister, and has a brother named Skop. Though the books do not mention her main fur color, it is said that she has a long, slim muzzle and bushy silver ears. Palla in herself is a strong fighter but also a loving mother, who is filled with despair when she believes Fell has died and even blamed Huttser for his death. Palla is heartbroken when Larka dies. Palla is also the mother of Khaz II, Skop II, Larka II and Kipcha II, who are named after the deceased members of her pack.
Kar is an orphan who accompanies Skop to the main pack, and is then left with them when Skop leaves to join the rebel pack. He and Larka are extremely close friends, and intended to also become mates before Larka's demise. Kar was initially subjected to Fell's teasing but the two recognised each other as brothers later in life. He is described as looking as a true Dragga, but often is shown to be slightly cowardly and more of a Sikla(omega). He had two brothers who were taken and killed by Morgra. He has a dark grey pelt. At first Huttser didn't have much patience for Kar but they eventually got closer. Palla was gentle with him, considering him a replacement for her unnamed Cubs, who died when Larka and Fell were born. Once Larka died, Kar was heartbroken and effected the most, alongside Fell.
Brassa is the pack's oldest member. She was the nurse who raised Palla and Skop as pups. She knew of Morgra's innocence in the pup killing, but said nothing to defend her as she still believed Morgra could pose a risk. She dies of a lump in her stomach, brought on by the guilt of her lie and its ties to the legend.
Khaz is the Beta, or second-in-command. He is described as having gray fur with a red bushy tail, and has the second strongest jaws in the pack. He falls into a wolf pit later in the book, due to being baited in by a big raw chunk of meat hanging from a branch above a clutter of leaf covered sticks above the pit (commonly known as a hunters pit fall trap), laden with spikes at the bottom, and dies due to a spike piercing his chest. During his final moments he speaks his last words mainly to Kipcha, who he was going to possibly (though he already did) mate with for cubs; after his tragic death, Kipcha is left in a deep state of what seemed to be depression.
Bran (wolf) is the pack's Sikla(omega), or weakest member. He is very skittish and often backs away from confrontations. However, he fights off a group of the Night Hunters to save his pack, later dying from the wounds he had sustained in the process. He had a distinctive smudge of black around his right eye.
Kipcha is the sister of Huttser. She mates with Khaz secretly, but she and her unborn pups die as she is smashed against a rock when she falls into a river. It is implied that she purposefully lets herself die when swept in the river, likely absorbed with grief from Khaz's death as well.
Skart, a steppe eagle, is Tsarr's Helper and mentor. When Larka was trapped in the fire, Skart saved her life by showing her a way out of the flames. He then becomes Larka's Helper as well as Tsarr's. Skart is an extremely proud and somewhat haughty animal, but proves to often be kind and helpful to Larka. Larka later discovers that Skart had known about Fell believing he was Wolfbane all along, and likely did not tell Larka due to the weight of the news.
Skop is Palla's brother and also the one that brought Kar to the pack, but then left in search for the Rebels. He couldn't find the Rebels, and after a few years, found a lone wolf in a cave and pleaded for food and shelter, while carrying the burden of a large wound on his side. He soon found out that the lone wolf is none other than Kar. He ends up slowly passing away.
Slavka is the leader of the rebel wolves. She was forced to kill her own cubs when she was younger as humans were about to invade her home, leading to her fiery need for revenge and bitterness, when she meets Huttser and Palla. Originally completely anti-superstition, after she met Larka she began to believe in the power of the Sight. Morgra gained control of her after she released the Searchers, spirits of the dead. After Morgra and Larka died, Morgra's power over Slavka was lost and Slavka approached Huttser, Palla, Kar and Fell for forgiveness and the latter accepted her into their pack. It is consistently noted that Slavka looks strikingly similar to Larka, due to a similar coat, but Slavka has shades of grey and more scars.
Tsarr is Larka's mentor. He is an old wolf who had the Sight, but it has since faded. He helped Jarla to steal the human child. It was his idea for the child to ride on wolves' backs such as Tsarr's back after realizing he's too heavy to carry in their mouths. Tsarr was one of the main wolves to protect and raise him. Tsarr died trying to rescue the baby from Morgra, and failed. He was very close to Bran. His Helper is Skart.
Tsinga is Brassa's sister. Brassa and Tsinga had a falling out as young wolves. Tsinga is a fortune teller who lives on her own in the Valley of Shadows. She is blind and feared by others. The pack seek her out to help Larka with the Sight and to tell them how to escape Morgra's curse.
Bran (human) is the human child that was stolen from his family and is used for Larka, and the Sight. He is named after Bran the wolf. Jarla, Tsarr, and Larka all died for the human cub so he can live. This human child was found by the wolves, except for Morgra. After Tsarr failed to save Bran, it was Huttser who rescued him, and brought the child on his back, to safety. In the end, Fell brought Bran back to his home. Fell knew that the child wasn't happy saying good bye, but Fell knew he had to.
Jarla is a grey wolf who suckled Bran at first. Then she was killed by Rebels and passed the duty on to Larka.
Morgra and the Pup
A vixen was rooting around the den one day. Morgra was the only one who saw it, and so grabbed a pup to save it from the vixen. However, in her panic she bit down too hard and snapped it's neck. When Morgra went to bury it, the pack found her and accused her of stealing and killing it. She was exiled from the pack. Later, it was revealed that Brassa was the only one in the pack who witnessed the event but did not stand up for her as she believed Morgra could still pose a risk. Rumour was that Morgra felt bitter that she couldn't have pups of her own, so she stole a pup from her own pack. After tasting a fellow wolf's blood, it was said that a wolf couldn't get enough and so kept killing its own.
The Searchers
The Searchers are the ghosts of wolves that have died. They can be summoned by the Summoning Howl, which can only be used by one with the power of the Sight. If the Searchers touch a living wolf, then that wolf can have its mind read and controlled by the one that used the Summoning Howl. The Searchers are neither good nor evil, but they have to do what the Summoner commands. These wolves are found in the "Red Meadow" that can only be reached when a wolf who possesses the Sight makes a kill, sleeps, and then calls Fenris's name (a Varg god). Once that has been done they can walk the pathways of death, but there is a chance that they might not be able to return.
The Balkar
The Balkar (also called "Night Hunters") are a group of Draggas, or alpha male wolves, who do Morgra's bidding. They are vicious and will do anything their leader asks of them (though not always without some uncertainty about it) even if it will lead them to their own death. Before, they were led by Tratto, a great Dragga who let all wolves live in peace and freedom, who then was murdered by Morgra, who fed him lies in his old age.
Eventually, his blessing, known as Tratto's Blessing which permitted wolves to enter other wolves' territory, was changed into Larka's Blessing for all she did Harja.
Sight
The Sight is a power that very few wolves have, and it is difficult to control. It is believed by some that the true power of the Sight is to heal one's mind and body. Only a very small amount is known about the Sight, and most wolves consider it to be a myth. Wolves who have the gift of the Sight have potential to have these powers:
The ability to see though the eyes of Lera (wild animals) and feel their pain when hunting them.
The ability to look into water and see visions of the past, present and future.
The ability to talk to birds and to see through the eyes of a bird. (Goes with the first power)
To bring forth the Vision by looking through the eyes of a human at the citadel of Harja and enslave all the Lera to their will.
To howl to the Searchers/Fenris, and either summon them to do one's bidding, or enter the Red Meadow (or field of the dead) and speak with the dead, summoning them with fresh meat from a recent kill.
The ability to look into the eyes of other Lera and control their will.
A telekinetic power used to throw physical items or creatures, or hold them in place.

Maura Bhuidhe "Bwee" O'Leary (or Yellow Mary O'Leary, Máire Bhuí Ní Laoire) (1774–1848) was an Irish poet born in County Cork, Ireland, who became a popular folk icon in the province of Munster in nineteenth century Ireland.
O'Leary's work was passed on for many generations purely by oral tradition. Her poetry, while it was sung or recited, is recognized as an early form of the spoken word art form. She was unknown to the English-speaking world, but a minority of Gaelic-speaking and Gaelic-reading Irish people kept her voice alive for almost a hundred years until it was documented.
In the early 20th century, Father Donagh O'Donoghue compiled and published a book of O'Leary's poetry in Gaelic titled the "Filiocht Mhaire Bhuidhe Ni Laoghaire". It was later translated into English by Fr. Sean Sweeney of the Society of African Missions and Fr. Richard P. Burke of the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts. The title translates to "The Poetry of Maura Bwee O'Leary" and was first published in 1931, with a second printing in 1933 and finally in 1950.
A passage is devoted to O'Leary in Robert Welch's Oxford Companion to Irish Literature, 1996 Edition; and a second book, Songs of An Irish Poet: The Mary O'Leary Story by Brian Brennan which is available on Google Books.
O'Leary clan
The O'Leary's were a clan or sept from the region of Corca Laoighe (Curk-a-Lee) in West Cork. The invading Normans forced them north to the River Lee where they settled on a territory known as the land of the O'Leary's. At Carrignacurra, Carrignageelagh and at Dromcarra, they built three castles.
Maura O'Leary was the first of eight children born to Dermot Bwee and his wide Siobhan (Joanna). She was raised in Tureenanane on 50 acres of land, but eloped with Seamus Burke (de Burca) in 1792. Burke, from Skibbereen, came from a family of soldiers but was a horse dealer by trade. They married in Inchigeelagh and bought a farm in Avnagh Beg Island where they raised six sons and three daughters.
Inspiration
The war of 1641–53 decimated Ireland's population as Protestant England broke the power of the Irish lordships in an effort to "civilize" and Anglicize Catholic Ireland. Over time it became forbidden to speak the Gaelic language but early poets such as O'Leary kept it alive.
Maura (Mary) was known as "Yellow Mary" because of her sallow complexion. A woman of the people, she understood the hardships around her and composed poetic songs to express the troubles and lift the spirits of her generation. Laments, love songs, songs of devotion and mourning, ballads of drinking songs, merriment and keening verses were all within her work and vision. While O'Leary was unable to read or write, her songs were sung at markets, at fairs and around campfires. As her songs were sung only in Gaelic, she was part of a group of Irish poets in the region who kept the language alive during the period before the Great Famine of the 1840s.
Death
O'Leary died in 1848 in Gougane Barra where a stone now stands next to the church to commemorate her life and work.
Work
O'Leary used words to vent the ongoing threat of the English:
"I'll cease from verse-making; old age is creeping;
The big-bellied beasts, my heart hates to the core;
No more shall I say, then - may that not relieve them -
But havoc and quaking is dogging their door!"
"On A Sunny Hillside"
To each on the road bring the news that they come!
They're coming in force, powder bullets and gun!
Swift doughty supporters – Louis and Spaniard as one
To Banba's green shore in full hope, by the grace of God's son.
Her work is still taught in schools across Ireland as part of preserving the Gaelic language.
"The Poor Gaels Are Tormented":
When we overhaul them, let nobody talk of
A pint or a quart to put on the score,
But barrels, full tall ones, piled in the hallway,
For thousands of callers, gallons galore!

Juan José Sánchez Maqueda (born 23 January 1969) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a midfielder, and was most recently the manager of Saudi Arabian club Al-Kawkab.
He amassed La Liga totals of 110 matches and six goals over seven seasons, representing mainly Real Madrid. In 2011, he became a manager.
Playing career
Born in Madrid, Maqueda spent 16 years with Real Madrid youth and reserve sides comprised. He made his La Liga debut on 2 January 1988 still not aged 19, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 home win against FC Barcelona. Late in the same month he scored his first goal with the main squad, in a 4–0 victory over Cádiz CF also at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.
Maqueda returned to Real in the summer of 1990, after a season-long loan with CD Logroñés. He contributed 24 games – 19 starts – and one goal in the first year upon his return, but the team ranked in third place. He added three appearances in the European Cup, netting in the 4–1 away defeat of Odense Boldklub on 18 September 1990.
Maqueda spent nearly two years on the sidelines due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury, from which he never fully recovered. After leaving the Merengues, he subsequently played with six clubs in as many years, appearing for Valencia CF and Albacete Balompié in the top flight and having abroad stints with C.D. Irapuato and Panionios FC. He retired in 2000, at 31.
Coaching career
Maqueda spent six years as assistant manager to Juan Ramón López Caro, with the pair being in charge of Real Madrid and Levante UD in the top tier and RC Celta de Vigo in Segunda División. They worked for a few months with FC Vaslui, leaving in October 2010.
Maqueda began working as a head coach in 2011, with Al Ittihad Alexandria Club in Egypt. Two years later, in October, he replaced Ahmad Al-Ajlani at the helm of Saudi Arabian club Al-Shoulla FC.
On 27 May 2014, Maqueda was appointed at Al Fateh SC. He returned to the African nation in December, signing for Al Masry SC.
On 2 November 2019, Maqueda returned to manage Al-Shoulla for a second time. He left the club on 28 June 2020 whilst the season was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cape Air Force Base also known as Fort Glenn Army Air Base, is a site significant for its role in World War II fighting, operating alongside Naval Air Facility Otter Point.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987 as Cape Field at Fort Glenn.
History
Origins
Because of the perceived vulnerability of Alaska immediately following the Pearl Harbor Attack, additional Army Air Corps units were authorized by General Henry H. Arnold for Alaska and plans were made to send modern aircraft to the Territory to replace the obsolete aircraft assigned. However, the Alaskan Air Force had few airfields to accommodate the additional aircraft and units being assigned.
Along with new airfields on the mainland and Southwest Alaska, new air bases were planned for the air defense of the Aleutians to Dutch Harbor. Construction of the new bases on Umnak and Cold Bay began in January 1942 in secret, with construction reportedly disguised as a cannery. Originally, the equipment was supposed to construct McGrath Army Airbase, but the ground had frozen by the time that the equipment arrived. The first United States Army engineers landed at what would become Fort Glenn Army Air Base on 17 January and construction began by the end of the month. A Naval airfield, Naval Air Facility Otter Point, was adjacent to the Army Airbase. The 807th Engineering Battalion (Aviation) was brought in from Yukat to perform the construction along with a detachment of the Navy Seabee 8th Construction Battalion.
Plans called for three hard-surfaced runways (four were eventually built), but time was of the essence in the construction of the base, as the air defense of Dutch Harbor was dependent on them. Instead of a hard surface, engineers chose to use a new material, pierced steel planking (PSP), which could be laid down quickly over a compressed gravel subsurface to provide the airfield with an all-weather capability. 80,000 pieces of matting needed to be barged to the island. Construction crews worked in three shifts, 24 hours a day laying down the runways and constructing a rudimentary support station, water and sewer lines, an electrical grid, communications, fuel and munitions storage sites and all the other necessities to convert a remote island site into an operational airfield capable of supporting heavy bombers. A PSP runway was completed on 5 April although a C-53 was the first plane to land on the field, on 31 March. The main runway was officially opened on 23 May. Fort Glenn's first runway was then the U.S. Army's most westerly airfield in the Aleutian Islands."
The first operational unit, the 11th Fighter Squadron, moved into Fort Glenn with P-40 Warhawk fighters on 26 May from Elmendorf Field. Additional construction continued throughout 1942 with four × runways were completed (06/24, 07/35), two of which (03/21, 04/22) were situated only 10 degrees apart. All runways had four layers of asphalt laid down over the PSP. Two additional emergency landing fields were built, one on the north coast of the island (North Shore) , 9.4 miles north; the other 7.7 miles to the west-southwest of the base near the Tullk Volcano (Pacifier) .
Morrison-Knudsen Construction Company built hundreds of Quonset hut structures on the base, replacing the temporary tents which exposed the construction crews to the sudden storms which swept the island frequently. Housing and messing facilities for 119 officers and 359 men were constructed as well as recreational and service buildings. Storage facilities consisted of 6,975 square feet for general stores and a 150-cubic-foot freezer. Buildings for aircraft included a kodiak-type hangar, x , a squadron warehouse, and a terminal for air transport service. Administration offices were housed in five buildings with a total floor space of 3,850 square feet. Radio facilities included a transmitting station, a direction-finder station, and a radar station, all with separate power houses, and with housing and messing provisions for personnel. The hospital, located in one small building, contained eight beds. The maintenance force of the station was installed in seven buildings. Electric power was provided by three diesel-electric generators.
Aleutian Islands campaign
On 3 June 1942 the Imperial Japanese Navy launched two aircraft carrier raids on the United States Army barracks and the US Navy base at Dutch Harbor on nearby Amaknak Island. The attack was a surprise, but the base been on alert for an attack for many days, although there was no specific warning of the attack before the Japanese planes arrived over Dutch Harbor. The attack signaled the beginning of the Aleutian Islands campaign. In response, the P-40s of the 11th Fighter Squadron from Fort Glenn AAB along with Naval land-based fighters attacked the Japanese aircraft. Eleventh Air Force also dispatched aircraft from Elmendorf Field. In the ensuring battle, the United States Navy lost four PBYs, and Eleventh AF lost one B-17, two B-26s and one LB-30 (B-24A) bombers and two P-40 fighters. The Japanese lost two A6M "Zero" fighters, and possibly a third due to ground anti-aircraft fire. One A6M "Zero", three D3A "Val" dive bombers and one E8N "Dave"reconnaissance seaplane were shot down in aerial combat.
Eleventh Air Force also dispatched B-26 Marauder medium bombers of the 77th Bombardment Squadron. They arrived at about noon to locate the Japanese aircraft carriers and counterattack; however, they landed at Fort Glenn about 1:30pm due to fog and low visibility. The Marauders were carrying airborne torpedoes, rather than contact bombs which they were designed to carry. In addition to the Dutch Harbor attack, Japanese forces landed on Kiska Island on 6 June; Attu Island on 7 June, seizing both.
The Japanese attacks on Dutch Harbor, however, inflicted only minor damage on the base, which were quickly repaired. The mission of Fort Glen Army Air Base was changed to serve as the initial forward base to launch bombing attacks against the Japanese forces in the Aleutians. Known Air Force units deployed to Fort Glenn were:
28th Bombardment Group
21st Bombardment Squadron, LB-30 Liberator
Assigned to Hamilton Field, California, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 11 June 1942
Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, 3 September 1942-19 September 1943
36th Bombardment Squadron, B-17E Flying Fortress, LB-30 Liberator
Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 4 June 1942-1 May 1943
73d Bombardment Squadron, B-25 Mitchell
Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning June 1942
Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, April–June 1943
77th Bombardment Squadron, B-25 Mitchell, B-26 Marauder
Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 30 May-3 October 1942
404th Bombardment Squadron, B-24 Liberator
Assigned to Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 24 August-13 September 1942
343d Fighter Group
11th Fighter Squadron, P-40 Warhawk
Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 26 May–June 1942
Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, June 1942-20 February 1943
54th Fighter Squadron, P-40 Warhawk
Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 6 June-19 September 1942
344th Fighter Squadron, P-40 Warhawk
Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, 8 March-23 May 1943
By the close of 1942, Fort Glenn AAB had 10,579 personnel assigned, but its role as an advanced air base had been supplanted by new air bases on Adak and Amchitka Islands in early 1943 farther to the west. By the end of the year, the base had become a backwater; its mission to provide housing and rations for transient personnel and the servicing of transient aircraft.
Closure
After the war ended, Fort Glenn remained open as a refueling stop for transient aircraft in the Aleutians along with Military Air Transport Service flights using the Great Circle Route from Japan to the United States. The main runway, however, was extended to to accommodate large, long range aircraft. By 1946, the base was manned only by skeleton staff due to the rapid demobilization of the Air Force.
The last Air Force personnel were withdrawn by 30 September 1947, and the base was put on inactive status and was effectively abandoned. It was decommissioned in 1950 and the site was excessed between 1952-55 to the Bureau of Land Management. It was later transferred to numerous owners (Native corporations and the State of Alaska). Today hundreds of buildings, runways, and World War II artillery emplacements remain in various states of deterioration."
In 1987, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Cape Field at Fort Glenn. The remains of the base are "the most comprehensive and intact World War II base in the Aleutian Islands" It is located on Umnak Island in the Aleutian Islands.
Today Fort Glenn AAF is a virtual ghost town—except for a family of cattle ranchers who have renovated several World War II buildings and who call the base home. The expanse and undisturbed quality of the resource make Fort Glenn AAF an outstanding conceptual model for landscape preservation. In 1991, National Park Service historians visited the site to review the World War II-related construction, infrastructure, landscape, and objects.
It was determined that any environmental cleanup should be designed to remove loose cables, transformers, hazardous material, toxic waste, and ordnance. Nontoxic World War II-related objects such as empty barrels could be left in place; full barrels would be, of course, another issue. All other buildings, structures, and infrastructure—no matter how "unsightly"—would be left intact and preserved: in this case preservation can simply mean avoidance and the acceptance that the buildings and structures have a definite place within the landscape.
On Saturday July 12, 2008, nearby Mount Okmok, erupted, sending ash 50,000 feet in the air and forcing the evacuation of the residents of the ranch. The eruption obliterated all remains of the South Pacifier Emergency landing strip, although some evidence of remains still are visible in aerial imagery.

James Tobin (1736/7–1817) was a prominent merchant and planter based in Nevis. During his life, he became one of the most prominent proslavery activists from the West Indies.
Life
Tobin was born in London, the son of James Tobin Sr. of Nevis, identified tentatively in the ODNB with the sea captain James Tobin (1698–1770), as given in Caribbeana. Educated at Westminster School, he took articles as a solicitor. After a period in Nevis, he returned in 1784 to Bristol. He was in business there, with John Pretor Pinney, and advocated for the planters' point of view on the abolitionist movement. He was a member of the Bristol West India Association.
Tobin travelled first to Nevis in 1758, to work in the family plantation business, at Stoney Grove Estate. From 1760 to 1782 he was there at least three times. He went back there in 1808. In 1817, the year of his death, there were 213 enslaved people on the Stoney Grove plantation.
In the end Tobin quarrelled with the Pinney family. He died in Bristol, on 6 October 1817.
Works
Tobin was one of a group of writers who defended the existing institution of slavery, based on experience in the Caribbean, that included also Samuel Estwick, Edward Long, Richard Nisbet who published Slavery not Forbidden by Scripture (1773), and Philip Thicknesse. He was drawn into controversy by the views of James Ramsay, expressed in An Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies of 1784; and published a number of works:
Cursory Remarks upon the Reverend Mr. Ramsay's Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the Sugar Colonies (1785). Tobin deployed arguments including the deprivations found in English rural life, compared to an idealised West Indian plantation drawing on the novels of Henry Mackenzie and Sarah Scott. He cited the pro-slavery work of Rev. Robert Robertson from earlier in the century, and followed racial purity arguments from Long.
Short Rejoinder to the Reverend Mr. Ramsay's Reply (1787). Tobin pointed out the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts as owner of a Barbados sugar plantation that used slave labour.
Tobin was addressed personally by Ramsay in A Letter to James Tobin, Esq., late member of His Majesty's Council in the island of Nevis (1787). He replied in:
A Farewel Address to the Rev. Mr. James Ramsay (1788)
The 1786 Essay on Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species by Thomas Clarkson deals with Tobin as the "Cursory Remarker". In 1787, Ottobah Cugoano responded to a number of authors defending enslavement, including Tobin, in Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species. Olaudah Equiano replied to Tobin in 1788, in The Public Advertiser, attacking two of his pamphlets, and also a related book from 1786 by Gordon Turnbull. Hector Macneill wrote positively about Tobin's Cursory Remarks in his Observations on the Treatment of the Negroes in Jamaica (1788).
In February 1790 Tobin gave evidence to a parliamentary committee on the slave trade. A later work was A Plain Man's Thoughts on the present Price of Sugar (1792). In that year a bill to abolish the slave trade was defeated in the House of Commons.
Family
Tobin married in 1766 Elizabeth Webbe, daughter of George Webbe, a Nevis planter. Living until 1777 in Salisbury, they had eight children: James Webbe, George, Henry Hope, John, Elizabeth, Charles Meadows, Joseph Webbe, and Frances. Elizabeth married John Cobham of Barbados, and Frances Robert Bush of Clifton. In a marriage of first cousins, George Webbe Tobin, son of George, married Susannah Cobham, daughter of Elizabeth.

Siwan is an album by pianist Jon Balke recorded in 2007/08 and released on the ECM label in 2009.
Reception
The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4½ stars stating "Every track here reveals something unusual, brings something hidden and alien to the fore even as it beguiles the listener with its intimacy of secret histories and knowledge. Siwan is Balke's masterpiece thus far, and will hopefully become as influential as it is groundbreaking".

Stalin-Allee is a German short film by director Sven Boeck.
The film focuses on the Karl-Marx-Allee, also still known as Stalin-Allee. The homogeneous architecture of the street is unique in Europe. In 1952, construction work began. Amidst the ruins of Berlin "palaces for the working class" were built, the "first socialist avenue in Germany".
In the first years of the GDR, Stalin Avenue was the showcase meant to demonstrate the power and effectiveness of the socialist system. Beyond the cultural aspects of the street, a film about Stalin Avenue has to include the failings of the socialist experiment as well. Built during the era of Nation Building, this street is connected with historical events like the rebellion on the 17th of June 1953, in which the construction workers played an important role, the sudden disappearance of the Stalin monument, the demonstrations on the 1st of May and the parades during the era of Erich Honecker.
This is a film about the claims of socialism and the wrong ways to realize it. Its subjective description of today's situation combines the views of the inhabitants, the "Trümmerfrauen" ("rubble women" who rebuilt Germany) and the former construction workers.

In cryptography, a pepper is a secret added to an input such as a password during hashing with a cryptographic hash function. This value differs from a salt in that it is not stored alongside a password hash, but rather the pepper is kept separate in some other medium, such as a Hardware Security Module. Note that the National Institute of Standards and Technology never refers to this value as a pepper but rather as a secret salt. A pepper is similar in concept to a salt or an encryption key. It is like a salt in that it is a randomized value that is added to a password hash, and it is similar to an encryption key in that it should be kept secret.
A pepper performs a comparable role to a salt or an encryption key, but while a salt is not secret (merely unique) and can be stored alongside the hashed output, a pepper is secret and must not be stored with the output. The hash and salt are usually stored in a database, but a pepper must be stored separately to prevent it from being obtained by the attacker in case of a database breach. Where the salt only has to be long enough to be unique per user, a pepper should be long enough to remain secret from brute force attempts to discover it (NIST recommends at least 112 bits).
History
The idea of a site- or service-specific salt (in addition to a per-user salt) has a long history, with Steven M. Bellovin proposing a local parameter in a Bugtraq post in 1995. In 1996 Udi Manber also described the advantages of such a scheme, terming it a secret salt. The term pepper has been used, by analogy to salt, but with a variety of meanings. For example, when discussing a challenge-response scheme, pepper has been used for a salt-like quantity, though not used for password storage; it has been used for a data transmission technique where a pepper must be guessed; and even as a part of jokes.
The term pepper was proposed for a secret or local parameter stored separately from the password in a discussion of protecting passwords from rainbow table attacks. This usage did not immediately catch on: for example, Fred Wenzel added support to Django password hashing for storage based on a combination of bcrypt and HMAC with separately stored nonces, without using the term. Usage has since become more common.
Types
There are multiple different types of pepper:
A secret unique to each user.
A shared secret that is common to all users.
A randomly-selected number that must be re-discovered on every password input.
Shared Secret Pepper
In the case of a shared-secret pepper, a single compromised password (via password reuse or other attack) along with a user's salt can lead to an attack to discover the pepper, rendering it ineffective. If an attacker knows a plaintext password and a user's salt, as well as the algorithm used to hash the password, then discovering the pepper can be a matter of brute forcing the values of the pepper. This is why NIST recommends the secret value be at least 112 bits, so that discovering it by exhaustive search is intractable. The pepper must be generated anew for every application it is deployed in, otherwise a breach of one application would result in lowered security of another application. Without knowledge of the pepper, other passwords in the database will be far more difficult to extract from their hashed values, as the attacker would need to guess the password as well as the pepper.
A pepper adds security to a database of salts and hashes because unless the attacker is able to obtain the pepper, cracking even a single hash is intractable, no matter how weak the original password. Even with a list of (salt, hash) pairs, an attacker must also guess the secret pepper in order to find the password which produces the hash. The NIST specification for a secret salt suggests using a Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) with an approved Pseudorandom Function such as HMAC with SHA-3 as the hash function of the HMAC. The NIST recommendation is also to perform at least 1000 iterations of the PBKDF, and a further minimum 1000 iterations using the secret salt in place of the non-secret salt.
Unique Pepper Per User
In the case of a pepper which is unique to each user, the tradeoff is gaining extra security at the cost of storing more information securely. Compromising one password hash and revealing its secret pepper will have no effect on other password hashes and their secret pepper, so each pepper must be individually discovered, which greatly increases the time taken to attack the password hashes.
Randomly Selected Pepper
In the case of a randomly-selected pepper which is not saved at all, it must be rediscovered every time it is needed. This means that an algorithm to verify a password would effectively need to brute-force the pepper every time. For this reason, algorithms implementing this would not want to use a large value for the pepper, as verification should be reasonably fast.

Lesbiinae is one of the six subfamilies that make up the hummingbird family Trochilidae.
The subfamily is divided into two tribes: Heliantheini ("brilliants") containing 14 genera and Lesbiini ("coquettes") containing 18 genera.
Phylogeny
A molecular phylogenetic study of the hummingbirds published in 2007 found that the family consisted of nine clades. When Edward Dickinson and James Van Remsen, Jr. updated the Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World for the 4th edition in 2013 they divided the hummingbird family into six subfamilies and proposed using the name Lesbiinae for a subfamily containing the tribes Heliantheini and Lesbiini. The subfamily Lesbiinae had been introduced by Ludwig Reichenbach in 1854.
Molecular phylogenetic studies by Jimmy McGuire and collaborators published between 2007 and 2014 determined the relationships between the major groups of hummingbirds. In the cladogram below the English names are those introduced in 1997. The Latin names are those proposed by Dickinson and Remsen in 2013.

The Giantess (The Guardian of the Egg) is a painting by Leonora Carrington. The painting is considered one of her most famous works as it sold for almost $1.5 million in 2009. Carrington created The Giantess circa 1947 in Mexico City after becoming a resident of Mexico in 1942. The tempera on wood panel painting is 117 x 68 cm. The Giantess now resides in the private collection of Miguel S. Escobedo in Mexico.
Description
Carrington wrote, "... it's a sort of giantess with a moonlike face in a field of wheat which is also golden hair. Her cape is white and she has a russet red dress with panels in which birdlike people are conversing. Out of the cape come wild geese which encircle her. She is standing against a sort of turquoise sea in which are small islands..."
As described by Carrington, the giantess, a huge female figure, stands in the center of the landscape scene with the sea behind her. She has an oval-shaped body. Surrounding her head is a field of golden wheat glowing like a halo. A small face floats in the middle of the wheat. She wears a red dress beneath a white cape. Through the opening of her cape are depictions of strange bird headed people and a three-headed bird in a register of scenes on the front of her dress. Two tiny hands holding a spotted egg emerge from inside of the cape. At her waist, two geese fly out from beneath the cape, while others fly around her. The Giantess appears peaceful with her eyes directed towards some of the geese flying beside her.
Between the Giantess's feet are three barely noticeable women. Groups of three women are a recurring motif in much of Carrington's art, such as Three Women Around the Table (1951), and The Magdalens (1986). Some have concluded that this is a representation of her with her circle of surrealist artist friends in Mexico, Remedios Varo and Kati Horna. In Celtic mythology, there are triple deity goddesses and for Carrington, Giantess was synonymous with Goddess. These three women and the symbolic geese could be another clue that this is indeed a work portraying a specific goddess.
The egg held by the Giantess was another recurring motif in Carrington's works. In Down Below, a short book by Carrington recalling her memoirs from time spent in a mental institution, she describes the conception of her egg motif. “This morning, the idea of the egg came again to my mind and I thought that I could use it as a crystal to look at Madrid in those days of July and August 1940—for why should it not enclose my own experiences as well as the past and future history of the Universe? The egg is the macrocosm and the microcosm, the dividing line between the Big and the Small which makes it impossible to see the whole.” However, the egg already had a history of alchemic symbolism. Several have found similarities in Carrington's egg and Hieronymus Bosch's in works such as The Garden of Earthly Delights.
There are considerable likenesses between The Giantess and early colonial representations of Irish people. Much of the painting has a simple folk aesthetic. The attire, of the figures and Giantess's cape with gold surrounded head are similar to that of figures in works such as Albrecht Dürer's Irish Warrior and Peasants (1521), John Derricke's Rorie Oge, The Image of Ireland (1581) and John Speed's Map of Ireland (1610).
In popular culture
The Giantess is among the surrealist paintings by women referenced in Mark Romanek's 1995 video for the Madonna song "Bedtime Story" (1995).

Thomas Kirby Van Zandt (March 7, 1814 - January 2, 1886) was a painter active in the Albany, New York region. He is remembered for his paintings of race horses for owners including Leland Stanford, Erastus Corning, and Eli Whitney, but also painted bust-length portraits of Albany citizens, dogs, and other animals. It has been hypothesized (see Ione) that Van Zandt traced his horse figures from lantern projections of Eadweard Muybridge's celebrated photographs. Van Zandt is buried in the Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.

The First and the Last are a 1919 play by the British writer John Galsworthy. It was based on a short story published in 1917. It was staged successfully in the early 1920s by Basil Dean featuring the actors Owen Nares and Meggie Albanesi. In 1937, it was adapted by Dean for the film 21 Days, which was not released until 1940, starring Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh.
Burt Lancaster and Harold Hecht also procured the filming rights in 1948, hoping to produce the movie through their film production company Norma Productions. The film was to star Marlon Brando and Meg Mundy before it fell through.
In 1933 a radio adaptation in Czech První a poslední directed by Josef Bezdíček) was broadcast on Czexh radio.

The band announced their seventh studio album, Explosions, after the release of "So-Called Life". They also announced tour dates for the spring that will take place in April and May 2022. In February 2022, the band officially revealed the track list and the cover art for the album.
Bassist Brad Walst explained the process of recording the album, "We didn't see each other for the longest time. We recorded nine or ten songs separately, in different studios, and by ourselves, which we've never done before." Drummer Neil Sanderson talked about what inspired the record with Loudwire, "There is a common thread of theme going through it — the notion of just feeling like you have to self-center yourself in today's world, but then at the same time, you have to hear the opinions of everyone."
Singles
"So-Called Life" is the first single released from the album. The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart for four consecutive weeks marking the band's 16th number one on the chart. "Neurotic" was released on February 17, 2022, as a promotional single. The second official single "Lifetime" was released on April 11, 2022. The song was dedicated to the people of Mayfield, Kentucky after an EF4 tornado hit the city in December 2021. The song peaked at number 1 both on active and mainstream rock charts making it the bands 17th number 1 on the charts. The third single, "I Am the Weapon" was released on September 27, 2022.
Critical reception
Explosion has been received with positive reviews. Rock N' Load gave the album a 9/10 rating complimenting Matt Walst's vocals on songs such as "Lifetime" and "A Scar is Born". Timothy Monger of AllMusic remarked, "the album feels like a continuation of the gritty, aggressive rock that has been the group's hallmark since the beginning." To date, the album has sold 44,000 equivalent album units in the US.

Dodge County is a county located in the central portion of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of 2010, the population was 21,796. The county seat is Eastman. Dodge County lies in the Historic South and Black Belt region of Georgia, an area that was devoted to cotton production in the antebellum years. It has significant historic buildings and plantations, has a substantial African-American population, and shows cultural aspects of the South.
History
Prior to 1802, this section of Georgia was owned by the Creek Indians. Treaties were made in 1802-1805 by which all lands east of the Ocmulgee River were taken from the Creek Indians. This land was distributed by lottery to the citizens of Georgia. In 1803 Wilkinson County was organized under that treaty. Telfair and Laurens counties were formed from Wilkinson County. In 1808 Pulaski County was formed from Laurens. In 1869, the Macon and Brunswick Railroad was built. Towns began to spring up all up and down the line, and, as this section was so far removed from the county seat, Hawkinsville, it was deemed expedient to create a new county and place the county seat at this point. A large portion of the county was taken from Laurens County, and also smaller portions from Pulaski, Montgomery, and Telfair counties. Dodge County was organized on October 26, 1870, during the Reconstruction era. The county was named by the Republican-dominated legislature for William E. Dodge. The county courthouse was built by Dodge and used until 1908, on the same area the courthouse stands now.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.4%) is water.
The western half of Dodge County, roughly west of Eastman, is located in the Lower Ocmulgee River sub-basin of the Altamaha River basin. The eastern half of the county is located in the Little Ocmulgee River sub-basin of the same Altamaha River basin, with a small northern corner of Dodge County, north and west of Chester, located in the Lower Oconee River sub-basin of the larger Alamaha River basin. The rivers were important for trade, carrying cotton and timber downriver to markets.

Vote-buying controversy
Dodge County has been at the center of several voter fraud and vote buying controversies over the past several decades.
1990s
The most notable incident of voter fraud in Dodge County in the 1990s is the case of the United States vs. McCranie. In this case, there were two defendants being tried together for several different methods of voter fraud. These methods included vote buying, vote selling, multiple voting, and votes cast by felons and deceased voters. The case involved the winners of the July 9, 1996, races for Dodge County Sheriff and Dodge County Commissioner. The races were decided by 9 votes and 31 votes, respectively. The original results of the election had been contested, and a secondary election took place in an attempt to resolve the issue. In the secondary election, the Dodge County Sheriff's race was overturned, but the results of the Dodge County Commissioner's race remained the same.
A joint federal-state investigation into the events of this election found that the defendants likely worked together to buy votes. This was backed up with bank records that showed that the defendants had each obtained $15,000 in cash in $20 bills from the Bank of Eastman. The two defendants were accused of voter fraud and sentenced on March 12, 1999. Many federal officials described the 1996 election trial as the largest election-fraud prosecution in United States history.
2000s
The most notable case of voter fraud in the 2000s is the case of the 2004 Dodge County Sheriff's race. Former Dodge County Sheriff Lawton Douglas Jr. was indicted on two counts of conspiracy and four counts of vote buying in July 2009. This indictment came due to an investigation of the 2004 election, and did not include any charges for the potentially fraudulent 2008 election. Former Sheriff Lawton Douglas received a maximum sentence. The sentencing cited Douglas's use of cash, liquor, and drugs to buy votes in the election. Also, Douglas had people accompany voters into the polling booths to ensure that the vote actually went to him. His sentence was 18 months in federal prison.

The Wanlockhead beam engine (also known as the Wanlockhead water-bucket pumping-engine or Straitsteps beam engine) is located close to the Wanlock Water below Church Street on the B797 in the village of Wanlockhead, Parish of Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. The site is in the Lowther Hills above the Mennock Pass, a mile south of Leadhills in the Southern Uplands. This is the only remaining original water powered beam engine in the United Kingdom and still stands at its original location. It ceased working circa 1910 after installation circa 1870.
It is a Scheduled Industrial Monument (SM90310), considered to be of national importance and the principles by which it functioned were originally derived from attempts at producing a perpetual motion machine.
History
Similar water powered water pumping engines are known from as early as 1745 and an example in the 1790s is known to have been used to drain a coal mine at Canonbie, Dumfries and Galloway. They were progressively replaced by steam powered water pumps such as the 1780s example once at Earlston in East Ayrshire and now preserved in the National Museum of Scotland.
Sir James Stampfield installed hand rag-pumps that were used manually at the Straitsteps Mine between 1675 and 1684, water being drawn up by rags attached to a continuous length of rope inside a pipe that opened below the water level. Later on water power was used to work drainage pumps and then two waterwheel-powered pumping engines, known as ‘bab-gins' were installed at Straitsteps in 1710.
By 1779 the Straitsteps mine that ran under Wanlock Dod was drained using a Boulton & Watt steam pumping engine, later replaced by a more economic and efficient Watt engine.
From 1870 until circa 1910 the Wanlockhead beam engine water pump is thought to have acted as a supplementary pump for draining water from the disused parts of Straitsteps lead mine that had first been worked as far back as 1675 and in doing so prevented the flooding of the nearby Bay Lead Mine. Traditional lead mining ceased in 1928 however lead and zinc extraction from the settling ponds only ended in 1968.
The Beam engine
The horizontal circa 8.5 m (27 ft) long pitch-pine beam pivots on cast-iron step plummer blocks with brass bearings and a wrought iron axle. The blocks are secured to the pillar by metal tie rods which pass right through the stone column and are tied in at the base. The aforementioned supporting column is 14 ft high and built from well dressed freestone ashlar block masonry. Two baulks of pitch pine are held together by wrought iron straps and reinforcing pads are located at the centre and beam ends.
The stone column has a decoratively carved cornice and has the general appearance of a typical 19th century railway bridge pier. A number of small locking screws can be seen and the brass bearings were clearly turned on a lathe. Wedges and cotter pins are used to hold some parts of the mechanism together. The machining of the bearings, etc. confirms the late 19th century construction of the beam engine.
The wooden parts of the structure have been replaced over the years however remains of ladders, platforms and the rest of the pumping rod may remain within the capped mine shaft. The wooden bucket on the eastern end of the beam has long since rotted however the 2m deep stone lined pit, once draining into the Wanlock Burn, still survives. The prominent wooden tripod frame with a ladder was used for maintenance of the pump rod and for adjusting or trimming the weight of the pumping rod end of the beam using smelted lead bars. This is a more recent replacement feature.
The lead tank or cistern that formed the head of water once stood on the hill above the site and was fed by a launder from the Wanlock Burn.
The stone column of another beam engine is recorded at the Bay Mine (NS868137) as well as the wheel pit of a sizable waterwheel. It is thought that the stone column is part of the atmospheric beam engine built by William Symington. It is possible that the Straitsteps beam engine had been used elsewhere before being assembled at Straitsteps.
Operation
The ongoing running costs were minimal as the only 'fuel' was free in the form of water and therefore construction costs were the only significant outlay. Water was fed into a lead tank or cistern above the beam engine from the Wanlock Water and then passed under the road to the square bucket that was attached to the eastern end of the wooden beam via wrought iron pumping mechanism. The weight of the water would eventually overcome the weight of the pumping rod attached to the western end of the beam and the upward movement would draw water up via flap valves at the rate of two to three oscillations a minute and lift around 7000 litres per hour that was released back into the Wanlock Water via a wood-lined culvert which ran underground. The water within the bucket was likewise released via a valve that was activated when the stroke reached its maximum and then the cycle was repeated. This simple operation was very reliable and ran 24 hours a day with minimum attention or maintenance.
A working model of the water-bucket pumping-engine is on display within the lead mining museum's exhibition area.
The characteristic nodding motion of the beam engine gave rise to the 'Bobbin John' nickname coined by the miners.
In front of the beam engine a double circle walkway indicates where a horse gin once stood, predating the beam engine and once used to haul miners and ore from the mine.
Straitsteps and the miners cottages
A number of the original single storey miners cottages are still in use or are preserved by the Museum of Scottish Lead Mining and a semi-detached example, East and West Straitsteps Cottages, stand above the beam engine site. The name 'Straitsteps' refers to a barren section between Straitsteps and the Bay Mine of the galena vein that runs from Mennockhass through the Dod Hill and on to the Limpen Rig.

Green Shading into Blue is the third album by Norwegian jazz bassist and composer Arild Andersen recorded in 1978 and released on the ECM label.
Reception
The Allmusic review by Jim Todd awarded the album 2 stars, stating "This is an outstanding group of individual talents who can communicate musically with one another at the highest level. For the 1978 follow-up, though, incongruous elements have now been grafted on here and there: occasional bits of string synthesizer, "soft rock" riffing, passages of sensitive, new age noodling. The result is neither particularly commercial, nor especially good jazz, relative to the players who made it".

Satinet is a finely woven fabric with a finish resembling satin, but made partly or wholly from cotton or synthetic fiber. The fibers may be natural (as with cotton, woolens or cashmere wool) or synthetic.
In the United States of America
The process of manufacturing satinets in the United States of America began c. 1820 at the Capron Mill in Uxbridge, Massachusetts.
The Hockanum Mill in Rockville / Vernon CT was originally constructed in 1814 by Bingham & Nash. They became a leading manufacturer of satinet. The Hockum Mills in Connecticut was formed in 1836 and constructed a larger mill to produce satinet, a finely woven fabric that resembles satin but is made from wool. They continued to produce satinet until 1869. Satinet was also an important commodity for the people of West Tisbury, MA, on the island of Martha's Vineyard Ma. The Old Mill Pond property in that town was purchased by David Look in 1809 and he converted what was once a grain mill to textile mill. He installed a carding machine to produce woolen yarn and looms for weaving that wool into fabrics called kersey and Satinet. Needing more power than the river itself could provide, Look installed a dam to raise the pond's water level. His mill produced Satinet; a waterproof fabric used in whaling and sea-going outerwear. Thomas Bradley bought the property in 1845 and erected a new textile mill which prospered until the 1860s, largely due to the popularity of Satinet's use in waterproofing Civil War military uniforms. That mill building, now headquarters for the Martha's Vineyard Garden Club, still stands today.

A points decision is a winning criterion in several full-contact combat sports, such as boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, mixed martial arts and others sports involving striking. Unlike normal decisions where there are three judges that agree on which fighter won the match, the fight is scored by the referee, who determines who wins the bout.
In some boxing matches, particularly when sanctioned by the British Boxing Board of Control in the United Kingdom, the referee is responsible for scoring (round by round) which fighter they feel is winning (and losing). Sometimes it denotes that the actual scores are unknown.
A unanimous decision is also sometimes referred to as a "win on points".

The Medwecki M9 was a 1930s, Polish designed two-seat cabin tourer or trainer aircraft. Only one was completed before the outbreak of World War II.
Design and development
Though Józef Medwecki and Władysław Kiryluk were employed by P.W.S, they designed and built the Medwecki M9 in their own time. Begun in 1937, it was a product of the 1930s revival of amateur aircraft design in Poland and perhaps the last to fly before the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. With funding from LOPP and some aircraft companies, Medwecki, Kiryluk and friends built the M9 in the P.W.S. workshops.
The M9 was of mixed construction. Its constant thickness high wing had a rectangular plan apart from blunted tips. The wing was a wooden structure in two parts, had two spars and was plywood-covered ahead of the forward spar with fabric covering elsewhere. A pair of parallel steel tube struts on each side braced the wing to the lower fuselage. Its ailerons were of the Frise type.
It was powered by a Cirrus III upright 4-cylinder air-cooled inline engine with its fuel tanks in the wings. The M9's fuselage was built around a triangular section frame of steel tubes, the nose metal covered and the rest with fabric covering over a light wooden frame giving it an oval section. Its enclosed cabin was under the wing, with its windscreen just ahead of the leading edge. There were two seats in tandem, each with a starboard-side door and dual controls, and a luggage compartment behind the cabin.
The horizontal tail of the M9, mounted on top of the fuselage, was straight-tapered with rounded tips and the fin was also straight-tapered. It carried a full, rounded rudder which reached down to the keel through a gap between the elevators. The cantilever empennage had a wooden structure with plywood covered fixed surfaces and fabric covered control surfaces.
The M9 had fixed, tailskid landing gear with tall, streamlined cantilever legs containing compressed-rubber shock absorbers and mounting wheels enclosed within spats.
It was flown for the first time by Stefan Hanschild in early August 1939. Tests showed the M9 had excellent and docile handling characteristics suiting it to both touring and training roles. The Silesian Aeroclub offered to buy the prototype when its tests were complete and plans were made for production of M9s with a range of more powerful engines and a wing set with light dihedral but these hopes were overtaken by the German invasion.

In addition to his career as an executive, Tillman has also worked as a CFL analyst for TSN, the CBC, and Rogers Sportsnet in 1998, 2000, and 2005.
Early career
Tillman began his career as a football executive in 1981 as a member of the Houston Oilers' public relations department. The following year, he received his first job in the CFL when he became the player personnel director of the Montreal Concordes. From 1984 to 1993, Tillman served as Executive Director of the Senior Bowl, a game sponsored by National Football League designed to showcase top players graduating from United States colleges.
BC Lions
From 1993 to 1995, Tillman was the General Manager of the BC Lions. Tillman took over a team that went 3–15 in 1992. Under Tillman, the Lions posted a 31–22–1 record and upset the Baltimore Stallions in the 82nd Grey Cup. The Lions success came in spite of regular fighting between head coach Dave Ritchie and owner Bill Comrie and a lack of team harmony.
In 1995, Norton Herrick, a real estate developer from Orlando, Florida, announced plans to move the CFL's Las Vegas Posse to Tillman's hometown of Jackson, Mississippi. Tillman was to be the club's general manager, however plans fell through and the relocation did not take place and Tillman remained with BC.
Toronto Argonauts
In November 1995, the World League of American Football named Tillman its Director of Football Operations. Tillman, however preferred overseeing a single team so in 1997 he returned to the CFL as general manager of the Toronto Argonauts. That year, the Argonauts won the Grey Cup. However, Tillman and head coach Don Matthews had a tumultuous relationship. On March 1, 1998, Tillman officially departed the Argonauts. He then joined TSN as a football analyst. In 1999, Matthews left the Argonauts to become head coach of the Edmonton Eskimos and, after Wally Buono turned down an offer to become head coach and general manager, the Argos asked Tillman to return as GM. When the team was purchased by New York businessman Sherwood Schwarz after the 1999 season, Tillman was fired and replaced by Schwarz's cousin, J. I. Albrecht. After his dismissal, Tillman returned to TSN.
Ottawa Renegades
On October 23, 2001, Tillman was named the first General Manager of the expansion Ottawa Renegades. Ottawa won four games their inaugural season and seven games the following year. In 2004, the Renegades gave head coach Joe Paopao the title of director of football operations. Although Tillman was still technically general manager, Paopao was effectively general manager.
After leaving Ottawa, Tillman served as an analyst for the CBC and Rogers Sportsnet.
Saskatchewan Roughriders
Part way through the 2006 CFL season, Tillman was hired as the Roughriders general manager after they fired long time GM Roy Shivers. He took over a team that had a tarnished reputation in the community after several players had run-ins with the law, including former linebacker Trevis Smith, who had been charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault after he knowingly exposed two women to HIV without telling them. Tillman promised to clean up the team's image and the Roughriders adopted a code of conduct which required players to obey the law, act with honesty and integrity, respect others, and take responsibility for their actions.
During Tillman's three years with the team they hosted three consecutive home playoff games and played in two Grey Cups. In 2007, the Roughriders won their third ever Grey Cup. Among the key signings made by Tillman were head coach Kent Austin, defensive end Stevie Baggs, receivers Weston Dressler and Rob Bagg, defensive back Omarr Morgan, and running back Corey Holmes. He also acquired many key players who would be part of the Roughriders 2013 championship season, including Darian Durant, Chris Getzlaf, and John Chick. In July 2008, Tillman was given a contract extension through 2010.
On August 6, 2008, Tillman was sent home from a team board meeting because he was acting strangely. After he arrived home, Tillman put his hands on the hips of his children's sixteen-year-old babysitter. Tillman's attorney would state that Tillman was not thinking clearly because he had taken a double dose of sleep aids and pain medication for a sore back and that he did not remember what happened. On January 27, 2009, Tillman was charged with summary sexual assault. He was placed on paid administrative leave by the Roughriders on February 2, 2009.
Tillman pleaded guilty to the charge on January 4, 2010, the day his trial on this summary offence was to begin. He was granted an absolute discharge the following day and subsequently received no criminal record but was fined $50.00. Judge Murray Hinds stated that Tillman was "genuinely remorseful [and] in this case there's no suggestion that Mr. Tillman is not generally of good character. He has no prior criminal record. His behaviour towards [the teenage girl] on Aug. 6 appears to be an aberration fuelled by his consumption of two non-prescription drugs." On January 8, 2010, he resigned from his position as the Roughriders' general manager.
Edmonton Eskimos
On September 14, 2010, Tillman was hired as General Manager of the Edmonton Eskimos. He took over an Eskimos team that had a league-worst 2-8 record. Tillman stated that his primary goal would be improving the team's Canadian players. According to Eskimos president Rick LeLacheur, the team received a "substantial" number of phone calls from fans opposed to hiring Tillman, however, the Eskimos organization had deemed him worthy of a second chance. After Tillman's hiring, the Eskimos won five out of its eight remaining games and finished out of the playoffs by only two points.
In Tillman's first full season with the team, the Eskimos finished with an 11–7 record, which tied them with the Calgary Stampeders and BC Lions for first place in the West. Edmonton defeated Calgary 33–19 in the West Semifinal, but lost to BC 40–23 in the West Final.
On December 12, 2011, Tillman traded quarterback Ricky Ray to the Toronto Argonauts for quarterback Steven Jyles, kicker Grant Shaw, and a first-round pick. The move would be criticized as Jyles struggled at quarterback for the Eskimos while Ray led the Argonauts to victory in the 100th Grey Cup.
In 2012, the Eskimos finished fourth in West, with a 7–11 record. The team struggled offensively throughout the season and started three quarterbacks Jyles, Kerry Joseph, and Matt Nichols. Edmonton lost its final three games but was able to make the playoffs due to the crossover rule. On November 3, 2012, eight days before the Eskimos playoff game against the Toronto Argonauts, Eskimos president Len Rhodes announced that Tillman had been fired. Rhodes stated that there "no specific reason" as to why Tillman was fired, but he did point to Tillman's lack of presence in the community as an issue.
Hamilton Tiger-Cats
Two months after his dismissal, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats hired Tillman as a consultant. His position was described by head coach/general manager Kent Austin as being a "sounding board" for Austin. In 2014 Tillman was given the title of director of U.S. scouting and U.S. pro personnel. In 2016, he was promoted to general manager, with Austin remaining as vice-president of football operations and head coach. The Ticats announced on January 3, 2019, that Tillman would not be returning as general manager. He had a 21–33 record with Hamilton as GM.
Atlantic Schooners
After Tillman's contract with the Tiger-Cats expired in December 2018 he elected to leave the team and join the Atlantic Schooners, a proposed CFL expansion team, as vice president of football operations.

Dreams or () is a 1993 Russian fantastical absurdist comedy directed by Karen Shakhnazarov and Alexander Borodyansky.
Plot
...Russia, end of the 19th century. Countess Prizorova suffers from strange dreams. In them the Countess becomes a dishwasher by the name of Masha Stepanova who works in a dirty Moscow eatery in 1993.
...Masha Stepanova has a pensioner husband, who shoots her nude and then sells these photos on the Arbat. Soon the president of Russia approaches Masha for help. An IMF representative is coming to Moscow and Stepanova who is appointed as Minister of Finance must seduce the foreigner to obtain favorable loans for Russia. However the provocation with Masha fails because of lustful Semyon Borisovich, accountant of the canteen where Stepanova works.
Count Prizorov, alarmed by his wife's condition, refers first to a famous doctor, and then, well, to a medium Monsieur Renoir. After the "magical" psychic session Prizorov explains that his wife has a prophetic gift: she dreams about what would happen in Russia a hundred years. The future of the country seems terrible: poverty, a general collapse, violence of criminals, foreign prostitutes, lack of spirituality... The shocked Count decides to take a desperate step: at the time of the report to the Emperor Nicholas II, Prizorov requires to immediately begin implementation of economic and social reforms because the current rate of the tsarist government will inevitably lead to revolution. Alas, the emperor and his entourage remain deaf to Prizorov's fiery speech, the Count is discharged and the course of history does not change...

The aircraft was on an executive flight from Berlin Tempelhof Airport to Salzburg Airport and the pilots had already begun the final approach, when severe icing conditions were encountered, leading to a stall and subsequent crash of the aircraft into a forest short of the runway. The accident investigation concluded that there was also a short circuit in the aircraft's electrical systems, which might have contributed to the crash.

Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) is one type of ad hoc Parliamentary committee constituted by the Indian parliament.
Formation
Joint Parliamentary Committee is formed when motion is adopted by one house and it is supported or agreed by the other house.
Another way to form a Joint Parliamentary committee is that two presiding chiefs of both houses can write to each other, communicate with each other and form the joint parliamentary committee.
Membership
The Lok Sabha members are double compared to Rajya Sabha.
for e.g. If Joint Parliamentary committee has 10 Lok Sabha Members then 5 members will be from Rajya Sabha and total member of JPC will be 15.
The strength of a JPC may be different each time.
Powers
A JPC can obtain evidence of experts, public bodies, associations, individuals or interested parties suo motu or on requests made by them. If a witness fails to appear before a JPC in response to summons, his conduct constitutes a contempt of the House.
The JPC can take oral and written evidence or call for documents in connection with a matter under its consideration. The proceedings of parliamentary committees are confidential, but in the case of the joint committee which went into "Irregularities in Securities and Banking Transactions", the committee decided that considering the widespread public interest in the matter, the chairman should brief the press about deliberations of the committees.
Ministers are not generally called by the committees to give evidence. However, in case of the Irregularities in Securities and Banking Transactions probe again, an exception was made, with the JPC, with the permission of the Speaker, seeking information on certain points from ministers and calling Minister of Finance and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
The government may withhold or decline to produce a document if it is considered prejudicial to the safety or interest of State. The Speaker has the final word on any dispute over calling for evidence against a person or production of a document.
JPCs so far
Bofors scandal (1987)
The first JPC was formed in August 1987 to investigate the Bofors scandal. It was chaired by Congress politician B. Shankaranand. It was formed on a motion moved by the then defence minister K.C. Pant in the Lok Sabha on August 6, 1987. The Rajya Sabha endorsed it a week later. The committee, held 50 sittings and gave its report on April 26, 1988. Opposition parties boycotted the committee on the ground that it was packed with Congress members. The JPC report was tabled in the Parliament, but it was rejected by the Opposition.
Harshad Mehta Stock market scam (1992)
The second JPC was formed in August 1992. It was headed by former Union minister and senior Congress leader Ram Niwas Mirdha. It was set up to probe Irregularities in Securities and Banking Transactions in the aftermath of the Harshad Mehta scandal. The motion was moved by the then minister for parliamentary affairs Ghulam Nabi Azad in the Lok Sabha on August 6, 1992. The Rajya Sabha concurred with it the next day. The recommendations of the JPC were neither accepted in full nor implemented.
Ketan Parekh share market scam (2001)
The third JPC was formed in April 2001. It was assigned to probe the Ketan Parekh share market scam. Then parliamentary affairs minister Pramod Mahajan piloted a motion in the Lok Sabha on April 26, 2001, to put it in place. Senior BJP member Lt Gen Prakash Mani Tripathi (retd) was named the chairman. The committee held 105 sittings and gave its report on December 19, 2002. The committee recommended sweeping changes in stock market regulations. However, many of these recommendations were diluted later.
Soft drink pesticide issue (2003)
The fourth JPC was set up in August 2003 to look into pesticide residues in soft drinks, fruit juice and other beverages and to set safety standards. It was headed by Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar. The JPC held 17 sittings and submitted its report to Parliament on February 4, 2004. The report confirmed that soft drinks did have pesticide residues and recommended stringent norms for drinking water.
This JPC made a recommendation about National Standards Body of India which was agreed by Parliament and the Govt. It recommended that Bureau of Indian Standards should be headed by an eminent scientist. No action has however been taken on this recommendation even after 16 years.
2G spectrum case (2011)
The fifth JPC has been constituted in February 2011 to probe 2G case. It is headed by P.C. Chacko. It has 30 members. 15 opposition members belonging to BJP, JD (U), CPI, CPM, Trinamool Congress, BJD, DMK and the AIADMK in the 30-member panel accused P.C. Chacko of being "partisan" and demanded his removal (They submitted a memorandum to the Lok Sabha Speaker expressing their “no-confidence”) as they criticised the draft report for giving clean chit to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister P Chidambaram. So PC Chacko agreed to amend the JPC draft report.
VVIP Chopper scam (2013)
The Government has moved a motion in the Rajya Sabha on February 27, 2013, which was adopted by voice vote-for formation of a JPC "to inquire into the allegations of payment of bribes in the acquisition of VVIP helicopters by the Ministry of Defence from M/s Agusta Westland and the role of alleged middlemen in the transaction." The JPC will have 10 members from the Rajya Sabha and 20 from the Lok Sabha and shall give its report within three months of its first sitting.
Land Acquisition (2015)
The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Second Amendment) Bill, 2015 has been referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee of both the Houses under the Chairmanship of Shri S.S.Ahluwalia.
NRC (2016)
on hold
Personal Data Protection Bill (2019)
The Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 (PDP Bill 2019) was tabled in the Indian Parliament by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) on 11 December 2019. As of March, 2020 the Bill is being analyzed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in consultation with experts and stakeholders.

Kvingra or Kvingla is a peninsula in the municipality of Nærøysund in Trøndelag county, Norway. Kvingla is surrounded by the Sørsalten fjord to the south, the Nærøysundet strait in the northwest, and the Nordsalten fjord in the northeast. The island was originally connected to the mainland on a tiny isthmus of land in the southeast, but there is a man-made canal through it, so the island now is technically an island. The peninsula has a population of about 400 (as of 2001). The largest population center on the island is the village of Ottersøya on the southwestern tip of the peninsula.

Alavandar murder case is a murder trial which was conducted in the Madras State, India in the early 1950s. The cause of the trial was the murder of a businessman and ex-serviceman named Alavandar whose headless body was found in one of the coaches of the Indo-Ceylon Express. After a trial which became a cause célèbre, Alavandar's ex-lover and her husband were found guilty of the murder and had been sentenced to brief terms of imprisonment.
Introduction
C. Alavandar, a pen salesman from Chennai was reported missing on 28 August 1952, by his employer kannan Chetty (the owner of Gem and Co). The next day a headless body was discovered in a third-class compartment of the Chennai-Dhanushkodi (Indo-Ceylon boatmail) express. It was found after passengers complained about a foul-smelling trunk when the train was nearing Manamadurai. Police investigating the complaint, opened the trunk and found the headless body. An autopsy done at Manamadurai concluded that the body belonged to a 25-year-old male. Since it was circumcised, the investigating police officer K.Khaja Syed Mohideen decided that the murder victim was a Muslim based on Circumcision ( removal of the upper layer of the skin in male reproductive organ) After a few days, police discovered a severed head in Royapuram beach, Chennai. It had been buried in the beach sand but was exposed due to tidal action. The head and body were sent to Madras Medical College for forensic examination. Dr. C. P. Gopalakrishnan who performed the examination concluded that both belonged to the same 42-year-old male. Alavandar's wife later identified them as her husband. Alavandar had served in the British Indian army and his fingerprints were on file there. They were used to conclusively prove that the murdered man was Alavandar.
Investigation and trial
The Police investigation into Alavandar's murder revealed the circumstances leading to his death. Alavandar belonged to the Komati Chetti community. In 1952, he was about 40–45 years of age and married with two children. Besides his pen shop at Parry's Corner, Chennai, Alavandar was a saree salesman. He was romantically involved with many women. One of them was Devaki Menon from Kerala. In 1951, Devaki broke off her relationship with Alavandar and married one Prabhakar Menon. But Alavandar continued to harass her. To stop Alavandar, Devaki and Prabhakar decided to murder Alavandar. Devaki called Alavandar to her house at the cemetery road on 28 August 1952. There the couple murdered Alavandar, cut his head off and buried it at Royapuram beach in Chennai. They put the body in a trunk and left it in the Indo-Ceylon Express. Then they left Chennai for Bombay.
The couple was arrested in Bombay and brought to Chennai for trial. The trial caused a sensation and large crowds thronged the hearings. Lawyer B. T. Sundararajan, appearing for the defense, argued that it was a homicide and not murder as there had been "grave provocation". The jury found the defendants Devaki and Prabhakar guilty. On 13 August 1953, Justice A. S. Panchapakesa Iyer awarded a seven-year rigorous imprisonment sentence to Prabhakar for culpable homicide and sentenced Devaki to three years in prison.
Impact
Prabhakara Menon and Devaki, eventually, served their sentences in jail and afterwards, moved to Kerala where they set up a tea shop and over the years they prospered and built a hotel in a big town in Kerala.
The judge who handed down the comparatively mild sentence has often been accused of being sympathetic to the accused. This sensational case was considered an important one in the Indian forensics field and finds mention in medical textbooks. It was dramatised in Doordarshan.

The golden-tailed woodpecker (Campethera abingoni) is a species of bird in the family Picidae. Its specific name commemorates the 5th Earl of Abingdon. It belongs to a species complex that includes the Knysna woodpecker to the south of its range, and the mostly allopatric Mombasa woodpecker to the northeast, with which it perhaps hybridizes.
Description
The combination of barred, greenish upper part plumage, and streaked underparts is distinctive. Their golden-olive tails do not differ markedly from those of several related or sympatric woodpecker species, but their single, strident call-note is characteristic.
It measures 20 to 21 cm from bill tip to tail tip. The southern races weigh about 70 g, but the northern race C. a. chrysura, only about 55 g. Males are on average larger and heavier than females. The sexes are best distinguished by their head markings, as the red and brown fore-crowns of males differ unmistakably from those of females that are black and spotted white. The malar stripes of males are red and that of females mottled black and white. The iris is usually dark red but variable, the mandibles slate grey, and the legs and feet greenish-olive. Juveniles are heavily streaked on the throat and breast and barred on the belly. They and have mottled malar stripes, and a brown to brownish-grey iris.
Sound communication
Besides the single strident "waaa" or "weeea" call-note, usually by the male, it has a long-range and repeated yaooaak-yaaaaaak. It drums softly.
Habitat
It is present in coastal forest, miombo, mopane and acacia woodlands. It shows a preference for riparian woodland, particularly in the dryer parts of southern Africa. It may intensively forage small areas in the lower to middle strata of trees. It establishes fairly large territories of 10 to 15 ha, and can cover some distance between foraging sites.
Range
Very widespread in woodlands or forest south of the equator, and very localized north of it. It is found in Angola, Benin, Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
Feeding
It obtains most food by probing and gleaning, but also hammers dead or infected wood rather more frequently than other Campethera species. It feeds mostly on arboreal ants and termites, but also takes millipedes, wood-boring larvae and leaf-feeding moth larvae. It occurs alongside the Cardinal woodpecker which to some extent exploits thinner branches.
Nesting
They nest during early summer. Both sexes excavate the nest, usually on the underside of a branch in the lower to middle level of a tree. Two to three glossy white eggs are laid, and the parents take turns to incubate them. The male incubates at night. The incubation period is about 13 days, and the chicks are fed regurgitated food by both parents. Chicks leave the nest after 22 to 25 days. Their nests are parasitized by various species of honeyguide.
Races
There are 6 to 7 accepted races. C. a. chrysura (Swainson, 1837) occurs from Senegambia to western Uganda. It is quite green above, has streaked ear coverts and is smaller in size than either C. a. suahelica or C. a. abingoni, without overlap. The tropical race C. a. kavirondensis van Someren, 1926 is olive-green above and more broadly barred, with thinner streaking below. C. a. suahelica (Reichenow, 1902) which occurs from the Kilimanjaro region to northern Swaziland, is similar to the former but has a yellower toned upper parts. The nominate race is widespread in arid and mesic woodlands of southern Africa, and has denser throat streaking than C. a. suahelica. C. a. anderssoni (Roberts, 1936) occurs from southwestern Angola to northwestern South Africa. It has very dense throat and breast streaking, locally verging on solid black. C. a. constricta Clancey, 1965 which occurs from southern Mozambique to KwaZulu-Natal, is smaller than the nominate race, and has the upper part plumage greener and under part plumage more yellowish.
Similar species
The Mombasa woodpecker has yellower plumage below, has brighter golden-green upper parts, with small white dots and no barring (and never drums). Cardinal, Bennett's, Reichenow's and Nubian woodpeckers are all browner above and more clearly barred, and only the first of these is streaked below.

Monster by Mistake is a Canadian CGI-animated series that aired on YTV from October 26, 1996 to March 23, 2003. The series was created by Mark Mayerson of Catapult Productions, and co-produced with CCI Entertainment (formerly Cambium) in Toronto, Canada. The two companies partnered in Studio 345, a computer animation and former Sears catalogue production facility for the production of the show, which was made using Houdini software.
Characters
Warren Patterson (voiced by Julie Lemieux in the series and voiced by Corey Sevier in the pilot episode) is the protagonist of the show, who turns into the titular blue sasquatch-like monster whenever he sneezes after having been accidentally cursed by Gorgool's jewel.
Tracy Patterson (voiced by Hillary Goldhar) is Warren's supportive older sister who practices witchcraft after receiving Gorgool's book.
Johnny B. Dead (voiced by William Colgate) is a wise-cracking, trumpet-playing ghost who assists the siblings in their misadventures and secretly lives in the Pattersons' attic.
Recurring characters
Roz and Tom Patterson (voiced by Sally Cahill and Tony Rosato) are the parents of Warren and Tracy.
Aunt Dolores (voiced by Jayne Eastwood) is Warren and Tracy's aunt, a crabby and stuck-up but serious and well-meaning police officer and the older sister of Tom Patterson. She has a vendetta against the monster, unaware of it being her nephew.
Billy Castleman (voiced by Daniel DeSanto) is an overweight, mean school bully who often ridicules Warren. He's hellbent on proving Warren as the monster, but is unable to do so.
Gorgool (voiced by Len Carlson) is a sorcerer and the would-be ruler of Fenrath, who is trapped in a ball. He intends to steal the Jewel of Fenrath and the Book of Spells with his servant.
The Servant (voiced by Howard Jerome) is the dim-witted servant of Gorgool. He carries Gorgool around and follows Gorgool's every command. His real name is never mentioned.
Wesley Whiffington III (voiced by Christopher Ralph) is a child who appears in Season Two. He is spoiled and never gets things his way. He is also interested in adult projects such as business and moviemaking.
Miranda Bell (voiced by Alyson Court) is a girl who said she became a scientist at age six and says that her brain weighs eight pounds.
Morgool (voiced by Len Carlson) is Gorgool's twin brother and the ruler of Fenrath. He is not trapped within a ball and is far more dangerous and evil than his twin. It is believed that Morgool is unable to control anyone who is superior to him, such as the monster, and his jealousy and greed for the throne resulted in Gorgool's confinement to the glass ball.
Ms. Gish (voiced by Barbara Franklin) is the teacher who is involved with most episodes in Season One.
Kragon (voiced by George Buza) is a guard working for Morgool in Fenrath. He always helps his master in his schemes, mainly trying to capture the monster. Kragon's home region is Gorem Range.

The Twilight Sad Killed My Parents and Hit the Road is a compilation album by Scottish indie rock band The Twilight Sad, released by FatCat Records on 8 December 2008. The compilation is composed of live tracks, covers and previously unreleased material, and was made to "help fund their tour with Mogwai" in late 2008. The compilation was initially limited to 1,000 CD copies only, and was only made available at live shows, in independent record shops, and at FatCat's official website. The CD has not been repressed, but the album was made available digitally shortly after the CD release, and pressed on vinyl for the first time in November 2019.
The album artwork and name are homages to the 1990 Sonic Youth album Goo. According to vocalist James Graham, the Goo pastiche was the idea of guitarist Andy MacFarlane. Graham commented, "[The Twilight Sad] were playing in America with Mogwai [...] and Thurston Moore [came] to the gig. So we were thinking 'fuck' and hoping he didn't see the merchandise table. They haven't sued us though. Yet."
The first six tracks were recorded at the ABC in Glasgow on 9 October 2008. "Untitled #28" and "Untitled #27" were later featured on the band's second studio album, Forget the Night Ahead, as "The Neighbours Can't Breathe" and "The Room", respectively.

Våmhus is a locality situated in Mora Municipality, Dalarna County, Sweden with 857 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated by the Orsa Lake's northwest beach.
Våmhus has a characteristic local dialect, Våmhusmål, distinct from other Dalecarlian dialects. Due to the relatively isolated location of Våmhus the Våmhusmål is still in use to some extent among the local population, although like all Swedish dialects it is in a general decline. The area is also known for its handicraft tradition, including basketry and "hair jewelry"(jewelry made of human hair).
The present urban area answers to an older parish by the same name, which covered 14 small villages:

A proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a heterobifunctional small molecule composed of two active domains and a linker, capable of removing specific unwanted proteins. Rather than acting as a conventional enzyme inhibitor, a PROTAC works by inducing selective intracellular proteolysis. PROTACs consist of two covalently linked protein-binding molecules: one capable of engaging an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and another that binds to a target protein meant for degradation. Recruitment of the E3 ligase to the target protein results in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein via the proteasome. Because PROTACs need only to bind their targets with high selectivity (rather than inhibit the target protein's enzymatic activity), there are currently many efforts to retool previously ineffective inhibitor molecules as PROTACs for next-generation drugs.
Initially described by Kathleen Sakamoto, Craig Crews and Ray Deshaies in 2001, the PROTAC technology has been applied by a number of drug discovery labs using various E3 ligases, including pVHL, CRBN, Mdm2, beta-TrCP1, DCAF15, DCAF16, RNF114, and c-IAP1. Yale University licensed the PROTAC technology to Arvinas in 2013–14.
In 2019, Arvinas put two PROTACs into clinical trials: ARV-110, an androgen receptor degrader, and ARV-471, an estrogen receptor degrader.
Mechanism of action
PROTACs achieve degradation through "hijacking" the cell's ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) by bringing together the target protein and an E3 ligase.
First, the E1 ligase activates and conjugates the ubiquitin to the E2 ligase. The E2 ligase then forms a complex with the E3 ligase. The E3 ligase targets proteins and covalently attaches the ubiquitin to the protein of interest. Eventually, after a ubiquitin chain is formed, the protein is recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome. PROTACs take advantage of this cellular system by putting the protein of interest in close proximity to the E3 ligase to catalyze degradation.
Unlike traditional inhibitors, PROTACs have a catalytic mechanism, with the PROTAC itself being recycled after the target protein is degraded.
Design and development
The protein targeting warhead, E3 ligase, and linker must all be considered for PROTAC development. Formation of a ternary complex between the protein of interest, PROTAC, and E3 ligase may be evaluated to characterize PROTAC activity because it often leads to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the targeted protein. A hook effect is commonly observed with high concentrations of PROTACs due to the bifunctional nature of the degrader.
Currently, pVHL and CRBN have been used in preclinical trials as E3 ligases. However, there still remains hundreds of E3 ligases to be explored, with some giving the opportunity for cell specificity.
Benefits
Compared to traditional inhibitors, PROTACs display multiple benefits that make them desirable drug candidates. Due to their catalytic mechanism, PROTACs can be administered at lower doses compared to their inhibitor analogues. Some PROTACs have been shown to be more selective than their inhibitor analogues, reducing off-target effects. PROTACs have the ability to target previously undruggable proteins, as they do not need to target catalytic pockets. This also helps prevent mutation-driven drug resistance often found with enzymatic inhibitors.

Cool Gardens is a poetry book by the lead singer of the band System of a Down, Serj Tankian. It was published by MTV Books and was released on October 1, 2002. It is a collection of seven to eight years of Tankian's reflections on life, and features artwork by fellow Angeleno, Sako Shahinian. The poetry, like the songs of System of a Down, consists of a reflection of societies and people's wrongs. It portrays what people do to themselves and the control others try to hold over them.
The book has received much praise in the artistic community.
Fellow poet and musician Saul Williams posted the following comments about Tankian's book:
Serj's words, like his voice, have a distinct aesthetic sensibility connected to an unyielding, visceral roar of passion. His capacity 'to mock a killing bird' while we wonder at the grace, beauty, and colorful range of his wingspan will be the trademark of both of his singing and writing careers. Serj is an amazing artist, full of passion, with a beautiful heart that pumps the essence of his vision and talent.

Stranton is an area of south Hartlepool in the borough of Hartlepool, County Durham, England. It is a former village and parish.
The ancient parish boundaries were the North Sea to the east, Greatham Creek, an arm of the Tees, to the south, the parish of Greatham to the south-west, and the Greatham Beck to the west. In 1831, the parish contained the townships of Stranton, Seaton Carew, and Brierton.
The area's name was last used as an electoral ward name in the 2011 UK Census, with a population of 6,105. It covered most of the town centre with parts of Stranton in the south west of the ward. For the 2015 general election Burn Valley, Headland & Harbour and Victoria replaced the majority of the former ward area.
History
Samuel A. Lewis's A Topographical Dictionary of England (1848) says:
Lewis noted that the parish church was on high ground in the centre of the village and that its tower was a landmark for seamen, and that there was also a Wesleyan Methodist chapel. He reported two benefices, Stranton and Seaton-Carew, and two schools, an almost new National School in the hamlet of Middleton, built in 1840, and a small endowed school in Stranton teaching fifteen children.
In draining a morass at Stranton, a large quantity of human bones was found, which may have been the remains of the Scots killed at the Siege of Hartlepool in 1644.

David John Howard Thompson (25 December 1961 – 23 October 2010) was the sixth prime minister of Barbados from 15 January 2008 until his death from pancreatic cancer on 23 October 2010.
Early life
Thompson was born in London to Charles Thompson, an Afro-Barbadian porter and painter, and Margaret Knight, a White Barbadian author, secretary and nurse. Both parents remained strong influences in Thompson's life. Thompson was brought up with his three siblings at Fitts Village, Saint James.
Thompson attended primary school at St Gabriel's Junior School and secondary school at Combermere School. He earned a Legal Education Certificate from Hugh Wooding Law School. Thompson graduated with honors from the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill law school in 1984. He was admitted to the Barbados bar in 1984 and taught as a part-time tutor in law at the University of the West Indies from 1986 to 1988. His law firm was Thompson & Associates.
Thompson was married to Mara Thompson (née Giraudy), who was born in Saint Lucia. The couple had three daughters - Misha, Oya and Osa-Marie. The family resided in Mapps, St. Philip, though Thompson resided at the official Prime Minister's residence Ilaro Court from 2008 until 2010.
Politics
Thompson first entered the Democratic Labour Party (Barbados) in 1978 and served in the Senate of Barbados until 1987. A by-election after the death of the Prime Minister Errol Barrow, gaining his parliamentary seat for Saint John in 1987. During Erskine Sandiford's term as Prime Minister, Thompson served as Minister of Community Development and Culture from 1991 to 1993. He was subsequently appointed Minister of Finance from 1993 to 1994. Thompson was elected and became leader of the DLP when Sandiford resigned after losing a parliamentary no confidence motion. Thompson was unopposed in that Leadership Election. Thompson unsuccessfully led the Democratic Labour Party in elections in 1994 and 1999. Shortly after the 1994 Barbadian general election, Thompson made his shadow cabinet including him as Shadow Minister for Finance, Economic Affairs and Investment He resigned as party leader in September 2000 following his third electoral defeat as party leader in the St. Thomas by-election. A leadership election was held to determine the future of the Democratic Labour Party (Barbados), where Clyde Mascoll defeated Freundel Stuart. However, when party leader Clyde Mascoll was forced to resign (as party leader) since his popularity had been eroded by internal party skirmishes it cleared the way for Thompson to once again became opposition leader but he became Chairman of the Democratic Labour Party (Barbados) instead of President in January 2006. Clyde Mascoll after seemingly being mistreated by the party he was born into and grew up in then decided to switch allegiance to the Barbados Labour Party,
The DLP won the general election held on 15 January 2008 with 20 seats against 10 for the Barbados Labour Party, which was led by former Prime Minister Owen Arthur. Thompson was sworn in as Prime Minister on 16 January, becoming Barbados' sixth prime minister and the third to serve under the DLP. Thompson was also re-elected to his own seat from St. John constituency with 84% of the vote. He announced his Cabinet on 19 January, including himself as Minister of Finance, Economic Affairs and Development, Labour, Civil Service and Energy; it was sworn in on 20 January.
He never resided at the Prime Minister's Official Residence at Ilaro Court, and stated that he never wanted to move there, and so lived at Mapps, Barbados during his tenure as Prime Minister.
The Governor-General scheduled a by-election for 20 January 2011 to fill the vacant seat in the House of Assembly formerly held by Thompson. Thompson's wife Mara was the DLP-candidate in the by-election for her late husband's former seat. She won the seat by an overwhelming margin, defeating BLP opponent Hudson Griffith 4 613 votes to 553.
Health issues and death
At a media briefing at his official Ilaro Court residence on 14 May 2010, Thompson, accompanied by his personal physician, Richard Ishmael, said that he had been suffering with stomach pains since early March. He also revealed he had undergone tests in Barbados, which were inconclusive, and had also travelled with Ishmael to New York where additional tests were carried out. The process of testing would be ongoing and, because of this, Attorney General and Deputy Prime Minister Freundel Stuart would assume the Prime Minister's office in Thompson's absence.
On 30 August, Thompson re-assumed his post of Prime Minister, having returned to Barbados the day before. On 7 September, he left Barbados for New York on a trip of unknown nature. A short time later Thompson's personal physician, Richard Ishmael, informed the general public that the Prime Minister was suffering from pancreatic cancer. However, when the news came of the fact that it was pancreatic cancer, many realised that such a diagnosis would have been known in the very early stages of the tests (even the local ones) and that it was kept secret more so for political reasons than for personal reasons.
Prior to Thompson's death a prepared letter was read-out on behalf of Thompson outlining his desires for political party and country. Hours later, Thompson died at his home in Mapps, St. Philip, at approximately 2:10 am on 23 October 2010. His mother, wife Mara and daughters Misha, Oya and Osa-Marie were by his side, as well as his sister, Liz.
Thompson was the third sitting Prime Minister of Barbados to die in office following the deaths of Tom Adams in 1985 and Errol Barrow in 1987. He was also the 7th head of government of a CARICOM country to die in office since CARICOM was founded in 1973.
State funeral and mourning
As news of Thompson's death spread, regional and international dignitaries expressed their condolences. to the Thompson family and the nation. Pope Benedict XVI was among those offering condolences for the Prime Minister and stated that he "invokes God's blessings upon the late Prime Minister's family and the people of Barbados." Barbadian pop star Rihanna, who was appointed by Thompson as an 'Honorary Ambassador of Culture' of Barbados, also expressed her sadness at the passing of the Prime Minister. Condolences have also been extended to Barbados by the United Nations General Assembly, and the then Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon. As well as former Prime Minister Lloyd Erskine Sandiford, and U.S. President Obama.
Barbados entered an official period of mourning for the former Prime Minister on 23 October. On that date, the government-owned national broadcaster began airing tributes of the Prime Minister. Such tributes included some of Thompson's speeches and debates, as well as some local and international statements of condolence to his family, extended family, and the nation. The mourning period was also stated to be in effect for Barbados until the official state funeral. On Monday 25 October Senator Maxine McClean announced in a televised broadcast the full arrangements for the funeral of PM Thompson; Senator McClean stated that on 28 October 2010 (from 9am–11am) Thompson would first have a closed viewing in the east-wing of the Parliament of Barbados. That viewing will be upstairs in the chamber of the House of Assembly and would follow Barbados' Table of Precedence for members of Government from the Governor General down to MPs. On that same date members of the general public could later view Thompson at the House of Assembly from 11am-5pm. On 29 October, from 2pm-5pm a public viewing would take place at Thompson's alma mater, The Combermere School. On 30 October, a viewing for the general public took place at the George Street Auditorium from 9am-5pm. On Monday, 1 November from 10am-5pm a general public viewing took place in Thompson's home constituency of Saint John at the Parish Church. On 2 November, Thompson will again have a general public viewing at the House of Assembly from 9am-5pm. The official state funeral for the Prime Minister took place on 3 November at the Kensington Oval stadium and was strictly a ticket only event. Over ten thousand persons, including foreign dignitaries and diplomatic representatives, attended the state funeral. Thousands more lined the streets of Bridgetown that morning to pay their respects as the official funeral procession made its way through the city en route to the Oval. Both the state funeral at the Kensington Oval and the interment at the St. John's (Anglican) Parish Church were broadcast live by CBC TV 8. Mr. Thompson's final resting place is in the church's cemetery and overlooks the east coast of the island.

Isabelle Stone (October 18, 1868 – 1966) was an American physicist and educator. She was one of the founders of the American Physical Society. She was among the first women to be awarded a PhD in physics in the United States.
Early life and education
Stone was born in 1868 to Harriet H. Leonard Stone and Leander Stone in Chicago. She completed a bachelor's degree at Wellesley College in 1890, and was among the first women to gain a PhD in physics in the United States, earning hers just two years after Caroline Willard Baldwin earned a Doctor of Science at Cornell University. Stone completed doctoral work at the University of Chicago. Her 1897 thesis, On the Electrical Resistance of Thin Films, showed that very thin metal films showed a higher resistivity than the bulk metal.
Career
Stone taught a year at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore. She was a physics instructor at Vassar College from 1898 to 1906, and head of the physics department at Sweet Briar College from 1915 to 1923. From 1908 to 1914, she and her sister Harriet Stone ran a school for American girls in Rome, and later in life they ran another school for girls in Washington, D.C.
Stone was one of two women (out of a total of 836) who attended the first International Congress of Physics in Paris (the other being Marie Curie). In 1899, she was one of forty physicists (and one of two women, the other being Marcia Keith) at the first meeting of the American Physical Society, held at Columbia University.
Stone's research was on the electrical resistance and other properties of thin films.

Udvar () is a village in Baranya county, Hungary. This village is found near the Danube River.
Until the end of World War II, the inhabitants were Danube Swabians, also called locally as Stifolder, because their ancestors once came around 1720 from Fulda (district). Most of the former German settlers were expelled to allied-occupied Germany and allied-occupied Austria in 1945–1948, about the Potsdam Agreement.
Only a few Germans of Hungary live there, the majority today are the descendants of Hungarians from the Czechoslovak–Hungarian population exchange. They occupied the houses of the former Danube Swabians inhabitants.

The Capt. N. H. Wulff House, at 549 Brown St. in Napa, California, was built in 1885. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
It is a two-story wood frame Italianate-style house. In 1992 it was "virtually unaltered" since its original construction, and retained its architectural integrity.
It was deemed significant as one of few surviving buildings associated with Napa's maritime history. The navigable Napa River flows from Napa to the San Francisco Bay, and early in Napa's history was essentially the only way to transport produce and passengers to San Fran, and assorted goods and passengers back. River traffic did not decline until the 1920s. Captain N. H. Wulff was "one of the city's most important steamboat owners and masters during the last half of the nineteenth century. Because Wulff was engaged in carrying goods and passengers vital to the growth of the town, the building is also significant in the areas of commerce and transportation.... Wulff had the house erected at the height of his career in 1885 and lived in it until his death in 1911."
The house was designed by William H. Corlett and built by Thomas Derry.

The black-backed tanager (Stilpnia peruviana) is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is endemic to forest and shrub into south-eastern Brazil. When first described it was mistakenly believed that it originates from Peru, leading to the misleading scientific name peruviana. It is closely related to the chestnut-backed tanager, and the two have sometimes been considered conspecific.
It is threatened by habitat loss.

Cedric Bryan Maxwell (born November 21, 1955) is an American retired professional basketball player now in radio broadcasting. Nicknamed "Cornbread", he played 11 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and played a key role in two championships with the Boston Celtics.
After a college career in which he led the UNC Charlotte 49ers to an NCAA Final Four appearance in 1977, he was drafted by the Boston Celtics. After coming off the bench his rookie year, he was elevated to a starting small forward position for the 1978–1979 season, a disappointing 29–53 team on which Maxwell was the lone bright spot. The following year, Larry Bird joined the Celtics, and the team started a resurgence that saw them become one of the dominant teams of the 1980s. Maxwell and Bird were joined in the 1980–1981 season by starting center Robert Parish and rookie forward Kevin McHale, a year in which the team won the NBA championship and Maxwell was named Finals MVP.
Maxwell and McHale would compete for the starting forward position over the next several seasons, with McHale winning the starting job and Maxwell being traded to the Los Angeles Clippers just prior to the 1985–1986 season. Maxwell would play for a season and a half for the Clippers, before being traded midway through the 1986–1987 season to the Houston Rockets, where he would finish out his career before retiring after the 1987–1988 season with over 10,000 points scored over his career.
Since retiring as a player, he briefly coached the Long Island Surf of the United States Basketball League before starting his career as a radio broadcaster, serving as the color commentator for Celtics radio broadcasts since 2001. His jersey number 31 was retired by the Celtics in 2003.
College career
Maxwell was a star forward/center for the UNC Charlotte 49ers. Among the 49ers, Maxwell ranks 6th all-time in points scored and his No. 33 jersey was retired in 1977, when he led UNC Charlotte to the NCAA Final Four. Upon completion of his career at Charlotte, Maxwell was the 12th overall pick in the 1977 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Boston Celtics, where he played for eight of his eleven seasons. During his time at UNC Charlotte, he was initiated in Omega Psi Phi fraternity via the Epsilon Zeta chapter.
Professional career
Maxwell made an impact in his second season with the Celtics. While Boston was mired in an otherwise awful 1978–79 NBA season, as they awaited Larry Bird's decision to sign with the franchise, the second-year power forward averaged 19.0 points and 9.9 rebounds per game. The Celtics would go just 29–53 on the year, but the young Maxwell's potential, along with the promising addition of Bird and others, set the stage for what would become an NBA dynasty.
Maxwell was best known for his moves near or beneath the basket. He was very effective in the low post, faking defenders into the air, drawing contact, then making high percentage shots, and sometimes drawing a foul, using either his jump-hook close to the basket or going up against the glass. It was rare that Maxwell took an outside jump shot, especially when Celtic teammates like Bird or Tiny Archibald were on the floor. This helped the Celtics run a balanced offense with a formidable inside game that was hard for most teams to defend.
Maxwell, in addition to being a dangerous scorer and a colorful character, was a clutch performer in the playoffs. Maxwell was named MVP of the 1981 NBA Finals. Three years later, Maxwell scored 24 points against the Los Angeles Lakers in the decisive game-seven victory during the 1984 NBA Finals. Before the game, he told his teammates to "climb on my back, boys." Maxwell's colorful side was also on display in the series as he mocked second-year Laker forward James Worthy's inability to make free throws during overtime of game 4 by walking across the lane between free throws with his hands around his own neck, suggesting Worthy's choking under pressure. Maxwell also made fun of Kurt Rambis prior to Game 4 of the 1984 Finals, wearing Rambis's trademark glasses and inadvertently missing a long range shot in front of loyal Rambis fans known as the Rambis Youth. The following season, after an injury, Maxwell lost his starting role to Kevin McHale, who had spent two seasons coming off the bench and was in the process of winning his second consecutive Sixth Man of the Year.
Maxwell was traded, with a draft pick, on September 6, 1985, to the Los Angeles Clippers for center Bill Walton. Maxwell spent a season and a half with the Clippers before being dealt to the Houston Rockets in January, 1987, for two draft picks. He finally retired after the 1987–88 NBA season, having scored 10,465 points and pulled down 5,261 rebounds over the course of 11 seasons, which averages over the course of his career to 12.5 points and 6.3 rebounds a game.
Career after the NBA
Maxwell was the 22nd former Celtic to have his jersey (number 31) retired by the Celtics on December 15, 2003. He is now a radio broadcaster for WBZ-FM in Boston, where he has announced Boston Celtics games with Sean Grande since 2001 and lives in Weston, Massachusetts. He was also a frequent co-host on WEEI's sports talk radio shows, such as The Big Show with former Celtics TV announcer Glenn Ordway, before Ordway parted with the station. He made guest appearances with the successor program Salk & Holley. In June 2013, Grande and Maxwell, better known in Boston as Grande and Max, began co-hosting a new show, Celtics Summer Cooler, a weekly offseason update on the Celtics. Maxwell came under fire for comments he made on the air during a game in 2007. Unhappy with the officiating of referee Violet Palmer, he told listeners that Palmer should "go back to the kitchen" and "make me some bacon and eggs." Maxwell apologized during a subsequent broadcast.
On the March 16, 2010 Primetime with The Packman radio show (WFNZ-AM) originating out of Charlotte, Cedric Maxwell stated he was open to the coaching position at Charlotte. He went on to say he was hoping the school would at least offer him an interview.
Nickname
Maxwell received the nickname "Cornbread" from his college teammate Melvin Watkins after the pair went to see the movie Cornbread, Earl and Me, in which a 12-year-old boy is traumatized by the murder of his friend, a star basketball player. Watkins thought that Maxwell looked like the title character (played by Jamaal Wilkes) and so began calling him Cornbread. Since Maxwell did not like the nickname, it did not gain widespread use until Maxwell was named MVP of the NIT tournament in 1976, when, according to Watkins, "The New York media picked up on [the nickname]."

In Greek mythology, Trambelus (Ancient Greek: Τράμβηλος) was a son of Telamon (thus a half-brother of Ajax the Great and Teucer). His mother was the Trojan captive, Hesione or Theaneira.
Mythology
When Trambelus' mother had already been made pregnant by Telamon, she escaped by jumping off his ship and swimming until she reached the land of Miletus. She then hid in the forest but was soon found by Arion, king of Miletus, who rescued her and raised her newborn son Trambelus as his own.
According to Parthenius, Trambelus lived on Lesbos where he fell in love with a girl named Apriate, but she rejected all his advances. Desperate, he laid a snare for her and tried to take her by force, but she defended herself so vigorously that he got enraged and pushed her off a cliff into the sea; alternately, she leaped off the cliff herself, preferring to die rather than give up her chastity.
Not much later, the same source relates, Lesbos was attacked by Achilles and his troops. Trambelus was among the defenders of the island and was mortally wounded in the battle. Achilles, impressed by his valor, inquired of his name; Trambelus managed to answer before he died. On realizing that the fallen opponent was his cousin, Achilles mourned Trambelus and piled up a tomb for him on the seashore; this tomb was still there in historical times.
John Tzetzes relates the same story of Trambelus' death, but states that it took place in Miletus (not on Lesbos). This version is also hinted at by Athenaeus, who refers to Trambelus as "king of the Leleges", and informs that there was a spring in Miletus known as the "Achilles' Well", in which Achilles was believed to have cleansed himself for the murder of Trambelus; the water of the spring was said to be salty on the surface, but very sweet in the main stream.

Tsogo Secondary School is a school founded on ethos of Roman Catholic Church. It is an English medium High School located on the Most Holy Redeemer Catholic Church campus in Mmakau North West of the City of Tshwane, in the North West Province of South Africa. When the school was founded the Sisters of Mercy were at the helm of its administration.
History
Tsogo Secondary School (formerly Tsogo High School) was established at the request of the Stigmatine Fathers by the Sister of Mercy in January 1975. ‘Tsogo' is a Setswana name meaning ‘Resurrection' - thus, since the school was founded on Catholic ethos, the name translates to the 'Resurrection of Christ'.
Beginning
The story of Tsogo Secondary School begins with the Catholic (Sisters of Mercy) . The Sisters of Mercy are a Catholic Women Religious Congregation founded in Dublin, Ireland which dates back to the 1970s and has amongst other things worked to establish community centres, schools, adult education centres and various centres across the country and globe. The Congregation has worked for over 30 years to assist and uplift communities through Christianity and philosophies of collectivism and self-help.
Tsogo Today
The school's campus also houses a primary school, Morekolodi Primary School and a preschool, Motsweding. In addition, the campus houses a community centre, an adult education centre, a church, a health centre, a refugee centre and a convent. The school is housed in a campus that gives learners an opportunity to interact with the community in some activities and therefore gain from social interaction and community work. The school has a small library, computer room, science and biology laboratories, technology room and a newly built mathematics lab.
The school has produced many successful alumni who have gone on to achieve success in their academic undertakings and careers. The majority of learners from the school come from the villages of Mmakau, Bethanie, Hebron and nearby townships of (Garankuwa|Ga-Rankuwa), (Mothotlung),(Mabopane), (Rankotea) and (Soshanguve). The community centre, called Mmashiko offers adult education. The community centre, which is adjacent to the school offers classes such as computer literacy, sewing and dressmaking, and bricklaying.

In generative grammar and related frameworks, m-command is a syntactic relation between two nodes in a syntactic tree. A node m-commands a node if the maximal projection of dominates , but neither nor dominates the other.
In government and binding theory, m-command was used to define the central syntactic relation of government. However, it has been largely replaced by c-command in current research. M-command is a broader relation than c-command, since a node m-commands every node that it c-commands, as well as the specifier of the phrase that it heads. Like c-command, m-command is defined over constituency-based trees and plays no role in frameworks which adopt a different notion of syntactic structure.

Charles Vernon (Chuck) Shank (born July 12, 1943) is an American physicist, best known as the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 1989 to 2004.
Early life and education
Charles Vernon (Chuck) Shank was born in Mount Holly, New Jersey, on July 12, 1943. He entered the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in 1965, his Master of Science (M.S.) in 1966, and his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in 1969, all in electrical engineering, writing his doctoral thesis on "Nonlinear Wave Interaction Spectroscopy", under the supervision of Steven E. Schwartz.
Career
After graduation, Shank joined the staff of the Bell Laboratories as a researcher. He would remain there for 20 years, becoming head of its Quantum Physics and Electronic Research Department in 1976, and director of its Electronics Research Laboratory in 1983. Shank introduced the use of short laser pulses to study ultrafast events, ones that take place in a femtosecond, and is considered to be the founder of ultrafast science. He pioneered the field of femtochemistry, developing its techniques and technologies, and laser communications, and is the co-inventor of the distributed feedback laser. He studied the femtochemistry of rhodopsin, a photosensitive pigment found in the eye that is an important component of the mechanism of human vision. But since many chemical reactions take place in femtoseconds, ultrafast science found uses in chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, medicine, meteorology and manufacturing.
Shank became the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1989. Under his directorship, the laboratory pursued a diverse range of initiatives, usually in cooperation with other agencies. Through the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, he made the laboratory a locus for supercomputing. Working with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, he helped create the Joint Genome Institute to work on the Human Genome Project. Through this joint effort the complete sequences of Chromosomes 5, 16 and 19 were mapped. The laboratory's SuperNova Acceleration Probe (SNAP) formed part of the Joint Dark Energy Mission to explore dark energy in collaboration with NASA, and it worked with the University of California, San Francisco's Comprehensive Cancer Center to study the disease. He strongly supported nanoscience, and was co-author of Complex Systems: Science for the 21st Century (1999), in which it was an important theme.
In 1989 Shank was a member of the California Council on Science and Technology. The following year he was a member of the National Critical Technologies Panel in the Office of Science and Technology. In this role he helped identify the most critical technologies required to advance the United States' national security and economic prosperity. He chaired the National Research Council's Committee on Optical Science and Engineering, and was the co-author of Harnessing Light: Optical Science and Engineering for the 21st Century (1998). He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences' Air Force Studies Board, and of the Central Intelligence Agency's Intelligence Science Board.
Shank retired from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 2004, and became a professor of chemistry, physics, electrical engineering, and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. , he is a member of the advisory board of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. He remains a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, and is a member of campus advisory boards. He is also a senior fellow at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Research Campus.
Accolades
Over the years, Shank received a number of accolades and awards. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1984, the National Academy of Engineering in 1983, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Optical Society of America. He was awarded the Optical Society of America's R. W. Wood Prize in 1981, the Franklin Institute's Edward Longstreth Medal in 1982, the IEEE's Morris E. ds Award in 1983 and David Sarnoff Award in 1989), the University of California's Distinguished Engineering Alumnus Award in 1990, the International Society for Optical Engineering's Edgerton Award in 1990, the American Physical Society's George E. Pake Prize in 1996, and Arthur L. Schawlow Prize in Laser Science in 1997, the Optical Society of America's Charles Hard Townes Award in 2002, and the United States Department of Energy's Enrico Fermi Award in 2014.

Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Wilmington was part of the United States Navy reserve fleets in Wilmington, North Carolina at . The reserve fleet was at and overflowed out of the former North Carolina Shipbuilding Company in the dredge out Brunswick River. The ships lined both sides of the Brunswick River. The freshwater of the river made a good spot to store ships. The reserve fleet was opened in 1946 to store the now many surplus ships after World War II. The mothball fleet was mostly cargo ships used in the merchant marine navy. When opened it had mostly cargo ships and a few troop ships. At its peak it had 300 Victory ships and Liberty ships, many that were built at the nearby former North Carolina Shipbuilding Company Shipyard. Some ships in the fleet were reactivated for the Korean War and Vietnam War. Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Wilmington closed in 1962, with the last ship removed in February 27, 1970. The ships in the fleet were either scrapped, used as targets or move to the James River Reserve Fleet and Beaumont Reserve Fleet.
SS Dwight W. Morrow was the last ship to depart Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Wilmington, she was scrapped in February 1970.
Notable former ships
USS Boulder Victory (AK-227) became one of many Seagoing cowboys ships doing livestock war relief, late in life the University of California conducted thermal stress tests on her.
SS Edward W. Burton removed and converted to USS Interceptor (AGR-8) a for the US Navy in 1955.
SS James F. Harrell removed and converted to USS Picket (YAGR-7) a Guardian radar picket ship for the US Navy in 1955.
SS William J. Riddle removed and converted to USS Tracer (AGR-15) a Guardian radar picket ship for the US Navy in 1955.
SS James W. Wheeler removed and converted to USS Searcher (AGR-4) a Guardian radar picket ship for the US Navy in 1955.
