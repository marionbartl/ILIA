The European Commission (EC) and Japan have announced the launch of six joint research projects, supported by £15.3m+ (€18m) in funding, that aim to build networks which are “5000 times faster than today's average European broadband ISP speed (100Gbps compared to 19.7Mbps)“.
The telecoms experts among you will know that 100Gbps+ (Gigabits per second) fibre optic links are nothing new but most of these are major submarine or national cable links. The new effort appears to be looking further ahead, with a view to improving the efficiency of such networks and perhaps even bringing them closer to homes.
It's frequently noted that demand for data is putting a growing strain on broadband connections (the EU expects data traffic to grow 12-fold by 2018), which is partly fuelled by every faster fixed line ISP and mobile broadband connectivity. But technology is always evolving to keep pace.
Neelie Kroes, EC Vice-President, said: “Our Future Internet should know no barriers, least of all barriers created because we did not prepare for the data revolution.”

Will set up joint EU-Japan experimental platforms that will help universities and research centres test new network technologies. Such new platforms will improve researchers' use of their experimental facilities.
A quick glance at each of the projects reveals that this seems to be more about improving what already exists, yet in some circles even 100Gbps is beginning to look old-hat. Never the less many of the improvements mentioned above will, if ever adopted, eventually filter down to benefit everybody.
After all, several UK ISPs are already offering 1Gbps home connections (e.g. Hyperoptic, CityFibre / Fibreband in Bournemouth, Gigaclear etc.) and that's only 99-fold slower than a 100Gbps link. In the realm of evolving internet access services that's only a short hop, unless your infrastructure is still limited by a copper last mile.
But there's little point in having a 100Gbps link (don't worry we won't see this in homes for a fair few years) if the ISP can't supply the capacity for it and that's another part of the new effort. It's important to stress that this is not about tackling today's needs; it's all about the future. Not so long ago we were still stuck on 50Kbps dialup.
Jennifer and Gary Block allege they were denied service for bringing service dogs into Aime's Love
A pair of disabled veterans have filed a federal lawsuit against a Longmont gluten-free bakery and the city alleging that bakery owners denied the couple service because they brought service dogs into the business on two separate occasions.
Jennifer and Gary Block also allege that Longmont police officers who responded to Aime's Love during the second incident handled the situation improperly and unlawfully made the couple leave the business.
The Blocks are seeking unspecified damages.
A Longmont police report paints a different version of the events, with police saying the couple left on their own, and the owners of the bakery merely questioning whether the dogs were legitimate service dogs.
The suit alleges that the bakery's owners and the city violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. The suit also contends that the bakery violated the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, and that the city violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
The ADA allows people with disabilities to bring animals into businesses and other buildings where they would not usually be permitted.
Jennifer Love Walter, co-owner of Aime's Love, said she was aware of the suit when reached by phone on Friday afternoon but declined to comment in a subsequent phone call.
Longmont police Chief Mike Butler and city spokesman Rigo Leal declined to comment in separate emails. The suit is not specifically filed against the police department but the city as a whole.

The Blocks allege that they entered the bakery on March 8 with a Great Dane named Rajah that the suit characterizes as a "service animal in training" but they were denied service. As they left, the couple contends they asked the owners to familiarize themselves with laws regarding service animals, according to court records.
Jennifer and Gary Block allege that they returned 10 days later with a different service dog, Loki, and were again denied service. The suit states that the owners of the bakery threatened to call police, which the couple "encouraged."
The suit alleges that a Longmont dispatcher told the owners that the plaintiffs were "trespassing." Four police officers — two of whom were being trained — responded to the bakery, and the couple alleges the officers behaved in a "dismissive and condescending" manner and didn't make the proper accommodations that should be afforded to people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental health issues.
Police eventually told the couple to leave the bakery, the suit alleges. The suit also contends that the bakery owners and police violated federal disability law when they asked for "proof" that their dog was indeed a service animal. Jennifer Block told police that a person can ask if a dog is a service animal and what task it performs but can't ask any further questions of the dog's handler.
Attempts to obtain the police dispatch recording on Friday were not successful. Dispatch notes obtained by the Times-Call state that police responded to the bakery because the owner told the couple they couldn't have the dog in the store, and they didn't have proof of the dog's status or a service animal vest on the dog.
A Longmont police report indicates that the Blocks appeared to leave the business on their own accord. Outside, Gary Block produced a card that identified Loki as a service dog. The officer told Block that although he was not required to produce any proof, doing so could have averted the incident.
A second officer remarked in the report that Gary Block had been recording the incident and the officer found that "odd," especially if the incident was not "pre-meditated on their part."
One of the business's owners told police she didn't want to press trespassing charges against the couple but had concerns the dogs weren't really service animals and that their presence would violate health codes, the report stated.
The Blocks' attorney, Zach Warren, said in an email that Gary Block is a former United States Marine who was injured in a car crash that left him suffering from "significant neurocognitive deficits." Jennifer Block was a Navy Hospital corpsman stationed with the Marines.
He said that he would classify the suit as a civil rights lawsuit because disability rights are an "important facet of the broader civil rights discipline."
"It also just so happens that disabilities (and particularly mental health issues) play a significant role in many other kinds of civil rights cases — including the use of force by law enforcement, conditions of confinement in jails and prisons, and so forth," Warren said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Barack Obama has opened an 8-point national lead on Republican John McCain as the U.S. presidential rivals turn their focus to a general election race, according to a Reuters/Zogby poll released on Wednesday.

Obama, who was tied with McCain in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup last month, moved to a 48 percent to 40 percent lead over the Arizona senator in May as he took command of his grueling Democratic presidential duel with rival Hillary Clinton.
The Illinois senator has not yet secured the Democratic presidential nomination to run against McCain in November.
The poll also found Obama expanded his lead over Clinton in the Democratic race to 26 percentage points, doubling his advantage from mid-April as Democrats begin to coalesce around Obama and prepare for the general election battle with McCain.
“Obama has been very resilient, bouncing back from rough periods and doing very well with independent voters,” pollster John Zogby said. “The race with McCain is going to be very competitive.”
The poll was taken Thursday through Sunday during a period when Obama came under attack from President George W. Bush and McCain for his promise to talk to hostile foreign leaders without preconditions.
Obama's gains followed a month in which he was plagued with a series of campaign controversies and suffered two big losses to Clinton in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
The poll was conducted after Obama denounced his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who made a series of public appearances that rekindled a controversy over his inflammatory comments on race and religion.
Obama also survived a furor over his comments about “bitter” small-town residents who cling to guns and religion out of frustration over their economic concerns.
Obama edged closer to clinching the Democratic nomination on Tuesday when he split two nominating contests with Clinton, beating the New York senator in Oregon and losing in Kentucky to gain a majority of pledged delegates won in state-by-state nominating contests.
The results put him within easy range of the 2,026 delegates needed for the nomination. Just three Democratic nominating contests remain before voting concludes on June 3.
OBAMA BETTER ON ECONOMY
The poll found Obama was seen as a better steward of the economy than McCain, leading 48 percent to 39 percent. McCain led Obama by 3 points last month on an issue that is certain to be crucial in their campaign.
Obama led McCain among independents, 47 percent to 35 percent, and led among some groups of voters who have backed Clinton during their Democratic primary battle, including Catholics, Jews, union households and voters making less than $35,000 a year.
McCain led among whites, NASCAR fans, and elderly voters. McCain led with voters who believed the United States was on the right track, and Obama led with the much higher percentage of voters who believed it was on the wrong track.
“Clearly voters are looking for change. Every problem Obama has had in consolidating his base and reaching to the center, John McCain has the same sort of problem,” Zogby said.
“It's McCain's lead among voters over the age of 65 that is keeping him within shouting distance of Obama,” he said.
The poll found Clinton, who has shrugged off calls to quit the Democratic race, tied at 43 percent with McCain in the national poll. She led McCain by 47 percent to 40 percent on who would be the better manager of the economy.
Obama and Clinton have refrained from attacking each other in recent weeks as Obama has turned his focus to McCain.
But Zogby said the attacks on Obama by Bush and McCain, who have been critical of his willingness to talk to leaders of countries like Iran, did not appear to hurt Obama. If anything, he said, it reminded voters of McCain's ties to Bush, whose approval rating is still mired at record lows.
Slideshow (7 Images)
“The president is so unpopular. To inject himself into a presidential campaign does not help John McCain, particularly when McCain is tied to Bush,” Zogby said.
The national survey of 516 likely Democratic primary voters had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points. The poll of the national race between McCain and the two Democratic contenders surveyed 1,076 likely voters with a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

Even from a distance, the view of Panama City is impressive. Dozens of skyscrapers line the Pacific coast and hint at great wealth – some of it from the business of hidden money. As the plane approaches Panama City, the container ships queuing for the Panama Canal fall into view, and the rainforest can just about be deciphered on the horizon. Somewhere in between, right behind the skyscrapers, lies the financial district and the headquarters of Mossack Fonseca. The Panamanian law firm has not only helped prime ministers, kings and presidents hide their money. It has also provided services to dictators, drug cartels, Mafia clans, fraudsters, weapons dealers, and regimes like North Korea or Iran. In brief, it seems Mossack Fonseca has helped and continues to help the world's biggest villains cover up their doings. In focus: the German's law firm Down in the financial district, hardly anyone refers to Mossack Fonseca's founder, 68-year-old Jürgen Mossack, by his name. He is known only as “the German”. Mossack and his law firm have been selling anonymous shell companies for almost 40 years. In many instances, they have also provided sham directors for these companies with the purpose of covering up who's really behind them. Mossack Fonseca is one of the biggest providers of such services in the world. Now the law firm is at the center of the Panama Papers, a project that began with the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ). Starting more than a year ago, an anonymous source began sending the SZ internal Mossack Fonseca data. Over a period of several months, the volume of data increased to a total of 2.6 terabytes. For the past year, around 400 investigative reporters from more than 110 media organizations in over 80 countries have been poring over this enormous mass of data. SZ and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington have coordinated the project. It is difficult to pick the most spectacular story. There are clues that appear to lead to Vladimir's Putin's innermost circle and hundreds of millions of dollars. Another story reveals that Iceland's current prime minister and two of his ministers held offshore companies. The doings of corrupt FIFA officials also appear in the data, as does FC Barcelona's superstar Lionel Messi.
The leak extends far beyond the law firm's clients. The documents reveal that Mossack Fonseca, Mossfon for short, may have failed to observe the law in a number of instances. It appears that sanctions may have been violated using Mossfon structures, and that the firm possibly aided and abetted tax evaders and operated with money from illegal sources. The leak, which includes about five million emails, contains an abundance of clues that Mossfon employees also knew about the questionable dealings of their clients. As a result of the leak, Mossack Fonseca has lost its unique selling point, namely its ability to guarantee utmost confidentiality. Searching for clues in Panama City The drive from the airport to the financial district is a journey through the extremes that define Panama City. Just a few hundred meters away from crowded slums, the facades of the city's skyscrapers sparkle in the sun. By comparison, the three-story glass building that houses Mossack Fonseca's headquarters looks like a relic from another era. Security guards patrol the building's entrance. According to internal emails, the reception desk keeps a list of personae non gratae, and journalists are particularly unwelcome. The Süddeutsche Zeitung too was denied an interview with Jürgen Mossack. His spokeswoman explained that the law firm's partners never give interviews. And yet there is so much to talk about. Questions addressed to him, delivered to his personal address in a letter, were left unanswered. In an email, Mossack answered only that the requested period for a response was too short. When SZ offered more time, Mossack didn't respond.
Jürgen Mossack, Christoph Zollinger and Ramón Fonseca
Jürgen Mossack's law firm left about 50 questions regarding its activities unanswered. Instead, it responded only with a very general statement affirming that Mossack Fonseca always acts in accordance with the law. It's no coincidence that “the German's” law firm should thrive in Panama. Tucked between Costa Rica and Colombia, the tiny Central American country is home to more offshore providers than any other country in the world. Evidently, the heart of the offshore world beats right here in the tropics. Jürgen Mossack was born in 1948 in Fürth, Germany, thousands of kilometers from Panama. His mother was a saleswoman and his father a mechanical engineer. The family moved to Panama from Germany in the early 1960s, where Jürgen Mossack went to school and then studied law. After graduation, he worked for law firms in Panama and London before founding the Jürgen Mossack Law Firm in Panama City in 1977. At the time, the corrupt General Omar Torrijos's military junta ruled the country. In 1983, the dictator Manuel Noriega took over. Despite political upheaval, business was good for Mossack's law firm, which specialized in shell companies. During Noriega's reign, Panama became the banking center of Colombia's Medellín drug cartel, in part because the corrupt dictator was on the payroll of several drug traffickers. In Panama, these criminals found a place where they could do their business reliably and safely, away from the public eye. Jürgen Mossack apparently provided services to at least one of the era's big drug bosses, the Mexican Caro Quintero. After Quintero had an American secret agent kidnapped, tortured and killed in 1985, the United States launched a manhunt to track him down. He was arrested in April 1985. Only a few days before his arrest, one of his middlemen had Mossack Fonseca set up a company to hide Quintero's fortune. A villa in Costa Rica was part of this fortune. Jürgen Mossack himself acted as its sham director. In an internal email exchange that addressed the Costa Rican villa, Jürgen Mossack wrote:
"Pablo Escobar was a baby compared to R. Caro Quintero. I wouldn't want to be among those he visits after he is released from prison."
As the years progressed, “the German” gained a certain reputation in Panama. A source says that he isn't particularly selective about his clients. In his personal interactions, he is considered direct, quick-tempered, and assertive. He is known as a man of few words, but of quick decisions. And, as the source has experienced himself, it is best to stay on Mossack's good side, otherwise things can get unpleasant. In the spring of 1986, Mossack joined forces with Ramón Fonseca Mora, a Panamanian lawyer, and the Mossack Fonseca law firm was born. Today, the 64-year-old Ramón Fonseca is a political heavyweight in Panama. He has advised several presidents, is deputy chairman of the Panameñista governing party, and sits in the cabinet of Panama's current president Juan Varela. In mid-March, Süddeutsche Zeitung also sent Ramón Fonseca a request for comment on all allegations. Fonseca, too, didn't respond to the questions. However, several days later, he announced that he would temporarily be stepping down from his function as presidential advisor and co-chairman of the governing party. Fonseca, who also happens to be a prize-winning writer, announced on Twitter that he was doing this to “defend his company and his honor”. Subsequently, his fans launched diatribes against the critics of the legal offshore business in the comments sections of Panamanian news sites. In official statements, Mossack Fonseca has repeatedly stated that it does not work directly with end clients, but only with intermediaries, such as banks or asset management companies. In fact, Mossfon even offers its end clients anonymous email addresses if desired, with fake names such as “Winnie the Pooh” and “Harry Potter”, or “Fighter”, “Azkaban”, “Father”, “Daughter”, or “Son”. These names even appear in formal correspondence:
From: Mossfon Trust Corporation To: Winnie Pooh We are writing in reference to our meeting with Harry Potter and our phone call from two days ago.
Hello again Chasm backers! Production has marched forward steadily this summer, and we're happy to report that we're making great progress. It's been a while since we've done a proper production update, so we thought we'd try to break things down into categories as neatly as we can, and give you an idea of where each is. Please don't take the percentages too seriously though, they're only meant as a rough approximation!
GAME ENGINE - 100%
Just shy of 50,000 lines of code!
The game engine has been done for a while now, and we have production-quality code running on all our launch platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, and PS4) at a silky smooth 60 FPS. We're still refactoring and cleaning things up, but all the major systems are in place and functional!
STORY - 100%
The basic story for the game has been done for over a year, but we have had to modify it a bit as we've progressed and fill in some details. Back in the spring we decided it was time to do a major revision in order to ensure all of the details we've added fit in nicely. We added a new intro, outro and epilogue, as well as improved the flow and trickle of new information. Your objectives are now clearer, and the stakes feel higher than ever before!
TOOLS - 100%
Our custom editor "Apparatus" showing how the world is connected.
Our editor Apparatus was finished last year and has been working amazingly. We're able to create a lot of high quality content quickly and see what works and what doesn't. It also has custom support for the world layouts and dungeon creation, scripting, and animations so it's pretty much our secret sauce!
GAME DESIGN - 100%
As attested by the Alpha's success, the core game design is working well! There were a lot of tough things to figure out when thinking about how a procedurally assembled Metroidvania would work best: how the areas are constructed, how the portal system works, how to pace correctly with save points, and how to quickly travel back to town. Everything fits well and feels great now, but it took a LOT of experimentation to get here!
GAMEPLAY MECHANICS - 100%
The core moveset of the player was one of the very first things we tried to get right, but we have taken the opportunity to fine tune things and get it feeling perfect. We have a whole slew of awesome moves and equipment for the player to gain, spells that tie into puzzles as well as combat, tough platforming to perform, traps to avoid, and a ton of items to find. We'll be trying to add as much extra content as we can when we get to the end, but all the core mechanics are in the game now.
TILESETS - 90%
The latest revisions to the Gardens tileset including improved details, lighting, and readability.
The visual building blocks of the world are the tilesets. The tileset for each area includes the terrain you walk on, walls and ceiling, as well as the wall behind the player and parallax backgrounds. Dan is finishing up the last tileset (Outpost) while doing revisions to the others, so we're expecting these to be completed in the next few weeks!
SOUNDTRACK - 90%
A lot of effort went into finding the right atmosphere to accompany the visuals of the game and set the tone, but we finally found what we were looking for! The soundtrack tops out at 20 tracks, including 8 main area themes, plus intro, outro, credits, and many special tracks. A couple dozen rough cuts and concepts were left on the cutting room floor, so expect to hear those in the Extended Soundtrack. Jimi is working on final touches for the last area's music now, so it should be wrapped up soon!
USER INTERFACE - 80%
We recently switched from modern button labels to manual selectors for that old school feel.
We just finished up our UI framework earlier this year. We did a full pass on the game consolidating all the menu and UI functions, improved NPC menus and dialogue, journal and note interfaces, and more. We still have a little more work ahead with final styling and making sure everything is consistent before calling it done.
BOSSES - 75%
There will be 6 main bosses in the game, and as of now 5 are playable with the final boss ready to be prototyped. Some areas also have minibosses to battle, and 3 out of 5 of these have been completed.
ENEMIES - 70%
First look at one of the undead soldiers of the Keep.
We've completed the core enemies for just over 2/3 of the game as of now. The fifth area has rough prototypes while the last is in concept only, so a large amount of the content work lies here.
BACKGROUND ART - 65%
These are mainly extra background wall variations to keep things interesting, as well as what we call "set piece" rooms - rooms with large, unique (and time consuming!) backgrounds that aren't reused anywhere else. Some examples would be the Campfire room, the cave paintings and frescos, and the boss rooms. Once the tilesets are completed Dan will be focusing all his energy on these.
ROOMS - 60%
All of the areas have been planned out in detail (you can even run through the entire game at this point), but we have just over half the rooms required in the game. As well as the special core rooms, we also need to create a lot of extra rooms that will enhance the procedural nature of the game. Along with enemies this will be one of our main focuses this Fall.
SCRIPTING - 30%
A look at our script editor in Apparatus.
We've tried our best not to put scripted sequences in Chasm to keep the player always feeling in control, but there are certain instances where that has to happen, such as the intro of the game or special events. These scenes have all been written and storyboarded, but we still have to script most of them in the game.
SFX - 25%
We still have a lot of sound effect work to do, but once the Soundtrack is completed Jimi will be focusing his full attention on it. Unfortunately, sound always seems to get put off to the end, but it's almost necessary in a way so you can see what all your game needs. Consistency is big thing here, so having the perspective on how the game looks and feels should speed things up considerably.
ETC - 20%
First look at the Bestiary prototype - gotta collect them all!
There are a lot of necessary extras that don't particularly fall into any category that will take some effort to complete. Things like extra side quests, game modes, NPCs, minigames, secrets and more are all planned and detailed out, but are waiting their turn to be worked on.
CONCLUSION
As we've learned during development of this game, one of the hardest and most time-consuming parts of game development is really just finding what works best for your game. With all the difficult design decisions out of the way and the unknowns down to a minimum, we're finally able to focus 100% of our efforts on churning out awesome content to jam pack the game with.
We know everyone is anxious for a release date to be announced, but we're not quite there yet. We do have a much clearer picture of what's ahead though, and we've started talking with Sony and Steam about the best time to launch from their perspective.
It's been a long journey, but we want to thank you all again for sticking with us and believing in our vision. Chasm is turning out more amazing than we had any right to expect, and we have you, our incredible backers, to thank for helping make that happen!
P.S. One more thing before I go – three members of our team, Tim Dodd, Dan Fessler, and Dan Adelman, will be showing off Chasm in the Indie Megabooth at PAX PRIME this weekend! If you're at PAX, be sure to swing by and say hi! We'll give you a full update on how PAX went after everyone fully recovers.
TheWrap takes a look back at the last eight months to see how “Making a Murderer” changed the case of Steven Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey, who were convicted for the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach.
Making a Murderer Gets Released
The documentary was released on Dec. 18, 2015. At first, it received an approval rating of 87 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.
Ken Kratz was Bashed on Yelp
A week after the doc aired, doc fans took to Yelp to warn potential new clients checking his law practice's Yelp page against hiring him.
“Mr. Kratz is a seasoned sexual harasser, with deep knowledge of abuse victims which he took advantage of. He has a long experience in evidence fabrication, and has the required strategic thought skills to send innocent men to jail for forged crimes,” one man wrote in a Yelpreview posted Sunday. “When you think of garbage think of Mr. Kratz, he is the living representation of immorality and indecency that you need by your side to solve any legal issues.”

White House Petition
A White House Petition was started shortly after the documentary's release, asking for the pardoning of both Avery and Dassey. It required 100,000 signatures before Jan. 19 to be eligible for an official White House review.

Avery's Ex-Fiancee Calls Him a “Monster,' ‘Not Innocent'
Jodi Stachowski, the ex-fiancee of Avery, says he is a “monster” and that “he's not innocent” in the murder of Halbach.
In a January interview with HLN's Nancy Grace, Stachowski admitted that she “ate two boxes of rat poison just so I could go to the hospital to get away from him and ask them to get the police to help me.”

Investigation Discovery Aired a Special About the Case
The special, aired in February, claimed that 16 people testified to his whereabouts, saying that Avery could not have been Penny Beernsten's sexual attacker in 1985, and that all vials of blood have a puncture hole (this was a piece of key evidence that was used to suggest law enforcement had framed Avery), among other revelations.
Vice President Joe Biden has promised to “break down silos and bring all the cancer fighters together.” | Getty Biden's cancer bid exposes rift among researchers
Joe Biden's proposal for a cancer moon shot has struck a deep nerve in the research community, where cutting-edge scientists blame an entrenched medical establishment for hoarding the data needed to make breakthroughs.
Biden, whose son Beau died of brain cancer in May, said earlier this month that vast troves of research were “trapped in silos, preventing faster progress and greater reach to patients.” While few researchers disagree, many are still reluctant to share the raw data used in their research, posing big obstacles to the vice president's initiative.

The tension boiled over this month when Jeffrey Drazen, editor of the New England Journal, and co-author Dan Longo, wrote in an op-ed that while sharing was all well and good, it had to be done collaboratively, not by “data parasites” who stole or misused work that might have taken bench scientists decades to assemble. The editorial did not mention Biden's initiative, but many commenters noted its relevance.
Over a snowbound weekend, the Twittersphere exploded with angry attacks on the Journal, which gave the impression of an ivory tower beset by flame-throwing iconoclasts. Geneticist Michael Eisen, at the University of California, Berkeley, decried the editorial (which Drazen toned down four days later) as “one of the most shockingly anti-science things ever written.”
The debate, which revolves around how fast researchers should have to share results from government-funded clinical trials, aired biomedicine's dirty laundry in public.
“Big data” has produced breakthroughs but it has also put some traditional researchers on the defensive. So have reports showing that most research papers—the bread and butter of careers—yield results that can't be reproduced. For many genetic studies in particular, the only way to get reliable, replicable results is to contribute to studies that amass huge amounts of data—and thereby surrender the glory of publishing alone.
That's not an easy sell to those in the medical trenches. Researchers need to publish original articles to advance their careers. In addition, their institutions are encouraged to monetize the information under the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which encouraged universities to commercialize discoveries.
Committees for ethical review and data management also get in on the act to protect the rights of patients and scientific integrity. Often, the process just looks like a waste of time, producing red tape and silos that threaten to block the administration's efforts.
Some kind of incentive may be required to cut them loose, said John Wilbanks of Sage Bionetworks, a nonprofit that supports open science projects.
“If they're serious about a moon shot, they have to advocate for the creation of a new system that doesn't have to fight all these various power structures,” Wilbanks said.
Biden has promised to “break down silos and bring all the cancer fighters together.” But he has not yet offered specifics about how to do that.
"Biden is absolutely right to focus on robust data sharing as a key tenet of cancer research,” says David Shaywitz, chief medical officer of DNAnexus, a biotech company. “Leading academic cancer centers are clamoring for government money to subsidize sequencing projects, but unless this funding is explicitly coupled to actual data sharing, we'll wind up enlarging existing silos rather than leveling them."
“Data sharing is in the Zeitgeist—that's why Biden said it,” added Wilbanks. But to force the transition to easier data handover, it will be necessary for the government to attach strings to its grants, he said.
A lot of scientists disagree, including those in the private sector.
“I don't think that kind of mandate will work,” said Brad Fenwick, a vice president at the academic publisher Elsevier, most of whose journals require high fees to read. He said such ideas reflect a “lack of appreciation of the difference between disciplines. Everyone sees the world from where they sit.”
Most academic researchers “perceive very little upside in generously and richly sharing their raw data,” Shaywitz acknowledges. “At a minimum, it's regarded as a thankless hassle.”
“At what point is data so free that you might wake up and find some part of your long, arduously created trial published by someone you've never heard of?” says Clifford Hudis, chief advocacy officer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
There are scientific risks to sharing data as well. Hidden elements in a dataset – details, for example, about a study population that the original researcher understood but didn't communicate in a publication—add mistakes when crunched into multiple sets, says biostatistician Donald Berry of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
NIH typically requires data from clinical trials it funds to be published within a year of the completion of the trial. Releasing it before it's collected can bias investigators, said Walter Kibbe, director of bioinformatics at the National Cancer Institute.
But to meet the administration's goal of a personalized approach to disease, patients' genetic variations will have to be matched against large databases of people with the same diseases. That isn't possible when it takes months to access the data, especially if the patient is gravely ill with cancer or some other condition.
“Everything we do in the rare disease space totally relies on data sharing,” says Daniel MacArthur, a genomics expert with appointments at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
Scientists describe some of the barriers as cultural differences that are generational, or entrenched in particular scientific disciplines.
“The clinical trialists like [the New England Journal's] Drazen are basically in a totally different universe” from data scientists, says cancer genome expert Michael Hoffman of the University of Toronto. “The sky doesn't fall because people use my research files without listing me as a co-author on their paper.”
“'Research parasites' is a rather hilarious thing to say,” adds Jeremy Leipzig, a bioinformatics software developer at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. “A statistician sitting in India might have nothing to do with your study, but have an excellent way of analyzing data that gives us terrific insight into the etiology of a disease.”
As an example of problems with sharing, researchers cite NIH's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes, created in 2006 to archive and distribute biomedical data generated in NIH-funded studies. Scientists complain that it takes months to learn whether they can access files, and sometimes the answer is ‘no' without explanation.
It's not entirely the government's fault. Each institution that donates data to the site has its own rules about using them, rules that vary from study to study. Technical problems can make it hard to upload vast files. The NIH crew that manages the database seems underfunded and overworked, said Leipzig.
Despite these factors, fewer than a third of those requesting access to the database have been refused, notes Laura Lyman Rodriguez, chief of the policy office at the NIH's genome institute.
She and others interviewed for this article see a trend toward more data sharing, and hope Biden's cancer push will speed it along.
Groups that started work in the 1990s on the federally backed Human Genome Project had a head start dealing with big collaborations and terabytes of data. Now, every biomedical lab needs a computer scientist and a statistician to stay on the cutting edge, said Louis Staudt, who leads the Center for Cancer Genomics at NCI.
The “dataheads” enjoy the support of patient groups, which are pressing scientists to share their results early and often, so the best knowledge can get to doctors faster.
The scientific value of the data, and the push for patient participation, are “shifting the conversation,” Rodriguez said.
Obama used a February 2013 executive action to require public access to data created with public funding. The feds, cancer centers and advocacy groups are building collaborative projects that make it easier for clinicians and researchers to keep abreast of the latest findings.
“Biden's onto something,” said Leipzig of Children's Hospital. “He's right. The more we can to encourage data sharing, the faster science will progress.”

At least 16 people have been killed in a stampede in the northern Indian holy town of Haridwar, officials say.
About 50 others were injured as devotees gathered to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of the founder of a Hindu sect.
Thousands have been attending the ceremony for Sri Ram Sharma, who founded the Gayatri Parivar sect.
Reports said the number of casualties could rise. Television footage showed injured people being taken to hospital.
"More worshippers turned up than the place could accommodate and so the stampede occurred," a senior local official, D Santhel Pandiyan, told the AFP news agency.
Many women and children are reported to be among the dead and injured.
Hemant Sahu, who works for the event organisers, told AFP: "When the big ritual was going on, too many people rushed forward to make their offerings to the holy fire and the crowd got out of control."
Reports said a number of people fell but other pilgrims continued to push.
Haridwar, 173km (107 miles) north of Delhi, is a temple-filled town where the Ganges emerges from the Himalayan mountains and is considered sacred by Hindus.
The huge numbers attending religious festivals in India make stampedes a frequent risk.
A stampede at a festival in the southern state of Kerala in January killed more than 100 people.
Longtime friend of President Trump and Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy said that special counsel Robert Mueller Robert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE's investigation “poses an existential threat to the Trump presidency.”
Ruddy said Sunday on ABC's “This Week” that he's worried the Mueller probe isn't fair to Trump and slammed a report that the special counsel removed an FBI agent from his team for potentially sending anti-Trump text messages.

"Robert Mueller poses an existential threat to the Trump presidency. He's gotten four major — two convictions, two plea agreements. Lightning speed," Ruddy said.
The CEO also noted that Ken Starr, the former independent counsel in the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky scandals during the Clinton administration, spent four years working on the investigation before delivering his first indictment.
“You get a picture that the investigation is out to get the president,” Ruddy said. “It's not a good group of people. I'm concerned … that they're not going to be fair."
Ruddy made the comments just days after Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to Mueller's charge of lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russian officials.
There are many paths to becoming a chef. For Dmytro Kovalenko, who heads the kitchen at this rustic East Village luncheonette, it started with a war. A former businessman and Euromaidan activist in his mid-thirties, Kovalenko fled the violence in eastern Ukraine three years ago. In New York, he worked as a dishwasher and a line cook before landing at Streecha. “You have to be passionate about cooking,” he said recently. “Otherwise, it's really hard and you will quit really soon.”
Streecha (an old Ukrainian word for “meeting”) is easy to miss. It's situated in a basement beneath a chiropractor's office and is demarcated by a blue banner in Cyrillic. The restaurant—which, despite appearances, is open to the public—was conceived about four decades ago (no one recalls the precise year), as an income-generating project for St. George Ukrainian Catholic Church, up the street. To this day, all the cooks, including Kovalenko, are volunteers, and the majority of the patrons are parishioners.
On a recent Friday, just past 7 A . M ., while Kovalenko was making beef stock for borscht, three elderly women sat at a table, folding mashed potatoes and cheddar cheese into rolled-out circles of dough for Ukrainian dumplings called vareniki. “Over here—put in potato—close—strong,” a centenarian named Anastasia instructed, pinching dumplings shut with practiced rhythm.
For as long as anyone can remember, the menu has consisted of exactly four items, all paragons of traditional Ukrainian fare. Besides borscht and vareniki, there is holubtsi, a medley of rice and pork or mushrooms swathed in braised cabbage leaves, and kovbasa, or sausage, which Kovalenko gets at a nearby Ukrainian-run butcher shop and serves with homemade horseradish. Rotating daily specials include shallow-fried potato pancakes (deruny), wheat berries with poppy seeds and honey (kutya), and a block of congealed fish stock (kholodets) that Kovalenko likens to “fish jello.” For dessert, there are rose-jam doughnuts dusted with powdered sugar (pampushki).
The décor borders on the monastic: communal tables, religious icons, a wooden dough-rolling machine long retired from service. Notably, there are not one but two portraits of Taras Shevchenko—a nineteenth-century Ukrainian poet who was exiled for organizing against the Tsar and mocking his wife. One of his most celebrated works begins with a plea: “When I am dead, bury me / In my beloved Ukraine.” Asked whether he shares the sentiment, Kovalenko said, “So far, I don't want to go there.” His application for asylum is pending with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

FRANKFURT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama blocked a Chinese investment fund from acquiring the U.S. business of German semiconductor equipment maker Aixtron (AIXGn.DE) because the deal posed a risk to American national security, the Treasury Department said on Friday.

Obama's executive order barring China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund (FGC) from completing the acquisition of a German company with American assets was one of few such instances in which a U.S. president has blocked a transaction due to national security concerns.
His action appeared to be based on concerns about China gaining access to the secrets of producing a material called gallium nitride used in military equipment.
In 2012, Obama ordered Ralls Corp, owned by China's Sany Group, to sell its interest in wind farms near sensitive U.S. naval installations in Oregon.
An Aixtron spokesman said the FGC deal would be called off if Obama took such action. Aixtron has said scrapping the proposed deal would mean it would have to take action to balance income and costs, including potential job cuts.
The Treasury Department said Obama was blocking the deal following an assessment by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency task force that the department leads.
“The national security risk posed by the transaction relates, among other things, to the military applications of the overall technical body of knowledge and experience of Aixtron, a producer and innovator of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and technology,” the department said.
Gallium nitride, a powdery yellow compound used in light-emitting diodes (LED), radar, antennas and lasers, is grown using Aixtron-manufactured technology, which has in the past been sold to U.S. military equipment maker Northrop Grumman (NOC.N).
The Treasury Department, in announcing the order, noted that Aixtron makes equipment for the semiconductor industry, including Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) systems used to grow crystalline layers for semiconductors, especially those based on gallium nitride.
Gallium nitride technology can boost the power and sensitivity of weapons systems while cutting their cost because it needs less electricity. The technology is being used to upgrade the radars of both American and foreign-owned Patriot missile defense systems.
CFIUS never gives reasons for its decisions. But sources have previously told Reuters it blocked the $3.3 billion sale of Philips' (PHG.AS) lighting business, Lumileds, to a consortium of Chinese investors last January over gallium nitride concerns.
AIXTRON'S FUTURE
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters at a regular briefing on Friday that the deal was “normal commercial activity” and that China hoped the world would not interfere politically.
The German Economy Ministry withdrew its approval for the deal in October and is now doing its own review of the transaction. It said the German process was independent of the U.S. scrutiny.

Analysts have said Aixtron has a bleak future as a stand-alone company as it struggles with market overcapacity. Aixtron had 713 employees at the end of the third quarter, 5 percent less than a year ago.
A fall in Aixtron's shares took them below Grand Chip Investment's offer price of 6.00 euros per share. The stock is hovering around a nine-month low.
Bigger chipmakers such as Germany's Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and French-Italian STMicroelectronics (STM.PA) were also slightly lower, shrugging off fears of an M&A slowdown following two years of consolidation of the global semiconductor industry.

One of the mysteries of the campaign is the way that pro-Obama advertisements have matched or exceeded pro-Romney advertisements in swing states, despite an apparent fund-raising edge on the Republican side. Part of the answer is that super-PACs aren't entitled to the lowest-ad-rate benefit that campaigns enjoy, forcing them to pay higher rates. Politico also reports the amazing news that Romney's campaign itself has been routinely overpaying for its ads simply because it's waited for the last minute to reserve airtime. And not just overpaying by a little:
Voters in Columbus, Ohio, saw 30-second television ads for both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney while watching “Wheel of Fortune” on their CBS affiliate over three days in September. For Obama's team, the order per spot cost $500. For Romney's, the price tag on the order was more than five times steeper at $2,800 per ad.
This does not seem to be a one-off. The story compiles case after case of Romney paying multiple times Obama's rate for essentially the same airtime.
If Romney fails to win, somebody in his campaign is going to hang for this. It also sort of makes you wonder about Romney's promise to use his keen business sense to scrub the federal budget for waste. Being president is not like running a business. But running a campaign sort of is like running a business — certainly the element of allocating your advertising resources is. And Romney is doing the equivalent of purchasing $20,000 toilets.
The Mayors of San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose got together Thursday afternoon to declare their intention to morph their collective communities into the “Electric Vehicle Capital of the US.”
The mayors' Nine-Point Plan was bolstered by Palo Alto start-up Better Place's announcement that they would begin building the commercial infrastructure that will be necessary in the region by the time EVs begin to hit the market in 2011.
With Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's influential advisor David Crane showing their support for strategy, there appears to be a commitment at the local, state and federal levels to make the Bay Area a key player in what some—including Germany's Foreign Minister—are optimistically calling President-elect Barack Obama's “Green Deal.”
“This type of public-private partnership is exactly what I envisioned when we created the first ever low carbon fuel standard and when the state enacted the zero emissions vehicle program,” Governor
Schwarzenegger said in a statement celebrating the plan. Schwarzenegger's zero emissions vehicle program was stifled in the courts last year as the result of a lawsuit introduced the Bush Administration.
But with a new administration intent on pushing alt fuels, local governments will certainly be throwing elbows in hopes of being in the right spot when and if the federal money spout turns on.
In fact, just a day earlier the city of Portland, Oregon said that it would be working with Renault-Nissan and Pacific Gas and Electric to build a network of EV charging stations with the goal of becoming a
“global leader” in zero-emission vehicles.
While it's all well and good to declare oneself a “global leader” or the “EV capital of the US” at a press conference, hopefully very soon these long-delayed alt-fuel-infrastructure initiatives will become more blasé and harder to sell as giant steps for mankind.

If you're a young driver, no doubt one of the biggest hurdles in your young life is the DREADED learner log book they hand you when you first get your L-plates.
As if learning to drive wasn't painful enough, you also have to be on your game CONSTANTLY.
Taking notes of kilometres driven, stressing about what to write when you forget to set the button that measures your drive, faking the weather conditions to show variety - and agonising over how many hours you have left to drive until you hit the minimum number needed.
Well, we're so pleased to report that young drivers could soon be ditching the hassle that is the logbook, according to Roads Minister Duncan Gay, who says it's set to be replaced with an app to make life easier.
He said, “the paper learner log book system has been around for 16 years.
Ask any learner or parent – it's time for the system to tap into new technology and move forward to the digital age.” Mr Gay said that the apps “need to be designed so as to not distract learner drivers or their supervisors.
Learner drivers are not permitted to use their mobile phones while in a vehicle.” The word is that the NSW government is calling on tech geniuses to help come up with an alternative, so make sure you put your hand up if that's you!
A 16-year-old Jordanian boy has been charged with murder after his 23-year-old sister was stabbed to death in an apparent "honour" killing.
The unnamed suspect allegedly stabbed his sister 10 times in the heart yesterday in a village in the northeastern province of Mafraq, an official said.
"He has confessed to murdering his sister because she disappeared from home for a month with a boyfriend," the official added.
It was the seventh reported so-called "honour" killing this year, according to security officials.
Jordanian authorities recorded 17 such murders in 2007, slightly up on previous years.
Killers in such cases often receive light sentences if convicted, as parliament has twice refused to reform the penal code despite pressure from human rights groups to end the near impunity of the perpetrators.

235 unaccounted for as weather slowed search and rescue efforts Sunday
FEMA claims To make a claim with FEMA, call 800-621-3362 or visit disasterassistance.gov.
A major air rescue for the Boulder County foothills devastated by 100-year floodwaters is planned for Monday, with residents asked to use white sheets, reflective mirrors, flares and signal fires to alert helicopter pilots to their locations.
"The pilots are going to go anywhere and everywhere they can," said Gabrielle Boerkircher, a spokeswoman for Boulder County. "People need to be prepared to be evacuated. They need to try to flag down the choppers in any way they can."
She said residents should be ready with a bag of medications, clothes and other important items -- and should wait until they get a signal to approach the helicopter after it lands. She acknowledged that many of those in need of rescue may not have phone or Internet service and won't know the helicopters are on their way, but the county is doing everything it can to get the word out.
A time when the helicopters will start flying hasn't yet been determined, but she said the goal is to take advantage of the clearer weather that's forecast Monday. After a reprieve Saturday from the torrential downpours that had dropped nearly 15 inches of rain on Boulder beginning last Monday evening, Sunday's nearly 2-inch rainfall and low-hanging fog grounded helicopters and complicated rescue efforts.

Boulder County was under a flood warning until 9 p.m. Sunday and, in north Boulder, both Twomile and Fourmile creeks were flooding Sunday afternoon, city officials said. But the rain Sunday didn't produce significant flooding within the city or county.
The historic flood has killed at least three and left 235 unaccounted for in Boulder County. The flood also has caused at least $100 million to $150 million in damage to roads, bridges and other structures in the county, according to early estimates from the Boulder Office of Emergency Management.
Given the severity of the damage, President Barack Obama has signed a disaster declaration and ordered federal aid for Boulder County residents.

The action makes federal funding available to those affected by the flood, and Boulder County officials are urging people to make claims -- even if they have flood insurance coverage -- to help gauge the severity of the devastating floodwaters.
The aid can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover.
Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle on Sunday said the number of people unaccounted for doesn't necessarily represent people who are definitively missing, but instead is a list of those who have not been in contact with loved ones.
"This information concerns the people who care for someone but can't account for them," Pelle said.
He said two detectives from his department have joined a search and rescue team in Jamestown to attempt to retrieve the body of a man believed to have died when his house collapsed.
But the rescue crew needs heavy equipment to start the recovery process, and Pelle didn't know when his office would be able to get some up the canyon.
Officials estimate 35 bridges need to be repaired and said rushing floodwaters have damaged at least 100 miles of roads. Additionally, flooding has damaged at least 100 minor structures, such as walking bridges near Boulder Creek, said Liz Donaghey, a spokeswoman for emergency operations.
The $150 million damage estimate doesn't include damage to private residences, officials said. Crews don't yet have a damage estimate for city and county buildings.
Walls of water and mudslides have crushed homes in Boulder's mountain towns the hardest, and search and rescue crews Saturday performed what is being called the largest aerial rescue since Hurricane Katrina.
More than 1,200 people have been evacuated so far.
Crews on Saturday were able to send helicopters into the mountain towns of western Boulder County as well as high-clearance trucks into Lyons to evacuate stranded residents, with Pelle calling the operation "an amazing 24 hours of saving lives."
About 500 people were driven out of Lyons, but many of the other rescues Saturday were performed by helicopter as the National Guard staged an air rescue campaign from Boulder Municipal Airport.
Coroner Emma Hall on Saturday evening released the identities of two of the three people killed by the flooding in Boulder County.
Those victims were Wiyanna Nelson and Wesley Quinlan, both 19. Sheriff's officials said the teens died after getting out of the car they were in on Linden Avenue and being swept away by the rushing floodwaters.
Hall has not yet identified the third victim claimed by the storm in Boulder County, but residents of Jamestown have said they believe it was former Jamestown Mercantile owner Joseph Howlett, 72. Neighbors fear Howlett was killed when his house collapsed in a mudslide Wednesday night.
Story highlights U.S. official says Pakistan could take "several steps" against extremists
The ISI chief will ask that Pakistan be allowed to conduct strikes
"You (the U.S.) develop a target and let us hit it," he will say
Pakistan has been critical of the drone program
The new chief of Pakistan's spy agency will urge the United States to end drone strikes on Pakistani soil and identify targets that the country's security forces can then attack, a senior intelligence official said.
Lt. Gen. Zahirul Islam will deliver the message during a meeting with the head of the CIA on August 2, said the Pakistani intelligence official, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
"You (the U.S.) develop a target and let us hit it," Islam will tell CIA Director David Petraeus, the official said. "It would be ideal if the U.S. provides drone technology to Pakistan."
Islam's call will continue an ongoing refrain from Pakistan about the CIA's controversial drone program. Pakistani officials and lawmakers have demanded an immediate end to the drone strikes, saying they have led to civilian deaths.

In keeping with its general policy, the CIA would not comment on meetings between the director and senior officials from other states, including whether the Pakistani intelligence chief was coming to Washington. But a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing intelligence matters, said the United States "supports the Pakistanis taking more responsibility for ridding the tribal areas of al Qaeda and its militant allies."
"The Pakistanis clearly have had, and will have, opportunities to show they are serious about taking actions with a practical effect on rooting out terrorists," the official said, adding there were "several actions" Pakistan could take to get rid of al Qaeda, the Pakistani arm of the Taliban and the Haqqani network -- a Pakistan-based militant group blamed for numerous attacks on U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan.
In a rare public statement earlier this year, President Barack Obama's administration defended the use of unmanned drones to target suspected terrorists. John Brennan, the president's top counterterrorism adviser, said the strikes are conducted "in full accordance with the law."
The program uses unmanned aerial vehicles, often equipped with Hellfire missiles, to target suspected terrorists in remote locations overseas, with many such strikes occurring in Yemen and Pakistan.
The intelligence official said Pakistan's military is already operating in areas where the United States has conducted drone strikes. The Pakistani military carried out 61 operations in North Waziristan since January, he said.
North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan, is widely considered the stronghold of the Haqqani network.
SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares in Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) and its suppliers slid on Friday on fresh worries over their position in China after highly critical state newspaper comments, even as the South Korean automaker managed to get a Chinese car plant restarted.
Hyundai has been at odds with partner BAIC Motor (1958.HK) over supplier strategy, sources have said - a rift that appears to be at the root of some of its parts makers not being paid on time, leading to plant stoppages.
Sources have told Reuters that BAIC wants to shift to cheaper Chinese suppliers to cut costs amid intensifying competition in the world's biggest auto market, while Hyundai wants to protect its current supply chain.
The problem has become a major headache for Hyundai which is also grappling with fierce competition and a less than stellar product line-up - a host of difficulties that prompted S&P Global Ratings to cut its outlook for the automaker and affiliate Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS) on Friday.
Its China woes were thrust into the spotlight again as the Global Times, in an article in its English edition on Thursday, cited unidentified sources as saying BAIC may end its partnership over supplier disputes.
The state-run newspaper followed up with commentary on Friday lambasting Seoul for its decision to deploy the U.S. anti-missile defense system THAAD - a diplomatic standoff that has been hurting Hyundai and other South Korean firms that are highly reliant on the Chinese market.
Shares in Hyundai suppliers saw some of the worst drops among slides for raft of South Korean firms, as investors feared a shift to Chinese suppliers was underway. Module maker Hyundai Mobis (012330.KS) tumbled 4.7 percent and engine parts maker Hyundai Wia (011210.KS) slid 7.1 percent.
BAIC declined to comment and said it was not aware of the Global Times articles.
Hyundai said in a statement that a cooperative relationship with its partner would continue and “the two companies plan to continue various dialogue to strengthen competitiveness in the Chinese market.”
The automaker's shares ended down 1.8 percent and have fallen 6 percent since reports of the payment problems in China first emerged.
IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP
Analysts said Hyundai's traditional suppliers may find themselves losing business because of the infighting with BAIC, and that the stakes were high for both automakers if they did not work out their problems.
“Beijing Hyundai is Hyundai's only JV in China, so I feel that it is intuitively very important to Hyundai. BAIC only has two joint ventures, one with Benz and one with Hyundai, and it's own brand isn't very good. So Beijing Hyundai to BAIC is of course very important,” said Jefferies analyst Patrick Yuan.
The automaker said earlier in the day that operations at its plant in Hebei province resumed on Thursday afternoon after being suspended since Tuesday - the second time in as many weeks that it has had to halt production at Chinese plants.
“We continue to be in discussions over payment,” a spokesman for the automaker said.
Samsung Securities analyst Esther Yim said the internal disputes over suppliers signaled a prolonged crisis for the South Korean automaker.

“Investors are frustrated that Hyundai is just blaming the political situation, and doing little to address the problem. Hyundai is a silent bystander,” she said.
Other companies that slid on Friday as the Global Times referred to THAAD as ‘a malignant tumor', included Lotte Shopping (023530.KS) which fell 3.2 percent. Its supermarket stores in China have been shut down for months in the wake of diplomatic tensions. Top cosmetic firm AmorePacific (090430.KS) also slumped, falling 4.6 percent.
“Have the conservatives in South Korea eaten kimchi until they've become confused?” the unsigned article said.
A Mexican newspaper on Monday criticized a group of tourists from the U.S. on spring break who reportedly chanted “build that wall” during a cruise off Cancun, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.
The chanting occurred on a “Pirate Ship” attraction. The Yucatan Times called the chant an act of “xenophobia and discrimination against Mexicans within their own country.”
The paper described the cruise as an entertainment excursion allows attendees to witness sword fights and drinking. The paper reported, “This situation is far from being an isolated incident, and it adds to the growing number of complaints from tourism sector workers, who point out that in recent days many Spring Breakers have been offensive, rude and haughty towards Mexican people.”
The Mexican paper referred to a social media post by a Peruvian man who was on board the ship.
"Today I was with Suly, my wife (who is a native of Mexico), watching an entertainment show off the coast of Cancun aboard a boat, and at the end of the show, a flock of Americans (maybe under the influence of alcohol, or maybe not), began to sing the infamous 'Build that wall' chant louder and louder'."
Grandmother 'hit with pistol' during Beirut abduction attempt involving 60 Minutes crew

Their Australian mother, Sally Faulkner, the Nine crew, as well as two British and two Lebanese citizens, are being detained in Lebanon over the incident.
A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said they had visited the Australians in detention.
"DFAT is in close contact with Channel 9 about the detention of an Australian TV crew in Lebanon. Officials of the Australian Embassy in Beirut are continuing to visit the Australians in detention to confirm their welfare and are providing consular assistance," the spokesperson said.
Lebanese police are investigating what they are calling an attempt by the mother and a recovery agency to abduct her children and take them back to Australia.
The incident was caught on CCTV and footage shows the two children accompanied by their grandmother and a nanny, walking along a Beirut street.
An SUV pulls up, men get out, grab the children and bundle them into the car as a woman presumed to be their grandmother, Ibtissam Berri, is shoved aside.
Ms Berri said one member of the group hit her with his gun while another man filmed the confrontation.
"A Honda car drew my attention and a big TV camera was being carried by a man filming us. Faster than lightning two men came out," she said.
"One hit me with his pistol on my head and I fainted and there were bruises on my body."
The team made a clean getaway, but was caught not long after the fact.
Soon after, the boy and girl were returned to the father and Ms Faulkner was arrested.
Authorities are investigating whether the Nine crew was involved in taking the children.
Abduction attempt could have ended tragically, father says
The children's father, Ali el-Amien, said it was a reckless and dangerous act.
"I was surprised [that] any one could endanger the children like that," he told the ABC.
"What if someone armed passed by and saw the scene and started to fire? We are in Lebanon here. If they started to shoot, they could have hit one of the children. They could have shot my mother."
Mr el-Amien said the family had been living in Lebanon until 2013, when Ms Faulkner decided it was no longer safe and took their children to Australia.
"When all the bombings took place, she wanted to go and visit her parents. She arrived there and tore up the children's passports," he said.
"She told me 'when you want to see them, you come to Australia'. I tried to live there more than once but all our revenue came from Lebanon and not from Australia. We were both out of work [in Australia]."
Ms Faulkner said Mr el-Amien took their children to Lebanon on a holiday last year but refused to let them return to Australia, leading to her attempted abduction alongside the 60 Minutes team.
Australia's ambassador has held talks with officials over the dispute.

This Friday, June 12, Dark Matter will premiere on Syfy. Created by Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie (The Stargate shows), and based on their comic book of the same name, Dark Matter follows the crew of the spaceship, who wake up from stasis with no memories whatsoever. Here's a video for each of the crew, letting you get to know them before they know themselves.
We've got seven videos with the cast and creators discussing each character and their place in this new show. There are a lot of great science fiction archetypes being introduced and played with here and we're pretty excited to see it all unfold.

Glitter is the worst. Come within 50 feet of it and you'll never be rid of the stuff.
So for those of you with large “I've got a lot of problems with you people” Festivus lists, there is a new method of revenge: ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com, a service that will do exactly what its name promises.
It's about the most perfect, passive aggressive way to get back at those who have wronged you.
“We are a real service, we actually do send glitter to your enemies,” company founder Mathew Carpenter told The Post via e-mail.
Here's how it works: Pay money to ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com and they'll send glitter to those you hate. “We'll also include a note telling the person exactly why they're receiving this terrible gift,” the site explains. “Hint: The glitter will be mixed in with the note thus increasing maximum spillage.”
The site launched early Monday morning — and crashed within hours. The Sydney-based company has logged more than 800 orders. The glitter bombs cost “$9.99AUD for anywhere in the world,” the site proclaims, adding, “Come on, it's Australian Dollars so it's probably only a few bucks for you.” (It's about $8.15 USD.)
“It's 4.36am here so no shipping yet, however we are filling orders as I type this to you,” Carpenter said via e-mail Tuesday. “The house looks like it's 1975 and Donna Summer has just hit the stage. ”
Glitter-bombing has been a thing in the United States for years and is best known as an act of protest in advocating for LGBT rights. It can be dangerous, as glitter can find its way into your eyes. Kardashians have been the recipients of glitter bombs.
A college student who glitter-bombed Mitt Romney in 2012 pleaded guilty to a charge of disturbing the peace. Former presidential candidate Rick Santorum was repeatedly glitter-bombed.
But mailing glitter to enemies is different. It's more courteous than mailing of packages of poop, and, hey, your enemy may even think the glitter is a gift! An annoying, horrible gift that gets into everything and will never go away. But they may feel like getting glitter all over the place is partly a result of their own doing.
Carpenter describes himself as an Internet marketing entrepreneur, and he's behind a number of other online ventures. He said the idea to send glitter to enemies came to him after years of receiving a Christmas card full of glitter from family friend.
“She sent a reasonable amount,” he said. “My idea came from wanting to send her 10x amount she had sent me over the years.”
So Carpenter sent an A4 envelope full of the sparkly stuff. He is not, he told The Post, expecting a Christmas card back this year. “Happy New Year to her!”
When asked if the company ships internationally (you know, just wondering), Carpenter responded, “Yes we do, unfortunately!”
Friends making fun of you for costuming your dog? Well, at the rate of growth in the pet costume industry, you won't be considered weird for much longer! (Well, not for putting a costume on your dog at least.)
Each year, the National Retail Federation conducts the Halloween Consumer Intentions and Actions Survey. For each of the 10 years that the NRF has conducted their survey, pet costume spending has been on the rise. Both the amount of people dressing their dogs and the amount of money they're spending to do it are increasing.
According to the survey, the top ten pet costumes are:
1. Pumpkin
2. Devil
3. Hot Dog
4. Cat
5. Bee
6. Ghost
7. Action/Superhero
8. Witch
9. Bowties/Fancy Collars/Bandanas
10. Superman
Aside from the most popular, traditional costumes, pop culture plays a big role in helping pet parents decide how to dress their furry family. Star Wars characters, political figures, athletes. Also expected to be a big hit this year are pop icons like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Michael Jackson, and Marilyn Monroe.
Are you dressing your dog for Halloween this year? Tell us about your best friend's costume in a comment below!
With just 20 hours of focused, deliberate practice, you can go from knowing absolutely nothing to performing noticeably well. That's the message from Josh Kaufman, author of The First 20 Hours. In the video above, he reveals the four steps to learning any new skill, fast.
Advertisement
It's a long, 20-minute TEDx Talk, but entertaining and enlightening too. The four steps in Kaufman's method are:
Deconstruct the skill: Break down the parts and find the most important things to practice first. If you were learning to play a musical instrument, for example, knowing just a few chords gives you access to tons of songs. If you want to learn a new language, learn the most common 2,000 words and you'll have 80% text coverage. Self-correct: Use reference materials to learn enough that you know when you make a mistake so you can correct yourself. Remove barriers to learning: Identify and remove anything that distracts you from focusing on the skill you want to learn. Practice at least 20 hours.
20 hours amounts to just 40 minutes a day for a month, so what are you waiting for?

The First 20 Hours
JACKSON, Ohio - So many people showed up last night to take a stand for Jesus that a meeting to discuss whether a painting of Him should hang in a public school had to be moved to a bigger space. In the end, the school board and administration agreed that the painting will stay, and one of only two people who spoke against it was booed by a crowd of more than 300.
JACKSON, Ohio � So many people showed up last night to take a stand for Jesus that a meeting to discuss whether a painting of him should hang in a public school had to be moved to a bigger space.
In the end, the school board and administration agreed that the painting will stay, and one of only two people who spoke against it was booed by a crowd of more than 300.
The painting depicting Jesus perhaps attracted some dust � but no fuss � while hanging over an entrance at Jackson Middle School in southern Ohio since 1947.
But a nonprofit group dedicated to the separation of church and state demanded earlier this month that the painting be removed as an unconstitutional government endorsement of Christianity.
The leader of Jackson City Schools said it would take a higher authority than the Freedom From Religion Foundation to force the painting�s removal after 65 years.
Superintendent Phil Howard told the crowd at Jackson High School that �we�re not violating the law and the picture is legal because it has historical significance. It hasn�t hurt anyone.�
The school board meeting was moved from a music room at the school to a commons area to accommodate the standing-room-only crowd.
Last night, the school board took no vote, but Howard made a statement that showed it had been discussed: �With support of the board, the picture will stay.� The crowd then erupted in cheers.
Howard earlier told Chillicothe radio station WKKJ that it would take a court order to remove the picture and said that the painting is permissible because it was provided by a student club and is displayed among other pictures in a �hall of honor.�
�I�m certainly not going to run down there and take the picture down because some group from Madison, Wis., who knows nothing about the culture of our community or why the picture is even there, wants me to take it down,� Howard told WKKJ.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation sent a letter to Howard on Jan. 2 seeking the removal of the painting depicting Christ from the school in Jackson, which is about 65 miles southeast of Columbus, after receiving a complaint.
�The school cannot endorse religion over non-religion,� staff attorney Rebecca Markert said yesterday.
�That sends an incredibly powerful message of religious endorsement, specifically Christianity, which is an egregious violation of the U.S. Constitution. If this goes to court, the district would lose.�
Resident Tricia Sturgeon was showered with boos, as she spoke in opposition of the painting last night.
�The painting is in clear violation of the First Amendment,� she said. �It is still violating the United States Constitution and must be removed immediately.�
Travis Hall, a Jackson High student, told WBNS-TV (Channel 10) that the painting inspired him when he went to the middle school.
�Every day in school, I remember it being there,� Hall said. �It was just motivation. It�s something I remember being there and I would love for it to stay there.�
Federal court rulings have established that public schools cannot display religious symbols and texts in isolation because they cross the constitutional line of separation of church and state, she said.
A 1994 ruling from the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals resulted in the removal of a painting depicting Jesus that had been displayed in a Michigan elementary school for more than 30 years.
�The portrait is moving for many of us brought up in the Christian faith, but that is the problem. The school has not come up with a secular purpose. The portrait advances religion. Its display entangles the government with religion,� the court wrote in its opinion.
Markert said the organization hopes that school officials �come to their senses� and take down the painting. If not, it will consider legal action, she said.

I won't bother giving the history of the Ruby language here. For those of you who haven't heard of it, the definitive web site is www.ruby-lang.org, and comp.lang.ruby is the newsgroup. For those who have, I present to you the reasons I love this (relatively) new language. You may also visit my main Ruby page if you didn't come from there.
It's object-oriented. What does that mean? Well, for every ten programmers, there are twelve opinions as to what OOP is. I will leave it your judgment. But for the record, Ruby does offer encapsulation of data and methods within objects and allows inheritance from one class to another; and it allows polymorphism of objects. Unlike some languages (C++, Perl 5, etc.) Ruby was designed from the beginning to be object-oriented.
It's a pure OOP language. Am I being redundant? I don't think so. By this we mean that everything, including primitive data types such as strings and integers, is represented as an object. There is no need for wrapper classes such as Java has. And in addition, even constants are treated as objects, so that a method may be invoked with, for example, a numeric constant as a receiver.
It's a dynamic language. For people only familiar with more static languages such as C++ and Java, this is a significant conceptual leap. It means that methods and variables may be added and redefined at runtime. It obviates the need for such features as C's conditional compilation (#ifdef), and makes possible a sophisticated reflection API. This in turn allows programs to become more "self-aware" -- enabling runtime type information, detection of missing methods, hooks for detecting added methods, and so on. Ruby is related to Lisp and Smalltalk in this respect.
It's an interpreted language. This is a complex issue, and deserves several comments. It can be argued that performance issues make this a negative rather than a positive. To this concern, I reply with these observations: 1. First and foremost: A rapid development cycle is a great benefit, and it is encouraged by the interpreted nature of Ruby. 2. How slow is too slow, anyway? Do some benchmarks before you call it slow. 3. Though some will criticize me, I will say this anyway: Processors are getting faster every year. 4. If you absolutely need the speed, you can write part of your code in C. 5. Finally, in a sense, it is all a moot point, since no language is inherently interpreted. There is no law of the universe that says a Ruby compiler cannot be written.
It understands regular expressions. For years, this was considered the domain of UNIX weenies wielding clumsy tools such as grep and sed, or doing fancy search-and-replace operations in vi. Perl helped change that, and now Ruby is helping, too. More people than ever recognize the incredible power in the super-advanced string and text manipulation techniques. Doubters should go and read Jeffrey Friedl's book Mastering Regular Expressions. So should non-doubters.
It's multi-platform. It runs on Linux and other UNIX variants, the various Windows platforms, BeOS, and even MS-DOS. If my memory serves me, there's an Amiga version.
It's derivative. This is a good thing? Outside of the literary world, yes, it is. Isaac Newton said, "If I have seen farther than others, it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants." Ruby certainly has stood on the shoulders of giants. It borrows features from Smalltalk, CLU, Lisp, C, C++, Perl, Kornshell, and others. The principles I see at work are: 1. Don't reinvent the wheel. 2. Don't fix what isn't broken. 3. Finally, and especially: Leverage people's existing knowledge. You understand files and pipes in UNIX? Fine, you can use that knowledge. You spent two years learning all the printf specifiers? Don't worry, you can still use printf. You know Perl's regex handling? Good, then you've almost learned Ruby's.
It's innovative. Is this in contradiction to #7 above? Well, partly; every coin has two sides. Some of Ruby's features are truly innovative, like the very useful concept of the mix-in. Maybe some of these features will be borrowed in turn by future languages. (Note: A reader has pointed out to me that LISP had mix-ins at least as far back as 1979. That's purely ignorance on my part; I shall have to find a better example, and make sure of it.)
It's a Very High-Level Language (VHLL). This is subject to debate, because this term is not in widespread use, and its meaning is even more disputable than that of OOP. When I say this, I mean that Ruby can handle complex data structures and complex operations on them with relatively few instructions, in accordance with what some call the Principle of The Least Effort.
It has a smart garbage collector. Routines like malloc and free are only last night's bad dream. You don't even have to call destructors. Enough said.
It's a scripting language. Don't make the mistake of thinking it isn't powerful because of this. It's not a toy. It's a full-fledged language that happens to make it easy to do traditional scripting operations like running external programs, examining system resources, using pipes, capturing output, and so on.
It's versatile. It can do the things that Kornshell does well and the things that C does well. You want to write a quick ten-line hack to do a one-time task, or a wrapper for some legacy programs? Fine. You want to write a web server, a CGI, or a chess program? Again, fine.
It's thread-capable. You can write multi-threaded applications with a simple API. Yes, even on MS-DOS.
It's open-source. You want to look at the source code? Go ahead. Want to suggest a patch? Go ahead. You want to connect with a knowledgeable and helpful user community, including the language creator himself? You can.
It's intuitive. The learning curve is low, and once you get over the first hump, you start to "guess" how things work� and your guesses are often correct. Ruby endeavors to follow the Principle of The Least Astonishment (or Surprise).
It has an exception mechanism. Like Java and C++, Ruby understands exceptions. This means less messing with return codes, fewer nested if statements, less spaghetti logic, and better error handling.
It has an advanced Array class. Arrays are dynamic; you don't have to declare their size at compile-time as in, say, Pascal. You don't have to allocate memory for them as in C, C++, or Java. They're objects, so you don't have to keep up with their length; it's virtually impossible to "walk off the end" of an array as you might in C. Want to process them by index? By element? Process them backwards? Print them? There are methods for all these. Want to use an array as a set, a stack, or a queue? There are methods for these operations, too. Want to use an array as a lookup table? That's a trick question; you don't have to, since we have hashes for that.
It's extensible. You can write external libraries in Ruby or in C. In addition, you can modify the existing classes and objects at will, on the fly.
It encourages literate programming. You can embed comments in your code which the Ruby documentation tool can extract and manipulate. (Real fans of literate programming may think this is pretty rudimentary.)
It uses punctuation and capitalization creatively. A method returning a Boolean result (though Ruby doesn't call it that) is typically ended with a question mark, and the more destructive, data-modifying methods are named with an exclamation point. Simple, informative, and intuitive. All constants, including class names, start with capital letters. All object attributes start with an @ sign. This has the pragmatism of the old "Hungarian notation" without the eye-jarring ugliness.
Reserved words aren't. It's perfectly allowable to use an identifier that is a so-called "reserved word" as long as the parser doesn't perceive an amibiguity. This is a breath of fresh air.
It allows iterators. Among other things, this makes it possible to pass blocks of code to your objects in such a way that the block is called for each item in the array, list, tree, or whatever. This is a powerful technique that is worth exploring at great length.
It has safety and security features. Ruby borrows Perl's concept of tainting and allows different levels of control (levels of paranoia?) by means of the $SAFE variable. This is especially good for CGI programs that people will try to subvert in order to crack the web server.
It has no pointers. Like Java, and with a grudging nod to C++, Ruby does not have the concept of a pointer; there is no indirection, no pointer arithmetic, and none of the headaches that go with the syntax and the debugging of pointers. Of course, this means that real nuts-and-bolts system programming is more difficult, such as accessing a control-status register for a device; but that can always be done in a C library. (Just as C programmers drop into assembly when necessary, Ruby programmers drop into C when they have to!)
It pays attention to detail. Synonyms and aliases abound. You can't remember whether to say size or length for a string or an array? Either one works. For ranges, is it begin and end, or first and last? Take your pick. You spell it indices, and your evil twin spells it indexes? They both work.
It has a flexible syntax. Parentheses in method calls can usually be omitted, as can commas between parameters. Perl-style quotes allow arrays of strings without all the quotation marks and commas. The return keyword can be omitted.
It has a rich set of libraries. There is support for threads, sockets, limited object persistence, CGI programs, server-side executables, DB files, and more. There is some support for Tk, with more on the way.
It has a debugger. In a perfect world, we wouldn't need debuggers. This is not a perfect world.
It can be used interactively. Conceivably it could be used as a sort of "Kornshell squared." (This is the most contested item on this page, and I am forced to concede that Ruby is not really good as a shell. I still maintain, though, that a Ruby-based shell would be a good thing.)
It is concise. There are no superfluous keywords such as Pascal's begin, then after if, do after while. Variables need not be declared, as they do not have types. Return types need not be specified for methods. The return keyword is not needed; a method will return the last evaluated expression. On the other hand... it is not so cryptic as C or Perl.
It is expression-oriented. You can easily say things like x = if a<0 then b else c end.
It is laced with syntax sugar. (To paraphrase Mary Poppins: A spoonful of syntax sugar helps the semantic medicine go down.) If you want to iterate over an array x by saying for a in x, you can. If you want to say a += b instead of a = a + b, you can. Most operators are really just methods with short, intuitive names and a more convenient syntax.
It has operator overloading. If I am not mistaken, this originated long ago in SNOBOL, but was popularized more recently by C++. It can be overdone or misused, but it can be nice to have. Additionally, Ruby defines the assignment version of an operator automagically; if you define +, you get += as a bonus.
It has infinite-precision integer arithmetic. Who cares about short, int, long? Just use a Bignum. Admit it, you always wanted to find the factorial of 365. Now you can.
It has an exponentiation operator. In the old days, we used this in BASIC and FORTRAN. But then we learned Pascal and C, and learned how evil this operator was. (We were told we didn't even know how the evaluation was done -- did it use logarithms? Iteration? How efficient was it?) But then, do we really care? If so, we can rewrite it ourselves. If not, Ruby has the good old ** operator you loved as a child. Enjoy it.
It has powerful string handling. If you want to search, substitute, justify, format, trim, delimit, interpose, or tokenize, you can probably use one of the built-in methods. If not, you can build on them to produce what you need.
It has few exceptions to its rules. The syntax and semantics of Ruby are more self-consistent than most languages. Every language has oddities, and every rule has exceptions; but Ruby has fewer than you might expect.

At the height of Beatlemania, skeptical journalists often asked John, Paul, George and Ringo, “What are you going to do when this is over?”
But for the Beatles, it's never been over. The band's legacy is more vibrant than ever, and the business of the Beatles will only be enhanced this year by a burst of activity surrounding the 50th anniversary of their American debut on “The Ed Sullivan Show.” That Feb. 9, 1964, telecast still ranks No. 11 on the list of most-watched non-sports telecasts in TV history, with an astounding 73 million viewers.
CBS will commemorate that landmark with the Feb. 9 concert special “The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to the Beatles.” A boxed-set re-release of their U.S. albums issued last week is kicking off fresh promotion of the band's music that will run for years and bring new Beatles titles to the marketplace.
More than four decades after they broke up, the Beatles remain the biggest-selling band in history. With domestic album sales of 64.1 million, they are second only to Garth Brooks among the top sellers tracked by Nielsen SoundScan since the music metrics service was formed in 1991. That figure does not include incalculable millions of albums sold in the U.S. from 1964-1990; 20 of their pre-'91 titles have been certified multiplatinum by the RIAA. Their 2000 hits compilation “1” is the fourth best-selling title of the SoundScan era, with nearly 12.3 million sold.

The two surviving Beatles have been no slouches on the concert trail, either. In 2013, Paul McCartney was the No. 12 live draw in North America, according to figures from concert tracker Pollstar; his 17 stadium shows in 13 cities grossed $49.6 million. And while, by comparison, drummer Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band is a much smaller attraction, playing venues in the 2,000-seat range, in 2012, the last year Starr played a significant number of U.S. dates, his 22 shows grossed $4.2 million (ranking him No. 169 among North American tours).
In addition, the Beatles are among the biggest movers in the classic rock genre when it comes to licensed material — from T-shirts to lamp shades to Christmas ornaments. Cirque du Soleil's “The Beatles' ‘Love' ” has become a Las Vegas mainstay. Homevid releases of the band's feature films, notably 1964's “A Hard Day's Night” and 1965's “Help,” are perennial sellers.
All told, the band's staying power defies the gravity of a notoriously fickle business, as Beatles tunes remain a must-have item for music lovers across generations.
The value of the Beatles' catalog was reflected in the $1.9 billion price paid by Universal Music Group in 2012 for EMI Records' label holdings, which includes the band's recordings, originally released stateside by EMI's U.S. subsidiary Capitol Records. The music is now jointly released by UMG's Capitol Music Group and the Beatles' Apple Corps.
Capitol Music Group chairman-CEO Steve Barnett knows first-hand what a rarefied entity the Beatles remain. In the early 1970s, he worked for NEMS, the management company founded by the Beatles' late manager Brian Epstein.
“At this company, we all feel a tremendous responsibility to advance and protect that legacy. It's a privilege and an honor that we get to work with this incredible catalog,” Barnett said. “There's a timeless essence to the music.”
Ironically, Capitol initially had no faith in the commercial potential of the Beatles, even after they had already conquered the U.K. in 1963.
Historian Bruce Spizer, who will present a retrospective on American Beatlemania at downtown Los Angeles' Grammy Museum on Jan. 28, notes, “Past experience had shown Capitol that British recording artists would not do well in the United States. Add to that (Capitol A&R chief) Dave Dexter's expertise in rhythm & blues and jazz, and lack of interest in rock 'n' roll, and you can understand why Capitol did not get excited about releasing Beatles records.”
Nonetheless, a confluence of events in December 1963 led Capitol to rush release of the single “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” which leaped to No. 1 on the American charts. By the time the Beatles stepped on the “Ed Sullivan” stage, they were well on the way to becoming the biggest band in the world.
Capitol-EMI has been minting money off the Beatles' library ever since with an array of re-issues, live and archival releases. If there's one thing music execs can count on, it's the selling power of a Beatles record.
The latest wave began Jan. 21 with the release of “The U.S. Albums,” a 13-CD set comprising the American versions of the Beatles' albums. Those collections were different in many respects (including different titles, track lineups and in some cases different takes or mixes of songs) from the versions that were released in the U.K.
Capitol Records brass couldn't have known it at the time, but the changes made to the U.S. releases back in the day were seeding the market for a plethora of re-release options in the future.
“The U.S. Albums” set follows the 2009 release of the U.K. albums in remastered form, which also came out via iTunes in 2010. The platters even returned to vinyl in 2012. The U.K. album box sets, in all their formats, have sold a total of 300,000 units, according to SoundScan.
Capitol separately issued eight of the U.S. albums on CD in 2004 and 2005. The latest boxed set marks an opportunity to re-introduce them to a new demographic, says Bruce Resnikoff, president-CEO of Universal Music Enterprises, UMG's catalog division. “(There's) an entire generation who hadn't seen these particular records the way they were released in the U.S., in one place, in one fashion, with a sound quality that would be satisfying,” Resnikoff notes.
The “U.S. Albums” set also marks the first time that a major Beatles reissue project is being released simultaneously in physical form and via the iTunes store, the Beatles' exclusive digital distributor. In December, iTunes released “Bootleg Recordings 1963,” a collection of 50 outtakes, BBC studio shots and unreleased demos; the package was likely tied to the extension of copyrights on the 50-year-old material.
“That collection performed very well from our perspective,” Resnikoff says, “and the people associated with Apple Corps and the Beatles felt the same way. I think there's an opportunity as we cull through the vaults to find additional material like that.”
Resnikoff confirms that a vinyl edition of the Beatles' mono albums, released on CD in 2009, will be issued later this year on a date to be announced. The 11-CD mono edition has sold 70,000 copies to date. Last year's “On Air — Live at the BBC Volume 2,” meanwhile, has moved 118,000 units.
This first anniversary wave of titles is just the beginning, Resnikoff notes: “We have a combined global Beatles team in a partnership with Apple Corps and the Beatles to not only discuss what we're doing now, but to bring forth a global strategy going forward, well beyond six months, 12 months or 18 months.”
Beyond UMG's exploitation of the Beatles' work, other projects will likely see the light of day. Rumors continue to circulate that the Criterion Collection, the high-end homevideo company, will re-release “A Hard Day's Night” this year.
In Las Vegas, the Beatles' music is the gift that keeps on giving. Cirque du Soleil's flamboyant production of “Love” at the Mirage has been running for more than seven years, and will continue through at least 2016.
Cirque du Soleil CEO Daniel Lamarre says the production has played before 6 million people and grossed $800 million. (Capitol's companion album has sold nearly 2.4 million copies.) The age range of the audience reinforces how enduring the band's music is, even to those born long after they took that last walk down Abbey Road.
“I think the Beatles are going to be relevant forever,” Lamarre says. “The one thing that is surprising to me is how much the music of the Beatles attracts kids, a younger crowd. … There is something about their music that was and is very, very special.”
HOOVER, Alabama - Police on Sunday released more details about a deadly shooting during an Iron Bowl party in Hoover.
The shooting happened about 7 p.m. Saturday at the Summerchase at Riverchase apartments. Two of the female partygoers, both Alabama fans, got into an argument shortly after the game ended.
The argument started inside the apartment, and spilled over into the parking lot. Hoover Police Chief Nick Derzis said the argument turned physical and both women ended up on the ground.
One of them pulled a small caliber handgun and shot the other. The victim was pronounced dead on the scene. Derzis said the two women didn't know each other. He said police have not yet confirmed what started the fight.
Shelby County Coroner Diana New identified the victim as 36-year-old Michelle Shepherd of Birmingham. She was a mother of three young children.
The shooter was taken into custody. Derzis said the case will be presented to the Shelby County District Attorney's Office Monday to determine whether criminal charges will be filed.
NYC Council Member Melissa Mark-Viverito announced yesterday a new tech program aimed at familiarizing and engaging residents with the city council.
The plan, called Council 2.0, was worked up by an internal committee called the Working Group on Public Technology and Civic Engagement, which consulted with experts in building open digital platforms. Goals include everything from making the council's website more accessible to soliciting citizen feedback on legislation via social media channels like Twitter and Facebook.
“Council 2.0 will utilize technology to make the Council more responsive, transparent, and open for every resident in this city,” Mark-Viverito, who is also council speaker, said in a press release. “This is a plan that includes and serves all New Yorkers. Through this framework, we will grow the Council into a digitally agile institution that adapts with emerging technology while remaining connected to the public.”
One of the plan's initiatives is called Council Labs, an ideas website that will allow New Yorkers to visualize the budget process. This should be launched next fall.
“By providing open access to Council data, improving our social media platforms, and taking concrete steps to pilot new models of engagement, we are building a more inclusive city. Like participatory budgeting, more engaging public technology helps us to hear the voices of New Yorkers — an essential step to doing our job right and strengthening our local democracy,” said Council Member Brad Lander, who chairs the rules committee.
More and more cities across the U.S. are making strides toward transparency in the digital age. In February, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter announced the redesign of the city's open data portal, OpenDataPhilly. Also that month, Fiscal Focus Pittsburgh made municipal spending and budgeting numbers more accessible in that city. Washington, D.C. has been using an online tool that allows voters to read drafts of council bills and leave comments electronically.
Hillary Clinton wondered aloud Wednesday why she wasn't trouncing her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, in the polls.
After running through some of the core tenets of her campaign in a video conference call with supporters in Las Vegas, the former secretary of state said: "Having said all this, 'Why aren't I 50 points ahead?' you might ask?"
"Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer," the Democratic presidential nominee added. "I need your help to get Donald Trump's record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled."
A reporter asked a similar question to Clinton earlier this month, asking her why she wasn't "running away" with the election, considering her extremely negative portrayal of Trump.
At the time, Clinton said she had repeatedly said she "always thought this was going to be a close election."
Clinton is locked in a dead heat with Trump for the presidency, though most analysts still give her the edge. The two will meet at Hofstra University on Monday for the first debate between the major-party nominees.
Bandai Namco is set to unveil another new fighter in the arcade version of Pokken Tournament in just a few days. Today, the company has confirmed that a new roster addition will be announced on December 1 – this coming Thursday.
Scizor was added to Pokken Tournament arcade in October. Last month, Bandai Namco followed that up by bringing in Croagunk, which was somewhat unexpected. Since Darkrai was introduced during the summer, Empoleon is the only remaining character found in patch files for the Wii U version that has not been unveiled – so perhaps this Pokémon could be the new addition.
Bandai Namco has recently been showing new Pokken Tournament fighters during Niconico streams, but we haven't heard anything about a broadcast thus far. Regardless, look for news later this week.

As with any work environment, there were clashes between the staff, scheduling conflicts, holiday- and cold-season staffing woes, and legitimate human error. To avoid the consequences of these typical work dynamics on our son, my husband and I developed standard procedures for drawing up and administering meds, transferring our son from wheelchair to exercise mat, and keeping stock of our inventory of medications and supplies. We installed a video monitor in his bedroom and a master schedule for everyone's comings and goings.
Prior to my son's illness I had run an organization with 60 employees. I prided myself on being open and collaborative and encouraging of different points of view. At home I was overbearing. Depleted from the extremely long hospitalization, and traumatized by seeing my son with this dreadful illness, I found myself resenting all of the people who were there to help us care for him. I did not want them in my home. I did not like being interdependent with so many people just to keep him safe. I did not want the stander and wheelchair in my living room, the bath chair in my shower, or the sounds of the churning pump and the pulse oximeter's alarm. I did not want to tell everyone who walked through my door to wash their hands and I was tired of the smell of Purell on mine. I did not want to spend my time making phone calls to insurance companies and doctors' offices and billing departments and medical-supply companies. In short, I did not want to run a hospital. Most importantly, I did not want my son to suffer for even one more day.
But there was no choice. After hearing a nurse refer to my son's bedroom as “the nurses' room,” I went about reclaiming our space as our home. It was time to start making our days as joyful as they could possibly be. I played upbeat music, cooked delicious meals, and rearranged the living-room furniture so the new equipment could be tucked away when not in use. I accepted the messiness of our bedroom and the excessive recovery-related clutter of our living room. I took down some of my son's old artwork (which had started to feel like a shrine to his pre-illness self) and put up new projects he and his home-based teacher had worked on together, her hand guiding his. His walls began to change and evolve as he did, showing his growth and progress and recovery.
He now attends a wheelchair-accessible neighborhood school, accompanied by a nurse at all times. Nurses continue to work overnight, but there are several hours each day that we are home, just the three of us, a family. He is still non-verbal. The feeding pump continues to churn. The pulse-oximeter alarm goes off far less frequently. He takes much less medication. Although the broken systems of supplies and insurance persist, we have figured out how to navigate them with our senses of humor intact, most of the time. I wonder if our son would have made as much progress if he were living in a long-term care facility. Home is a medicine unto itself.
I still have not taken down the preschool art project of the human figure with eyes on his hand from my son's bedroom wall and I may never do so. It is one of my favorite things in the entire apartment. I love the metaphor of the wind blowing our eyes off our faces, and us proudly, wearily, and resiliently catching them in our hands.

So after re-reading 1959's Hugo winner A Case of Conscience (post), I couldn't resist picking up 1961's Hugo winner A Canticle For Leibowitz. It may not be the only other explicitly religious Hugo winner, but it's certainly an interesting contrast.
A Canticle for Leibowitz is about a world that has been through a flood of fire—a nuclear war that has left survivors to grope through a new dark age. It's set in the barbarous ruins of the U.S., and it's explicitly reminiscent of the period after the fall of Rome when the Church kept learning alive. It's a clearly cyclic history, with civilization rising and destroying itself again. You'd think this would be a terrible downer, but in fact it's light and funny and clever as well as moving and effective and having a message. It treads some very strange ground—between fantasy and science fiction (the wandering Jew wanders through), between science and religion, between faith and reason, between humour and pathos. It's an amazing book, covering a thousand years of future history, making me laugh and making me care. It's hard to think of anything with the same kind of scope and scale.
Walter M. Miller was an absolutely wonderful short story writer. In short form he managed to produce a lot of poignant memorable clever science fiction. A Canticle For Leibowitz is a fixup of three shorter works, and he never wrote another novel. There's a sequel of sorts, St. Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, which he worked at for years and which was finished for him by Terry Bisson. Despite loving Bisson I haven't been able to bring myself to read it. For me, A Canticle for Leibowitz is complete and perfect and doesn't need any supplementary material, sequels or prequels or inquels.
The three sections of A Canticle for Leibowitz were published in SF magazines in the late fifties, and then the novel came out in 1960, winning the 1961 Hugo award. The concerns about nuclear war, and the particular form of nuclear war, are very much of that time. This is a rain of fire that destroys civilization and leaves mutants but doesn't destroy the planet—that waits for the end of the book and the final destruction. This is the survivable nuclear war of the fifties and sixties, the war of The Chrysalids and Farnham's Freehold. But this isn't a survivalist novel, or a mutant novel—although there are mutants. This is a novel about a monastery preserving science through a dark age. Almost all the characters are monks.
The central question is that of knowledge—both the knowledge the monks preserve, hiding the books, and then copying and recopying them without comprehension, and the question of what knowledge is and what it is for. There's the irony that Leibowitz, the sainted founder of their order, was himself Jewish, which the reader knows but the monks do not. There's the wandering Jew—and the question of whether he's really the wandering Jew. When I think about the book I keep coming back to the illuminated blueprint, done in gold leaf with beautiful lettering and absolutely no idea what it is that it describes and decorates.
We see three time periods of the monastery of St. Leibowitz, and we can deduce a third, the foundation, from what we know and what they know. There's a nuclear war, with awful consequences, followed by a hysterical turning on scientists, who are considered responsible, and on anyone educated—the “simpleton” movement. In response, Leibowitz and others became bookleggers and memorizers, using the church as a means of preserving science. The story starts several generations later, when simpleton is a polite form of address to a stranger, like “sport” to a mutant. The first section is about Brother Francis and the canonization of St. Leibowitz. The middle section is set at a time secular civilization is just beginning to get science organized, a new renaissance. And the third section is set just before the new apocalypse, with a few monks escaping to the stars and God's new promise.
I want to repeat: it's delightful to read. It's easy to forget just how much sheer fun it is. I thoroughly enjoyed it—even the perspective of the buzzards and the hungry shark. It's a surprisingly positive book.
The details of the monastery are pretty good. The Catholic Church was in the process of abandoning Latin at the time he was writing, and had renounced it entirely by the time the novel was published in book form, but he has them using it. (I have no problem with this. Of course, they'd have gone back to Latin in the event of a global catastrophe. I mean, it's obvious. I'd do the same myself.) The preservation of science and knowledge generally is very well done. I love the scientist reading a fragment of RUR and deducing from it that humanity as he knew it was a created servant race of the original masters who destroyed themselves. There's no dark age direct equivalent of bookleggers, but that doesn't matter.
Spoilers:
Theologically though, looking at the fantasy aspects, I find it odd. To start with, there's the wandering Jew, who appears in the first and second parts but not in the third. In the first part he leads Brother Francis to the hidden fallout chamber. In the second he's known as Benjamin and claims to be Lazarus, explicitly waiting for the second coming. He doesn't appear in the third part and there's no reference to him—has he gone to the stars? If Rachel is the messiah, he misses her. And is she? I think we're supposed to believe she is—and I like the weirdness of it, the science-fictionality. I don't know that it's orthodox Catholicism—and I gather from Wikipedia that Miller was a Catholic, and was involved in bombing Monte Cassino in WWII and then thought better of it. If this is true, he certainly made something to set against that destruction.
Teresa Nielsen Hayden says that if something contains spaceships, it's SF, unless it contains the Holy Grail, which makes it fantasy. I don't know whether the Wandering Jew (and potentially a new female mutant messiah) counts as the Holy Grail or not in this context. There are certainly spaceships, the monks are taking off in them as the new flood of fire falls at the end of the book. It doesn't really matter whether it's science fiction or fantasy or both. Hugo votes have never had much problem with mysticism, and they certainly noticed that this really is a brilliant book.

In his State of the Union address last week, President Barack Obama cheered rising wages. What he didn't mention is that much of the income gained since the recession has gone into the pockets of the richest Americans.
In 39 U.S. states, the top 1 percent of earners gobbled up at least half of all of the income gains between 2009 and 2012. And in 17 of those states, the top earners got every bit of the income growth in those years. That's according to a new paper released Monday by the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank focused on labor issues.
In all states, the rebound in income in the three years after the recession pretty much all went to the richest of the rich, the EPI found.
"Over this period, the average income of the bottom 99 percent in the United States actually fell (by 0.4 percent)," the paper states. "In contrast, the average income of the top 1 percent climbed 36.8 percent."
The EPI paper, using state-level tax data from the IRS, builds on older research by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who analyzed income gains captured by the top 1 percent to illustrate broader trends in economic inequality. The French economist Piketty got famous last year for his book, Capital In The Twenty-First Century, which warned that inequality was only going to get worse without government intervention.
The map below shows where the richest 1 percent captured the greatest percentage of the overall income gained between 2009 and 2012. The darker orange and red shades show where the largest share of income growth went to the 1 percent.
Among the states where the 1 percent got the biggest share of the income gains were Delaware -- where they got 301 percent of income growth -- and Florida, where they got about 260 percent.
Nevada was arguably one of the most-unequal states in the country during that stretch: The income of the top 1 percent jumped nearly 40 percent, while the income of the rest fell 16 percent. But because total state income fell -- the only state in which this happened -- it doesn't register on the map, which measures the 1 percent's share of income gains.
West Virginia was the least-unequal state in the country during that stretch: It's the only state in which the 1 percent suffered falling income while the 99 percent enjoyed rising income.
Since the recession ended more than five years ago, wages have been one of the slowest parts of the economy to recover. In his speech last week, Obama applauded the 11 million new private-sector jobs created since 2009 and claimed that "Wages are finally starting to rise again."
But wage growth is still a lot slower than it was before the recession. And it's still too slow to keep up with the growth enjoyed by the 1 percent, who typically don't have to beg employers for raises.
Marc Methot to Binghamton: Chris Wideman Gets His Chance (Sort of…)
On Friday, the Ottawa Senators announced that Marc Methot would join the Binghamton Senators in the AHL for a conditioning stint.
As per the Ottawa Senators Twitter account:
Roster update: The #Sens have assigned defenceman Marc Methot to Binghamton on a conditioning assignment. cc: @BSens_Hockey — Ottawa Senators (@Senators) January 2, 2015
Marc Methot made a brief return from off-season back trouble in early December before aggravating the injury.
The 6'3, 230 lbs. Ottawa native is a welcome sight for Head Coach Dave Cameron's squad. Many of the Senators' young defensemen have struggled to manage the puck this season.
In fact, each of Jared Cowen, Mark Borowiecki, Cody Ceci, Erik Gryba, and veteran Chris Phillips have posted Corsi For percentages (CF%) below 48 percent. Each of these five defensemen is below the team average CF%. It isn't necessarily strange for a team's defense corps to lag in puck possession. But, Marc Methot's 52.1 CF% from last season is certain to be a boon for the mostly young group of blue liners.
Marc Methot Down, Chris Wideman Up
It's a #BSens Game Day!!! The team is on home ice when they take on the Syracuse Crunch at 7:05p.m. and will be joined by Marc Methot who is down on a conditioning stint from Ottawa. Call 722-7367 for tickets and don't forget your skates for the POSTGAME SKATE WITH THE PLAYERS!!! A photo posted by Binghamton Senators (@bsens_hockey) on Jan 1, 2015 at 8:54am PST
While Marc Methot is conditioning with Binghamton, 24-year-old defenseman Chris Wideman will get his chance in the NHL.
Sort of.
Despite leading Binghamton with 29 points in 32 games, Senators Head Coach Dave Cameron has made it clear that Wideman will only dress for a game in an emergency.
As Cameron said to the Ottawa Sun's Don Brennan:
Right now [Chris Wideman]'s not going to play. Something is going to have to happen for him to play. He will be with us for two games, for sure.
Cameron can be excused for his desire to preserve team chemistry by not deploying a brand new NHL defenseman, especially because Methot figures to return shortly.
But are the Ottawa Senators missing an opportunity to bolster the overall quality of their blue line for the rest of the season?
As written here, Chris Wideman has made a case for an NHL job (not just an emergency call-up) since last season. He has registered 80 points in 105 games and a plus-11 rating over the past two seasons (stats here). Wideman offers some offensive punch and defensive responsibility that deserves a chance at the NHL level.
By relegating Wideman to the press box during his first NHL call-up, the Sens may be missing out on a chance to make a permanent addition (and improvement) to their blue line.
What do you think, Ottawa Senators fans? Does Chris Wideman deserve a chance to play in the NHL while Marc Methot is in Binghamton? Or, is he best left as an emergency fill-in?
Here's some great news for fans of Marc Singer's awesome 2000 film Dark Days; 11 years after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival (where it went on to win three of the festivals major awards), the film has now found a new home at Oscilloscope Laboratories. The boutique distribution company has announced that they'll be re-releasing the film theatrically (which I believe kicked off on July 1st in New York City), followed by a repackaged 2 disc DVD release that's packed with supplemental features.
For years, a homeless community took root in a train tunnel beneath New York City, braving dangerous conditions and perpetual night. DARK DAYS explores this surprisingly domestic subterranean world, unearthing a way of life unimaginable to those above. Through stories simultaneously heartbreaking, hilarious, intimate, and off the cuff, tunnel dwellers reveal their reasons for taking refuge and their struggle to survive underground. Filmed in striking black and white with a crew comprised of the tunnel's inhabitants and scored by legendary turntablist DJ Shadow (Endtroducing…), DARK DAYS remains a soulful and enduring document of life on the fringe.
The DVD edition of the film is set to hit stores on July 19th. You can pre-order the disc here or watch for it on the shelves of your favourite video outlet bargain place. Have a look at the sweet special features below and check out the trailer while you're at it. God bless Oscilloscope!

VZD's is (not) reopening tomorrow…
Update: Yeah, I have no clue what's going on. Apparently the whole “reopening this week” thing has hit some snags. The liquor license is expired, and the new owner I talked to apparently isn't even the new owner. Brianna Bailey took a break from singing Yellow Ledbetter at Nancy's Lighthouse to update on everything. You can see it after jump. I added some “editor's notes” to the post below.
That lasted about as long as a plate of stuffed mushrooms… (I guess mushrooms last longer than I thought.)
Less than one month after the venue was shut down because someone didn't pay taxes, the Oklahoma City landmark VZD's is set to reopen as early as 5:00pm tomorrow under new ownership. (Haha, psyche!)
I know this because I just got off the phone with VZD's new owner article, Brent Walton. (So, according to The Oklahoman article, the guy I talked to isn't the new owner, but the new operator and eventual owner. Meh, details suck.) He's been involved in the Oklahoma City bar scene for nearly his entire life. He's a former owner of the Cock-O-The-Walk and Classics – two of my favorite local neighborhood dives – and his first job was at Will Rogers Theatre when it was still a theater. When Brent was a kid, his uncle owned Sipango and Red Rooster, so I guess you can say Brent and his family have been directly responsible for a bunch of Bishop McGuinness graduates getting drunk and laid over the years. (Hey, I think this part is right. Who knows.)
Here are a few things (I thought) I learned from my brief conversation with Brent…
Not a lot is going to change…
The “new” VZD's will be very similar to the “old” VZD's (Heh, I guess that means it's not currently open). The food menu should remain relatively the same, the staff that stuck around and decided not to pursue a pro career in Roller Derby will be welcomed back, and they're going to continue to feature live music.
Which leads to…
Expect Live Music 7-Days A Week…
According to Brent, VZD's will now be open on Sunday. The old one was closed on Sunday, and for some reason decided to market that with this recent video. (The video is actually three years old or whatever, but it was posted on the VZDs facebook page about a month or two ago, so I just assumed it was recent… kind of like how I thought the guy I talked to on the phone was the new owner.)
Yeah, let's tell people about the one day each week we're closed. That will help us pay taxes.
(Here's another video to summarize how I feel)
In my original post, I suggested that VZD's tone down the live music. It looks like Brent's doing the exact opposite, which is probably a good move. My suggestion was totally selfish in nature and had nothing to do with what's good for the venue. I'm a big live music snob, and would prefer that I be the center of attention when drinking with friends as opposed to a group of talented musicians. But VZD's is a live music venue at night, and sticking to the one thing that made it a historic venue worthy of this type of coverage is a good idea. I wish them the best, and hope they have a plate of piping hot stuffed mushrooms waiting for me the next time I come in for happy hour. (If / when they open)
—-
Per Brianna Bailey with The Oklahoman…
VZD's will not reopen Thursday night, owner Chad Bleakley said. Although Bleakley has agreed to let Brent Walton manage the local restaurant and bar, and eventually purchase VZD's, a final deal has not been reached and the venue is not yet ready to reopen, Bleakley said.
Dominos: How Bear Stearns default threatens the entire world financial system Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published: Tuesday March 25, 2008
|
Print This Email This When we hear of turmoil in world financial markets, it can be difficult to understand how so much chaos can result from a relatively small number of defaults on individual home mortgages. Paul Solman, the business and economics correspondent for PBS's NewsHour, undertook to explain how those modest defaults could escalate to the point where they "now threaten the entire world financial system." Solman began by noting that "the money you borrow to buy your home no longer comes from the local bank. It comes from investors from all over the world." A firm like Bear Stearns buys up the mortgages on lots of houses, combines them into a pool, and sells slices of that pool to investors. This has been an attractive investment, because it offers a high rate of return, and it has also been considered extremely safe, because even if one mortgage defaults that will have little effect on the pool. With the US housing market booming thanks to the easy credit these deals opened up, it seemed there was no way that anyone could lose. However, the problem was that "the more investors got into the act, the greater the pressure to lend." Lenders were competing with one another to offer more favorable mortgage terms. Eventually, new buyers had so little actually invested in their homes that if any problems arose, it was easiest to just walk away from both house and mortgage. Making things worse, the return on these mortgage pools was so high that the big lenders began investing in them on their own, often using money borrowed at a lower rate from banks like Citicorp and JP Morgan. And the banks were also investing directly in securities backed by mortgages, credit cards, or auto loans. Even more investments went into so-called "derivatives," essentially side bets on these other loans. Everybody wanted to get in on the action and nobody was using their own money, so the debts quickly multiplied from billions to trillions. And the only thing of real value holding up the whole house of cards was the homes owned by individual buyers. If the value of those homes drops -- as it now has -- and too many of the buyers walk away, the whole structure can collapse. If that happens, as Solman explained, there's a further problem. "The world financial system runs on credit -- on paper promises. If big borrowers and lenders don't make good on those promises, panic can set in, and the biggest financial institutions in the world can find themselves under siege." That sort of panic was the reason Bear Stearns became unsustainable. And if a firm like Bear Stearns goes down, its creditors -- the major banks -- can become unsustainable as well. That is why the federal government has stepped in to try to salvage the situation. And, Solman concluded, "That's why they call it the domino effect." The following video is from PBS's Jim Lehrer News Hour, broadcast on March 21, 2008.
University of Washington graduate student Jose Ceballos wears an electroencephalography (EEG) cap that records brain activity and sends a response to a second participant over the Internet. University of Washington
In one lab, an image of an object is shown to a study participant on a computer screen. The subject wears a cap connected to an electroencephalography (EEG) machine that monitors his brain waves. Another participant, the asker, sits in another lab on campus. It's her job to figure out what image the answerer was shown. The asker has a magnetic coil almost touching her skull. She selects a question from a list on a touchscreen to narrow down the object, 20-questions style. The question she asks appears on the screen in front of the answerer. To the left and right of the screen are two LED lights, flashing at different frequencies. One side is labeled ‘yes' and the other ‘no'. He answers the question by staring at the correct light. Chantel Prat, a psychologist at the University of Washington and a co-author on the paper, told Popular Science that the computer can distinguish what light he looks at because different frequencies of light trigger different brain patterns in response. The computer algorithm sends its interpretation of the answerer's brain patterns to the magnetic coil in the asker's lab over the Internet. If the answer is yes, the coil releases a pulse that stimulates the asker's visual cortex in the brain. The stimulation triggers a phosphene, which can look like a flash of light, a blob, a blur, or a wavy line. If it's no, the coil still makes the same sounds and scalp-tingling sensations, but doesn't release a pulse strong enough to cause a phosphene. The asker notes whether they saw the phosphene flash or not, and moves onto the next question. It's a game of 20 Questions played brain to brain.

In the study, published Wednesday in PLOS One, participants guessed the correct object 72 percent of the time. To make sure it wasn't due to chance or cheating, the researchers also ran control games where the participants thought they were communicating but no data was being sent. In those conditions, they only guessed correctly 18 percent of the time. This is a big step forward from the group's 2014 experiment, in which they successfully transmitted the brain pattern of hand movement to another person's brain, causing the second person's hand to move. In this study, the asker consciously acknowledges incoming information from other person's brain and makes a decision based on it. It's real communication.
People get nervous that others could read their thoughts without them being aware

Their lights blaring in the night, hundreds of taxis lined an unlit airstrip in a jungle region of Peru so an emergency medevac plane with three very sick patients could take off.
All three survived after the 300-odd drivers of motorcycles fashioned into small taxis with compartments for passengers heeded a call Wednesday night from a radio station to race to the 800-meter airstrip in Contamana, in one of Peru's poorest regions, Peruvian media reported.
The airstrip is not equipped for nocturnal flights because it has no lights.
The patients were a woman and her newborn, both with serious problems after delivery, and a man with a tropical disease.
"We have always been people with a heart," said Adolfo Lobo, the radio presenter who put out the call for help.
Contamana, a town of 26,000, has a hospital with no equipment for emergency situations and the airport is rudimentary.

This is a very easy Thai curry, which is just so delicious ! It is low in fat and the flavours just linger on your palette. So if you want to enjoy a Thai at home, or wish to make it for friends, then look no further. I made enough for 2 days, which rocks, because I have a whole lot of stuff waiting to be sorted out after my return from holiday.
Serves 4
INGREDIENTS
sesame oil for gentle frying
2 spring onions, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 zucchini (courgettes), roughly chopped
1 sweet potato, roughly chopped
10 mushrooms, sliced
1 small red pepper, roughly chopped
1 inch piece of ginger, finely chopped
½ tsp galangal powder (optional)
2 cups (500 mL) coconut milk
2 tsp Thai green curry paste
1 cup broccoli florets (pre-steamed)
1 Tbsp teriyaki sauce
salt to taste
1 tsp agave nectar, or maple syrup
1 tsp raw sesame seeds (for garnishing)
METHOD
In a saucepan, pour a little sesame oil, and fry your courgettes until slightly golden, turning them around as you do so. You may wish to bake them on a baking tray, and brush with sesame oil on both sides, if you wish to avoid frying them. Set aside. Next, in another saucepan, fry the mushrooms for a few minutes until they yield their juices, then, when cooked, spoon onto the courgettes. Using the same empty saucepan, fry the sweet potato until a little golden on both sides, then add the onion, ginger and garlic, and continue to mix. At this point, stir in the green curry paste, and then add the coconut milk. Lower the heat, and allow the potatoes to soften – check this with a fork. Now add the pre-steamed broccoli florets, the red pepper, and the remaining ingredients. Simmer for 15 minutes, and then serve.
Rose Rice Pistachios & Lime
I served this rice with the Thai curry – you may of course opt for the sticky rice – but I fancied a change. Here is the easy-to-make recipe for you. It compliments the dish so wonderfully. This is a little bit of a fusion, but one that works beautifully.
INGREDIENTS
basmati rice, boiled according to instructions (I used 2 cups rice)
1 Tbsp rose water
the zest of 1 lime
a handful of non-salted pistachio nuts
METHOD
Just boil and drain the rice, rinse with tepid or cold water, then garnish with the remaining ingredients and voila, tis there for you. Serve hot with the curry and enjoy !!!

North Korean media has warned that nuclear war could break out ‘at any moment' as the US and South Korea begin their biggest-ever joint air drills
US senator: military families should leave South Korea as threat of war grows
The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has called on the Pentagon to move the families of US military personnel out of South Korea, as a senior Trump administration official warned that the potential for war with North Korea was growing by the day.
The South Carolina senator, who is a member of the Senate armed services committee, also opposed sending any more military dependents to South Korea, which hosts 28,500 US soldiers.

“It's crazy to send spouses and children to South Korea, given the provocation of North Korea. South Korea should be an unaccompanied tour,” Graham said on CBS's Face the Nation.
“So, I want them to stop sending dependents, and I think it's now time to start moving American dependents out of South Korea.”
Tensions have risen on the Korean peninsula after more than two months of relative quiet.
Last week, North Korea test-fired a powerful intercontinental ballistic missile it claims can strike any city on the US mainland and later declared itself a nuclear state. That test came days after Donald Trump had restored North Korea to Washington's list of state sponsors of terrorism.
On Monday, North Korean media warned that nuclear war could break out “at any moment” as the US and South Korea began their biggest-ever joint air drills.
The Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers' party, said the five-day Vigilant Ace exercises, which involve more than 200 aircraft, were “an open, all-out provocation against the DPRK, which may lead to a nuclear war any moment”.
“The US and South Korean puppet warmongers would be well advised to bear in mind that their DPRK-targeted military drill will be as foolish as an act precipitating their self-destruction,” it added, using the country's official title the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
While Washington and Seoul insist their military drills are purely defensive, North Korea regards them as a rehearsal for invasion.
Graham said he was confident Trump could manage the growing crisis, despite his failure to prevent the North from conducting missile and nuclear tests since becoming president.
In recent months, Trump has exchanged personal insults with the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, and issued threats to “totally destroy” the country if the US or its regional allies Japan and South Korea were forced to defend themselves.
“He's got the best national security team of anybody I have seen since I have been in Washington,” Graham said of Trump, who has vowed to deny North Korea the ability to strike the US with nuclear weapons.
“Denial means pre-emptive war as a last resort,” Graham said. “The pre-emption is becoming more likely as their technology matures. I think we're really running out of time.”
The senator said attempts by China – North Korea's main ally and economic partner – to pressure the Pyongyang regime into abandoning its weapons programme had been ineffective.
If North Korea conducted another nuclear weapons test, he added, “then you need to get ready for a very serious response by the United States”.
Graham's comments came a day after Trump's national security adviser, HR McMaster, described North Korea as “the greatest immediate threat to the United States”.
Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, McMaster said the risk of war with the North was “increasing every day, which means that we are in a race, really, we are in a race to be able to solve this problem”.
A Secret Service officer pleaded guilty Wednesday to two federal crimes, after sending explicit images to a police officer posing as a 14-year-old girl online.
According to the Justice Department, Lee Robert Moore, 38, was an agent assigned to the White House before he was arrested in November 2015. He's been in custody since his arrest.
Moore, of Church Hill, Md., sent sexually explicit text messages and at least one sexually explicit photo of himself to a Delaware State Police officer posing as a 14-year-old girl on the website Meet24. He also sent voice messages, according to a statement.
The chats were sexual in nature and some even took place while Moore was working at the White House.
After his arrest, Moore admitted to having similar interactions with three other minor girls, one in Florida, one in Texas and one in Missouri. He admitted to sending sexually explicit images of himself and convinced those girls to send sexually explicit photos of themselves as well.
He pleaded guilty to all charges and has yet to be sentenced.
Catching them all gets a bit more personal later this year as Nintendo announces two 3DS eShop tie-ins for Pokémon Black and White 2: the pro version of its free 3D Pokédex, and Pokémon Dream Radar, a game that let's players capture monsters in real life and transfer them to the full games.
This is exactly what I imagined when Nintendo first talked augmented reality on the 3DS. In Pokémon Dream Radar, players will use the handheld's camera and motion sensing capabilities to hunt for Pokémon in the wilds of their own living room (or that outside area I keep hearing about), firing beams of light at projected pocket monsters to capture them. Once captured, critters can be transferred into the upcoming Pokémon Black Version 2 and White Version 2. Fans can expect certain rare Pokémon to be easier to catch using the augmented reality app.
When they aren't hunting them, fans will be able to research Pokémon using the Pokédex 3D Pro, a premium version of the free Pokédex 3D app for the 3DS with all of the existing entries unlocked. I was wondering when they'd do that.
Both apps should supplement Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 quite nicely, giving players a new way to appreciate Black Kyurem and White Kyurem, the stars of the two games' covers.
I am completely ready to look ridiculous for the sake of augmented reality Pokémon. Look for both new apps to his the 3DS eShop later this year.

That's the question that two Republicans in Congress want answered. The failure of a relatively small local bank drew a lot of contributions from major financial institutions in order to qualify for $75 million in bailout cash, an odd level of attention considering the size of ShoreBank — but not if considering its political connections:
U.S. Rep. Judy Biggert (R-Ill.) joined U.S. Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.) in a letter to Obama asking for records concerning ShoreBank. The South Side bank, known for its community lending and with personal ties to Obama aides, has lined up at least $125 million in capital from major banks to qualify for a potential $75 million from the federal government. Citing unspecified reports of pressure on Wall Street mega-banks, whose interests are involved in a financial regulations bill, the representatives asked for all material, “including e-mails, phone logs and meeting records,” that deal with ShoreBank. They said ShoreBank may be getting special favors when other banks have been forced to close. The letter asked Obama to respond by June 2.
So who came to ShoreBank's rescue? The list includes Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and JP Morgan — all heavily involved in bailouts themselves, and all heavily connected to the administration. These all have accepted and repaid TARP funds, and as a consequence, all have to account for themselves to Treasury on salaries, bonuses, and business practices.
But why ShoreBank? The Boss Emeritus explains:
ShoreBank is a Windy City investment bank with all the right (or, rather, left) ties. Its stated progressive mission isn't merely to make good lending decisions, but to engage in Barack Obama-esque social engineering to “create economic equity and a healthy environment.” The ShoreBank corporate slogan: “Let's change the world.” The company website features a video of Obama in Kenya championing ShoreBank microlending projects overseas. ShoreBank has also touted itself as a “green” bank from its founding days — promoting dubious carbon credit programs, subjecting new borrowers to eco-litmus tests (“we look at how you use water, how you recover water and clean it, how you use energy, if you produce clean energy, how you manage CO2, whether you are offsetting CO2 that your product produces, if you are using sustainably produced materials”) and encouraging customers to participate in “EcoDeposits” to “directly support the green agenda.”
It's more than just a politically-correct agenda, though:
– ShoreBank co-founder Jan Piercy was a Wellesley College roommate of Hillary Clinton's, who has long supported the bank along with former president Bill Clinton. – Former ShoreBank Vice Chairman Bob Nash worked for Mrs. Clinton's presidential bid as deputy campaign manager. Board of Directors member Howard Stanback is a Hyde Park neighborhood pal of President Obama, who served with Stanback on the board of the radical Woods Fund (where Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers also sat). – White House senior advisor Valerie Jarrett served on the board of Chicago Metropolis 2020 with ShoreBank Director Adele Simmons, former president of the liberal MacArthur Foundation, where she focused on “climate change” and “global governance” issues. – The bank and its employees donated some $12,000 to the Obama 2008 presidential campaign, and co-founder Mary Houghton reportedly gave advice to Obama's late mother about small business lending issues.
This practically defines “crony capitalism.” Having the big financial institutions come to ShoreBank's rescue should have everyone's noses in full smell-test mode. Unless these institutions heavily invested in ShoreBank prior to its failure, this looks like a political intervention in an effort to pick winners and losers when the market should be determining those.
Addendum: Does anyone think Alexi Giannoulias might be wondering why these financial institutions didn't come to his family bank's rescue?

God has given them to me since I love kids. I am very comfortable with them and have no problems with my wives.”
Of the 34 children, six are boys, the oldest of the kids was born in 1989 and the youngest two years ago.
But managing such a large family, and life as an internally displaced person since the ISIS attack on the Yezidi town of Shingal, has not been easy.
“We do not have work and there is no salary. Before the arrival of ISIS my children were used to working. But our life is miserable now,” he complained, adding “all of the kids are students except the toddlers. We do not receive a fair share of the oil wealth.”
An estimated 14,000 families live in refugee camps in Zakho, which is in Duhok province.
ZAKHO, Kurdistan Region – Dakhil Khalaf, a Yezidi-Kurd living at a refugee camp in Kurdistan with his three wives and 34 children, had his plans ruined by the August 2014 ISIS attack on his town near Shingal: the 48-year-old was planning to take a fourth wife.“I was planning to get married for the fourth time, at the consent of my wives, but I did not manage to make it as ISIS forced us to flee,” he told Rudaw at the Bersevi refugee camp in Zakho, where all 38 family members live in a single tent.Commenting on his large brood of children, he said, “I know their names. I love them all without favoritism.
A new universal laptop charger standard that promises to cut down on e-waste has been published in the hope that it firms will choose to adopt it.
The International Electrotechnical Commission [IEC] Technical Specification 62700 would be compatible with a wide range of notebook computers and the IEC hopes that it will be adopted in the same way as the standard published for mobile phones.
“The IEC International Standards for the universal charger for mobile phones has been widely adopted by the mobile phone industry and is already starting to help reduce e-waste. A single power supply covering a wide range of notebook computers is the next step in lowering e-waste and its impact on our planet. I am proud that the IEC has yet again managed to make the best possible technical solution available,” stated IEC general secretary and CEO Frans Vreeswijk.
The IEC release states that it wants to attempt to reduce the e-waste related to chargers that is estimated at half a million tons per year and is not just the chargers themselves. When chargers are lost or break often computers are also thrown away and the IEC thinks that a universal standard will prevent computers from being disposed of and adding to the e-waste.
IEC's new standard covers all parts of the charger including the connector and plug, in addition to the safety, interoperability, performance and environmental considerations.
“The IEC is all about bringing concrete, feasible solutions to the marketplace. We welcome input from many sides to make our work as broadly relevant as possible. The result are state-of-the art tools that allow policymakers to initiate achievable and effective energy-efficiency and waste-management programmes,” Vreeswijk added.
The IEC plans to have the notebook charger ready for distribution in the early part of 2014 and follows the earlier released common standard for mobile phones that was adopted by the European Union in September.

Edubuntu is a version of Ubuntu Linux designed for schools, students, and folks generally interested in education. Formerly known as Ubuntu Education Edition, the operating system is based on Ubuntu, but includes a suite of apps aimed at teachers and students.
The first version of the operating system was released in 2005, and the last major release came in 2014, when the developers decided to only offer new versions alongside Ubuntu's LTS (Long Term Support) releases every two years instead of the more frequent releases which come out every six months.
Now it looks like the Edubuntu team has decided to slow the pace even further: Ubuntu 16.04 is coming in April, but Edubuntu will stay on version 14.04 indefinitely.
The developers plan to continue supporting Edubuntu 14.04 through April, 2019, which is when the “long term support” promise would normally end anyway.
But unless new contributors step up to take over development of the open source operating system, it doesn't look like we'll see any major new features in this education-oriented version of Ubuntu.
Of course, there's nothing stopping users from installing educational software in Ubuntu or other Linux-based operating systems on their own. Or you could try a different education-oriented operating system. The Edubuntu website even has a list of alternate Linux distributions including Debian-Edu,m Fedora Education Spinand OpenSUSE-Edu.

Researchers strike gold with nanotech vaccine
| Source:
Scientists in the US have developed a novel vaccination method that uses tiny gold particles to mimic a virus and carry specific proteins to the body's specialist immune cells.
The technique differs from the traditional approach of using dead or inactive viruses as a vaccine and was demonstrated in the lab using a specific protein that sits on the surface of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
The results have been published today, 26 June 2013, in IOP Publishing's journal Nanotechnology by a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University.
RSV is the leading viral cause of lower respiration tract infections, causing several hundred thousand deaths and an estimated 65 million infections a year, mainly in children and the elderly.
The detrimental effects of RSV come, in part, from a specific protein, called the F protein, which coats the surface of the virus. The protein enables the virus to enter into the cytoplasm of cells and also causes cells to stick together, making the virus harder to eliminate.
The body's natural defence to RSV is therefore directed at the F protein; however, up until now, researchers have had difficulty creating a vaccine that delivers the F protein to the specialised immune cells in the body. If successful, the F protein could trigger an immune response which the body could ‘remember' if a subject became infected with the real virus.
In this study the researchers created exceptionally small gold nanorods, just 21 nanometres wide and 57 nanometres long, which were almost exactly the same shape and size as the virus itself. The gold nanorods were successfully coated with the RSV F proteins and were bonded strongly thanks to the unique physical and chemical properties of the nanorods themselves.
The researchers then tested the ability of the gold nanorods to deliver the F protein to specific immune cells, known as dendritic cells, which were taken from adult blood samples.
Dendritic cells function as processing cells in the immune system, taking the important information from a virus, such as the F protein, and presenting it to cells that can perform an action against them―the T cells are just one example of a cell that can take action.
Once the F protein-coated nanorods were added to a sample of dendritic cells, the researchers analysed the proliferation of T cells as a proxy for an immune response. They found that the protein-coated nanorods caused the T cells to proliferate significantly more compared to non-coated nanorods and just the F protein alone.
Not only did this prove that the coated-nanorods were capable of mimicking the virus and stimulating an immune response, it also showed that they were not toxic to human cells, offering significant safety advantages and increasing their potential as a real-life human vaccine.
Lead author of the study, Professor James Crowe, said: “A vaccine for RSV, which is the major cause of viral pneumonia in children, is sorely needed. This study shows that we have developed methods for putting RSV F protein into exceptionally small particles and presenting it to immune cells in a format that physically mimics the virus. Furthermore, the particles themselves are not infectious.”
Due to the versatility of the gold nanorods, Professor Crowe believes that their potential use is not limited to RSV.
“This platform could be used to develop experimental vaccines for virtually any virus, and in fact other larger microbes such as bacteria and fungi.
“The studies we performed showed that the candidate vaccines stimulated human immune cells when they were interacted in the lab. The next steps to testing would be to test whether or not the vaccines work in vivo” Professor Crowe continued.

Twelve Years after the fall of the Fourth Hokage, the Village Hidden in Leaves has regained its military and economic power. The attack of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox, although brief, was enough to threaten the stability of the Shinobi World. The Third Hokage, pulled out of retirement, worked towards strengthening Konoha's position amongst the Great Five. The new host of the Nine-Tails Demon Fox received the personal attention of some of the most elite Shinobi in Konoha and rose into the ranks of ANBU at a young age.
The ANBU knelt, a black cloak spooled around the knees, and awaited orders. The elite ANBU's posture was perfectly still, obedient and subservient, as the Third Hokage stood there. The silence in the room was stiffening- the ANBU guard hiding in the shadows fidgeting- but the loyal ANBU did not move. The Hokage's face was like stone, weathered and wearied, yet there was something lurking in his eyes, something that had allowed him to reign over the most powerful Hidden Village for decades.
Many called it the Will of Fire.
"Rise, Kitstune," The Third Hokage said. He clasped his wrinkled hands behind his back and watched from beneath his conical hat as one of his most loyal and powerful warriors rose in a single deft movement. "I have called you here to undertake a S-rank mission. It is, of course, optional should you choose to decline but-"
"I accept," came the immediate response from the ANBU Kitsune. The white mask gleamed under the light of the office, the intimidating red stripes curled up into an angry snarl. Nonetheless, there was no emotion in the highly-skilled ANBU's voice. There never was.
"Very well," The Third Hokage murmured. He reached into his robes and patted his pockets for a few moments. Then, without a single gesture, the ANBU in the corner flickered and vanished. A second later, the guard reappeared holding the infamous Hokage's pipe.
"Ah, thank you," Sarutobi muttered. He lit his pipe and took a few puffs. "Kitstune, rendezvous with Delta Platoon at the coordinates provided in this scroll. You will provide assistance to complete their task It is vital for village security that this mission is completed. You have two and a half hours. Time is of the essence."
"I understand," Kitsune said solemnly as the Hokage passed over the sealed and bound scroll. "I will not fail you, Hokage-sama."
Then, without another word, Kitsune disappeared. There was no flicker of chakra or breeze of wind to accompany the disappearance. One moment Kitsune was there. The next moment, Kitstune was gone.
The Third Hokage continued to puff on his pipe, clouds of smoke billowing out and hovering around him in a haze of thick scented fog. The ANBU in the corner of the room made a hand sign and the walls of the Hokage's office flashed for a second, a circle of glowing symbols flashing in and out of existence. All at once, the stiffening silence In the room was lifted.
"Ferret!" The Hokage commanded. The ANBU in the corner straightened as Sarutobi walked back to his desk and, with a small grunt, sat back down in his chair. A small stack of papers lays waiting for him, highly classified documents that could not be delegated to the appropriate department.
"Your orders, Hokage-sama?" the ANBU in the corner muttered.
"I feel rather burdened today," Sarutobi said. "Go and prepare my calligraphy set. I will be there later. Wait for me there."
"Sir," Ferret acknowledged and disappeared with a small puff of smoke.
The Hokage sat back in his chair and continued to smoke his pipe. There was a lot riding on this mission. He could only hope that Kitsune would pull through.
After some years, the threat of war diminished and the cycle began to repeat itself. Old heroes would fall and new ones would rise up and replace then. One such hero of Konoha is Kitsune, an elite and well-trained ANBU on par with some of the most powerful Jounin in the world.
Later on in the day in one of the Hokage's personal rooms within the tower, Ferret finished unpacking the calligraphy set and stood back up with a small sigh. Almost as if he had predicted it, Sarutobi appeared at the doorway.
"My cloak," the old man said with a straight face and twinkling eyes.
Ferret nodded and took the cloak of the Hokage. He felt the fabric through his fingers as he hung it up on a peg. The Third Hokage nodded and took another drag of his pipe, only to frown as the last glowing embers of the tobacco went out.
"That's unfortunate," Sarutobi murmured. He stroked his beard and glanced at Ferret from the corner of his eye. "Did you, perchance, forget to refill my pipe?"
The ANBU paused. "Perhaps, Hokage-sama," he said after a short while. "My apologies."
"There's no need to apologise," Sarutobi chuckled. He moved over and knelt down before a large scroll. "I have become accustomed to my elite Shinobi failing their missions ever since I took you on. It was quite a difficult task for somebody of your…caliber."
The ANBU tensed. For a moment, the white mask seemed to scream at the Hokage, before the person behind it managed to compose himself. He bowed. "My apologies again, my lord."
"My Lord?" Sarutobi muttered and chuckled. "My, my, you have become rather good at apologizing, haven't you? Still, it can't be helped when you manage to continually fail your routine missions."
Ferret twitched.
"Perhaps I should give you another try," Sarutobi muttered as he picked up a fine brush and dipped it in his ink. "Take my hat and place it with my coat." Ferret moved in to take the hat but Sarutobi stopped him. "I warn you, I suspect that enemy Shinobi may intercept you on your mission. There is a high chance that you will fail it- like usual."
A strange noise came from behind Ferret's mask and Sarutobi couldn't hide the genuine amusement on his face. The elderly Shinobi cleared his throat. "However, I suppose I should give you a chance to explain yourself. After all, you are behaving very well today."
"Hokage-sama…" Ferret trailed off.
"Go on," Sarutobi urged. He gave a small smile that crinkled up his face. "I'm very impressed with your behavior but I know that you must be very eager to speak your mind, so I shall allow it."
"My mind?" Ferret repeated. "You want me to speak my mind?"
Kitsune is an A-ranked Shinobi gifted in all of the fields of battle. Taijustsu, Ninjutsu, Genjutsu, Fuinjutsu, Kenjutsu- there is no domain that Kitsune cannot claim some proficiency at. Kitsune's mission score is impressive and his exploits will undoubtedly go down in legend.
This is not Kitsune's story.
The Ferret mask came flying off the ANBU's head and a pair of cerulean-blue eyes glared at the elderly Hokage with righteous anger.
"Dammit, old man!" Uzumaki Naruto howled. "Don't treat me like a common servant!"
Three marks, like whiskers, stretched the young ANBU's cheeks as his face twisted into a fierce scowl. The boy, who couldn't have been older than twelve or thirteen, was dressed in ANBU armour, armour plates covering the backs of his arms and grey armour strapped over his black tunic and pants. Three pouches hung on his waist and a bandage was wrapped around his right thigh. All in all, he was hardly an intimidating or imposing figure.
The Hokage looked genuinely confused. "Ah, I'm afraid I don't understand, Naruto," he said. A smile flickered on his face. "As one of my loyal ANBU and my personal bodyguard, I was under the impression that you were my servant."
This is his story, the story of the ANBU named Uzumaki Naruto. Personally trained by the Third Hokage from a young age, Naruto entered the ranks of Genin at 8, Chunin at 10 and ANBU shortly after. Listed as a B-Ranked Shinobi in the latest Bingo Book, Naruto is the personal assistant and bodyguard of the legendary God of Shinobi, the Third Hokage of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
Essentially, Naruto was his servant.
"You're impossible!" Naruto snapped. He folded his arms with a huff and pouted. "Did you have to rub Kitsune in my face again?"
"I find your dislike of Kitsune quite interesting," Sarutobi chuckled. He began to paint, his weathered old hands moving deftly despite his age. "I would assume that you would look up to your senior officers as role models. He is talented and you could learn much about the ways of the shinobi from him."
"Yeah, but Kitsune is such…such a…." Naruto seemed to be at a loss for words.
"Loyal and powerful Shinobi?" Sarutobi supplied.
"No, not that," Naruto snapped. Comprehension dawned on his face and he snapped his fingers. "Arsehole! Yeah, that's the word. Kitsune is an arsehole!"
Sarutobi chuckled good-naturedly and looked behind Naruto young blonde boy cocked his head in confusion before horror dawned on his face.
'He's standing right behind me, isn't he?' he mouthed at Sarutobi, who merely smiled.
"Report," Sarutobi said.
"Mission complete." Naruto heard Kitsune's voice and closed his eyes in resignation.
"Good work, Kitsune," Sarutobi praised. "Your skill and dedication do you credit. There will be a debriefing with the Commander in fifteen minutes- I will be there shortly."
"Yes, sir." And then the ANBU was gone.
"I hate you," Naruto muttered with a scowl.
"How unfortunate," Sarutobi responded dryly. He stood up and motioned to Naruto, who rolled his eyes but obediently retrieved the Hokage's hat and cloak. Once Sarutobi had finished dressing himself, he waved Naruto off. "You're dismissed, Naruto. Report back at 1700 hours to complete routine assignment 4E."
"For once, could you make your own dinner?" Naruto muttered under his breath. He retrieved his mask and gave a short, clipped bow to the Hokage as protocol demanded. "I don't suppose you could talk to the Commander about that matter we discussed earlier?"
Sarutobi chuckled. "I rather like your mask, to be honest," he said and waved Naruto off. "Go, you little brat. Enjoy yourself while you can. Tomorrow I need you to watch Konohamaru and I'm sure you'll want to be well rested for that."
"I hate you so much sometimes, boss," Naruto said with abject horror.
"Welcome to ANBU, Naruto," Sarutobi chuckled and left, leaving the blonde demon host alone.
"Did it have to be Ferret?" Naruto whined to himself as he began cleaning up the Hokage's calligraphy set. "You'd think the Nine-Tailed Demon Host would get the Kitsune mask…" Naruto trailed off as he muttered some obscenities to himself.
ANBU sucked.
ANBU Directive #4: An ANBU must take the orders of the reigning Hokage with priority and before other duties.
A/N: It's been a while and I've been pretty bored over the past few weeks. I thought I'd take up some writing but I had no inspiration for any of my previous series or even Harry Potter in general. With that in mind, I thought I'd have a go at doing a Naruto story, since I've been wanting to do one for a while. That said, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to write until I read a bad ANBU!Naruto story.
So yeah, I guess I'll bash a few clichés, try to make it a bit light-hearted and see where it will go. I'm thinking of a series of connected one-shots until I either get bored or inspired to write a fully-fleshed story.
I'm rusty, so if you care enough let me know what you think.
Cheers.
Joe Launchbury should be England's next captain, according to Dai Young
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young has backed Joe Launchbury to become England's next captain and believes he can go on to emulate Martin Johnson and Sam Warburton.
The future of current skipper Chris Robshaw is in doubt with new head coach Eddie Jones stating last week his captain would have to be guaranteed a place in the team.
Jones was highly critical of Robshaw in a column he wrote for the Daily Mail in the build-up to England's World Cup defeat to Australia in which he stated the Harlequins flanker did not possess the necessary skills required to play number seven at international level.
That has led to speculation Jones will demote him and Young believes 24-year-old Launchbury - who has no previous captaincy experience - would be the ideal replacement.
Young believes Launchbury is a "world class player"
"I think he would make a great England captain. I would back him 100 per cent," Young said. "He is certainly somebody the players would get right behind.
"I see real leadership skills in Joe and you've got four years to build it. That's important. You pick your captain now and build his experience as a captain, building that trust from coach to captain.
"One of the greatest captains England has ever had, Martin Johnson, didn't speak for the sake of it. When he spoke people listened. I think Joe would be very similar."
Young was head coach at Cardiff Blues in 2011 when Warren Gatland sounded him out about making the then 22-year-old Warburton his new Wales captain.
That has since proved to be an inspired appointment and Young sees many parallels between Launchbury and the British and Irish Lions skipper.
Sam Warburton has been an inspired choice as Wales captain
"Joe ticks all the boxes and I do see similarities with Sam," Young said. "Sam had limited experience and that is not a drawback.
"Both are very sensible guys, they don't go looking for the limelight, don't do things that will draw attention to themselves and don't talk for the sake of talking.
"Like Sam, Joe is vocal when he needs to be. Gats [Gatland] helped grow Sam into the role. He wasn't someone that had captain written all over him.
"But Joe knows the game inside out and demonstrates the qualities that you'd want from a captain - he leads from the front, sets the standards on and off the field, in the preparation he does and the attitude he shows.
"Joe came in at a young age and not only does he now look an international player, he looks a quality international player, world class, a cut above everything that's out there."

Portugal has had its debt rating cut by Fitch to so-called "junk" status, and warned it could be cut again.
Fitch made the downgrade because of its "large fiscal imbalances, high indebtedness across all sectors and adverse macroeconomic outlook".
Portugal, along with Greece and the Irish Republic, has received bailout funds from the eurozone.
The news comes as a 24-hour strike in Portugal brought the country to a halt in protest against austerity measures.
The downgrade would make it more expensive for Portugal to borrow - if it were not already being bailed out.
Portugal received a bailout of 78bn euros from the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund and will not need to borrow from the markets until at least the end of 2013.
Other eurozone nations, such as Italy and Spain, have seen the yields on their debt rise to record highs against Germany, the safest and richest of the 17 nations that use the euro.
Investors fear Spain or Italy may be next to need a bailout.
Portugal's debt rating was cut by one notch, to BB+ from BBB-, and put on "negative outlook", meaning it is likely its debt will be downgraded again.
The latest rating means it is sub-investment grade, or "junk" in the terminology of the bond markets.
The aim is to cut Portugal's deficit of 9.1% - three times the eurozone's limit - to 3% by 2013.
Methamphetamine (METH), a highly addictive drug used worldwide, induces oxidative stress in various animal organs, especially the brain. This study evaluated oxidative damage caused by METH to tissues in CD-1 mice and identified a therapeutic drug that could protect against METH-induced toxicity. Male CD-1 mice were pretreated with a novel thiol antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA, 250 mg/kg body weight) or saline. Following this, METH (10 mg/kg body weight) or saline intraperitoneal injections were administered every 2 h over an 8-h period. Animals were killed 24 h after the last exposure. NACA-treated animals exposed to METH experienced significantly lower oxidative stress in their kidneys, livers, and brains than the untreated group, as indicated by their levels of glutathione, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl and their catalase and glutathione peroxidase activity. This suggests that METH induces oxidative stress in various organs and that a combination of NACA as a neuro- or tissue-protective agent, in conjunction with current treatment, might effectively treat METH abusers.
Amid all the brouhaha about the Spanish-made high-speed Talgo trains hitting Indian railway tracks, here is something which may come as a disappointment. The train's third and final phase of trials didn't go as expected because the train arrived at the destination three hours late.
The train started its journey from Delhi on Monday at 7:55 PM and reached Mumbai on Tuesday at 11:40 AM which is three hours behind the schedule. The train was expected to complete the journey of 1,384 km in 12 hours and 35 minutes, and was scheduled to reach the metropolis at 8.31 AM.
The train stationed at Matura Railway Station
A Western Railway official has blamed the heavy rains for the reason behind the delay.
Presently, super-fast train such as Rajdhani Express take around 16 hours to cover the Delhi-Mumbai route. The Talgo train which runs at an average speed of around 90-100 km/hr and can attain a maximum speed of 130-150 km/hr aims to cut short the time between the two destinations by almost four hours.

Recently, it became the fastest train in India after clocking 180 km/hr by covering 84 km in 38 minutes in a trial conducted by Railways on Mathura-Palwal route. The train consists of nine coaches, two executive class, four chair cars, a cafeteria, a power car and a tail-end coach for staff and equipment.

The state that gave America Frank Sinatra, Whitney Houston, Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi has another little-known distinction: New Jersey is the only state without an official song.
While some states have adopted multiple anthems since their founding, New Jersey has -- somehow -- gone its entire 226-year history without one.
But the push to create a Garden State anthem isn't just some runaway American dream. State lawmakers and musicians, after squabbling over the matter for decades, are hoping to, at last, decide on a song or set of songs that can represent the New Jersey way of life.
"After 75 years of state songs contests, enough is enough," music teacher and composer Dr. Patrick Finley, who wrote one of the state song candidates years ago, told FoxNews.com.
It hasn't been for lack of effort. The New York Times reported in 1937 that then-Gov. Harold G. Hoffman initially proposed legislation to create a state song. Since then, the debate has only dragged on, with much disharmony along the way. Choosing a state song has been, for New Jersey, akin to an entire state choosing pizza toppings, a process riven by petty disagreements and peculiar preferences.
State Sen. Jeff Van Drew, who has introduced a new state song bill, said New Jersey needs a song that represents “all that the state has to offer.”
Van Drew told FoxNews.com he realizes the legislature has other issues to focus on, but that doesn't mean this isn't important too. “I believe that we can also spend a small amount of time establishing more pride in our great state and its residents,” he said.
But ... what song?
In all likelihood, it wouldn't be an existing chart-busting hit. Low-profile songwriters, and even school children, have been behind most of the candidates so far.
One such effort started in 1996, when then-Gov. Christine Todd Whitman ordered the New Jersey Council on the Arts to hold a contest. The council declared “New Jersey, My Home,” written by Finley, the winner, and legislation was drafted to make it official.
However, the bill hit a snag. Legislation was also filed to declare the second-place song “In New Jersey,” which was inspired by a class of fourth-grade students, as the state song.
Complicating matters further, the two bills were also facing off against another song that preceded the contest. A bill declaring a song called “I'm From New Jersey” as the state song had passed both legislative houses multiple times in the 1970s and 1980s, but was never signed into law.
The song's composer, Red Mascara, has attempted to get the bill signed ever since, and legislation for his song is still pending. Mascara did not respond to a request for comment from FoxNews.com.
Finley told FoxNews.com he later grew frustrated and came up with a different solution. Even though he notes he did win the contest, he proposed “in the spirit of good sportsmanship we would share the honor,” meaning himself and the runners-up.
Finley told FoxNews.com he offered to let Mascara, whose song he quips is more of a “college fight song” than a state anthem, in on the new bill, but he refused. Mascara, according to Finley, told him he wanted to have his work declared the state song alone, or not at all.
Finley's new bill also languished, but was eventually revived by Van Drew, who added in yet another song to the latest bill. Finley said he plans to continue his nearly 20-year quest to see his song officially recognized, and called on lawmakers to finally make the multiple song bill law.
"This bill contains four lovely pieces of music and is equitable as it gets," he said.
But is he just livin' on a prayer? The legislature has not yet set a date for a final vote on the state song bills.
Nightwing Movie : 6 Actors In Talks To Play Dick Grayson
A few weeks back, Warner Brothers films confirmed that they had allotted Lego Batman director Chris McKay to the director a solo Nightwing movie. The movie is currently in the development phase, and according to the reports DC wants to launch the film by the end of 2019.
Why are we getting a Nightwing movie?
NW is Dick Grayson, the first sidekick of Batman as Robin. After years of fighting crime together, Robin felt that Batman still doesn't trust him, manipulates his teammates and he even went ahead called him selfish.
All these instances led to a heated altercation between them, and Dick finally left the Bat family. He took up a new identity as Nightwing and now fights crime in Gotham without relying on Batman or his resources unless the circumstances demand.
There is also a famous Comic Book Issue known as Batman R.I.P, where Dick puts on the cowl of Batman in his absence. Dick is an important character that has its enormous fan base and packs a ton of potential for DC's extended Cinematic Universe.
There hasn't been any official Dick Grayson movie or live-action adaptation till this date. Dick is more humorous and relatable to the public than any of the major DC characters, and if Warner Bros can get the right person to play this role, nothing can stop this movie from becoming one of the best Superhero movies of all time.
All the DC films till this date have not hit the Avengers-like note when it comes to a wholesome success. All DC flicks have been notable financial successes, but most of them were butchered by the critics. Dick's character is a fresh concept for the live-action audience; it can open a new dimension for the DC's shared universe.
Bill Dubuque (The Accountant) has penned the script, and the studio has approved it. The cast selection for Grayson's character is undergoing, and we've got reports that 6 actors got the auditions calls, and their tests will begin in a few months from now.
Is The Movie In Right Hands?
Chris Mckay, the director for this film, has already worked with the character of Robin during his mega hit “Lego Batman” movie that dominated the domestic box-office for weeks together.
Lego Batman is not at all the definitive version of Batman, but Chris is a talented director who has the capability to mix humor with action and bring an entirely new angle to the comic book characters.
If you look at his work in the three seasons of Robot Chicken that he has developed, you will see an incredible talent of giving characters their own distinct unorthodox aura that connects with the audience in an amusing way.
It is extremely hard to mock a fan-favorite character and still make the audience laugh. We have no reservations about the success of this movie if Chris's vision of the “first sidekick of Batman” is allowed to actualize on the big screen in its purest form.
How Is This Film Is Going To Connect With Current DC's Cinematic Universe?
Zack Snyder has already confirmed that Robin is dead during the timeline of Batman V Superman. However, he hasn't confirmed that which version of Robin got killed, and if we go by speculations it is Jason Todd. That means Dick might still be out fighting crime in parallel to Batman during BVS.
David Goyer is developing a movie based on Gotham Sirens, which will have antiheroines of DC teaming up to fight crime in Gotham. It will feature characters like Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy.
This movie could use some Nightwing's action instead of plugging Batman in every film. There is also a solo Batman movie in works with legendary director Matt Reeves, that can surely get NW more room to shine and bring some significant value to the overall franchise.
Who Should Become The First Robin?
Once Dick joins the DC movies, his role is going to become recurrent, and it will be a multi-movie deal for the actor playing this role.
Playing the part of such an important character in the DC Universe is an indispensable opportunity for any artists, and that's the reason we keep seeing several well-established actors posting and sharing NW's fan arts on their social media handles to make the creators aware that they are ready for this role.
According to a report from THR, 6 actors are under on the radar of the selection team, and here are the names of those actors.
6) Kit Harington
Kit has become a household a name after his breakout role in Game Of Thrones. He looks exceptionally good which is actually a requirement for the role, we have seen him doing phenomenal acting in Game of Thrones, and most importantly, his presence in this movie is a good way to get the female audience into theaters as he has an enormous female following across the globe. He is like a Rated R Harry Potter for ladies due to his role of Jon Snow in Game Of Thrones. The only reason, he may be rejected is because of his London accent.
5) Steven Yuen
He is the bad-ass pizza delivery guy from the Walking Dead, whose death in the show made countless fans quit watching. There is already a petition in existence that has around half a million signatures to cast Steven as the first Robin in the DC Cinematic Universe. Steven's character Glenn in Walking Dead has made a very special place in people's hearts. Steven is also going to be one of the lead guys in the upcoming Snowpiercer TV series which is a sequel to the hit movie by the same name. Steven has a great chance of getting selected, and he is also going bring some diversity in the DCU.
4) Aaron Taylor-Johnson.
Aaron has already performed two superhero roles in his career, that is Kick-Ass and Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Aaron has the physicality and the acting chops to bring an amazing Nightwing on the big screen. The only problem with Aaron is that he has grabbed a ton of negative light for playing the Quick Silver in the MCU. The writing of the movie didn't allow Aaron to shine as Quick Silver. ATJ came out as a weak actor. However, DC's cast specialists still think that he has what it takes to be the Nightwing, that's the reason his name is on the list of contestants. We believe that Aaron can do well in the boots of Nightwing, as he will bring a sort of rebellious attitude because it is natural to him. He is just 26 right now, so if he gets to play the part, he will be the poster boy for DC movies in years to comes. We still believe that there are much better actors to play Nightwing than ATJ.
3) Rami Malek
Rami Malek didn't have any notable acts before his earth-shattering performance in Mr. Robot. He bagged several prestigious awards like Emmy and Critics Choice awards for his delivery in Mr. Robot; he also got nominated for Golden Globes. Rami has become a fan-favorite in the realm of Internet, and fans want to see him pretty much in every movie that's out there. Rami may be over-qualified for the role of Nightwing in regards to acting, but he doesn't look like Dick at all. Yet, Warner Brother production team thinks that he is fit for playing Dick. If you ask us, Rami is a great actor, and he may be able to give us a dark and gritty Grayson that may suit the current ecosphere built by Batman V Superman. But his selection is going to piss off a ton of DC fans because Rami's doesn't carry that attractive, manly & handsome aura that is a basic requirement for this role.
2) Richard Madden
We have already seen the impressive performances of Richard in Game Of Thrones; there is no doubt that he could pull off an excellent Nightwing. He also packs a movie star look that brings him one step closer to the personality of the first Robin. Game Of Thrones is a massive hit across the globe, and his face is familiar to millions of people globally, having him on the movie is only going to help the DC's extended movie universe. Maybe, that is the reason Richard is one of the finalists for the Nightwing's part.
1) Finn Wittrock.
Finn is born to play the role of Nightwing. He looks like Dick Grayson just came out of the comic book pages, and now he is walking amongst us. And not just his appearance, Finn has done pretty much all sorts of characters in his career, and if you want to get mind your blown by his performance, check him out in American Horror Story Anthology series, Wittrock is the perfect Nightwing actor. For a change, DC and WB should cast an actor that doesn't generate negative ripples in the fandom just because people can't imagine them as their comic book counterparts. In our opinion, Finn is the right choice for the Nightwing's position. But we will have to wait to see what's going to be the outcome of this long and tedious selection process.
Raised in America, Namit Deshpande's great Indian football dream came true on Thursday.The young NRI's joy knew no bounds when he learned he made the India team for the Fifa U-17 World Cup next month. Along with Sunny Dhaliwal who lives in Canada, Namit created a piece of history – the first instance of NRIs donning India colours on the football pitch.For Namit, the coveted spot also kept a remarkable tryst with his adopted country.When the draw unfolded in Mumbai on July 7, first up for India in the first ever Fifa event the country gets set to host was the United States and it sent Namit and his father into raptures.On the other side of the world, an Indian-American shared the duo's joy. Sunil Gulati, president of the US national football body, witnessed his wish, expressed in a pre-draw speech in Mumbai, come true.Destiny deemed that the two countries not only found themselves in Group A but also playing the tournament opener against each other in New Delhi on October 6.“I am very excited, this opportunity comes once in a lifetime,” Namit told TOI, taking a quick break from the busy training camp at the Don Bosco Oratory ground in Fatorda.“Getting a place in the team is a dream come true,” he said. “My father and I were watching the draw and were very excited when India came up against the USA,” Namit said.The Deshpandes – Sandeep and Radhika, architects both – moved from Dadar, Mumbai, to New Jersey in 2006, taking six-year-old Namit along.Now a strapping lad of 17, 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing 72kg, the central defender has the adrenaline already flowing as he looks forward to the match against the US.“I grew up with many of the US players and I now have a chance to prove, not just I, but India are better than they are,” he said, confidence personified.As a defender, Namit joined the team on a preparatory tour in Brazil and was pleasantly surprised. “To be honest, the Indian defence is a compact unit and play their lines very well. It's well organized and it's something I understand better,” Namit observes.“The US are not really focused on the defensive line. They focus on build-up and just playing the game,” he saidNamit impressed the selectors who conducted a global scouting search which included video uploads from candidates.Studying in the 12th grade at Eastern Regional School, New Jersey, he has had to do a juggling act to balance studies with World Cup training commitments.“It was tough but with the help of Abhishek (Yadav) Sir (COO of the team), the federation and the entire team, I have been able to travel to and fro to meet my academic schedule,” he said.According to Namit, the school itself totally changed opinion and rendered every possible support after Yadav contacted them, acknowledging the fact that India were due to host their first-ever Fifa event.Namit is enjoying every bit of his stay in India, Goa in particular, and managing very well despite speaking broken Hindi and Marathi. His spirit and exuberance, not to mention ability in the heart of the defence, augurs well for India in a brutally tough group that also includes former champions Ghana and Colombia.
Ensaf Haidar stands in front of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in London, clutching a smiling photograph of her husband, Raif Badawi, who is behind bars for "insulting Islam through electronic channels."
It is almost five years since Saudi blogger Badawi was arrested for criticising the harsh measures of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, Saudi Arabia's religious police. On his website, the Liberal Saudi Network, Badawi questioned the Saudi regime's adherence to Wahhabism, a reactionary branch of Islam which aims to purify the religion and vehemently opposes Shia Muslims.
His criticism was seen as a grave offence by the Saudi regime and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, a fine of one million Saudi riyals (£200,000) and 1000 lashes. He received the first 50 in January 2015. Haidar watched on YouTube how her husband was flogged in front of a mosque in Jeddah. The next flogging was suspended because of Badawi's poor health, but the sentence still stands and his family live in fear that he will be whipped again.
After her husband was jailed, Haidar started receiving death threats. She fled to Canada with her three young children in 2014 where she was granted political asylum. From the other side of the world she has continued to campaign for Badawi's freedom, travelling across the globe to meet with human rights activists and politicians and raise awareness about her husband's plight.
Haidar tells IBTimes UK about her family's torment since Badawi's arrest.
"You can imagine our suffering. We feel every hour, every day, every week like a month,"she says at a vigil outside the Saudi Arabian embassy in London on Wednesday.
She used to speak to him on the phone regularly, but now he calls less frequently. He has diabetes and hypertension and has been complaining of kidney pain. His mental health has deteriorated, Haidar says. "Since he has been away from us for five years, he doesn't know much of what is going on in the outside world."
Haidar is joined by human rights organisations in London to "preserve Raif's morale and to show him that the world stands with us," she says. Haidar holds a weekly vigil in her Canadian hometown Sherbrooke to raise her husband's spirits and campaign for his release.
British human rights activist Peter Tatchell stands among the protesters holding placards emblazoned with the slogan 'Free Raif.'
"We are here to say that we won't go away until Raif, his lawyer Waleed and all political prisoners are free," Tatchell tells IBTimes UK.
"These men and women are in detention for merely expressing opinions and ideas that the Saudi regime does not like. We are urging the Saudi government to show them clemency and commute their sentences."
The UK and US governments have it in their power to pressure Saudi Arabia into releasing political prisoners "by ending our sordid commercial deals with the Saudis," he says.
83% of UK arms exports, almost £900 million, in 2015 went to Saudi Arabia, according to research by Greenpeace's EnergyDesk. In the same year, the UK bought £900 million of oil from the kingdom.
"If Western countries claim they support human rights, they have to act to support human rights. That means giving an ultimatum to Saudi Arabia [that] there will be no more deals unless Raif Badawi and other political prisoners are free," Tatchell says.
Saudi Arabia is one of the most tightly controlled media environments in the world. It is ranked 168th of 180 countries in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index, having fallen three places in the last year. There is no independent media, meaning that the internet is the only place information can freely be reported. But as Badawi's case shows, opinions online are also strictly policed.
"The situation is getting worse," says Alexandra El Khazen, head of Reporters without Borders' Middle East desk. There are currently 11 journalists and bloggers behind bars in Saudi Arabia, she tells IBTimes UK. They have been sentenced under the anti-terrorism and cybersecurity laws "simply for expressing their opinion online," she says.
Despite the lack of progress, Haidar strongly believes that the international campaign will have an impact and that the family will be reunited. "I am convinced that Saudi Arabia is currently adopting reforms which will maybe lead to the release of Raif," she says. "I am convinced always that he will be free soon."
Bears Return of the grizzly? Feds consider transplanting bears into Washington's North Cascades.
In the summer of 1993, Bill Gaines, a young wildlife biologist with the U.S. Forest Service in Washington state, took a break from field work to climb in the Glacier Peaks Wilderness in the North Cascades. As he trekked through the remote, subalpine Napeequa Valley, Gaines spotted a furry face peering at him from behind a log some 40 feet away. It looked like a bear — cinnamon-colored, round face, small ears. But was that a shoulder hump? Gaines dropped his pack (“rather stupidly,” he recalls) and tried to get a closer look. But the creature spun around and disappeared.
“(That's) the only time I've seen a bear in the Cascades where I could not say with certainty that it was a black bear,” says Gaines. Although five to 10 grizzlies supposedly roam the mountains of northwest Washington, Gaines has snagged more than 700 bear hair samples without finding a single one. But, that could change.
Following the listing of the Lower 48 grizzly population under the Endangered Species Act in 1975, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identified the North Cascades and five other areas—Yellowstone, Selkirk, Cabinet-Yaak, Bitterroot and the Northern Continental Divide— as grizzly recovery zones. Since then, most zones have seen steady bear population growth thanks to strong state and federal management and financial investment in recovery initiatives. In 1997, a recovery plan was developed for the North Cascades zone, and 10 years later, the Washington Legislature appropriated funding for an environmental analysis of grizzly restoration. But state and federal agencies were unable to begin work quickly, and when the recession hit the following year, the state withdrew funding for the project. The recovery plan languished, and the North Cascades grizzly seemed destined to disappear completely.
But in 2014, things turned around. This time, when National Park Service and the Skagit Environmental Endowment Commission offered funding for an assessment, national, state and local agencies were ready. This January, the environmental impact statement was released, along with a draft plan to return the bears to the 6.3-million-acre North Cascades ecosystem. Now, biologists and advocates have renewed hope that one day they'll see a viable grizzly population in the Cascades.

The draft plan, currently under public comment, offers four alternatives for recovery, with the aim of one day achieving a population of 200 grizzlies. They range from taking no action to augmenting the population with transplanted bears from northwestern Montana and/or south-central British Columbia. One would see the initial translocation of 10 closely monitored bears with the intention of reaching 200 within 60 to 100 years. Another would move in five to seven bears per year for up to a decade. And an expedited approach could lead to 200 bears in a mere 25 years.
If the North Cascades bears are ever going to bounce back, says Wayne Kasworm, acting grizzly recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it will take that kind of intervention. Though a small population has long existed on the British Columbia side of the Cascades, major river valleys, human development and railways have prevented those grizzlies from moving south across the border, says Kasworm. But trapping and moving bears can be difficult. Not all survive the stressful journey. Some slip their radio collars and wander off. Others attack livestock or pets. Transplanting grizzlies to restore a population isn't entirely new, though — and it's worked before.
In 1987, Kasworm was one of the first to propose augmenting the population in the Cabinet-Yaak zone, in northwestern Montana and northern Idaho, with bears from British Columbia's Flathead Valley. Eventually, residents and officials agreed to give it a chance, and in 1993, biologists captured a young female, fitted her with a radio collar, and drove her 150 miles through the night to the Cabinet Mountains. It was the first time a grizzly bear had ever been translocated in the United States. Since then, the Fish and Wildlife Service has introduced a total of 19 bears, and the Cabinet-Yaak population has successfully grown to over 45 individuals.
But some fear that grizzlies might harm hikers, horseback riders or mountain bikers in the North Cascades. Steve Darwood, a local outfitter, has been leading pack trips through the Pasayten and Sawtooth Wilderness for 47 years. “The people I service, they don't want to see grizzlies here — they have a good experience without them,” he says. People should have a choice, he says; if they want to view grizzlies, they can visit Yellowstone or Canada.
The draft plan is open for comment through April 28, and eight open houses will be held across Washington in February. Gaines, who retired from the Forest Service in 2011, remains hopeful that these efforts will bring grizzlies to the North Cascades. “This area is so, so wild,” he says, “and yet we don't have that symbol of wilderness.”

Mayor Ras J. Baraka announced today that the City of Newark has begun a 4-year partnership with Rutgers University–Newark and its School of Public Affairs and Administration (SPAA) to develop and maintain an official citizen-facing mobile application, an official Open Data repository of non-sensitive city data, and an analytics team of graduate students through the Center for Information Management, Integration and Connectivity (CIMIC). The mobile application, called “My Newark” includes the reporting of non-emergency issues, anonymous police tips, current news, and local information. The new Open Data portal is available online at http://data.ci.newark.nj.us and features data on property ownership, 311 calls, permits, and more. The Rutgers CIMIC analytics team of students and faculty will leverage City data to make efficiency recommendations.
“This groundbreaking partnership between Newark and Rutgers University–Newark is about offering 21st Century government services,” said Mayor Baraka. “The mobile app and Open Data site will empower Newark residents, promote transparency, and encourage civic participation. I commend our team and Rutgers on this partnership and look forward to seeing their data expertise improve how we operate.”
“The work we are doing with the City of Newark on this app, Open Data site, and analytics is a collaborative, reciprocal partnership that sharply reflects the role of Rutgers University–Newark as an anchor institution in the city,” said Rutgers University–Newark Chancellor Nancy Cantor. “SPAA and the city are pooling their expertise and learning from one another, which greatly increases the impact of their work both individually and collectively. We look forward to many more such collaborations.”

It wasn't just the nature of Arsenal's 6-0 defeat to Chelsea that caused the weekend's biggest jolt - tonkings by both Manchester City (6-3) and Liverpool (5-1) in the league this season are still fresh in the memory, after all. Instead it was the timing of their latest humiliation that delivered a shock. Almost from the moment Arsenal had reestablished themselves as genuine Premier League contenders (rather than a shoo-in for fourth spot) following their away win at Spurs, so they were being swept aside by Jose Mourinho's title-chasing side.

This fixture against Swansea presents a neatly timed opportunity to stem the bleeding. With rumours that crisis talks were held at Arsenal during the fallout from Saturday, not to mention reports that Arsene Wenger is maybe questioning his position on a new contract at the club, a home fixture might be just the tonic. Win with style and Arsenal can recalibrate their tilt at the title. A nervy draw - or heaven forbid, defeat - and Arsenal's reputation as chokers on the home straight will have gathered further credence.
Swansea will present a test of modest challenges. With the Europa League's whistle-stop tour of easyJet destinations concluded, their results have given fans much to fret about. The 3-2 defeat at Everton was yet another nail in the coffin of a season that stands in stark contrast to the bright campaign of 2012/13. The table paints an equally gloomy picture: Swansea have gone eight games without a win. The shadow of potential relegation lengthens with every week.
Team news
Such are Arsenal's injury concerns in prominent areas that one or two players should be made available for cameo roles in Casualty. Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshere, Abou Diaby and Mezut Ozil are medium to long-term absentees, though the red shown to Kieran Gibbs - that should have been waved at Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - against Chelsea by latest pantomime villain Andre Marriner has been rescinded.
In better news, midfield fulcrum Aaron Ramsey might be available for selection.
Swansea's medical notes are comparatively lightweight. Only defender Kyle Bartley is sidelined following his hamstring injury. Striker Michu, who was a long-term presence in the stands, should now be on his way to full fitness following appearances against West Brom and Everton.
Player to watch: Tomas Rosicky (Arsenal)
Rosicky has been the focus of a charge of "What if?' questions from Arsenal fans this season: What if injuries hadn't hampered his career curve? What if he was a couple of years younger than 33? What if his supporting cast - Ozil, Ramsey, Walcott and Wilshere - hadn't been pinched by lengthy spells in the medical room in recent months? Chances are, Arsenal's points tally this season would have been slightly higher.
As his performances this season have proved, Rosicky has shown both the technical smarts and vision to unlock resolute defences (maybe not against top four sides, but definitely when combating teams lower down the table). His work-rate is unswerving, too. This is a stage on which Rosicky is primed to make a telling contribution. A display brimming with verve and confidence should steady any nerves within his team-mates.

The managers
Wenger might have experienced something of a crisis of personality given the weekend's schizophrenic mood. Hype precluding his 1,000th game in charge lauded him as an innovative figure amid the Premier League's current era of hyper-fitness (such was the gushing praise, it wouldn't have been a surprise had someone heralded him as the inventor of broccoli). By Monday, commentators had framed him as a man struggling to keep up with the changing times. Happy birthday.
For Garry Monk, Swansea's current man at the helm, a trip to the Emirates Stadium presents a free swing on the fixture list.
His side travel to London with no real expectation of securing three points - most fans would have dismissed this fixture as an exercise in misery long before their season had taken such a turn for the worst. The shackles are off, then. Gather a point or better here, and Monk's claim for survival could gather momentum.

Arsenal vs Swansea LIVE ANALYSIS with Stats Zone
Marlin Briscoe threw 14 touchdown passes as a rookie with the Denver Broncos. And then he never got another start as a quarterback.
The Denver Broncos didn't want Marlin Briscoe to play quarterback.
When the team chose him in the 14th round of the 1968 American Football League draft, they planned to stick him at defensive back. It didn't matter that Briscoe had thrown for 2,283 yards and 25 touchdowns as a senior at the University of Omaha, where he'd earned the nickname “The Magician” for his elusive style of play.
Briscoe was small for a quarterback at 5-foot-10 and 180 pounds. And, of course, he was black.
He had played quarterback all his life, starting at the Pop Warner level in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. He had no desire to give it up. So Briscoe did something uncommon for a black man in that era: He negotiated.
“I wanted a three-day trial at quarterback before I would sign a contract,” Briscoe says. “They thought I was crazy. A 14th-round draft choice going to dictate to the Denver Broncos how he wanted to structure his contracts and his workouts?”
“I told him, I said, ‘I want to play professional football. I'll play defensive back, but this is something that I want into this contract.'”
Briscoe got his three-day tryout. In front of media and fans during training camp, he showed enough for the Broncos to keep him on the roster.
On Sept. 29, 1968, he got his chance. It was the Broncos' home opener in Week 3. With Denver trailing the Boston Patriots 17-10 and failing to generate much offense, Broncos head coach Lou Saban sent Briscoe into the game. Briscoe shrugged off his green coat and jogged onto the field as the team's quarterback.
“Anything I'm interested in, I go overboard for.”
The man who became the first black quarterback to start in the modern football era is now 71 years old. He leads a mostly quiet life. He's worked in football, finance and education, but he's retired from it all now.
Briscoe says it's hard for him to sit still because as he puts it, “I'm a -holic. Anything I'm interested in, I go overboard for.”
These days, it's golf. Briscoe plays around six times a week. He couldn't make it out to the course Wednesday because of the weather. Over the phone, he sounds disappointed about the conditions.
“It's raining,” he says.
When Briscoe likes something, it's hard for him not to become obsessed with it. It's this trait, he says, that helped him play quarterback through talent and force in an era when black men didn't.
It's also this trait, Briscoe says, that helped him play eight more seasons of pro football at wide receiver after racism kept him from playing quarterback after initial success in Denver.
And, yes, Briscoe says, it's this trait that fueled his drug addiction after his professional career that almost cost him everything.
Briscoe is happy and healthy now. He's been sober since 1990. He's glad to tell his story — that is, when he's not busy playing golf.
“We knew if anybody could break that barrier it could be Marlin.”
In the week leading up to the Broncos' home opener against the Patriots, Briscoe was told there was a slim chance he'd get in at quarterback. He was given a handful of plays to work with just in case. Denver's starting quarterback Steve Tensi was still on the mend with a broken collarbone. Briscoe knew that if Tensi's backup Jim LeClair was ineffective, there was an opportunity for him to play. Early in the fourth quarter, it happened.
“I only had six to eight plays to work with that first game,” Briscoe says. “I didn't have a full menu of plays to work with. So I just went back and started playing sandlot ball.”
Briscoe completed his first pass, a 22-yarder to Eric Crabtree. He later led Denver on an 80-yard touchdown drive, which he capped with a 12-yard score. Denver lost the game 20-17, but Briscoe showed enough to earn the nod the next week against the Cincinnati Bengals. He became the first black man to start at quarterback in the modern professional football era.
He'd end up tossing 14 touchdowns in 11 games that season — still the most ever for a Broncos rookie — and finished second in the AFL's Rookie of the Year voting.
“We were pretty excited,” says John Beasley, who was Briscoe's college teammate. “Nineteen-sixty-eight was a pretty tumultuous year across the country. There were a lot of things going on politically. A lot of police brutality. So we were more focused on that. It was no surprise to anybody that Marlin could play quarterback. We knew that the position up until that time was reserved for white players only.
“We knew if anybody could break that barrier it could be Marlin, and he did.”
What Beasley didn't know then was that his friend would never play another snap for the Broncos. In fact, his friend would never even start a game at quarterback again.
“All I asked for was a fair competition.”
Briscoe was back in Omaha when his cousin Bob Rose called him in the summer of 1969. Rose, who worked in insurance in Denver, told Briscoe that the Broncos were holding quarterback meetings without him.
Briscoe was puzzled. He knew he'd be competing for the starting job with Tensi. But to not even get invited to the meetings that the backups were part of? He flew to Denver and drove to the Broncos' facility.
“The receptionist, she was always very good to me, looked at me like she saw a ghost,” Briscoe says. “They were having quarterback meetings in the next room. I sat down in the lobby. I just sat there.
“Saban, he came out, looked like he saw a ghost because I surprised him by being there. He couldn't even look me in the eye.”
Briscoe knew then that he would never get a fair shake in Denver. He asked Saban for a release. Saban granted it to him — but not immediately. He waited four days.
“At the end of the four days, I had no tenders,” Briscoe said. “No team even called me. I threw six touchdown passes against the Chargers, and they wouldn't give me a look.
“I realized those four days were used to sully the waters on me, I guess. I was being labeled. I wanted to compete. I never asked them to give me a starting position. I never demanded it. All I asked for was a fair competition.”
No one wanted Briscoe at quarterback, despite his promising rookie season. Briscoe had played the position his entire life — from Pop Warner, to college to the AFL — by being insistent that that was where he was most valuable.
“He had to remake himself.”
Briscoe began calling around. One of the teams he tried was the Buffalo Bills. They offered him a tryout as a wide receiver. Briscoe had never played the position before in his life. Once again, he negotiated.
“I told them I'd compete for job as a wide receiver, but (I said), ‘You can't cut me until the last cut.' The guy, you could hear him kind of gasp on the phone. I told him, ‘I've never played this position before. I'm not going to come there for two days and get cut because I'm stumbling around and trying to find my niche at a position I've never played.' They agreed.”
Briscoe's “-holic” personality took over as he learned his new position. He watched film of Paul Warfield, who he'd later team up with in Miami, and Lance Alworth — two of the receivers he admired. He ran routes to learn the proper footwork. He took to it well.
As a rookie, Briscoe recorded 532 receiving yards and five touchdowns. His second season in Buffalo, he was named a Pro Bowler after going over the 1,000-yard receiving mark and catching eight touchdown passes.
He joined the Dolphins in 1972 and started opposite of Warfield at wideout. In three seasons there, he racked up 858 receiving yards, seven touchdowns and was a part of two Super Bowl champion teams.
“He was released after he proved to them that he could be very valuable in terms of winning,” says Warfield. “Once he was released, he had to remake himself. He became a wide receiver. That is where I have great admiration for him. He was a quarterback from the time he was a youngster. He remade himself. That occurred in a matter of weeks, and he figured it out and made himself competitive.”
Briscoe's Miami teammates say he didn't bring up what had happened to his career as a quarterback.
“He didn't talk about it,” says Dolphins offensive lineman Larry Little. “But you could tell he wanted to play quarterback. We had a great quarterback, Bob Griese. Marlin made the most out of his situation by being an outstanding wide receiver.”
“L.A. was a little bit different.”
At 31, Briscoe moved to Los Angeles and took a job in finance selling municipal bonds. He was the only black salesman at the company. Financially well off, he bought a home.
“I was always on top of things I guess you could say, the worldly things in life,” he said. “L.A. was a little bit different.”
The friends Briscoe started to make there were rich and well-connected. Actors, actresses and athletes. He didn't need to stay in shape anymore and fell into the party life. He began dabbling in drugs.
“But my personality is I'm a -holic in whatever I do,” he said. “Whether it's playing marbles or whatever. So I had this personality is that it's all or none. And that's what happened.”
Briscoe started using crack cocaine. Over a 10-year span, he lost most of his wealth, his home and got divorced. He was arrested twice — the second time in 1990 when he was picked up with a $5 rock of cocaine in his possession.
He spent 60 days in a San Diego jail, and it was there that he made the decision to get clean once and for all. He arranged for a friend from Los Angeles to pick him up once he got out.
Briscoe says he's remained clean ever since.
“He was just exciting to watch.”
A movie about Briscoe's life is in the early stages of production. It's called “The Magician” after the nickname his teammates gave him in college.
“He was just so magical on the field. As his pass protector, I'd fall back to block for him, and I'd see him on the other side of the field surrounded,” says Beasley, who played left guard at Omaha — and is the grandfather of current Denver Nuggets guard Malik Beasley. “And the next thing you'd know he'd be downfield. He was just exciting to watch. Sometimes I found myself being a fan while I was supposed to be protecting him to play.”
Beasley, who went on to become an actor and has appeared in “Rudy,” “Walking Tall,” and “CSI: Miami,” helped secure funding for “The Magician.” Greg Howard, who wrote “Remember the Titans,” has already written a screenplay for the movie, while Lyriq Bent agreed to play the lead.
Briscoe says now that he didn't think much about the significance of his accomplishment as it was happening. He was just playing a position he'd always played. It wasn't until Ebony Magazine published a six-page story about him the next year that he began to realize what he'd done.
“That's when I realized the impact it had on African Americans as well as white America as well,” he says. “It let them know, let everybody know that a black man could think it through and lead at that level.”
Briscoe doesn't sound bitter about today about never getting a chance to play the position he loved after 1968. He went to a Pro Bowl, won two Super Bowls and was a part of the undefeated '72 Dolphins team as a wide receiver.
He admits there is a small part of him that wonders what could've been. But when he looks back on his pro career, he says what he feels the most is pride in the fact that he was able to pull off playing quarterback at all when the deck was stacked so heavily against him.
“I was adamant about it when I was a kid. I was adamant about it when I was in college. I was adamant about playing it when I was in the pros,” he says. “And I pulled it off.”

FAIRFAX, VA — A group of George Mason University students filed a lawsuit Thursday against both the school and its primary fundraising arm in an attempt to find out more about the university's relationship with the Charles Koch Foundation.
The group, which calls itself Transparent GMU, says it's concerned about the potential for private donors to influence students' education and wants access to records that detail the school's involvement with the Koch Foundation, the school's biggest donor.
The group says students began a campaign in 2014 for donor transparency after the Koch Foundation entered into an agreement with Florida State University that gave the conservative organization influence over hiring and curriculum decisions.
To ensure similar agreements were not influencing decisions at their own school, Transparent
GMU filed a Virginia Freedom of Information Act request for the Mason's agreements with
the Koch Foundation but the university and the GMU Foundation said the records
weren't covered by the Act.
After being denied access to the records, Transparent GMU worked with attorneys at
Appalachian Mountain Advocates, a public interest law firm, to explore other options.
Here's what attorney Evan Johns says:
"It's disappointing to see the Foundation turn away students who are justifiably concerned about
donor influence at their university—especially when Virginia's open records law is so clear. The law simply does not allow a public university to conceal its records by outsourcing its public business to a private company."
Here's a copy of the suit.
Here's background information from Transparent GMU.

In their own words - GAA stars on their battles with depression
Here, in their own words, are the heart-breaking, courageous and ultimately inspiring experiences of Maurice Shanahan, Wayne Hutchinson, Shane Carthy, Alan O'Mara and Conor Cusack.
Maurice Shanahan
I got really bad: I tried to attempt suicide. That's not an easy thing to say, it's just something that came over me that I wanted to end my life. I'm glad today that I didn't.
I don't remember much about doing it. I did think about it for a long time. I thought about it for a week or two before I attempted it. I got home one Sunday evening and I took an overdose.
I texted my sister after taking it, around an hour later. I texted her because I thought, by the time she came that I would have been gone. I didn't want my parents walking in to find me me dead in the bed. I wanted her to come in and see it first.
One evening I went out for a walk and the whole of Lismore were out looking for me and they found me in time.

My father had battled through cancer at the time and it was really hard on him. I could see him, and (I thought) that was down to me because of the worry I'd put in to him.”
Dan, being my brother, locked me into the shed at home. He said stuff that really hit home. He said that if I did what I was attempting to do, ‘you're not just going to kill yourself, you're going to kill your parents, you're going to kill me'.
That really hit home that evening. It wasn't hearing that from your own brother and the tears flowing down his eyes.

Shane Carthy
It was building up so much for years previous to that and unfortunately the five or six months before that, my thoughts were of ending my life really
That really didn't help with going to school or football, I just had this constant dark shadow in my way.
Inside when I had a few moments to myself, I was really crumbling and breaking down.
Shane Carthy
I don't know how I went through it for a couple of years but it got harder and harder as the thoughts got worse.
I'm glad I spoke up and dealt with it and to be honest now I wish I had done it earlier because I'm along the recovery path and am nearly out the other side.

Wayne Hutchinson
I'd planned what I was going to do well in advance, right down to date, time and place. I was going to end it all.
I waited for everyone else to go to bed. And when they did, the blackest of darknesses consumed me as I lay there, as I so often have, staring at the ceiling. I quietly made my way downstairs, but all the while I was shaking. I was intent on going to the back of the house and into a forested area nearby.
Just as I'm about to make my way outside to end it all, I hear a noise upstairs, followed by footsteps, gingerly making their way downstairs.
I leave the door slightly ajar to see who it is. It's Mam, and she's getting a glass of water.
Wayne Hutchinson describes his battle with depression on an online blog
Unknowingly, she has intervened again to make a difference in my life; those footsteps, to me, were a sign from God: I need to keep fighting. I owe it to Mam
The following day, when the house was empty, I return to the spot where I'd planned to end it all. I pick up my stuff and am filled with shame and embarrassment.
I place the stuff in a bag, drive to Shannon Cliff in Dunmore East, take the rope out of my bag and throw it off the cliff and into the sea below.
The rope is gone. I'm still here.
For years I was thinking I was different, thinking I was the only one in the world with my particular problem.
Now I know it's not just me. I know there are others with that same 'companion' in life: depression.

Alan O' Mara
There is nothing to catch my attention on this road; nothing to distract my brain.
It's just me in the car, me and the voice that has become more and more prominent lately. It is getting louder. It gets to the point where it muffles out the radio. I keep driving. I keep thinking, questioning and wondering.
How have I got to this point? The point where there is even a thought of swerving my car into the concrete wall on the side of the motorway.
I feel trapped; it's just me and that voice in the fast lane of a motorway. Deep down, somewhere, I'm aware that is not a good mix.

The concrete wall to my right looks so appealing. How easy it would be just to swerve into it and finish it all. The voice whispers in my ear: ‘Will anybody even care if I do it?' The visualisation of my parents at my funeral rescues me from this horrible train of thought. I wind the window down and let the crisp air hit my face.
Eventually I get home and I want to switch off. I'm tired, I'm cranky and I've had a realisation that I am depressed.
The key thing for anyone who is feeling depressed is to always remember there is light at the end of the tunnel.
If you ever get to a point where you are struggling to see it, like I did, then that is the moment to reach out for help. Opening the vault that had become my head was crucial in lifting my depression.

Conor Cusack
I still remember the moment well. It was a wet, cold, grey Friday morning. I rose out of bed having had no sleep the night before. Panic attacks are horrific experiences by day, by night they are even worse.
My desire for death was now much stronger than my desire for living so I made a decision.
I had the rope hidden in my room. I knew there was a game on a Saturday evening and that my father and the lads would be gone to that. After my Mother and sister would be gone to Mass, I would drive to the location and hang myself. I didn't feel any anxiety about it. It would solve everything, I thought.
For some reason my Mother never went to Mass. I don't know why but she didn't go. It was a decision on her part that saved my life.
Depression is difficult to explain to people. If you have experienced it there is no need, if you haven't, I don't think there are words adequate to describe its horror.
Conor Cusack - found space to express his emotions in psychotherapy
It permeates every part of your being, from your head to your toes. It is never ending, waves and waves of utter despair and hopelessness and fear and darkness flood throughout your whole body. You crave for peace but even sleep doesn't afford that. It wrecks your dreams and turns your days into a living nightmare.
It destroys your personality, your relationship with your family and friends, your work, your sporting life, it affects them all. Your ability to give and receive affection is gone. You tear at your skin and your hair with frustration. You cut yourself to give some form of physical expression to the incredible pain you feel.
For those people who are currently gripped by depression, either experiencing it or are supporting or living with someone with it, I hope my story helps. There is no situation that is without hope, there is no person that can't overcome their present difficulties.
For those that are suffering silently, there is help out there and you are definitely not alone.
Your journey in will unearth buried truths and unspoken fears. A new strength will emerge to help you to head into the choppy waters of your painful past. Eventually you will discover a place of peace within yourself, a place that encourages you to head out into the world and live your life fully. The world will no longer be a frightening place to live in for you.
The most important thing is to take the first step. Please take it.

The uninitiated may question the wisdom of disregarding mental cues that promote survival.
“Maybe it is really unhealthy, but for me, I'm curious,” Hoagland said. “I only live once, and I want to see what it's like to go to these dark places, where we're not intended to be. At his or her core, an ultra runner is meant to go beyond what is rational. It's crazy, but that's how we are.”
Roche said the events were a chance to explore limits on one's own terms — like a dress rehearsal for real adversity.
“Life now is pretty sterile — a lot of the problems we face are manufactured,” Roche said. “When things go wrong in ultras, it's very real and visceral, and you confront it. It's life condensed down to a bite-size morsel that you can generally consume without consequence. If you don't finish, it doesn't actually matter.”
As the number of races grows in pace with demand, the reclusive sport is changing. Although races generally offer little in prizes, money and sponsorship have begun to trickle in, along with some of the governance concerns that have plagued mainstream road racing. Lance Armstrong, barred from competition in many sports, won a trail race last year, driving debate around future regulation of performance-enhancing drugs in the sport.
And professional runners are increasingly drawn to the longer distances. The 2008 American Olympic marathoner Magdalena Boulet won her 100-mile debut at the Western States Endurance Run last year and continues to dominate the field. The Olympic distance runner Kara Goucher, who grew up in a town near that of the champion ultra runner Scott Jurek in Minnesota, also sees a new athletic future in the sport. Although she is one of the most accomplished marathon runners in the United States, Goucher said she was daunted by the challenge of even finishing such a distance.
“I'm attracted to the challenge, and I think the first time I do it I will be facing my fears of not finishing, and just surviving, seeing if I compete without quitting,” said Goucher, 38. “I was very nervous for my first marathon; I had never run that far. But I was also fearful of others' expectations of me, whereas if I do an ultra, no one's going to care.
“People run ultras because they love running. I think about what's gotten me out the door year after year, and I think, these could be my people. We're all just trying to do the best we can.”
Tertiary students Jack Wilson, 20, Scott Anderson, 19, Arjun Singh, 18, and James Coogan, 19, have just moved into their flat in Ada Street in Palmerston North.
As tertiary students return to the city, safety advisory groups are getting prepared to make sure they are receiving the right messages.
Orientation week kicks off at Massey University on Wednesday with city and Massey organisations preparing to welcome students back in a fun and safe way.
Palmerston North City Council safe city co-ordinator Alane Nilsen said Operation Combi was in action and different organisations would be out door-knocking within the next week.
Operation Combi - a combined effort involving city Safety Advisory Board members including police, fire service, ACC, Palmerston North City Council and the Massey University Students' Association - was started after the deaths of two students in flat fires in 2005 and 2006.
This year she said they would be promoting an online party register set to launch, where students could register parties to make police aware they were occurring.
She said anyone could use the registration but they would be targeting certain student areas to encourage them to use it.
"We're going to get out information on what good host responsibility is... with the police visiting them there's going to be that face-to-face and it means if something gets out of hand they know who to contact.
"It's not about punishing somebody, it's about making sure people are keeping safe and have a great time.
"We want them to have fun and have a memorable time in our city."
Scott Anderson, 19, said this was his first year flatting in Palmerston North and he was moving into Ada St, a street known for its student lifestyle.
Anderson said he had moved to the area for the convenience.
He said he wasn't sure if the party registration would be used and it depended on how it was approached.
"It depends on how big the party was."
Flatmate James Coogan, 19, said it would also depend on what happened when you did register.
"If they were going to hassle us too much [probably not]. It depends on what they were going to do, how they were going to handle it."
Sarah Karika, 21, said this was her second year living in Ada St and she thought this year's O Week would set the tone for the street's behaviour for the year.
"It will be interesting to see how this year's O Week goes and we'll know from there."
However, she was optimistic about the streets behaviour.
"I think it will be better this year."
The houses that were the "party houses" last year had a fence put up separating them more, which Karika thought would stop the parties.
In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the evangelical Reverend Cotton Marcus was raised by his father to be a preacher. He agrees that the filmmaker Iris Reisen and the cameraman Daniel Moskowitz make a documentary about his life. Cotton tells that when his wife Shanna Marcus had troubles in the delivery of their son Justin, he prioritized the doctor help to God and since then he questions his faith. Further, he tells that exorcisms are frauds but the results are good for the believers because they believe it is true. When Cotton is summoned by the farmer Louis Sweetzer to perform an exorcism in his daughter Nell, Cotton sees the chance to prove to the documentary crew what he has just told. They head to Ivanwood and they have a hostile reception from Louis's son Caleb. Cotton performs the exorcism in Nell, exposing his tricks to the camera, but sooner they learn that the dysfunctional Sweetzer family has serious problems.

An angry war of words has erupted between Greece and Turkey after Turkish authorities permitted a daily Koran reading to be broadcast from Turkey's famous Hagia Sophia, a former Byzantine cathedral.
Turkish national broadcaster TRT Diyanet will broadcast the sahur or Islamic predawn meal along with daily readings from the Koran during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan which began Monday.
Greece's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the move in a statement calling it “bigotry” and “not compatible with modern, democratic and secular societies.”
“Muslim rituals in a monument of world cultural heritage are incomprehensible and reveal a lack of respect for and connection with reality,” the statement said.
Dora Bakoyannis, a Greek politician and former minister of foreign affairs said the decision to hold Islamic prayers there essentially turns the Hagia Sophia into a mosque, in a "provocative and incomprehensible act,” showing “disrespect against Orthodox Christians across the world.”

Last month thousands of Muslim worshipers led by an Imam, crowded around the Hagia Sophia, demanding the right to pray there, according to Turkish media.
The Hagia Sophia, famous around the world for its large, iconic dome was originally a cathedral in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, but when the Ottoman empire defeated them in the 15th century, the church was turned into a mosque.
During the reign of Turkey's progressive President Mustafa Atatürk the building was converted into a museum in 1935.
Supporters of a secular Turkey have feared that under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's Islamic-leaning reign, the Hagia Sophia could be transformed back into a mosque.
In 1985 UNESCO designated the Hagia Sophia a world heritage site.

ERBIL, Kurdistan Region—Head of Iran's atomic energy organization said on Sunday that he and the foreign minister have been threatened with execution by members of parliament over their nuclear deal with the Western powers, Iranian media reported.
“Someone has come and tell us ‘We will kill you and bury you under cement at the Arak reactor,'” Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the atomic energy organization told the Iranian parliament.
Arak is an underground reactor in central Iran which Tehran claims is being used for research purposes.
According to media reports out of Iran, a number of MPs jeered at Salehi and called him a liar as he delivered a speech about the implementation of the nuclear deal.
The Persian service of the BBC reported that Majid Ansari, an Iranian MP has confirmed the threats by some parliamentarians against Salehi and Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif.
Ansari added that the two officials—Salehi and Zarif—have received similar threats in the past.
Salehi and Zarif are hailed as architects of a nuclear deal they signed with the world powers P5+1 in Vienna in July.
The agreement will slow down Iran's nuclear program for 10 years and in return the United States will lift its economic sanctions on Iran.
Meanwhile, Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA) reported that the threats were made by Ruhullah Hosseinian, a hardline opponent of his country's nuclear deal with the West.
Tensions rose inside parliament accompanied by sharp exchange of words and attacks on Salehi and Zarif when the two officials put before parliament a proposal for how the government should implement the terms of the nuclear deal.
A report by IRNA news agency also said that three MPs repeatedly interrupted Salehi's speech and tried to bring him down from the podium when they were restrained by other MPs.
Documents show Anglo-Swiss firm is using Brexit as a chance to seek further exemptions from climate policy costs
Anglo-Swiss chemicals firm Ineos is privately leading an industry lobbying attempt to avoid paying for the cost of decarbonising Britain's economy.
Documents released under freedom of information rules reveal that Ineos is pushing the government to use Brexit as a chance to exempt the chemicals sector entirely from climate policy costs.
In Ohio, frackers are drilling. Soon Ineos will be doing the same in Britain Read more
Currently, energy users pay a levy to support green energy providers, such as offshore windfarms. Last week, the government announced £100m worth of cuts to the energy bills of heavy users, meaning the chemicals, cement and steel sectors will pay less towards subsidising low-carbon energy generation.
That new help comes on top of exemptions worth £250m already awarded to such energy-intensive industries, but the documents show that Ineos is pushing for even more generous treatment.
Billionaire founder Jim Ratcliffe, who is the chief executive and chairman, promised a British shale gas revolution in 2014 to produce gas for energy and the chemicals it needs for the company's Grangemouth refinery in Scotland.
Although Ineos's shale drilling efforts have run behind schedule, the materials show the company has been busy lobbying behind the scenes to remove barriers to fracking and weaken environmental taxes.
The cache of progress updates, letters and meeting notes comes from the Chemistry Growth Partnership, a government-industry initiative. Ineos is a member of the partnership and its director, Tom Crotty, chairs the initiative's energy work.
One document dated shortly before the European Union referendum said: “Outside the EU: simplify the UK policy mix and seek a single route to 100% exemption from policy costs and CCL [climate change levy, an environmental tax]. Seek a low-cost alternative to EU ETS [the EU's carbon trading scheme].”
Another policy long in the group's sights is the UK's carbon floor price, a carbon tax on electricity generators. The partnership and Ineos want to see it abolished in a bid to cut energy costs passed on to the chemicals sector.
Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, which obtained the materials, said: “If Ineos got their way, the petrochemicals industry wouldn't bear any of the costs of cleaning up their carbon pollution.”
The stated goal of Ineos and the partnership's lobbying is to pave the way for fracking and extracting shale gas. Documents say the objective is to: “Support appropriate policies to enable the safe exploitation of unconventional gas [shale gas], sustainable use of biofuels and optimal use of waste resources.”
British firm Ineos accused of ‘bribes and bulldozers' approach to fracking Read more
To do that, it wants a “level playing field on energy and climate-related policy costs”. In other words, the chemicals sector wants to be exempt from paying for the UK's various climate policies in the form of business taxes and levies added to energy bills. One document from February, before last week's £100m giveaway, says the partnership had “lobbied hard” to achieve the exemptions previously awarded by government.
The government said it did not share their views on abolishing the carbon floor price. “The Chemistry Growth Partnership is an industry-led body which sets its own agenda and whose views are independent of government,” a spokesman said.
A spokesman for the Chemistry Growth Partnership said: “As an industry, our opposition to the carbon floor price has been consistent since the day it was announced and predates the CGP by several years.”
A spokesman for Ineos said the company “supports UK manufacturing and has consistently argued for a level playing field on its environmental legislation and competitive energy costs, to enable it to compete in world markets”.
He continued: “Ineos has consistently opposed the carbon floor price, as we have always seen it as a UK-only tax on carbon which makes the UK uncompetitive on energy against the rest of the EU.”
Ineos recently increased its shale gas prospects in the UK by 10% when it bought 15 shale licences from French energy company Engie for an undisclosed sum. It now has rights to explore across 1.2m acres in the East Midlands, Yorkshire and Cheshire.
The company had promised to submit 30 planning applications to drill and explore for shale gas last year. In January it submitted its first application, for Marsh Lane in the east Midlands, but the chief executive of Ineos Shale has promised others are being prepared. “We are a little behind where we'd like to have been,” said Gary Haywood at a recent energy security conference. “You can expect to see a lot more coming through from us.”
Inmarsat signs contract to launch EAN satellite with Arianespace
8 December 2016: Inmarsat has signed a contract with Arianespace to launch its S-band satellite for the European Aviation Network (EAN) on an Ariane 5 heavy lift launch vehicle.
The EAN payload is part of a ‘condosat' constructed by Thales Alenia Space, which incorporates a second payload for Hellas-Sat. The condosat is scheduled to be launched from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana in mid-2017.
The condosat was originally scheduled for launch with SpaceX. However, following the delay in SpaceX's launch schedule, Inmarsat and Hellas-Sat took the decision to move the condosat to an Arianespace launch.
Launch slot
Inmarsat will launch Inmarsat-5 F4, a Global Xpress (GX) satellite, with SpaceX. This launch is planned for H1 2017 and Inmarsat is looking forward to continuing to work with SpaceX going forward.
“We are delighted with the flexibility that Arianespace has shown in being able to provide a launch slot that enables us to place our European Aviation Network S-band satellite in orbit by mid-2017,” said Michele Franci, CTO, Inmarsat.
“This launch schedule supports the introduction of our ground-breaking integrated satellite and air-to-ground network, developed by Inmarsat and Deutsche Telekom, which will deliver a very high capacity broadband Wi-Fi experiences for passengers flying throughout Europe.”
CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday dealt a major financial blow to Illinois by ordering the cash-strapped state to pay $586 million a month to Medicaid providers to ensure continued medical care for poor and disabled residents.
The order by Judge Joan Lefkow also stipulated that Illinois send $2 billion to Medicaid providers during the fiscal year that starts on Saturday to pay down the existing $3.1 billion backlog of unpaid bills.
Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, whose office pays the state's bills, said the ruling “takes the state's finances from horrific to catastrophic” and called on state lawmakers to immediately pass a budget.
“Payments to the state's pension funds; state payroll including legislator pay; general state aid to schools and payments to local governments – in some combination – will likely have to be cut,” she said in a statement. “Payments to the state's bond-holders will continue uninterrupted.”
The decision came as Illinois lawmakers failed to reach consensus on a budget on Friday, leaving a state with the worst credit rating in the nation poised to enter a third-straight fiscal year without a full operating budget.
Governor Bruce Rauner's office had no comment on the ruling.
Lefkow had issued an order on June 7 that concluded Illinois was not complying with federal consent decrees regarding Medicaid. That order allowed attorneys representing Illinois' 3 million Medicaid recipients to seek a subsequent order forcing the state to increase payments to managed-care organizations, which in turn pay doctors, hospitals and others.
In her latest order, the judge said the state failed to offer a payment plan that would result in substantial compliance with the consent decrees that stemmed from lawsuits filed against Illinois in 1992.
Attorneys representing Medicaid recipients said Illinois, which has been allocating only $160 million a month to the healthcare program, will be able to subsequently seek reimbursement for about half of the higher payment from the federal government.
“Without these payments, doctors, hospitals, clinics and other key healthcare providers would stop seeing Medicaid patients, or else simply go out of business altogether,” Tom Yates of the Legal Council for Health Justice said in a statement.
Illinois' unprecedented budget impasse between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has ballooned the state's unpaid bill pile to about $15 billion.
It isn't every day that University of Chicago economists Eugene Fama and Richard Thaler see eye to eye. Fama, who won the Nobel Prize in 2013, is one of the best known proponents of the efficient market hypothesis. Thaler, in contrast, champions behavioral economics. Indeed, Thaler spends a great deal of time criticizing the efficient market hypothesis in his recent book, Misbehaving.
Both economists, however, seem to be on the same side when it comes to bitcoin. Commenting on Fama's recent interview with the Bitcoin Uncensored podcast, Thaler tweets: “Must say I agree with Fama here. Only value of bitcoin seems to be to crooks& [sic] tax cheats. Negative social value.”
Fama and Thaler are not alone. Many regulators worry that, absent sufficient government oversight, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will be used to conduct illegal transactions and transfers on a massive scale.
For example, Sen. Joe Manchin has claimed that the “clear ends of Bitcoin [are] for either transacting in illegal goods and services or speculative gambling.” Likewise, Sen. Charles Schumer has described bitcoin as “an online form of money laundering.”
Some have even warned that bitcoin might be used to fund terrorism. Like Fama and Thaler, many people outside the bitcoin community seem to believe bitcoin is basically for criminals.
But they're wrong. To date, the black market transactions that trouble Fama, Thaler, and others have been quite limited.
Consider Silk Road, the premier bitcoin-for-drugs website in operation from February 2011 to October 2013. The best available evidence suggests there were roughly $1.2 million worth of transactions made on Silk Road each month. More recent estimates put the figure at roughly $4.7 million per month.
That modest figure hardly made Silk Road the Amazon of drugs, as Gawker once claimed. Amazon averaged roughly $6,204.2 million per month in 2013. That's more than 370 times the highest monthly transactions volume estimated for Silk Road. Silk Road was not even the Etsy ($112.32 million per month) of drugs.
One might counter that the volume of transactions on Silk Road was low because so few people were using bitcoin at the time. But the volume of transactions on the Silk Road was also small relative to the total volume of transactions conducted in bitcoin.
The monthly transactions volume for the entire bitcoin system averaged just under $16 billion from February 2011 to October 2013. That means that Silk Road transactions were responsible for a measly 0.03 percent of all transactions conducted in bitcoin. In other words, it was not just that few people were using bitcoin, but that of those who did few were buying and selling illegal substances on Silk Road.
What about terrorism? The U.S. Treasury Department itself has found no evidence of bitcoin's widespread use in funding terrorism. That really shouldn't come as a surprise. Terrorist groups have much more convenient ways to secure funding outside of legitimate banking channels. Moreover, to the extent that terrorists are located in developing regions, they would encounter the same hurdles to adopting bitcoin that others in developing countries face.
If they aren't buying cocaine or funding terrorists, what are users doing with all that bitcoin? Answer: a lot of things. They are purchasing flights, Xbox games, and, well, anything sold on Overstock.com. They are paying college tuition. They are ordering satellite television. They are purchasing premium memberships on dating sites and then using Yelp! to find a romantic coffee shop or trendy bar that — you guessed it — accepts bitcoin. They are sending remittances to family members around the world at a fraction of the usual cost. They are donating to support art, open source projects, and foundations. A better question would be: what aren't they doing with bitcoin?
Contrary to popular opinion, bitcoin is not basically for criminals. It is barely for criminals. In that respect, it resembles ordinary cash — that is, Federal Reserve notes. As a matter of fact, the case is probably stronger for eliminating cash than bitcoin. Harvard economist Ken Rogoff has claimed more than half of all cash in circulation is used to hide transactions from tax or law enforcement authorities.
More formal estimates by Edgar Feige suggest roughly 48 percent of cash held by the public is employed in the domestic underground economy. For those interested in transacting outside the law, cash — not bitcoin — is king.
In short, most bitcoin users seem to be a lot like you and me, if perhaps a bit more tech savvy. They want to purchase legal goods and services and remit funds as cheaply and conveniently as possible. To the extent that bitcoin is more effective than traditional payment mechanisms for making some transactions, it lowers transaction costs, encouraging production and exchange.
In other words, Thaler is wrong: bitcoin has a positive social value.

The Padres and Mariners have announced a trade that will send outfielder Seth Smith from San Diego to Seattle in exchange for right-hander Brandon Maurer.
The 32-year-old Smith (pictured) unquestionably had an excellent 2014 campaign, and his career year earned him a two-year $13MM extension in early July. He's slated to earn $6MM in 2015, $6.75MM in 2016 and has a $7MM club option ($250K buyout) for the 2017 season. The Padres, at the time of the signing, assured Smith that he wouldn't be traded after signing, but that assurance was made by different leadership; GM A.J. Preller was not in place yet at that time.
Preller has taken a dogged approach to acquiring talent via trades this offseason, successfully obtaining an entirely new outfield of Justin Upton, Wil Myers and Matt Kemp. Those three additions have left Smith without regular at-bats, and his inability to handle center field makes him a poor choice as a fourth outfielder. Thus, despite hitting a strong .266/.367/.440 with 12 homers, he found himself a frequently mentioned trade candidate. Smith's strong production was the best of his career, especially considering that it came at Petco Park, but the new Padres front office may have been wary of his ability to repeat a career year.
In acquiring Smith, the Mariners have netted a platoon partner for fellow trade acquisition Justin Ruggiano. Smith's platoon problems are well known; he's a lifetime .205/.291/.314 hitter against fellow lefties, but he's crushed right-handers to the tune of a .277/.358/.481 batting line. That will pair well with Ruggiano's .288/.357/.569 triple slash against southpaws over the past three seasons.
Upon first glance Maurer's stats aren't particularly appealing, but the 24-year-old became a different pitcher upon moving to the bullpen midway through the season. Maurer's heater averaged better than 95 mph as a reliever, and he posted a 2.17 ERA with a 38-to-5 K/BB ratio in 37 1/3 innings out of the Seattle 'pen in 2014.
The Padres' pursuit of Maurer has been ongoing for about a year, tweets Dennis Lin of the San Diego Union-Tribune. Some within the organization feel he could return to a starting role, though the Padres likely will rely on Andrew Cashner, Tyson Ross and Ian Kennedy atop their rotation, with a combination of Robbie Erlin, Odrisamer Despaigne, Brandon Morrow and Josh Johnson (once his deal is finalized) fighting for the final two spots. San Diego will control Maurer through the 2019 season, and he won't be eligible for arbitration for another two years.
Maurer is the second arm acquired by the Padres to deepen the bullpen this week, as the Friars struck a deal to acquire Shawn Kelley from the Yankees yesterday. Maurer and Kelley will give manager Bud Black a pair of strikeout arms to add to a bullpen that already featured Joaquin Benoit, Kevin Quackenbush, Nick Vincent, Dale Thayer and Alex Torres. That creates a deep and formidable bullpen, though we of course shouldn't rule out that possibility that Preller will deal some of those arms in further trades. Benoit, in particular, seems like a possible trade candidate to me, given his $8MM salary and the presence of other closing options in the Padres' bullpen.
Shannon Drayer of 710 ESPN in Seattle was the first to report that a trade of Smith to the Mariners was close (Twitter link). USA Today's Bob Nightengale first mentioned Maurer's possible involvement in the deal (on Twitter). ESPN's Jerry Crasnick reported that the swap was complete (on Twitter).

Image caption Satellite television channels are hugely popular in China, but often fall foul of authorities
China is to clamp down on the number of entertainment shows broadcast on satellite television channels in a bid to boost public morality.
Authorities are concerned at the "vulgar tendencies" of light entertainment shows, particularly reality TV, dating and talk shows.
From next year, satellite channels will each be permitted to screen only two programmes of this type a week.
Networks will be required to promote "socialist core values" instead.
The directive, from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, follows a Communist Party meeting last week which asserted the need to strengthen social morality.
The crackdown is intended to improve social cohesion in the face of rising materialism, and wrest back Communist Party control over cultural industries that are promoting alternative viewpoints.
It coincides with a bout of national hand-wringing over a perceived decline in public morality, highlighted by the recent death of a toddler left for dead by passers by after being hit by a vehicle.
'Overly entertaining'
The order states that during the peak hours of 19:30 to 22:00, the country's 34 satellite TV channels will be allowed to broadcast nine hours of "overly entertaining" content between them.
No channel will be permitted to screen more than 90 minutes of such programming in prime time.
Each station must also air at least two hours of news during the day, including an hour in prime time, and produce documentaries and other shows to promote traditional and socialist values.
The ruling had been made to "meet the public's demand for varied, multilevel, and high-quality viewing," the order said.
"Satellite channels are mainly for the broadcast of news propaganda and should expand the proportion of news, economic, cultural, science and education, children's, and documentary programming."
The BBC's Martin Patience, in Beijing, says China's satellite channels are hugely popular, but by focusing on entertainment programmes have frequently fallen foul of the authorities.
Last month regulators ordered a TV station to stop broadcasting a popular talent show called Super Girl, saying it was "too long". A senior employee at the station said the authorities had been jealous of the popularity of the programme.
Earlier this year, Chinese television stations were ordered not to air any detective shows, spy thrillers or dramas about time-travel in the months leading up to the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party, but to focus on programming celebrating the party instead.
Orange County filmmaker Alex Hallajan spent a month using his cameras at various locations throughout Long Beach to time-lapse the loading and unloading of goods, the trucking and packing, the going and coming at the Port of Long Beach.
The result is captivating.
With clockwork-like efficiency, we see that the generally simple idea of bringing goods to and from one location is a massively complex process.
“With time-lapse and filmmaking in general,” Hallajan told Longbeachize, “there's a need to film subjects that haven't been approached yet. The Port is pretty inaccessible yet very interesting. Thankfully I know someone there and they approached me with an idea to do a small time-lapse. The project grew from there… After almost a year of trying, an opportunity came up and it worked out.”
“The Art of Stevedore”—stevedore is the term for those who load and unload cargo from a dock—was born. The various camera locations were, for the most part, places Hallajan specifically chose.
“Some ideas I couldn't do but weren't feasible without disrupting the work going on,” Hallajan said. “For others, like inside the cab of the crane, I waited a long time to be able to do. I actually just shot that a few days before finalizing the piece.”
We're happy you did.
Showtime's standalone service is not even available yet, but they are already making a positive impression on cord cutters. Yesterday, it was announced that Hulu would offer Showtime as an add-on to their service for just $8.99. Now, in a conversation with staff at Showtime, Cord Cutters News has confirmed that every service that carries Showtime standalone service will offer a free 30-day trial.
A 30-day free trial is a great move for Showtime. First, it tells potential subscribers that Showtime is confident in their service. It also is a smart marketing move on Showtime's part, allowing millions of potential new customers to become hooked on their shows before requiring them to pay.
Showtime has also been smart in how they priced the service. They are offering their service for $10.99 a month (or $8.99 through Hulu), compared to HBO's $15 a month. When “Game of Thrones” is not on the air, Showtime's standalone service will look very attractive at $10.99 a month, as both services do not lock you into a long term contract.
While Showtime seems to be doing everything right before the launch, hopefully things go as smoothly afterward. As with all new services, there are usually early glitches. We hope Showtime has had a chance to learn from HBO Now's early issues and is ready for the large number of potential subscribers.

It looks like things are finally beginning to take shape for the next generation of X-Men movies heroes.
Josh Boone, the writer/director of 20th Century Fox's upcoming The New Mutants movie has teased on Instagram that the film is entering pre-production.
The teases began a few days ago, on Boone's birthday. He shared a photo of his birthday cake which, in addition to featuring a “Happy Birthday, Josh” message, also included the classic The New Mutants logo. The photo was shared to Instagram with the tags #birthdaycake, #prep, #newmutants, and #productionoffices.

The New Mutants movie was announced by 20th Century Fox in 2015 with Boone on board to write and direct. Boone directed the YA love story The Fault in our Stars, which makes him a solid fit for The New Mutants, a team of teenaged mutants. Fox is said to be looking to make The New Mutants the YA movie series in its long-running X-Men movies franchise. Up Next: Lana Condor Wants To Play Jubilee Again
Image caption Lifelong Doctor Who fan professor Brian Cox is called upon to help the Timelord
Professor Brian Cox came up against one of the wonders of the universe even he could not explain, when he appeared in the latest episode of Doctor Who.
The popular physicist and broadcaster was called upon to try and help when mysterious black cubes start to fall from the sky.
But he is left unable to answer the events in Saturday's episode of the BBC TV series, called The Power of Three.
Another cameo role was taken by entrepreneur Lord Sugar.
Prof Cox said: "I have been a Doctor Who fan for a long time - from Pyramids of Mars and The Hand of Fear onwards, with the great Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen.
"I am also a huge fan of Matt [Smith, who plays the lead role], so it was a tremendous honour to be part of one of the great institutions of British television."
Image caption Lord Sugar also makes a cameo appearance
Lord Sugar appears in a scene in the BBC Wales-produced series where he asks his apprentices to try and sell the mysterious objects, with pretty poor results.
He said: "I have watched Doctor Who for over 40 years and I was flattered when they approached me to make a cameo.
"It's an honour to be appearing in such an iconic programme, not to mention the street cred it gives me with the grandkids."

After two-and-a-half years, the situation in Syria may appear to have turned into a static and bewildering slaughter. Neither victory nor defeat seem imminent for any of the sides, but this picture is not entirely accurate.
On one front, at least, there is movement in a clear direction. The Kurds of northeastern Syria are consolidating their autonomous enclave bordering Iraq, which they call “Rojava,” or western Kurdistan.
They have in the last two weeks inflicted a series of telling defeats on al-Qaida-linked rebels on its borders.The absence of clarity in the direction of the war in Syria derives partly from the fact that there is no longer a single conflict in the country. Rather, the civil war has in the last year turned from a straight fight between a regime and a rebellion against it into three interlocking wars involving a variety of participating elements.The regime and its allies are still engaged against a mainly Sunni rebellion.An internecine civil war has also broken out in the rebellion itself, pitting the al-Qaida-linked Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its hardcore Islamist allies against more locally focused rebel groups.The third contest is taking place between ISIS and its allies and the Kurdish fighters of the People's Protection Units (YPG) in the north and east of the country.The first two wars remain at bloody stalemate. The Kurds, whose goal is survival rather than conquest, are winning the third.The current Kurdish “surge” began on October 26 with the capture by the YPG of the Yarubiya border crossing in Hasakah province, between Syria and Iraq. The crossing, known by the Kurds as Tal Kojar, had been held by ISIS since March. The YPG captured it after three days of fighting.The rebel Syrian National Coalition issued a strange claim following the battle that Iraqi regular fighters had participated alongside the Kurds. In truth, however, the superior organization of the YPG when compared to their Islamist rivals appears to have been the deciding factor.The taking of Yarubiya gives the Syrian Kurds full control of an entry and exit point into Iraq for the first time. But its significance goes beyond this.Hasakah province, with a 70-percent Kurdish majority, is home to the greater part of Syria's oil reserves.Syria has, according to a 2009 study, 69 billion barrels worth of proven oil reserves and probably about 315 billion barrels worth of not yet discovered reserves. The great majority of this is in the northeast of the country.In March of his year, the YPG took over three oilproducing towns, most importantly the town of Rumeilan. Control of Yarubiya gives the Kurds the ability to engage in the export of oil.This fact is not lost both on the jihadis of ISIS, who hope to run their own private oil export operations, and on the Syrian National Coalition, which reminded the Kurds in their statement that the oil belongs to “all Syrians.”Following the Yarubiya victory, the Kurds pushed on, capturing 20 villages from ISIS and its allies over the last week. ISIS was joined by additional forces in these battles, including Islamist but not al-Qaidaallied groups.The YPG's drive forward concluded in the last days, with the complete capture of the strategically important and long-contested Ras al-Ain (Sere Kaniye) area, on the border with Turkey. The expulsion of ISIS from the al-Manageer area of the town left the YPG in full control of Ras al-Ain and the road to neighboring Tal Tamer. These gains mean that the Kurds have now consolidated a clear western “borderline” for their area of control in northeast Syria.Their intention, according to Kurdish sources, is now to push further west, towards Tel Abyad. There the outcome is much less certain, however.Outside of Hasakah province, in the areas of sparser outlying Kurdish populations in Raqqa and Aleppo provinces, the YPG has enjoyed less success.Many Kurds from these areas have fled to a Kurdish-held enclave in Afrin, further west and not linked to the main area of Kurdish control.The YPG victories ultimately derive from the greater discipline and organization of this group, in comparison with its jihadi rivals.This reporter has spent time both with the YPG and with the Syrian Arab rebels. The YPG, which was trained by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), exhibit a far superior tactical knowledge and awareness of basic soldiering.Ammunition is carefully conserved.Units move in a coordinated and controlled way. The rebels, by contrast, are certainly brave, but are often poorly trained and undisciplined.What the recent fighting means is that the YPG and the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) are now in firm control of around 10% of the territory of Syria. Rojava forms part of a contiguous area of Kurdish control, which stretches from Ras al-Ain at its western point, through northern Iraq and all the way to the Iranian border.Sharp political divisions remain, however, between the PKK-oriented forces controlling the Syrian enclave, and the Kurdish Regional Government of Massoud Barzani in northern Iraq.Hopes of unity remain elusive. A planned and much-discussed Kurdish “national congress” bringing together all forces in the Iraqi Kurdish capital of Erbil later this month may now not take place.The rivalry between the two key pan-Kurdish forces of the PKK and its associated groups, and Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) appears to be for the moment insurmountable.Still, the YPG's performance in the fighting over the last two weeks confirms that as the de facto partition of Syria takes shape, Rojava is becoming an indelible part of the political landscape.

New York (CNN) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan personally intervened in a scheme that allowed Iran to dodge US and UN sanctions, a gold trader with ties to the Turkish government claimed in explosive court testimony in New York on Thursday.
It's the first time Erdoğan has been named in the closely-watched US criminal case over Iran's violations of international sanctions and movement of billions of dollars.
The case's central figure, Reza Zarrab, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader, was arrested in Miami last year and has since been the case's top named defendant. There are eight other defendants facing similar charges.
He quietly cut a plea deal last month and admitted to defrauding the United States, money laundering, and bank fraud, according to court documents.
On Thursday, Zarrab testified in federal court about Erdoğan's alleged role in Zarrab's scheme, which involved laundering funds from Iranian oil and gas sales through Turkish banks, including the state-run bank, Halkbank.
Zarrab testified that when the amount of money illegally flowing through Turkey's Halkbank became too much to handle, Erdoğan approved getting two more Turkish banks involved: VakıfBank and Ziraat Bank.
Zarrab said he received this information from the government official he claims to have bribed to take part in the scheme, former Turkish economy minister Zafer Caglayan. Caglayan denied all allegations in a Turkish probe into these allegations that started in 2013.
On Thursday, Erdoğan responded to Zarrab's testimony from Wednesday, saying Turkey "did the right thing" and did not violate US sanctions against Iran, according to CNN Turk.
"The prime minister of that time, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and [then] Minister of Treasury Ali Babacan had given orders for them to start the trades, the banks," Zarrab said Thursday. CNN has sought comment from the Turkish government on Zarrab's testimony and is awaiting response.
In their court filings, the US government has not alleged that Erdoğan cooperated in the scheme.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of Turkey.
On Wednesday, Zarrab testified that he paid Caglayan more than 31 million Euros ($36.7 million) in bribes to help Iran launder money and dodge international sanctions. Caglayan denied all allegations in a Turkish probe into the claims, which started in 2013.
That probe was shut down after Turkish police and prosecutors in charge of it were accused of being supporters of Fethullah Gulen. Gulen is the Muslim cleric in self-imposed exile in the US whom Erdoğan has accused of being behind a failed military coup to overthrow him in 2016. Gulen denied any involvement.
One of the police officers in the 2013 Turkish probe has since fled Turkey and will now serve as a witness in the US government's case, prosecutors said in court earlier this week.
For years, US and United Nations sanctions on Iran have kept that country from accessing billions of dollars stored in banks around the world. The tactic is meant to punish Iran for its attempts to develop nuclear weapons and threatening Israel and the United States.
Zarrab's detailed testimony, which surprised those in the courtroom, brings the criminal case's focus to top levels of the Turkish government — and may help explain why Erdoğan has lambasted the American investigation. The Turkish government has sought the return of Zarrab. Erdoğan loyalists view the Zarrab case being tried in New York as a political move against the President and his party.
Cash to CAG
On Wednesday, Zarrab testified about his role in helping Iran dodge sanctions to access money stuck in Turkish banks.
Zarrab recalled how he paired up with a jeweler in 2012 to devise a scheme in which they would trade gold for cash in order to launder billions of dollars for Iran. He told the court how money would traverse through nearly a dozen banks and shell companies and sometimes wind up in American banks — including Standard Chartered and others. They did this so that Iran could conduct international business through proxies and circumvent international sanctions.
"A few billion ... euros" were withdrawn in this scheme "under disguise of gold trade," Zarrab said.
In this courtroom sketch, Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, center, testifies before Judge Richard Berman, right.
When a top official at Turkey's Halkbank refused to let Zarrab do that, Zarrab said he went to Caglayan -- then the economy minister -- to pressure Halkbank to play along.
Caglayan agreed to meet in person, and asked Zarrab details about the illegal deal and its profit margins, Zarrab testified.
"I can work with this, sharing profits 50/50," Caglayan said, according to Zarrab's testimony.
US federal prosecutors showed American jurors what they said were spreadsheets kept by Zarrab during the operation of his illegal trading business. In it were several payments marked "cash to CAG," a reference to Caglayan.
Nate Schenkkan, a Turkey analyst at the pro-democracy organization Freedom House who is watching the trial, told CNN this is the first time the public sees "the raw scale of the bribes and corruption."
Zarrab's witness testimony and documents displayed at trial "would show that this conspiracy to launder money for Iran was not a rogue operation. It would show the Turkish government at its very highest level understood what was going on — and approved of it," Schenkkan tsaid.
Zarrab is also testifying in this trial against the deputy general manager of Halkbank, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who until recently was Zarrab's co-defendant. Atilla has pleaded not guilty.
Zarrab testified that he conducted these types of business deals for the National Iran Oil Company, and the scheme would move money between bank accounts at Halkbank that belonged to a major Iranian bank, along with the Turkish companies Botas, Tupras and others, before moving the money out internationally.
In essence, Zarrab painted a picture that portrayed Halkbank as a laundering tool within its own walls.
In a written statement, Halkbank denied the accusations: "Our bank did not do any illegal transfers about any country. There is no systematic or conscious violation in order to bypass the embargo."
Zarrab also testified that he engaged in a scheme to pull Iranian money out of Aktif Bank, the largest privately-owned investment bank in Turkey.
On a daily basis, Zarrab said he brokered the illegal movement of US $5-10 million of Iranian money out of Aktif Bank. But Zarrab claimed he lost the illegal business when the bank cut him out as the middleman and started doing it on its own.
The US connection
In testimony on Wednesday, Zarrab told the court he initially hired American lawyers to pursue some sort of "prisoner exchange" between the United States and Turkey -- an odd effort that failed.
It is unclear who would have been part of that prisoner swap. But the Turkish government has several Americans — jailed under suspicious circumstances — whom it sees as bartering tools with the United States, according to Schenkkan, the analyst.
Zarrab did not mention the lawyers by name in court, but after his March 2016 arrest he hired former US Attorney General Michael Mukasey and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a supporter of and former campaign advisor to US President Donald Trump.
Giuliani and Mukasey traveled to Turkey in February to meet Erdoğan to seek a solution to the case, according to one of Zarrab's other lawyers.
In a filing in federal court made public in April, Giuliani said US and Turkish officials were "receptive" to resolving the case, Reuters reported.
"That receptiveness is hardly surprising when one considers that none of the transactions in which Mr. Zarrab is alleged to have participated involved weapons or nuclear technology, or any other contraband, but rather involved consumer goods, and that Turkey is situated in a part of the world strategically critical to the United States," Giuliani said, according to the filing.
Cut credit card thief chargebacks in Laravel Cashier
Chargebacks - a customer "reverse charge" that your credit card gateway will then essentially fine you for - are never any fun, even when legitimate. But as my friend Bemmu at Candy Japan discovered, when a credit card thief uses your subscription service to test the validity of thousands of cards, it can become a nightmare. A very expensive nightmare.
Of course the thief wasn't interested in buying Japanese candy. He just wanted to see if the card would be accepted, as hassle free as possible. "Hassle free". That was the key to fighting him, I thought.
The idea is simple - create a hassle small enough that your real customers won't mind, but one that there is no way he'll go through hundreds or thousands of times. Something like...an opt-in email! This is a subscription site, after all, and a subscription to a service is much like a subscription to a newsletter.
What we'll do is collect the credit card and other info on sign up, pass it all to our billing gateway for safekeeping, but don't actually assign them a subscription until they confirm the order from their email box. No charge to the card means no chargeback from the angry victim of the fraud.
Let me show you how to set this up in Laravel with the Cashier libraries. I'll assume you already know about how to get Cashier working, and have a Stripe testing account up and running. I am only going to show actual code where it is specific to make it work in the fashion I described above.
To help explain things, I will use "user" to mean the user's table record in your application, and "customer" to refer to the Stripe customer record. Therefore, when accessing or updating the customer, you should be thinking about the record you can see in your Stripe account.
The first change to how we normally do things will occur in your method to create the new user with subscription. We will still create the user, but when we make the customer we will not assign them to a subscription. The psuedo-code:
// before any of this, with a migration, create a field on users to store // the plan name they have signed up for & a nonce for the email // This code can go anywhere, but a method on your User model is probably the easiest public function createCustomer($stripeToken) { // from the Billable trait; a plan is actually optional //returns a new \Laravel\Cashier\StripeGateway $stripeGateway = $this->subscription(); //calls Stripe API & creates customer $customer = $stripeGateway->createStripeCustomer($stripeToken, [ 'email' => $this->email ]); // as it says, updates your users table record return $stripeGateway->updateLocalStripeData($customer); }
With your users table setup and this new method created, we are ready for the controller functions.
// Your input comes in with user info, a subscription plan and stripe token // First, create the user, ie $user = \App\User::create(['userinfo']); // Usually you would do this: //$user->subscription('monthly')->create($stripeToken, ['email' => $user->email]); // Instead, only create the customer (stripe token came from form input): $user->createCustomer($stripeToken); // Send an email with a link that has their nonce // Redirect to a page explaining they should check for the confirmation email
At this point you can confirm that the following have happened: you have a new user record, it has a stripe_id & last_four value; in your Stripe dashboard you have a new customer record with that email, but it does not have an assigned subscription. Your customer has received a "thank you" email with a link to confirm the purchase. Now let's prepare for their link click:
// From the nonce, find the user $user = App\User::whereNonce($nonce); $stripeGateway = $user->subscription(); // This is calling Stripe to pull customer record $customer = $stripeGateway->getStripeCustomer($user->stripe_id); $payload = ['plan' => $user->plan, 'prorate' => false, 'quantity' => 1, ]; // Working from inside out, the payload is sent to Stripe to update the customer. // The customer record is returned, which includes the subscription id, // which we then update our local user record $user->setStripeSubscription( $customer->updateSubscription($payload)->id ); // This will update the user stripe_subscription and stripe_plan fields $stripeGateway->updateLocalStripeData($customer, $user->plan);
That's it! Pretty simple, as I promised. Of course, we are only "out-running you, not the bear" - we aren't able to permanently stop the credit card thief, only make our site too big a pain to bother with. Seeing that they have to do the extra work to create and check separate email inboxes for each credit card they want to use, they will find another victim. Sadly, there isn't much we can do about that. Until authorities find a way to better combat cybercrime, this will keep our own site relatively safe.
DreamRift have confirmed in this month's issue of Nintendo Force (via Nintendo Everything) that a remake of their DS original, Monster Tale (featured above), is coming to the Nintendo 3DS.
The metroidvania remake will be known simply as Monster Tale Ultimate, and it will come with an entirely remade game, with DreamRift reportedly touching up “every single aspect of the adventure.” DreamRift's Peter Ong described the upcoming release:
A lot of the rebalancing has nothing to do with difficulty. [It] is instead about making the various components of the game more balanced in a manner that makes the game more strategically interesting.
Monster Tale Ultimate is getting improved visuals with new art assets, full stereoscopic 3D support, a new orchestral soundtrack (and the ability to switch to the original chiptune music), new rooms and areas, and finally rebalanced gameplay. Backtracking has been looked at directly, as fan feedback from the original led to the addition of shortcuts between worlds.
Monster Tale is a metroidvania with virtual pet elements, putting you into the shoes of a young girl named Ellie. Upon finding herself lost in the Monster World, she is confronted with two scenarios – finding a way home, and saving the Monster World from its own destruction.
Lastly, DreamRift are open to a retail release, but for now the game is coming as an eShop exclusive. For a retail release to happen, DreamRift have to get the help of a publisher, and they're also open to working with a publisher for their eShop release.
Monster Tale Ultimate is set for a release some time this spring.
A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise money for medical expenses for an Apex teenager who was attacked by a man with a machete as she was walking home from school last week.
Priyanka Kumari, 18, is now recovering from extensive wounds from the attack. The GoFundMe page was set up Wednesday and had received more than $53,500 in donations within 24 hours. The goal is to raise $150,000.
Kumari had just gotten off the school bus on Venezia Drive shortly after 3 p.m. on Jan. 12 when she was attacked. Several witnesses called police to report that a man was stabbing and cutting the teen on her neck and face, and police said they found Neel Salil Mehta, 20, of Cary holding a “large knife” standing over Kumari. When officers approached, Mehta dropped the knife.
An EMS crew rushed Kumari to Duke University Hospital in Durham with serious injuries. Police charged Mehta with assault with a deadly weapon, which was later upgraded to attempted murder.

Police said Mehta and Kumari had “a previous dating relationship.” The GoFundMe page described him as a stalker.
“She is a strong young lady who will recover with your love, support and encouragement,” the GoFundMe page said. “Please support the family with financial donations for medical expenses so they can focus their time and energy on helping their sweet, beautiful daughter heal through the physical and emotional wounds.”
Kumari will go through multiple therapies in her medical treatment, according to the GoFundMe page, including occupational, trauma, speech and pain therapies along with reconstructive surgeries and home care.
PHILADELPHIA -- Ed Snider, the Flyers founder whose "Broad Street Bullies" became the first expansion team to win the Stanley Cup, has died after a two-year battle with cancer. He was 83.
The Flyers said he died early Monday morning.
"Our Dad was loved and admired for his big heart, generosity of spirit, and dedication to his family. Despite his considerable business achievements and public profile, he was first and foremost a family man," the Snider family said in a statement. "Unrivaled, however, was his love for the Philadelphia Flyers Hockey Club, the team he created 50 years ago and to which he remained fiercely devoted through his final days."
With Snider ailing, the Flyers clinched a playoff spot on Saturday and dedicated the playoff push to him.
Snider watched Lauren Hart sing "God Bless America" on FaceTime as the team's longtime anthem singer held out her phone during her performance. She blew kisses after the song.
"You get a little emotional when you start to think about it," Flyers captain Claude Giroux said. "We know he's happy we made the playoffs."
Snider was arguably the most influential executive in Philadelphia sports. He was chairman of the 76ers, was once a part-owner of the Eagles and had a hand in founding both Comcast's local sports channel and the city's largest sport-talk radio station.

Snider, chairman of the Flyers' parent company, Comcast-Spectacor, was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988.
"Ed Snider was the soul and the spirit of the Flyers, who have reflected his competitiveness, his passion for hockey and his love for the fans from the moment he brought NHL hockey to Philadelphia in 1967," NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said.
Snider, who built his fortune with a record company, arrived in Philadelphia in 1964 as a part owner of the Philadelphia Eagles. He bought the team with builder Jerry Wolman and Earl Foreman, an attorney who married Snider's sister. Snider served as the team's treasurer.
Upon hearing that the National Hockey League was going to expand from its original six teams to 12, Snider petitioned the league and was awarded an expansion club in 1966. The Flyers played their first game in October 1967, a 1-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins in front of 7,800 people.
Snider was confident hockey would be a hit in blue-collar Philadelphia.
"I just had the belief that if you're a regular guy and know what regular guys like, you can't be wrong," Snider said.
The Flyers won the West Division in their first season. The next year, they were dominated by the St. Louis Blues and swept out of the playoffs in the first round. Snider than directed his general manager to acquire bigger, tougher players.
Five seasons later, the Broad Street Bullies won the Stanley Cup, beating the Boston Bruins. They repeated as champions in 1975 -- the team's last title.
Snider assumed control of the Spectrum, the home arena for the Flyers and Sixers, in 1971. Three years later, he established Spectacor, a management company that controlled the Flyers and Spectrum. Snider and the Flyers enjoyed their greatest success in the since-demolished Spectrum.
"When the officials made a bad call in my mind, everybody would look back and I'd be standing up screaming, so they'd all be standing up and screaming," Snider said. "I had a great connection with the fans and I miss that tremendously."
Spectacor went on to establish or buy other business, including Philadelphia-area cable channel Prism and WIP-AM. Snider's company picked up the radio station around the time it transitioned to an all-sports format -- one of the first in the nation to do so.
He also developed the Wachovia Center, which opened as the new home of the Flyers and Sixers in 1996. That same year, Snider merged Spectacor with Comcast Corp., bringing together the Flyers, Sixers, Philadelphia Phantoms of the American Hockey League, the Wachovia Center and Spectrum.
The company joined with the Philadelphia Phillies to form the regional sports channel Comcast SportsNet, and now runs arenas and stadiums around the country.
Under Snider, the Sixers drafted Allen Iverson and the team reached the NBA Finals in 2001. Comcast-Spectacor sold the team in 2011.
"I've adopted the Sixers and I love the Sixers. I really do," Snider said when he owned the Sixers. "But in hockey, I started from scratch. We named it, we created it. It didn't exist. Now it's a worldwide emblem recognized everywhere. It's my baby. It doesn't mean it's my favorite. It means it's my baby. I enjoy both of them."
Born in Washington, D.C., Snider grew up working with his father in the family's grocery store business. A graduate of the University of Maryland, Snider became a partner in the record company Edge Ltd. before joining the group who bought the Philadelphia Eagles. He sold his stake in the team in 1967.
Snider's deepest pride came from the Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation he started in 2005. The foundation promotes life skills and hockey through after-school, recreational, and supplemental educational activities for children and families in Philadelphia. Snider hockey programs are provided at no cost and are focused on underserved boys and girls who otherwise would not have the opportunity to play.
"I really want it to be my legacy," he said.
He is survived by his wife Lin and daughters Lindy, Tina and Sarena, sons Craig, Jay and Samuel, and several grandchildren. He was married three other times.
Lin Snider said in a statement Monday, "I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and admiration for Ed. He was a man of tremendous vitality. At the core he was a wonderful family man. He loved his children and grandchildren, and they truly loved him.
"I join them in expressing gratitude today to all of those who have shared their thoughts and feelings about Ed. Our time together, while far too short, was filled with extraordinary moments and wonderful adventures. We loved each other deeply. I will treasure my memories, and will miss him greatly."
Streep On Diversity: We're All Africans Really
Streep On Diversity: We're All Africans Really
Meryl Streep has dismissed questions about the all-white panel at the Berlin Film Festival by telling reporters that "we're all Africans really".
Streep, who is heading the jury for the first time, said she was committed to equality and the inclusion of "all genders, race, ethnicities, religions".
"This jury is evidence that at least women are included and in fact dominate this jury, and that's an unusual situation in bodies of people who make decisions," The Iron Lady actress said.
"So I think the Berlinale is ahead of the game."
Image: Say Cheese! Clooney at Berlin Film Festival
Asked by an Egyptian reporter whether she understood films from the Arab world and North Africa, Streep said that while she did not know much about the region, "I've played a lot of different people from a lot of different cultures".
"There is a core of humanity that travels right through every culture, and after all we're all from Africa originally," she added.
"Berliners, we're all Africans really."
The questions were put to the triple Oscar winner as the debate about the lack of diversity among this year's Academy Award nominees continues.
Some stars are boycotting the 28 February ceremony because they believe the industry has overlooked talented black people.
The seven-member jury at Berlin will choose the winners of the Golden Bear and various Silver Bear awards at the first of the year's major European movie festivals.
The festival is opening with the Coen brothers' comedy Hail Caesar! starring George Clooney and Josh Brolin.
Eighteen movies are in contention for the Golden Bear prize at the festival, which is in its 66th year and runs from 11 to 21 February.
Has Edward Snowden betrayed people of the world or certain elites in a particular country, asked Ecuador Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino as he confirmed that the whistleblower was in Russia following the asylum bid the South American country.
Patino said on Monday that human rights principles were the most important consideration in the case of former CIA contractor.
Ecuador has been in contact with the Russian government over Edward Snowden and has informed Russia that it is considering him asylum appeal, Ecuador's Foreign Minister said at a press conference in Hanoi on Monday.
He stressed that the Ecuadorian government puts human rights above any other party's interests. Patino also said it is “paradoxical” the person who revealed alleged rights violations is being “persecuted.”
“It should be asked, who betrayed whom,” Patino stressed as he questioned the correctness of calling Snowden's leak a “treason.”
“Is this betraying the citizens of the world, or betraying some elites that are in power in a certain country?” the Minister asked.
The alleged US espionage plan would be violating the rights of “every citizen in the world,” Patino said, referring to Snowden's claim that the US agencies are “intercepting the majority world's communications.”
Patino also read out Snowden's formal asylum request. In it, the whistleblower has compared himself to the US Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning, who has been accused of sending a trove of classified documents to WikiLeaks and is now on trial for “aiding the enemy.”
“It is unlikely that I will have a fair trial or humane treatment before trial, and also I have the risk of life imprisonment or death,” Snowden said in his asylum bid, citing Manning's case and his “inhumane” treatment.
The Ecuadorian Constitution guarantees the safety of people who publish opinions through the media and work in any form of communication, Patino stressed.
Meanwhile, Ecuador is also considering a US request related to Snowden, which it received from the US envoy in Quito. Patino said the decision would come in due time.
“The relationship between the US and Ecuador should be based on respect for the sovereignty of both countries and our actions are founded on our principles. We consider the consequences of our decisions, but we act in the name of our principles,” said the Minister, stressing that the US had denied the extradition of several Ecuadorian bankers charged in Ecuador.
Snowden, a former contractor for the US National Security Agency (NSA) who exposed a top-secret PRISM surveillance program to the media, was expected to fly to Cuba on Monday and then change planes to Ecuador. However, he has not been seen aboard the plane flying from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport to Havana, RT's Egor Piskunov reported.
Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton is today regarded as one of the principal explorers responsible for the so-called “Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.” During this time, close to twenty expeditions were launched to explore and survey the then-mysterious continent on the underside of our planet. These expeditions are called ‘heroic' due to the near-superhuman levels of mental and physical fortitude required to survive for months on the Antarctic ice.
Shackleton led several groundbreaking treks in Antarctica, including two that broke records for the farthest southern latitude reached. For his efforts, Shackleton received numerous royal commendations and is widely regarded in as one of the world's most notable explorers.
Shackleton died in 1921 while on an Antarctic expedition and was buried on the continent on South Georgia island. Yet, almost a century after his death, the explorer is still the source of wonder and mystery. While examining an trove of Shackleton's correspondences and records, an archivist with the Perth-based Royal Scottish Geographical Society discovered a mysterious cryptic note written in the margins of Shackleton's CV.
Shackleton used the CV, dated 1903, to apply for posts while in between voyages. The CV contains a reference from his most noted rival, Captain Robert Falcon Scott, who once sent Shackleton home from an expedition for health reasons. Could the strange note be some form of taunt or jab between rival explorers? Could it be the location of some buried treasure or hidden relic on the icy continent?
The Royal Scottish Geographical Society is seeking the public's help in unraveling this mystery. Think you might know what it says? Email them at [email protected] and add your name to Shackleton's legacy.

I was invited to submit an op-ed regarding the recent Lewis/Curry paper on climate sensitivity. For background, see
WSJ editorial
The full text of the op-ed is reproduced below, WSJ [link].
The Global Warming Statistical Meltdown
At the recent United Nations Climate Summit, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned that “Without significant cuts in emissions by all countries, and in key sectors, the window of opportunity to stay within less than 2 degrees [of warming] will soon close forever.” Actually, this window of opportunity may remain open for quite some time. A growing body of evidence suggests that the climate is less sensitive to increases in carbon-dioxide emissions than policymakers generally assume—and that the need for reductions in such emissions is less urgent.
According to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, preventing “dangerous human interference” with the climate is defined, rather arbitrarily, as limiting warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial temperatures. The Earth's surface temperatures have already warmed about 0.8 degrees Celsius since 1850-1900. This leaves 1.2 degrees Celsius (about 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) to go.
In its most optimistic projections, which assume a substantial decline in emissions, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that the “dangerous” level might never be reached. In its most extreme, pessimistic projections, which assume heavy use of coal and rapid population growth, the threshold could be exceeded as early as 2040. But these projections reflect the effects of rising emissions on temperatures simulated by climate models, which are being challenged by recent observations.
Human-caused warming depends not only on increases in greenhouse gases but also on how “sensitive” the climate is to these increases. Climate sensitivity is defined as the global surface warming that occurs when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles. If climate sensitivity is high, then we can expect substantial warming in the coming century as emissions continue to increase. If climate sensitivity is low, then future warming will be substantially lower, and it may be several generations before we reach what the U.N. considers a dangerous level, even with high emissions.
The IPCC's latest report (published in 2013) concluded that the actual change in 70 years if carbon-dioxide concentrations double, called the transient climate response, is likely in the range of 1 to 2.5 degrees Celsius. Most climate models have transient climate response values exceeding 1.8 degrees Celsius. But the IPCC report notes the substantial discrepancy between recent observation-based estimates of climate sensitivity and estimates from climate models.
Nicholas Lewis and I have just published a study in Climate Dynamics that shows the best estimate for transient climate response is 1.33 degrees Celsius with a likely range of 1.05-1.80 degrees Celsius. Using an observation-based energy-balance approach, our calculations used the same data for the effects on the Earth's energy balance of changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols and other drivers of climate change given by the IPCC's latest report.
We also estimated what the long-term warming from a doubling of carbon-dioxide concentrations would be, once the deep ocean had warmed up. Our estimates of sensitivity, both over a 70-year time-frame and long term, are far lower than the average values of sensitivity determined from global climate models that are used for warming projections. Also our ranges are narrower, with far lower upper limits than reported by the IPCC's latest report. Even our upper limits lie below the average values of climate models.
Our paper is not an outlier. More than a dozen other observation-based studies have found climate sensitivity values lower than those determined using global climate models, including recent papers published in Environmentrics (2012), Nature Geoscience (2013) and Earth Systems Dynamics (2014). These new climate sensitivity estimates add to the growing evidence that climate models are running “too hot.” Moreover, the estimates in these empirical studies are being borne out by the much-discussed “pause” or “hiatus” in global warming—the period since 1998 during which global average surface temperatures have not significantly increased.
This pause in warming is at odds with the 2007 IPCC report, which expected warming to increase at a rate of 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade in the early 21st century. The warming hiatus, combined with assessments that the climate-model sensitivities are too high, raises serious questions as to whether the climate-model projections of 21st century temperatures are fit for making public policy decisions.
The sensitivity of the climate to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide is a central question in the debate on the appropriate policy response to increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Climate sensitivity and estimates of its uncertainty are key inputs into the economic models that drive cost-benefit analyses and estimates of the social cost of carbon.
Continuing to rely on climate-model warming projections based on high, model-derived values of climate sensitivity skews the cost-benefit analyses and estimates of the social cost of carbon. This can bias policy decisions. The implications of the lower values of climate sensitivity in our paper, as well as similar other recent studies, is that human-caused warming near the end of the 21st century should be less than the 2-degrees-Celsius “danger” level for all but the IPCC's most extreme emission scenario.
This slower rate of warming—relative to climate model projections—means there is less urgency to phase out greenhouse gas emissions now, and more time to find ways to decarbonize the economy affordably. It also allows us the flexibility to revise our policies as further information becomes available.
First draft
I learned a lot about writing an op-ed through this process. Below is my first draft. This morphed into the final version based on input from Nic, another journalist and another person who is experienced in writing op-eds, plus input from the WSJ editors. All of the words in the final version have been approved by me, although the WSJ editors chose the title.
The challenge is to simplify the language, but not the argument, and keep it interesting and relevant while at the same not distorting the information. Below is my first draft:
Some insensitivity about climate change
At the recent UN Climate Summit, Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon stated: “Without significant cuts in emissions by all countries, and in key sectors, the window of opportunity to stay within less than 2 degrees will soon close forever.”
In the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, preventing ‘dangerous human interference' with the climate has been defined – rather arbitrarily – as limiting warming to more than 2oC above preindustrial temperatures. The Earth's surface temperatures have already warmed about 0.8oC, leaving only 1.2oC before reaching allegedly ‘dangerous' levels. Based upon global climate model simulations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report (AR5; 2013) projects a further increase in global mean surface temperatures with continued emissions to exceed 1.2oC sometime within the 21st century, with the timing and magnitude of the exceedance depending on future emissions.
If and when we reach this dangerous level of human caused warming depends not only on how quickly emissions rise, but also on the sensitivity of the climate to greenhouse gas induced warming. If climate sensitivity is high, then we can expect substantial warming in the coming century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase. If climate sensitivity is low, then future warming will be substantially lower.
Climate sensitivity is the global surface warming that occurs when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles. Equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the rise in temperature once the climate system has fully warmed up, a process taking centuries due to the enormous heat capacity of the ocean. Transient climate response is a shorter-term measure of sensitivity, over a 70 year timeframe during which carbon dioxide concentrations double.
The IPCC AR5 concluded that equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C and the transient climate response is likely in the range of 1.0°C to 2.5°C. Climate model simulations produce values in the upper region of these ranges, with most climate models having equilibrium climate sensitivity values exceeding 3.5oC and transient climate response values exceeding 1.8oC.
At the lower end of the sensitivity ranges reported by the IPCC AR5 are values of the climate sensitivity determined using an energy budget model approach that matches global surface temperatures with greenhouse gas concentrations and other forcings (such as solar variations and aerosol forcings) over the last century or so. I coauthored a paper recently published in Climate Dynamics that used this approach to determine climate sensitivity. Our calculations used the same forcing data given by the IPCC AR5, and we included a detailed accounting of the impact of uncertainties in the forcing data on our climate sensitivity estimates.
Our results show the best (median) estimate for equilibrium climate sensitivity is 1.64oC, with a likely (17–83% probability) range of 1.25–2.45oC. The median estimate for Transient Climate Response is 1.33oC with a likely range of 10.5-1.80oC. Most significantly, our new results support narrower likely ranges for climate sensitivity with far lower upper limits than reported by the IPCC AR5. Our upper limits lie below – for equilibrium climate sensitivity, substantially below – the average values of climate models used for warming projections. The true climate sensitivity may even be lower, since the energy budget model assumes that all climate change is forced, and does not account for the effects of decadal and century scale internal variability associated with long-term ocean oscillations.
These new climate sensitivity estimates add to the growing evidence that climate models are running ‘too hot.' At the heart of the recent scientific debate on climate change is the ‘pause' or ‘hiatus' in global warming – the period since 1998 during which global average surface temperatures have not increased. This observed warming hiatus contrasts with the expectation from the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report that warming would proceed at a rate of 0.2oC/per decade in the early decades of the 21st century. The warming hiatus combined with assessments that the climate model sensitivities are too high raises serious questions as to whether the climate model projections of 21st century have much utility for decision making.
The sensitivity of our climate to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide is at the heart of the public debate on the appropriate policy response to increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Climate sensitivity and estimates of its uncertainty are key inputs into the economic models that drive cost-benefit analyses and estimates of the social cost of carbon.
Continuing to use the higher global climate model-derived values of climate sensitivity skews the cost-benefit analyses and estimates of the social cost of carbon. The implications of the lower values of climate sensitivity in our paper is that human caused warming near the end of the 21st century should be less than the 2oC ‘danger' level for all but the most extreme emission scenario considered by the IPCC AR5. This delay in the warming – relative to climate model projections – relaxes the phase out period for greenhouse gas emissions, allowing more time to find ways to decarbonize the economy affordably and the flexibility to revise our policies as further information becomes available.
JC reflections
I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to write this op-ed, and I am hugely thankful to Nic Lewis and others (unnamed) who helped me improve this.
The timing for all this couldn't be worse for me, being in China, 12-hour time difference, behind the great Chinese internet firewall (thanks to all who tried to help me break through) without access to twitter, and leaving for travel this afternoon.
Let's see how this is received. I have a trusted colleague tweeting for me on this, should be interesting. In any event, I see the climate policy dialogue starting to open up, with discussion of the 2 degree threshold, lower sensitivity, and the hiatus.
Univision reported on its website that Atlanta United has expressed an interest in signing enigmatic Danish forward Nicklas Bendtner.
Here is the univision story.
So, today you will be a bonus version in the series Building Atlanta United.
Others in the series:
PSG's Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is reportedly signing with Manchester United
Liverpool's Kolo Toure
Manchester United's Michael Carrick, who is reported re-signing with Manchester United
A.C. Milan's Alex
Manchester United goalkeeper Victor Valdes
-
I described Bendtner as enigmatic because his confidence, and quotes about his confidence, have exceeded his results at Arsenal in England, Juventus in Italy and Wolfsburg in Germany. He has scored 46 goals in 218 appearances for various clubs, and 29 goals in 72 appearances for Denmark.
He was released by Arsenal in 2014 after failing to ever secure a first-team spot.
His production actually isn't too bad. But his quotes are what make the totals seem less than ideal.
Pros: Can score goals and is just 28 years old. Could he become another Sebastian Giovinco in MLS?
Cons: Seems to have had issues with management at every club he's played for. President Darren Eales has said many times he wants a player who wants to help establish a culture at Atlanta United. Bendtner wouldn't seem to be that type of leader.
Frankly, I would be surprised if Eales or technical director Carlos Bocanegra would take the risk, unless the media is exaggerating Bendtner's issues with his clubs. Eales and Bocanegra would know from their time in England.
A few years back, cheat days were the rage. Initially the idea of "stepping out" on your diet was met with skepticism, but as research emerged supporting the idea that taking a day off could actually speed the rate of fat loss, people increasingly jumped on board.
Cheating isn't a new idea by any stretch, nor is it going anywhere. In 1999, Bill Phillips, borrowing an idea from sometimes employee sometimes partner TC, put forth the idea of the "free" day in the bestselling newbie bible Body-for-LIFE.
More than a decade later, in his own bestseller The 4-Hour Body, Author Tim Ferriss again extolled the virtues of the cheat day. In between those two bestsellers (2002), T NATION published The Cheater's Diet by Joel Marion, and since then Joel has followed with a number of highly successful programs that incorporate cheat days.
However, recently cheat days have come under fire. A number of respected coaches, including a few T NATION top guns, have spoken out against cheat days, despite their apparent popularity.
Of course, what's popular isn't always right, but to dismiss cheat days completely out of hand seems a bit rash.
This is especially true when some of the arguments against cheat days are founded in illogical reasoning and sensationalistic statements–which is what's been going on.
The main purpose of this article is to defend cheat days. But rather than present a stack of before and after pictures or testimonials supporting their efficacy, we'll explore the most common argument against cheat days, and ascertain whether it even holds water.
To Begin at the Beginning – Why Cheat?
Let's first cover the theory behind cheat days and why they've been included in nutrition plans to begin with.
The theoretical benefits of cheat days are:
Increased thyroid hormone output. When in a caloric deficit, underfed individuals produce less T3 and T4–both important thyroid hormones that play roles in the regulation of metabolic rate. A cheat day or strategic overfeed is used in part to increase these hormones.
Increased 24-hour energy expenditure. A caloric surplus from a cheat day causes the body to upregulate basal metabolic rate (BMR). Some studies have shown an increase of 9% above baseline, and it's hypothesized that more is possible.
Increased serum leptin levels. The big one that most harp on. Leptin levels drop while in a caloric deficit (lasting as little as 72 hours), and a periodic bump in leptin coming from a cheat day has several benefits including increased thyroid output, increased energy expenditure and BMR, and overall increased thermogenesis.
Those are the physiological and hormonal benefits of cheating. Of course, there's the psychological benefit of being able to take a day off from your diet; eat whatever you like and be comfortable in the knowledge that you'll still get lean. It's hard to quantify how much that actually helps, but the majority of folks who opt to use cheating protocols cite this as one of the most significant benefits.
The First Problem
The issue that arises in any discussion of cheat days is that from a purely scientific or research based standpoint, the studies are conflicting and the conclusions that are most solid aren't always applicable.
Essentially, the idea of using cheat days is to get leptin-depleted individuals to increase leptin levels, which will result in all the benefits listed above. That would be great, but the problem is that often those using cheat days simply aren't leptin-depleted; at least, not insofar as their metabolic rate is slowing to a significant degree.
Or so the doubters would posit. Two points to consider:
Any drop in metabolic rate is unacceptable. As T NATION contributor Shelby Starnes wrote, a 6% decrease can slow things down to a degree that the dude simply can't abide. This is especially true at higher levels of development, and even more so when a contest or deadline is approaching. Those who aren't depleted in the technical sense are keeping calories too high on non-cheat days. This means that while they're still getting some benefit of cheating, they're not optimizing progress. This can be–and is–true of any diet, and so for the purposes of deciding whether cheating protocols work, it must be discarded as user error. Problems with the client are not the fault of the method.
The Fact Is...
Cheat Days WORK. They just work. Even if there is evidence to suggest that cheat days or periodic overfeeding doesn'tenhance the rate of fat loss, at this point there's too much anecdotal evidence to say that theyslow fat loss.
I've worked with hundreds of clients, and while I'm not testing leptin levels, I know that cheat days DO NOT slow progress. And so, if they don't hurt and probably help, what's the problem?
The Second Problem: The Illogical Argument
There's a growing trend to argue against cheat days based NOT on any physiological basis but rather a psychological one, comparing cheating to addiction.
I'm not kidding. I wish I was.
The illogical argument is as follows:
"Telling a dieter to have a cheat day is like telling an alcoholic that it's okay to binge drink one day per week."
Actually, no it's not.
That argument ONLY holds water if a few things are assumed as fact:
(Cheat) foods are addictive.
People who eat cheat foods are addicted to them.
Eating cheat foods one day per week perpetuates the addiction.
Now, it's true that for some, food can be addictive, and as such it can be used and/or abused for comfort and the like. I've no real issue with the first assumption, in theory.
The problems start to arise when we get to the second assumption, that people who eat cheat foods are (all) addicted to them.
That's ludicrous. Fact is, basing an argument on such an assumption is to commit a logical fallacy known as "affirming the consequent."
The assumptive argument would be, people who are addicted to junk food eat junk food; therefore anyone who eats junk food is addicted to it.
Clearly, this isn't accurate.
To go back to the example of alcohol, the representation of this utter nonsense would be, alcoholics drink alcohol; therefore everyone who drinks alcohol is an alcoholic.
You can see where this is going.
As the saying goes, not all rectangles are squares. Not everyone who drinks is an alcoholic, and enjoying pizza once per week doesn't mean you're addicted to pizza or have fantasies of copulating on the counter at Papa John's.
The third assumption is that eating cheat foods perpetuates the addiction to cheat foods. This requires the second assumption to be true–that is, in order for it to even be considered, you'd have to accept that everyone who eats a little non-diet food is addicted to those foods.
Since it's quite clear that the second assumption is false, and the third relies on the second to be relevant, the third can't be true, either.
So, of the three assumptions that would NEED to be true in order for the original argument to work, two are logically invalid.
You don't have to be Leonard Nimoy to raise an eyebrow at that.
To be fair, there are folks who do battle serious issues with food. For these individuals, cheat days aren't a wise idea. However, as with any dietary protocol, there will always be certain populations that would be better served following a different approach. We can't allow dietary practices that are of value to many to be dismissed outright.
The Third Problem: The Abundance Argument
Another argument that's been used (again, comparing food to alcohol) is, "Even for non-alcoholics, is it a good idea to encourage excessive recreational drinking one day per week?"
Um, yes–that day is called Saturday, and it's the day when epic things occur and embarrassing pictures are taken.
Kidding, kidding.
Seriously, again this argument implies a strong assumption. It assumes that proponents of cheat days suggest excessive consumption of "bad" foods as the sole or even primary source of nutrition.
That simply isn't true.
First, there's no rule in any cheating protocol that states a person has to eat unhealthy foods on a cheat day. As long as the dieter gets in adequate carbs, fat and calories, it doesn't matter if it's from oatmeal and egg whites or oatmeal cookies and Egg McMuffins.
Clients can–and should–eat whatever they want. Most of them want to have some junk food, and that's fine. No one has ever published a diet involving a cheating protocol that suggests or requires that ALL calories be obtained from a drive thru window.
The cheat day is about freedom and choice, about removing the dietary mental shackles and enjoying yourself. Food choices and amounts are intensely personal, and the client chooses what's best for them.
To go back to the example of alcohol, I might tell a client it's okay to have a few drinks; that of course will mean different things to different people.
The point is that no coach recommends only bad foods for an entire day, and so the abundance argument is also irrelevant.
How (And When) To Cheat
So I've convinced you. You're going to start cheating on your diet again. You've stashed your MAG-10 Pulse Fast supplies and have scheduled an evening of dietary debauchery with your wingmen Ben and Jerry.
Hold up, soldier. You may qualify for a day's leave but the battle rages on. Here's how to use cheat days and still come away victorious.
If you're on a diet that doesn't specifically call for a cheat day or cheat meal, and you wish to add one in, assess progress first. If your progress has slowed for two weeks or more, a cheat day may help.
The first thing to consider is your overall level of caloric deficit.If you're not in a huge deficit, you don't need to cheat that often. The more you restrict calories, the faster leptin levels will drop and the more you'll benefit from a cheat day. Frequent cheat days generally only have merit for restrictive diets.If your diet doesn't force you to eat at a deficit of 50 calories per day or more, you don't need to cheat more than once or twice a month, and often a single cheat meal will suffice.A deficit of 750 calories per day or more generally allows you to cheat once per week, depending on your level of leanness.
The leaner you are, the more often you can cheat.Generally, if you're 10% or below, you can cheat once every 5-7 days. If you're 10-12%, every 7-9 days. If you're over 12%, you can cheat once every two weeks.
Those above a certain fat threshold – say 16% bodyfat, or anyone with more than 40 pounds to lose – probably don't need to cheat from a physiological standpoint. These people are better off with cheat meals, not cheat days, which should be used once every two weeks until progress slows. After that, a progression to one cheat meal per week is used.
If you're naturally prone to fat gain, don't cheat unless you're pretty lean (12%). Even then, start small.Use cheat meals and assess progress, and graduate to cheat days.
Along similar lines, ectomorphic guys can schedule one cheat meals during mass gaining phases a day to help them put on more weight. For these guys, I don't recommend cheat days but a single cheat meal every 3-5 days to get in some extra calories.
The basic "limit" guideline for ANY cheat (either meal OR day) is to not push past the point of satiety. Eat whatever you want, but don't intentionally stuff yourself. Stop eating whenyou're nice and full, not uncomfortable.
To make any cheat day more effective, I recommend having a fast day to follow the cheat. This will create a huge caloric deficit following the caloric overload. In essence, you get the hormonal benefit of cheating (enhanced metabolic hormonal output) as well as the hormonal benefits of fasting (increased Growth Hormone production). By pairing a "feast" with a fast, you get the best of both worlds.
Final Thoughts
The fitness and nutrition industry is in part dependent on debate of various topics–hotly debated ones get attention and that's good for everyone. While it's certainly acceptable to enjoy a debate and I don't mind defending the ideas of what I endorse, I take issue with the way those ideas are attacked.
Whether someone agrees with and recommends cheat days for their clients or readers should be based on their assessments of either the science or the practicality. It seems, in this case, the arguments are based on emotion rather than logic, and that does everyone a disservice.
Hopefully this article has shed some light on the issue, and helps you to decide–logically–whether you'd like to include cheat days in your diet.
Live well. And prosper.
DUNEDIN — John Gibbons understands and occasionally dreads the final days of spring training.
He lived the nomadic life of a minor league ballplayer for long enough, never quite good enough, never certain to know where he would be starting any season. He came to hate that clubhouse tap on the shoulder that brings with it the news — the manager wants to see you.
[np_storybar title=”Toronto Blue Jays give Aaron Sanchez spot in starting rotation” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/mlb/toronto-blue-jays-give-aaron-sanchez-spot-in-starting-rotation”%5D
Only now, he's the manager.
“It's tough from my end,” Gibbons said Monday. “You don't want to be too callous about anything. Because you know you're affecting people's careers. Sometimes guys get sent out that should be in the big leagues. But that circumstances dictate otherwise. I feel for those guys. And I don't take that lightly.”
Monday was a three-pronged day for Gibbons, three different morning meetings with players. One with bad news. One with good news. One somewhere in between.
The first meeting was the most tugging. It was with Drew Hutchison. About a year ago this time, Gibbons named Hutchison his opening day starter in New York. That choice was partly circumstantial, partly earned. It wasn't second guessed at the time: It was like that Jays team, all about possibilities and hope.
The meeting Monday morning was slightly uncomfortable. Gibbons had to tell Hutchison what most of us already knew: He was being sent to Buffalo, AAA. He was being sent down after pitching well enough this spring to be on the team: He finished the Grapefruit League with the most innings pitched on the Jays staff and a very sound 3.26 earned run average. He didn't lose his job this spring — some weren't sure he could pitch much better — he really lost his job and maybe his focus all of last season on the road.
What did Gibbons tell him he needed to work on — the usual conversation between outgoing player and mumbling manager?
“I don't think he needs work on anything,” said Gibbons. “I told him to be consistent, pitch well. He's going to play a big part for us this year. That's my gut feeling. You never go through a whole season (without pitching problems or injuries.) You'll always need more. He can turn out to be the key guy this year, who knows?”
Last year, after a season of win at home and be terrible on the road, Hutchison made one last memorable start at Rogers Centre for the Jays. It came against the Yankees on a Sunday afternoon, with the Jays trailing the Yanks by a game and a half. Toronto had lost the first two games against New York. The game was hugely important.
Hutchison had a terrific outing. And that was it. He was later shuffled aside, first to the bullpen, off the playoff roster, now to AAA Buffalo.
And he's only 25.
“This year, it's a good year,” Gibbons said of most of the decision making. “We have the personnel in place. Now we're just identifying their roles. It's not like we're cutting a lot of guys.”
Hutchison, that was the hard one. “That was tough,” said Gibbons.
The meeting with Gavin Floyd was short and typical. First there was the handshake and the official news he had made the team. Then the second part: Instead of being a starting pitcher, which he has been for most of his big league career, he's going to start the season as a long reliever. The only thing that might change that is if Marco Estrada isn't healthy enough to begin the season on the 25-man roster.
Floyd is the sixth starter on a team that will only use five. He showed enough in 12.1 Grapefruit innings to earn a spot as a depth player. He came here wanting to start: Early morning, Gibbons had to tell him that he might eventually start here, he just doesn't know when.
The third Gibbons meeting was the kind that makes a manager smile. Telling the kid with all the credentials that there is finally a place for him. The place he wants. Aaron Sanchez didn't exactly hide his excitement as he all but skipped out of the manager's office and over the next several minutes proceeded to high five just about everybody in sight.
The team was pulling for Sanchez to earn a spot in the starting rotation. His buddy, Marcus Stroman, was ecstatic, his smile almost wider than that belonging to Sanchez. This is what they worked for, the two of them, maybe eventually being one and two in the Toronto rotation.
The Sanchez promotion was an executive decision, not a unanimous decision. Gibbons wanted him in the starting rotation. Others, wanting supreme bullpen depth, were not so certain. “We put our heads together and came up with this,” said Gibbons. “I don't think we can lose either way, if he's a starter or in the bullpen. I totally understand both sides.”
The argument for: A better starting rotation and the potential development of a top of the rotation pitcher. The argument against: Having a lights out bullpen.
“It's not one day,” said Gibbons. “It's not one month. It's the whole season. It's six long months.
“I totally understand how tough this is (for players),” the manager said. “They're focusing on themselves. They're thinking ‘Where am I going to be?'
“A guy like Hutch. He's had some success in the big leagues. He's done a nice job for us. He wants to be here. He's not going to be here. And it toughs to tell those guys. It is. I totally understand their side.”
He understands. There are two days of Florida baseball left before opening day, a few decisions of twisting significance still to be made. John Gibbons will be glad when the last of the morning meetings are over.
Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, says he promises to pay back taxpayers for funds from a special congressional account he used to pay a harassment settlement back in 2013.
Farenthold told NBC affiliate KRIS6 in Corpus Christi that he "didn't do anything wrong" but would "do my best" to repay the settlement fee sometime this week, this time taking out a personal loan instead.
"Even though I was completely exonerated by OCE, and the settlement agreement has been paid. I'm doing my best and am I going to hand a check over this week to probably Speaker Ryan or somebody and say look here's the amount of my settlement, give it back to the taxpayers," said Farenthold.
He added, "I also don't want the tax payers to be on the hook for this. And I want to be able to talk about it and fix the system, without people saying 'Blake you've benefited from the system you don't have the right to talk about it and fix it.'"
Farenthold is the only sitting House member since 2013 to have used the congressional Office of Compliance account to pay for a sexual harassment claim, in which $84,000 was paid out, CBS News confirmed Friday.
The House Administration Committee revealed Friday that only one sexual harassment claim has been paid through the taxpayer-funded account since 2013. Politico was the first to identify Farenthold as the lawmaker who was accused.
The information was disclosed as part of the panel's investigation into details of settlements and awards from the Office of Compliance.
According to Politico, Farenthold's former communications director, Lauren Greene, sued her boss in December 2014 over allegations of sexual harassment, gender discrimination and creating a hostile work environment. At the time of the settlement, Greene's attorney, Les Alderman, confirmed in a statement that both parties had reached a deal to save taxpayer dollars.
The revelations came amid allegations of harassment leveled against lawmakers, including Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota and Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, as well as growing calls to reform the process of reporting any allegations of such misconduct.
CBS News' Rebecca Shabad contributed to this report.
Experts on Sunday warned of a potential military conflict over heightened US surveillance in the South China Sea and cautioned that both sides should try their best to avoid miscalculation in the world's most important bilateral relations.
Analysts believe that recent US military activity is another example of how the US is struggling to maintain the status quo while coping with the rise of China as a global power. They urge the US to face up to the reality that China is becoming a maritime power and that China's determination to protect its sovereignty should not be underestimated.
"The South China Sea issue makes up a small portion of Sino-US ties," wrote Cen Shaoyu, an international relations commentator. "Leaders from both countries should understand that the future of China and the US, as well as the future of Asia, are far beyond just that."
China electronically jammed Global Hawk long-range surveillance drones spying on China's Nansha Islands, a possible attempt to capture a Global Hawk by causing one to crash in shallow waters, or to snatch one in flight using a manned aircraft, The Washington Free Beacon reported on Friday.
Disclosure of the jamming came as a US P-8A anti-submarine and maritime surveillance aircraft flew overwaters off China's Nansha Islands for reconnaissance activities on Wednesday.
It is the US that travelled thousands of miles to China's doorstep to force China to safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime interests, Peng Guangqian, a specialist in military strategy at the PLA Academy of Military Science, told the Global Times.
"China's responses were justified acts of self-defense when the US flights approached China's territory and were in accordance with international practice," Tao Wenzhao, a research fellow with the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.
China will very likely strike back if the US comes within 12 miles of the islands, Peng said, adding that the US was deliberately provoking China.
"The US provocation has boosted the chance of military confrontation between Beijing and Washington," Zhu Feng, director of the Collaborative Innovation Center of South China Sea Studies under Nanjing University, told the Global Times.
Once China dispatches aircraft to drive away the US fighters, both sides are likely to exchange fire due to high flight speed, Zhu said.
"The reconnaissance conducted by the US military aircraft poses a potential threat to the security of China's maritime features, and is highly likely to cause miscalculation, or even untoward maritime and aerial incidents," Hong Lei, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told a regular press conference on Friday.
The presence of the US military in the South China Sea also encouraged countries neighboring the waters to increase military build-up, making the region more unstable and deterring peaceful settlement through dialogue, said Jin Canrong, vice director of the School of International Studies at Renmin University of China.
The Pentagon's moves came after US Secretary of State John Kerry finished his two-day visit to China on May 17. Kerry reaffirmed the US government's stance of not taking sides on the South China Sea issue and said the same stance will apply to other parties involved in the dispute, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
"The conflicting attitudes adopted by the US government and its military demonstrated the disunity within the US," Jin said.
"Of course the involvement of great powers outside the region complicates the South China Sea situation. However, the involvement of major countries also means more convoluted interests are at stake when it comes to making the decision to enter military conflicts," said Xue Li, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
How do you say "It will never happen here" in Dutch?

An online campaign has overturned ING's executive pay policy, and the mood in Amsterdam is getting increasingly militant about bonuses at bailed-out banks﻿.
Source - Guardian
After a furious row over pay packages at Amsterdam-based ING in which thousands of customers threatened to make mass withdrawals, the Netherlands is now vying for the title of Europe's most bonus-hating country.
A growing Dutch political storm could end with a blanket ban on bonuses to financiers who work for institutions bailed out by the taxpayer.
ING customers mobilised on Twitter and other social networks to protest at bonuses paid to bosses at the bank, one of the biggest in the country. The threat of direct action raised the spectre of a partial run on ING, terrifying the Dutch establishment. Fred Polhout, union organiser at the bank, says: "People were outraged. We heard about the bloated sums being paid again in the City and in New York; but suddenly the issue exploded on our own front door."
Compared with the packages awarded to bankers in the US and UK, the Dutch bonuses were small potatoes. Jan Hommen, ING's chief executive, was due to receive a £1m bonus – a pittance when you consider that Stephen Hester, head of state-controlled RBS in the UK, is in line for up to £7.7m, Bob Diamond of Barclays is to collect as much as £6.5m, and some senior bankers at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are looking at windfalls of about £40m each.
"Perhaps we are so upset because we are a small country that prefers to set an example, rather than follow others," suggests Polhout.
So severe was the public reaction to Hommen's bonus that within days he had agreed to waive the award and told other ING directors to do the same.
Now the Netherlands is going through a painful period of introspection and soul-searching. Politicians have voted to implement a 100% retrospective tax on all bonuses paid to executives at institutions that received state aid as a result of the financial crisis. In other words, no banker should get a bonus until the debt is cleared, and they should return payments made since 2008.
On the streets of Amsterdam, there is little sympathy for the bankers. Emma Rohl, who works at an English bookshop in the city centre, says: "They shouldn't get bonuses at all. Why should people be paid vast sums for going into work and doing their jobs? It's utterly ridiculous."
Erick Koenig at a nearby restaurant says: "We rescued the banks from their own follies, and now they expect to be paid extra. I think they should work for free for at least five years."
The bankers' response that high remuneration is vital to retain talent and prevent Dutch financiers from defecting to overseas banks is given short shrift by Polhout. He says: "Let them go abroad if they don't like it her;, there are plenty of clever people who will take their place and work for less. Good riddance, as far as I am concerned."

Hillary Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, allegedly used Clinton Foundation money and other charity resources to fund her wedding to Marc Mezvinsky. This was discovered through a new batch of WikiLeaks emails from top Bill Clinton aide, Doug Band. On January 4, 2012, Band wrote in an email that Chelsea used Foundation resources “for her wedding and life for a decade.” He also alleged a top Foundation donor was responsible for “killing” unfavorable press coverage, according to Fox News. The Clinton Foundation is a non-profit charity run by the Clinton family and formally referred to as the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

Doug Band, who is also the founder of the global strategies company Teneo, emailed a Clinton Foundation Global Initiative board member to complain about Chelsea. He used the initials “cvc” in reference to Chelsea Victoria Clinton, according to Fox News.
“The investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using Foundation resources for her wedding, and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents… I hope that you will speak to her and end this[.] Once we go down this road…”
Podesta said Band's comments were an “understatement.”

According to the Daily Mail, Clinton's wedding was “estimated to have cost about $3 million dollars, but it is unclear how much money or resources went from the Clinton Foundation to the wedding and what it went toward, if in fact, funds were used.”
Doug Band has been Bill Clinton's personal assistant since the 1990s. According to Fox News, Band wrote an email to John Podesta and two other Clinton aides after receiving word that Chelsea told “one of the [President] Bush 43 kids” and others about “an internal investigation of money within the Foundation.”

The following email reads, per the Daily Mail:
“I just received a call from a close friend of (William Jefferson Clinton) who said that cvc told one of the (George W. Bush) kids that she is conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation from cgi to the foundation… The bush kid then told someone else who then told an operative within the republican party… I have heard more and more chatter of cvc and (Bari Lurie, chief of staff to Chelsea Clinton at the Clinton Foundation) talking about lots of what is going on internally to people. Not smart.”

In a WikiLeaks email dated November 27, 2011, Band allegedly becomes upset with Chelsea for going to her “daddy” to re-schedule a meeting, according to the Daily Mail. In an email sent from Robert S. Harrison, Chief Executive Officer of the Clinton Foundation, the recipients were asked if they were able to schedule the meeting before Sundown on the first night of Yom Kippur, WikiLeaks purports.
Chelsea Clinton responds to the email thread by writing: “Thank you, Bob. I'll talk to my Dad about the below later today. Hope everyone had wonderful Thanksgivings.”
null
Later, a private email sent to Podesta shows Band with some choice words for Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, according to the Daily Mail.
“This is the 3rd time this week where she has gone to daddy to change a decision or interject herself in the process she says is so important to maintain… Her father decided to keep cgi as it always was and bob is Jewish/didn't like that decision and went to cvc and thus it will be changed…”
WikiLeaks has released Band's email during a time of turmoil and upheaval inside of the Clinton Foundation.
“Marc mez had an idea to put together a poker night for the foundation to raise money… His raising money for his own fund hasn't been going well and he has cvc making some calls for him to get mtgs with some clinton people… Marc has invited several potential investors and a few current business ones to the poker night. I assume all are contributing to the foundation, which of course isn't the point.” “What is the point is that he is doing precisely what he accused me of doing as the entire plan of his has been to use this for his business which he is.”
The Clinton campaign has blamed the Russian government for breaking into Podesta's email account and passing the material to WikiLeaks in an attempt to help Donald Trump win next week's election. Podesta, a veteran of nearly half a century of U.S. politics, says he has spoken to the FBI “as a victim” of hacking, according to the Guardian.
The Clinton Foundation is reportedly being looked into by the FBI, according to Fox News. It is unclear what the FBI is focusing on within their investigation.
The Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, previously said the possible subjects of the FBI probe was some of the “personal” emails she deleted from her server and Chelsea's wedding, according to Fox News. FBI Director James Comey discussed the FBI investigation, according to the Washington Examiner.
“Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation.”

Fans have had years to learn everything they can about every single character in the Star Wars universe, and now, they can find out all there is to know about the characters in The Force Awakens.
Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded was given a sneak peek by the official Star Wars website. It releases in April and is filled with information on every character.
The encyclopedia reveals some new facts about classic characters like Han Solo and new characters like Korr Sella and Grummgar who weren't featured prominently in The Force Awakens. You can check out more images of the encyclopedia here.
It looks like that even with the updates, the entries shown remain largely spoiler-free and don't include many plot details from The Force Awakens.
For those looking to dive even deeper into the Star Wars lore, publisher DK also released a visual dictionary for The Force Awakens back in December. The latest Star Wars movie's list of voice actors was also recently revealed.

The Bronx has long been known as the borough of parks and breweries. Several local establishments are adding one more staple to the list: beer.
A new tour offered by the Bronx Tourism Council lets visitors explore five breweries and four special bars.
Nick Mezansky of the Bronx Brewery, located in the Port Morris neighborhood, explained his company's roots.
“The reason the co-founders decided on the Bronx is they wanted to be a part of the borough that was really making things, a production-focused borough,” said Mr. Mezansky, a marketing coordinator for the brewery. “Nothing is made in Brooklyn anymore. Things are sold in Brooklyn but things are still made in the Bronx and that's what we're doing here, we're rolling up our sleeves and making beer all day.”
The Bronx Brewery opened its doors a couple of years ago, three blocks north of the Port Morris Distillery.
Founder Rafael Barbosa explained how he and his partner came to open a business specialized in pitorro, a distilled spirit that originated in Puerto Rico.
“We brought him [Mr. Barbosa's uncle] from Puerto Rico. It's his recipe. Our recipe is brown sugar and we use fruits in the mash, we chose to use apples and honey which are New York State fruits. We support NYS agriculture,” he explained.
If you've never tasted the Puerto-Rican beverage, this is what to expect: “Our pitorro, I think, is a lot smoother than others… it would give you, of course, the burning sensation but at the same time you get a hint of apples and honey,” Mr. Barbosa said.
Décor at the Port Morris Distillery evokes Puerto Rico.
“It's challenging for us because we try not only to keep it within our culture but also educate the visitors that there is such a thing as Puerto Rican moonshine,” said Mr. Barbosa.
The Chelsea Craft Brewing Company recently relocated to the Claremont area of the Bronx, bringing a completely different style with it.
“My beer philosophy is making regular beer. I'm not into super strong beers and fads,” head brewer Mark Szmaida said. “I do have a fruity beer because you have to make it, but most of my beers are very dry-finish, hoppy — just nice beers.”
The Bronx Brewery has a similar philosophy: “The brewery started on the philosophy of do one thing and do it right,” Mr. Mezansky said.
“We made pale ales from the beginning, so that's our style,” he added. “But we get really creative within that style. We try to stretch the boundaries of what a pale ale can be as much as possible.... We also have seasonal beers. We made our winter pale ale with cinnamon and ginger. We made our spring pale ale with tea.”
The two businesses are direct competitors, but Mr. Szmaida says they know how to help each other out. For a recent beer festival, the Chelsea Craft Beer Company did not have a truck available, so the Bronx Brewery helped get the precious brews to the event.
The Bronx Brewery is open for tastings seven days a week in the afternoon; the Chelsea Craft Beer Company, Wednesdays to Sundays; and The Port Morris Distillery, Wednesdays to Saturdays. All offer free tours.
The Bronx Tourism Council's trolley costs $50 and includes a beer “passport” and light snacks at one of the breweries. The next tour is on Sunday, June 12 at 11 a.m. For more info, or to buy tickets, visit www.ilovethebronx.com.
I've covered the Tampa Bay Lightning as my main photo beat for the past 18 seasons for the Tampa Bay Times. It's been an incredible ride with many playoff runs including the thrilling Stanley Cup Championship of 2004. That same year I pitched a story idea that would follow the cup during its summer tour. I witnessed and had the privilege to document some iconic and amazing moments from around the world that myself and many fans had never seen. The image of Marty singing and partying on stage with his wife, Heather, and his favorite band, The Samples, on his cup day in Burlington, Vermont, was one of my favorites from the project. Which you'll see in this collection of photos, is just one of the many times I had the opportunity to photograph # 26, Marty St. Louis. I've always loved the challenge of making memorable hockey photos, whether captured by a remote camera in the catwalk or from the camera in my hand. However what makes those pictures most relevant is when hall of fame greatness, such as Marty St. Louis, appears in those frames. Here are some of my favorite moments as well as a few from my colleague Douglas Clifford, from St. Louis' 14 year career in Tampa Bay.

Two girls alleged he was among four boys who forced them to have sex
One of the girls recanted her statements
The son of Detroit Tigers outfielder Torii Hunter filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking up to $40 million in damages from those who accused the 17-year-old of sexual assault last year, according to attorneys for Darius McClinton-Hunter.
Two girls said in May 2012 that McClinton-Hunter and three other boys from Prosper (Texas) High School forced them to have sex, but the girl who made the allegations against McClinton-Hunter recanted her statement less than 48 hours later. In February, a grand jury declined to indict McClinton-Hunter.
Larry Friedman, an attorney representing McClinton-Hunter, also left open the possibility of legal action against the Prosper (Texas) Police Department, which, Friedman claims, "investigated a crime that didn't exist for over a year after the accuser recanted her complaint."
One of the other boys was indicted on a lesser charge of unlawful restraint. The case is pending.
The lawsuit, filed in Collin County, Texas, seeks to "recover damages against the girls and the parents of the girls who made the false accusations of sexual assault against Darius that falsely branded as a 'criminal,' ruined his reputation, sent him to an Alternative School for a year, got him kicked off the Prosper High School Football Team and banned from High School Sports."
The lawsuit also states that McClinton-Hunter, now a high school senior, was being recruited to play football by schools such as SMU, Texas Tech, Utah, West Virginia, Arkansas, LSU and Oregon, but that any scholarship offers were retracted as a result of the allegations. McClinton-Hunter's brother, Torii Jr., committed in February to play for Notre Dame.
After the accusations, McClinton-Hunter was forced to attend a school for juvenile delinquents, and was allowed to return to Prosper High School after a grand jury refused to bring charges against him. However, school regulations forbid him from participating in extra-curricular activities.
McClinton-Hunter is the lone plaintiff in the lawsuit, and there are eight defendants, including three minors and their parents.
"To this day, nobody has taken responsibility - not the girl, not the Prosper Police Department, not the district attorney," Friedman said. "No one has taken responsibility for what they've done to this young man. No one's said sorry."
"In today's world, these types of things go viral in a minute. There are millions of stories out there accusing him of sexual assault that can never be erased. You can never erase those allegations. He will live to be 100 years old, barring something unforeseen. For the next 80 years those allegations will be there. The impact of this is tremendous."
The suit seeks $10 million in actual damages and punitive damages that run the total to about $40 million.
The lawsuit opens with a reference to the Michael Jackson song Billie Jean: "And mother always told me be careful of who you love. And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth."

The White House is under fire for omitting the name of the Prime Minister of Luxembourg's husband while captioning a picture of every other leader's spouse at the G7 Summit.
The official White House photo, posted onto its Facebook page Saturday, included the Queen of Belgium along with the other halves of leaders from the US, France, Turkey, Iceland, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Belgium, Norway and Luxembourg.
READ MORE: Justin Trudeau left out as G7 leaders huddle (VIDEO)
However, the photo's original caption left out Gauthier Destenay, the husband of Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel.
Despite a quick rebuke from Facebook users, the White House did not update the caption to include Gauthier's name until 10 hours after the image was posted.
Not letting the administration off lightly, many have taken to social media to criticize the omission, saying either incompetence or downright “homophobia” was behind the snub.
Other critics were similarly scathing:
Bettell, who married the Belgian architect in 2015, is currently the world's only openly gay leader after Iceland's Johanna Sigurðardóttir and Belgium's Elio Di Rupo finished their terms in 2013 and 2015 respectively.

When April and I decided to try and have a baby, I was 33 years old. It would be my first, and only biological child. After having always said that I'd never have children, it was kind of a big deal. So, when April sent me that text with a picture of a positive pregnancy test (while I was in a board meeting), I was equal parts jubilant and terrified.
Going to the doctor, seeing the pictures of the little miracle sitting in April's belly, hearing it's fast little heartbeats, was one of the most amazing, surreal moments of my life. It was the happiest I could ever remember feeling.
Fast forward two months. April said something didn't feel right. She was bleeding a little bit, so we headed straight to the emergency room. After some waiting, then some tests, the doctor came in and very matter of fact-ly says, “You've miscarried. There is no heartbeat. These things happen sometimes. I'm sorry.”
And that was it. April handled it better than I did. I think she was already pretty sure of what was happening. I was crushed. I felt silly for crying like I did, but I couldn't help it. How could I already be in love with something that was only the size of a peanut? It was just a little blurb on the screen. But it was mine. It was ours. And now it was gone.
We went home and hugged each other for a while, and then told the girls, although Emma didn't totally understand. And then I did what I do when I'm upset. I began to write in my moleskin notebook. I didn't know what I was going to write, and so I just let my heart take over. And this is what I wrote:
“Your news was so surprising
With equal parts fear and joy
Would I be a good father?
Would you be a girl or boy?
Would you be covered in freckles?
Or would you have a loud voice?
Would I rather have a son or daughter,
If I was given the choice?
These are things I'll never know
You'll remain a mystery
Before I met you, you had to go
Not knowing what you would be
I wanted you so badly
Yet God said it was not to be
So you'll stay forever in my heart
As a yellow memory”
Until we meet again, little peanut. I love you.

Trump's Twitter feed is offensive so frequently that it's tempting to let oneself get inured to the horrors, to ignore as white noise his 140-character offerings. Ad Policy
But his retweets of Britain First videos about the purported perils of Islam, and of Muslim migration to the West, was so offensive, even by Trump's morally debased, cretinous standards, that they merit a serious response. Related Article Donald Trump's Most Vile Tweets Yet Deserve Global Condemnation John Nichols
Trump retweeted three video clips, titled “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!,” “Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!,” and “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!” In fact, the first depicts the actions not of a migrant but of a person born in Holland, and the other two, depicting events in Syria and Egypt, are not explained in context. Regardless of the veracity of the imagery, the use to which it is being put by Britain First and now by Trump is truly vile, as the actions of depraved individuals or gangs are used by a fascist movement to deliberately tar hundreds of millions of people who have nothing to do with such crimes and would never tolerate them.
Imagine, for a moment, the unanimous outcry if Trump were to tweet, “Christian man shoots hundreds of festival goers in Las Vegas!” or “Christian mob goes on drunken rampage after Euro-cup football game!” or “Armed Christian mobs demonstrate outside mosques in Texas while other Christians firebomb Islamic centers!” He would, rightly, be condemned for tarring a whole religion with the heinous acts of a few twisted people.
That Trump was looking at a fascist Twitter feed is horrifying enough—though not at all surprising, given that he has previously paraphrased Hitler in a public speech and during the election campaign tweeted out Mussolini quotes. But that he then felt compelled to add the imprimatur of presidential authority to such vicious propaganda is unfathomable. As unfathomable as it would be if, say, Franklin Roosevelt used one of his fireside chats to broadcast the views of Julius Streicher, the monstrous but highly effective anti-Semitic propagandist in Nazi Germany.
Trump's Twitter endorsement of Britain First's propaganda is every bit as scurrilous. There's nothing “mainstream” about Britain First, or about figures like Jayda Fransen, the woman who serves as deputy leader of the group and whose tweets Trump was so taken by during his early-morning online perambulations. They are, and always have been, deeply fascist in inclination and in action.
Britain First has emerged over the past few years out of the remnants of two proto-fascist groups, the British National Party and the English Defence League, both of which have been effectively driven into obscurity, or at least steep decline, by years of grassroots anti-fascist organizing. The BNP itself emerged as a splinter group from the National Front, which was founded as a street-fighting anti-black and anti-immigrant party in the late 1960s, and which caused considerable mayhem during the 1970s. Its founding was regarded by fascists in the UK as the most significant event in Britain since the disbanding of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, under government order, during World War II.

This is the heritage of white-supremacist skinheads and racially motivated football hooligans. It is the sort of politics that regards a weaponized broken bottle as an appropriate tool with which to pursue one's political agenda.
Such are the vicious antecedents of Britain First, a group that these days uses the Internet to troll Muslim and pro-immigrant politicians, and that routinely threatens, and sometimes commits, acts of extreme violence against its opponents. In 2016, Labor MP Jo Cox was stomped, stabbed, and shot to death by a supporter of the organization, a man who repeatedly yelled “Britain First!” during his bloody attack. That same year, Britain First activists launched “Christian Patrols” in the town of Luton aimed at personally intimidating local Muslims, especially women wearing the hijab. Fransen, who is currently facing legal actions in Northern Ireland for her hate activities, has described pro-immigrant politicians as “traitors” who will be “punished” via “good old fashioned British justice at the end of a rope.”
Any mainstream politician in the UK who retweeted Britain First tweets would be out of a job and probably expelled from his or her political party in an instant. In Britain, as in the rest of Europe, there is still an active memory of what happens when fascists, or those temperamentally sympathetic to fascist worldviews, take power. The carnage unleashed by Nazism isn't regarded as ancient history in the continent the Nazis turned into an abattoir.
That doesn't mean that plenty of people in France—as well as Germany, Holland, Sweden, and elsewhere in Europe—aren't attracted to far-right parties and beliefs; but it does mean that the mainstream body politic works to marginalize such views and such groupings, and to delegitimize the hate-filled, mob-inciting messages of their leaders. That Trump, the most powerful politician on earth, retweets such moral garbage instead of condemning it, and that his party, the GOP, stands silently by while he does so, is the great tragedy, the stench, of our historical moment.
Where are those good men and women of the GOP who will rise up against this filth? Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham condemned the president's retweets, but why are their colleagues silent? Where are the voices of conscience at this pivotal moment, as Trump wins the public praise, again, of David Duke and other pond-scum white supremacists? Where are the ones who say “enough”? You will, one day, be judged by history for your silence.
The last few weeks of the Republican Presidential road show has been dominated by discussion of Mitt Romney's career as head of a Wall Street private equity firm -- Bain Capital. Most people who enter politics have some previous career in the private sector -- especially if they're wealthy.
But Mitt Romney's career on Wall Street -- which he apparently hoped would allow him to tout his credentials as a "job creator" -- will instead weigh down his election hopes like a massive millstone. There are six reasons why:
1). First and most important, attacks on Romney's history at Bain are not "attacks on free enterprise" -- or being "anti-business." They are important for what they communicate about Mitt Romney and his values and the contrast that it poses with President Obama.
Barack Obama - like Mitt Romney -- earned a degree at Harvard -- and all of the opportunities that afforded. But when he graduated from law school, Obama went to work helping workers in the shadow of closed -down steel mills. Romney made millions for himself closing down steel mills.
The point is not just that workers were laid off, or jobs were outsourced -- though they were. The point is not whether some of the ventures Romney funded succeeded and others failed. The point is that the impact of Romney's business activity on the lives of ordinary people was incidental to his one and only goal: making huge sums of money for himself and a small group of his partners and investors.
Romney's idea of success was embodied in that picture from two decades ago, with Romney at the center, surrounded by a squadron of Wall Street sharpies with money coming out of their pockets, their mouths and ears.
The point of the Bain story is that Romney would do whatever he could legally do to make money for himself and his crew. The effect of his decisions on the lives of ordinary people -- or even the businesses in which they invested -- was simply irrelevant. If shifting jobs overseas would make him and his friends more money - fine. If Bain could make millions by loading up a business with debt and bleeding it of cash -- that was fine too -- even if it meant that the business itself was ultimately forced to close. If buying a business and chopping it up into parts for resale would make him more money -- so be it.
Improving the lives of ordinary workers -- or of local communities -- was never his goal. His goal was to make millions and millions of dollars for himself -- often at other people's expense. Instead of viewing ordinary workers as human beings who were parts of a team, he viewed them as "factors of production" -- assets to be used when they helped him make money -- objects to be discarded when that would fatten his bottom line.
Americans want a President who understands and cares about ordinary people -- that's not the Mitt Romney of Bain Capital.
2). If you were the Republican Party, you couldn't pick a worse time to nominate a candidate with a resume as one of Wall Street's "Masters of the Universe."
Even today, most voters are acutely aware that the recklessness of the big Wall Street Banks -- and a complicit Bush Administration -- caused the 2008 financial crisis that cost eight million Americans their jobs and worst economic calamity since the Great Depression.
The GOP will have to go some distance to convince everyday voters that they should trust their economic futures to a guy who was part of precisely the same crowd whose greed and recklessness just sent the economy crashing in flames.
After all, not many people would be keen to sign up for a cruise managed by the same team that commanded the Titanic.
3). Over the last year, Americans have become increasingly focused on economic inequality -- and on the fact that the gang that caused the economy to collapse kept making billions while everyone else paid the price. The message of the Occupy Movement doesn't resonate solely on the left of the political spectrum. Occupy speaks to many independents and conservatives as well.
And let's remember, the Occupy Movement started out as "Occupy Wall Street." Americans are increasingly uncomfortable with the exploding role of the financial sector in the American economy. They are not uncomfortable because of theoretical or "policy" concerns. It just doesn't make sense to them that a relatively tiny number of people -- who don't build a product or create a service -- can make massive amounts of money, while ordinary people who work hard and play by the rules see their incomes flat-line.
Their view is simple. They create cars, or food, or houses or computers -- or they provide police protection, or care for sick people, or teach our kids. Why should they be asked to sacrifice when guys who basically gamble for a living -- as Wall Street speculators -- make incomprehensibly large sums of money?
It makes no sense to them that 400 families control as much wealth as 150 million of their fellow Americans -- that the top 1% control 30% of all of the wealth in America.
It makes no sense that a hedge fund investor like John Paulson can make $5 billion in income and pay a lower percentage in taxes than a secretary. He makes $2.4 million per hour -- or $40,000 a minute. Paulson makes as much in the first 1.25 minutes of the work year as the average worker makes all year long.
That kind of excessive wealth might not upset everyday Americans so much if their own incomes were growing. But those incomes have stagnated for decades. And over those same decades, the incomes of the top 1% have increased by almost 300%.
And perhaps most galling to everyday voters, is the fact that the wealthiest Americans have such an outsized influence setting the rules -- cutting their own taxes -- making their own regulations -- and are rarely held accountable for the recklessness that has cost everyone else so dearly.
Americans feel that the middle class is in dire jeopardy -- that it is under attack. They worry that the American dream will be snatched from their own families -- and those of their children.
Not a great time for the Republicans to nominate a poster boy for the one percent.
4). The impact of Romney's record at Bain is magnified by his own personality.
Romney comes across as a cold, calculating guy -- precisely the kind of guy who doesn't blink an eye when he orders up hundreds of "pink slips." He is about as empathetic as a rock.
He has a hard time connecting with people in public -- and on TV. And he seems to have a tin ear -- a hard time understanding how his remarks will be interpreted by ordinary voters.
He "enjoys" firing people who don't give him good service. Really?
He doesn't understand how it might sound for a guy who has a fortune of $200 million to say that he is actually "unemployed" too. Or when -- having graduated from Harvard, born into a family of the CEO of a big auto company, he says he has been worried about getting a "pink slip"? Sure.
He doesn't even have to stop and think when he offers to bet $10,000 on who is right in a televised debate? Ten thousand dollars is two thirds of the average annual Social Security benefit.
That kind of tin ear sends a message to ordinary voters that he is simply out of touch - that he doesn't understand or empathize with the lives of ordinary Americans.
Then there is the story of the 12-hour trip with the dog in the kennel on top of the car. The story about how when the dog got sick riding on top of the car -- had an attack of diarrhea. Romney hosed down the car -- hosed down the dog -- put the dog back on top of the car and continued the drive.
These personal characteristics just reinforce the picture of Romney as a Wall Street baron who doesn't understand or care about the needs, or lives, or interests of ordinary Americans.
5). The fact that Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry have joined in defining Romney's Bain years absolutely inoculates Democrats from charges that they are "anti-free enterprise" or "anti-business" when they make the same charges.
Probably not very likely that Gingrich or Perry would volunteer to attack Romney's history at Bain next September -- but they just did. All Democrats need to do is put a clip of Rick Perry in an ad where he accused Romney of being a "vulture capitalist.".
6). Finally, in so many respects, Romney's Bain history makes him the perfect antagonist in the campaign narrative set out by President Obama last month in his Kansas speech.
The President will, quite correctly, frame the upcoming election as a battle for the future of the American middle class -- a choice between a society where we're all in this together or all in this alone.
He will offer a vision of America where we look out for each other -- where everyone is called upon to play by the same rules -- and everyone gets a fair shot, a fair shake and contributes their fair share.
The Willard Mitt Romney who ran Bain Capital is the perfect foil for the Democratic narrative this fall. That's why the Bain Capital narrative is so important for defining Romney and setting the terms of this year's election campaign.
Just visualize the national political debate that features the Mitt Romney we've seen on TV the last several weeks and the Barack Obama who made the speech in Osawatomie, Kansas last month.
At the close of his Kansas speech -- which took place in the same town where Theodore Roosevelt had announced his "New Nationalism" a century ago. Obama said:
"We are all Americans," Teddy Roosevelt told them that day. "Our common interests are as broad as the continent." In the final years of his life, Roosevelt took that same message all across this country, from tiny Osawatomie to the heart of New York City, believing that no matter where he went, no matter who he was talking to, everybody would benefit from a country in which everyone gets a fair chance. And well into our third century as a nation, we have grown and we've changed in many ways since Roosevelt's time. The world is faster and the playing field is larger and the challenges are more complex. But what hasn't changed -- what can never change -- are the values that got us this far. We still have a stake in each other's success. We still believe that this should be a place where you can make it if you try. And we still believe, in the words of the man who called for a New Nationalism all those years ago, "The fundamental rule of our national life," he said, "the rule which underlies all others -- is that, on the whole, and in the long run, we shall go up or down together." And I believe America is on the way up.
The man paralyzed when a Cedar Rapids police officer shot him last month during a traffic stop has a released a statement ahead of the dash camera video the Linn County Attorney will release Thursday.
On Tuesday, a Grand Jury decided the officer involved would not face any charges for shooting Mitchell. Linn County Attorney Jerry Vander Sanden made the findings public during a news conference, which included foul language the officer says Jerime Mitchell used during the incident.
Wednesday night, Mitchell asked that the following statement be released before the dash camera video is released Thursday:
"What Mr. Vander Sanden said during Tuesday's press conference & led people to believe about me is untrue & completely different from my true character. I would never say those things to anyone, let alone to a police officer. If there was sound on the video it would tell a completely different story.
After I stepped out of my vehicle Officer Jones changed his story as to why I was being pulled over and became combative toward me. I was frightened, and decided it was in my best interest to get back in my truck. At that point, Officer Jones got even more aggressive towards me and slammed me against the truck then, without provocation from me, he tackled me to the ground and released his dog who started attacking me.
I was scared and knew I had to get back in my vehicle to get away from the dog. Officer Jones then jumped on me and shot me while I was in my truck.
I realized I was shot and needed to get to the hospital immediately and that is when I accelerated. Immediately after, I lost control because his bullet paralyzed me.
I was unarmed. I never struck the officer, or the dog. This has changed my life forever... he shot to kill me... No one should ever be treated the way I was that night."

When Pakistani painter Mahwish Chishty returned from the United States to her native Lahore in 2011, her friends and family couldn't stop talking about the American-led drone war raging along the border with Afghanistan. That's how she got the idea to reimagine drones in her country's colorful truck art tradition. So has the US Department of Defense asked her to repaint any Predators yet? See her answers and more of her hauntingly beautiful paintings below.
Mother Jones: How did you get the idea for these paintings?
Mahwish Chishty: In 2011, I went back home to Lahore. I'd heard all this propaganda behind the drone war, and I was curious about that. It triggered my imagination. Are you familiar with the truck-art genre from Pakistani culture?
MJ: Why don't you explain it.
MC: It's kind of a folk art. It's a tradition, a culture. People who drive these trucks basically live on those trucks, sleep on those trucks. They kind of make that into their mobile home and they decorate it into something that's eye pleasing. They're extremely beautiful paintings. They spend so much time on it and they don't get any funding. This is something that they do, just a personal interest. It has no reason whatsoever other than just an aesthetic sense. I always thought that it was not given any importance in the art world back home, and I wanted people to think maybe what would happen if these drones were friendlier looking, instead of such hard-edged, metallic war machines.
MJ: Some people might see this as a positive spin on drones.
MC: I don't know if I am glorifying it. I just want people to talk about it. At the same time, it has some kind of beauty to it. I am also looking at them as objects, and not as much as war machines.
MJ: So has the Department of Defense asked you to repaint any of their Predators yet?
MC: [Laughs.] No, but I was thinking that would be so cool. I probably should put in a proposal for that.
Does it ever seem like the entertainment industry needlessly interjects biased and politically-charged content into otherwise entertaining television programs or films? If so, rest assured you're not unreasonably suspicious. Aside from the biases already attendant to the industry, the truth is that Hollywood is engaged in a concerted effort to propagandize unsuspecting Americans on certain political issues; and one of their chief causes is gun control.
This is an important point noted earlier this week by Daily Caller writer Dan Griffin, who brought much-needed attention to the work of the Entertainment Industries Council (EIC). Core to EIC's mission is “Encouraging the entertainment industry to more effectively address and accurately depict major health and social issues.” According to EIC, civilian firearms ownership is one of the “major” issues requiring public conditioning.
To further this effort, EIC provides those in the entertainment industry with a list of “Depiction Suggestions” for how firearms should be portrayed on television and in film. Of the more than 30 “suggestions,” a handful target the criminal misuse of firearms. However, the vast majority seek to portray legitimate firearm ownership as destructive and dangerous.
Here are just a few examples:
Consider reflecting the reality that homeowners often freeze up or tremble so badly when trying to use a gun in self-defense that they are unable to deploy it. Or show them as being too frozen in fear to even get the gun.
Consider showing someone who is attempting to use a gun in self-defense being overpowered by the attacker who then uses the gun against him or her.
Consider depicting people as feeling less safe, rather than more safe, when they find their neighbors becoming increasingly armed.
If appropriate to the story, consider exploring a gun dealer's or a gun supplier's remorse about the harm done by someone to whom he or she furnished a firearm.
Consider having a character use a gun in what he/she believes is self-defense only to be charged with murder or manslaughter because it's determined that excessive or unjustified lethal force was deployed.
Consider portraying a gun manufacturer making the right decisions in choosing to design a safer firearm.
Try making the point that having guns in the house may actually increase the possibility of home invasion robbery since firearms are an attractive target for theft.
While EIC states accuracy as an intended goal, they've failed woefully. For instance, EIC's suggested characterizations of armed self-defense appear solely informed by their anti-gun prejudice. In reality, only a minority of defensive gun uses involve an individual firing at a criminal perpetrator, with the firearm often acting as a deterrent to further aggression. Moreover, in their book, Armed: New Perspectives on Gun Control, researchers Gary Kleck and Don B. Kates cite evidence suggesting those who resist crime using a firearm have more favorable outcomes than those who do not resist. The authors note, “Victims who used guns were less likely to be injured than crime victims who did not resist…,” and, “there does not appear to be any increase in injury risk due to defensive gun use that counterbalances its greater effectiveness in avoiding property loss.” The pair go on to explain, “In sum, defensive gun use rarely provokes criminals to attack victims, and on the rare occasions that gun-using victims are injured after using their guns, the injuries are almost always minor.”
While the entertainment industry's assault on our rights did not begin with EIC's efforts, EIC has been engaged in their anti-gun mission for more than 15 years, with their “Firearm Depiction Tip-Sheet” launching in 2000. A few years later, EIC created a “guide” to firearm issues for industry members, following a “Picture This” meeting that included a who's who of the anti-gun movement. Just like the “Depiction Suggestions,” the guide contends to offer TV and film “creators” information on the dangers of firearms, much of which has been thoroughly debunked by NRA.
In the guide, special thanks is given to representatives from the Brady Campaign, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, A Million Mom March, and Violence Policy Center. The publication makes clear that it was produced “with support from The Joyce Foundation.” The Joyce Foundation is best known to gun rights supporters as a key funding source for the radical gun prohibitionist group Violence Policy Center. Further, the EIC board of trustees includes Wallis Annenberg, President and CEO of the anti-gun Annenberg Foundation. The Annenberg Foundation has made significant donations to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
The document concludes by acknowledging EIC's attempt to condition the public, noting, “All genres of entertainment can and do impart information to their audiences, which in turn may influence real-life decisions and beliefs.” The document adds that anti-gun propaganda should be embedded into all manner of entertainment, regardless of whether it is particularly suitable, stating, “Gun violence is not an issue only appropriate for police, medical or legal dramas. All types of programming — from television comedies to country music — can find an angle of the issue that will appeal to their audience while maintaining the integrity of the production.”
According to the Hollywood Reporter, in 2005, EIC mailed out 1,900 copies of the guide to “showrunners, development executives, writers, producers and directors in film and television,” and sent additional emails to “800 people working on TV shows or programs in development.”
Moreover, in 2003, EIC joined with the Joyce Foundation to launch the now defunct EDGE (Entertainment Depiction of Gun Education) awards. Commendations were given to television shows that best conformed to EIC's suggested depictions of firearms. Those programs that received inaugural EDGE awards included 7th Heaven, ER, and The West Wing.
To EIC's credit, their “Depiction Suggestions” do not include producing negative representations of the nation's largest civil liberties organization, or as they might term NRA, the gun lobby. However, anti-gun studio executives have not let this oversight stop them.
Described by Variety as a “gun control drama,” Miss Sloane, a film set to be released in 2017, follows the exploits of a political strategist working on behalf of the gun control lobby. Actress Jessica Chastain, who portrays fictional gun control lobbyist Elizabeth Sloane in the film, told reporters, “It's a David and Goliath story, with this woman up against a powerful force: the NRA.” It will certainly take some movie magic to portray a character whose real-world counterparts are principally bankrolled by a billionaire media mogul and his well-heeled cohorts as David, to a 5 million member grassroots organization's Goliath.
Hollywood mega-producer and Hillary Clinton fundraiser Harvey Weinstein also has NRA in his sights. Weinstein is currently working on an anti-NRA project titled The Senator's Wife. In early 2014, Weinstein told listeners of the Howard Stern Show that NRA is a “disaster area,” and, "I'm going to make a movie with Meryl Streep, and we're going to take this head-on. And they're going to wish they weren't alive after I'm done with them." When Weinstein isn't pontificating against guns, he is the purveyor of violent films such as Rambo (2008), Pulp Fiction, and Grindhouse, and slasher flicks like Halloween and Scream.
Unfortunately, even the fiction section of your local library isn't safe from the organized gun control agenda. According to an article from WashingtonPost.com, two-dozen crime writers have collaborated on a forthcoming collection of short stories, titled, Unloaded: Crime Writers Writing Without Guns. The anthology specifically contains stories in which the authors have refused to depict violence perpetrated with firearms, instead opting for other violent means, as some sort of incoherent statement against guns generally. The proceeds of the compilation will go to gun control group States United To Prevent Gun Violence. However, one surprisingly astute Washington Post writer points out, “If not overtly, then certainly implicitly, this is a pro-gun-control collection, but ironically, it seems to confirm the old NRA bumper sticker: ‘Guns Don't Kill People. People Kill People.'”
In the face of entertainment industry intransigence, the most effective means of combatting this type of conditioning is to inform others of the concerted effort to indoctrinate the public. As for frustrated gun rights supporters, the next time you're at home watching television or a film and encounter this sort of propaganda, just remember, there was a reason your mother called it the idiot box.
CHAOS!~ AMNESTY ACTIVISTS Storm Cantor's HQ After Concession Speech (Video)
This was crazy!
Adding insult to injury, far left amnesty activists stormed Eric Cantor's election night headquarters after his loss to Dave Brat.
They raided the wrong headquarters.
Cantor lost.
That had to hurt.
The Washington Post reported:
As if the political drama were not powerful enough, chaos erupted at election night headquarters shortly after House Majority Leader Eric Cantor conceded his stunning defeat to tea party-backed conservative David Brat. Cantor addressed his supporters for about four minutes at a suburban Richmond hotel ballroom, then boarded an SUV without taking questions from reporters scurrying after him. Then it got really rambunctious. In the room of downcast Cantor allies, a new energy suddenly erupted — but not the kind they wanted on election night. A group of immigration activists stormed the ballroom, screaming and waving a flag. “What do we want? Immigration reform! When do we want it? Now!” A few Cantor supporters tried to block the protesters' entrance into the ballroom, and pushing and shoving ensued. And before they reached the microphone, one Cantor supporter threw his glass of wine at a female protester. She swore at him in return.
The NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan has confirmed only that it carried out a "precision strike" in Watapur district in eastern Kunar province late on Saturday. According to the coalition, the strike had killed 10 "enemy forces," but that it had no reports of civilian casualties.
Afghan officials, however, say that several civilians, including children, were caught up in the airstrike. They said the truck was hit after the driver gave the Taliban fighters a lift.
Reports on the number of civilian casualties differ, with Kunar provincial governor Shujaul Mulk Jalala telling the AFP news agency that 12 civilians were killed, along with four insurgents belonging to the terrorist network al Qaeda.
Kunar police chief Abdul Habib Sayed Khil told AFP that 10 civilians had died in the attack.
"President Hamid Karzai termed the attack on women and children against all internationally agreed principles and strongly condemned it," Karzai's office said in a statement
Longstanding tension
Kunar province, which shares a border with lawless tribal areas of Pakistan, is considered a transit hub for foreign insurgents, including al Qaeda militants who fight alongside the Taliban.
Civilian casualties in NATO operations are a longstanding source of tension between the Afghan government and US-led NATO troops. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has forbidden Afghan troops to to call for foreign airstrikes, though the ban is not always heeded.
NATO troops are winding down operations in Afghanistan as they prepare to withdraw by the end of next year. Violence in the country has grown as Afghan security forces gradually take over. The UN says nearly 1,000 civilians were killed in the first half of 2013, a 23 percent increase over the same period last year.

The Canadian Coalition for Peace and Justice (CCPJ) filed submission on behalf of some of the arrested with the United Nations Human Rights Council, Fourth Universal Periodic Review Canada (2008). Lawyer for the CCPJ, Faisal Kutty, alleged on behalf of the CCPJ that Canada was in breach of its international commitments pursuant to various provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Standard Minimum Rules for Treatment of Prisoners adopted by the First United Nations Congress in 1955; and the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1990. He called on the Human Rights Council to investigate these allegations.[86]

On October 19, 2017, the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), the Dutch-led criminal investigation into the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over Ukraine, published a new photograph Buk 332, the Russian Buk missile launcher that downed MH17 on July 17, 2014. Buk 332, previously identified by Bellingcat as ‘Buk 3×2,' is an anti-aircraft missile launcher belonging to Russia's Kursk-based 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. The image shows the right side of the Buk, loaded on the red low loader. In publishing the photograph, the JIT wrote that the photograph was “probably taken on July 17, 2014 in the town of Makeevka, Ukraine,” but we can now conclusively say that the photograph was actually taken at 78 Prospekt Ilycha, at the intersection with Shakhtostroiteley, in Donetsk.
The Hunt
Using Check, a crowdsourced verification platform, we asked our readers to contribute tips regarding the location of this photograph so that we could collectively geolocate this key piece of evidence concerning the downing of MH17.
Geolocating this #MH17 photograph seems impossible, but we already have a lead. Help us to crowdsource this task: https://t.co/OuZcd7fZbA pic.twitter.com/2P90SHMhxw — bellingcat (@bellingcat) October 19, 2017
One of the strongest candidates was 78 Prospekt Ilycha in Donetsk, due to previous witness accounts identifying a Buk missile launcher with its Russian/separatist convoy at this site.
“Bad news. Around 9am, a hauler was going along the Makeevka highway from Makeevka in the direction of Donetsk. On the platform was a BukM1-M2? This AAMS proceeded to the intersection with Shakhtostroiteley Boulevard. The system was accompanied by a convoy that was composed of 1 gray Rav4 SUV, a camouflaged UAZ, and a dark blue Hyundai van with tinted windows. As of 9:15am, the vehicle was located at the intersection of Shakhtostroiteley and Ilycha. The militants got out of their cars, blocking 2 of the far left lanes. Obviously, they were waiting for logistical guidance.”
Numerous features in the photograph were also visible in Google Street View and Yandex Panorama imagery of the same location, including the two trees in the foreground, a gate beneath the Buk's low-loader, a rock next to the nearest tree, and notches in the curb blocks.

The walkway along the salon, where cameraman stood, is much lower than the curb, which explains low position of camera on the "BUK" picture. pic.twitter.com/xTb37YesAF — Zitty (@zitty055) October 20, 2017

Looking the other side becomes even clearer; this is at the Illicha Ave in Donetsk. #mh17 pic.twitter.com/TkYpW0O665 — Roelard Smit (@ROELart) October 20, 2017
Taking these tips together, the following comparisons show how some key details match between the two photographs, making the site worthy of further investigation to confirm the geolocation.

Right: the same type of gate visible on October 2011 Google Street View of Prospekt Illycha in Donetsk, Ukraine.

Conclusive Evidence
Today, at least one local in Donetsk snapped two photographs from this same location, attempting to confirm or refute a geolocation to Prospekt Ilycha in central Donetsk. These photographs were shared online by Christo Grozev and Rudy Bouma.

Conclusion
With this geolocation, we now have photographic evidence of a scene that was reported on by numerous locals: Buk 332, originating from Russia's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, arrived in Donetsk from Makiivka around 9am on July 17, 2014, parked at the intersection of Prospekt Ilycha and Shakhtostroiteley, and then eventually turned towards the east-bound Prospekt Ilycha towards the Motel roundabout in Donetsk. The movement is shown in the map below, with the photographer of the original Buk photo facing south from building number 78.

Councilor Gotaak looked down at the headlines once more and frowned before putting down his PADD.
“Lukari Captain Solves Mysteries, Saves Ancestral Races”
“Lukari Protomatter Protects Galaxy”
“Kentari Discovered; Lukari Fixes Pollution”
He shook his head. The media were eating up the exploits of Captain Kuumaarke. They absolutely adored her and were doing all they could to make the rest of the planet love her too. Gotaak wasn't the only one who had taken notice of this. The various councils were all trying to gain influence over the young captain. Only last week, the Economic Council had tried to coerce an endorsement from her to reduce military spending. Of course, reduced military spending would also mean fewer space-faring vessels, and Kuumaarke was entirely against that.
The Planetary Councilor picked up a second PADD and brought up the captain's report. Not only did she rediscover Kentar, the planet of their origins, devastated from centuries of abuse - but she also found New Kentar, the homeworld of their long-lost kinsmen. To think that, after all these years in exile, a bridge could be built between the two societies. Perhaps they could all be one again.
Considering the Kentari record of planet-wide environmental abuse, it came as no surprise that the Science Council was strictly against any sort of Lukari-Kentari merger – especially the Environmental Division. One more fire to put out, thought Gotaak.
The door chimed.
“Come in,” Gotaak looked up from his PADD as his aide, Nedil, entered with an inquisitive look upon his youthful face.
“You asked to see me, Councilor?” Nedil was sorting various budget files when the call came for him. The life of a Planetary Council Aide wasn't the most exciting per se, but it was illuminating. He never knew how expensive running a country could be, let alone an entire planet.
“Yes,” Gotaak tapped his PADD, replacing the report with an attached message, offering it to his young assistant. “It would appear that our young hero has added diplomat to her résumé.” Nedil took the PADD and started reading, his eyes going wide.
“S-Sir!” Nedil stammered, flabbergasted. “Are we seriously considering opening regular diplomatic relations with the Kentari? The very people responsible for the Great Exodus?!”
The councilor shrugged. “It would appear so. Kuumaarke's suggestion is gaining considerable support in some very influential circles. Many feel that membership in the Federation may hinge upon such… diplomatic efforts,” He continued before his aide could respond. “Obviously there will be opposition, but if a working arrangement can be found, I'm sure a majority of the councils will go along.”
“That… that's incredible, sir. I mean… wouldn't such an open embrace of the Kentari be political suicide for most of the council members? The polls are showing –“
“If this effort were to succeed,” Gotaak smiled thinly. “Those in support of the measure would be known as the generation that repaired the greatest cultural divide in our history. We'd be the peace bringers who reconciled the schism that led to the Great Exodus. Political suicide? I should think ‘political immortality' would be a more fitting term.”
“I… I shall bow to your superior wisdom on the matter, sir. That being said, what can I do to help?”
“As of now, I am taking you off of all of your other tasks. I want you to assist me in drawing up a new proposal I've been working on - something that could have a great impact on both Lukari and Kentari.”
“Me, sir?”
“This project involves a logistical focus on a planetary scale. Your experience in managing such logistics is noteworthy. Frankly, there is no one else I'd trust to check the numbers on a project like this.”
“You honor me, sir! I… I accept, of course!”
“Don't get too excited. It's still early days, and the political landscape could shift to a point where the project becomes untenable. We'll need to build multiple levels of contingencies. That said… do you think you're up to the task?”
“For political immortality, I believe I shall rise to the challenge, sir. You can count on me,” The young aide beamed as the councilor handed him a PADD with details on the project.

Prime Minister Tuulemaan looked out the window of her office at the familiar haze. She had thought that her actions would help tear down the Traditionalist opinion. She was wrong. Buildings were plastered with posters –
“NO CONFIDENCE: Remove the Prime Minister!”
“Keep New Kentar for Kentari only!”
“Free Pentaaro! Free New Kentar!”
Her attempt to save the planet turned some of the planet against her, but she was willing to shoulder that burden if it meant her people would survive longer. Regardless, it was an uphill battle, and she was going to need another major victory if any of these policies were going to stick. Food production had resumed on the moon, but the fact remained that it wouldn't be possible without Lukari help. Never mind the horrific attack by the Tzenkethi, or the treachery of Pentaaro and the Traditionalists in the military – in the court of public opinion, the government of New Kentar had to rely on aliens to save the day.
Meeting the Lukari and their allies was an important first step, and she knew that without the Lukari technology, New Kentar was doomed. The challenge was helping the people come to the same realization.
“Madame Prime Minister, we just received a message from the Lukari Planetary Council,” Waantel, one of her deputies, handed her a transcript of the latest missive from Lukari Prime. “The diplomatic proposal has passed, and they are ready to move forward. They're prepared to establish an embassy at our convenience, and have extended the same courtesy to us.”
The Prime Minister looked at her well-armored associate. After losing two of her staff to “freedom fighters,” many members of her staff were now prepared for combat at all times. At least no one wanted to risk making a martyr out of her yet.
“Excellent news,” She allowed herself a tired smile. “Phase one is to commence immediately. I'd like a final list of potential embassy sites by week's end, along with construction budgets and security details. Alert the media as well. I'd like to get our spin on this before the Trads. Emphasize the diplomatic and economic potential of the effort, especially all of the new jobs involved in constructing the embassy.”
“Yes, Madame Prime Minister.” Waantel bowed and turned to leave. He paused briefly before looking back at his boss, grimly. “Hopefully the news of new jobs will alleviate some of the hostility out there. The latest protests are starting to get ugly. In fact, you'll need to leave via the secure exit today.”
“Understood. Thank you, Waantel, that will be all for now.”
The younger man nodded his head and exited the office, closing the door behind him.
Tuulemaan shook her head and frowned. A lot of work ahead, indeed.

One Russian city wants to send a message to Americans protesting the election of Donald Trump: Well, we like him.
The city of Obninsk was granted a permit for a rally Saturday in favor of the U.S. president-elect — another sign of Trump's embrace in a country whose relations with the Obama administration soured badly over rifts such as Syria and Ukraine.
The demonstration was organized by Artyom Mainas, a 27-year-old blogger in Obninsk, a nuclear-research center some 60 miles south of Moscow. He said he decided to act after seeing news from the United States about demonstrations in the wake of Trump's election.
“I thought, well, it would be good if we can organize something here in Russia to demonstrate our support to the newly-elected president,” Mainas said by telephone Friday. “We think that Trump is a good candidate for Russia.”
Russians have greeted the election of Trump as a victory, in part because of the Republican's support for Putin and calls for better ties with Russia during the campaign. On Friday, Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said Trump and Putin see “eye-to-eye politically,” according to the TASS news agency.
Throughout the campaign, Russian officials and state media constantly warned that a Hillary Clinton presidency could erode already poor U.S.-Russia relations . Meanwhile, Moscow has conducted nationwide civil defense drills.
The U.S. administration accused Russia of interfering on Trump's behalf, including hacks of emails from top members of Clinton's campaign team. Earlier this week, President Obama warned his successor not to embrace Putin too readily.
[Obama to Trump: Stand up to Putin and Russia]
Putin also sounded a bellicose note Friday, saying Russia is working to develop new weapons to “ensure a strategic balance.”
The Russian leader, wrapping up a week-long series of talks with his senior commanders on Moscow's plans to modernize its military, said that Russia is developing state-of-the art weapons that draw on laser, hypersonic and robotic technologies.
“We are giving special attention to the development of weapons based on new physical principles that allow selective, pinpoint impact on critically important elements of enemy weapons and infrastructure,” Putin said at the meeting, broadcast on Russian television from the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
Russian military officials have recently described developing warheads for ballistic missiles that would be invisible to antimissile defenses, or capable of evading them. Russia has protested NATO's U.S.-led missile defense system, and Putin on Friday appeared to lodge a response to the U.S. development of Prompt Global Strike, a weapons systems that would allow the U.S. to deliver a strike anywhere in the world within an hour.
“We will do all necessary to ensure a strategic balance,” Putin added. “Our task is to efficiently neutralize any military threats to Russia, including those created by strategic missile defenses, the implementation of the concept of global strike, and information wars.”
The Kremlin believes that the Obama administration is waging a propaganda war to isolate Russia, and a top Putin aide accused the White House on Thursday of “doing everything it can to drive bilateral ties into such a deadlock” that it would be difficult for a new team to improve relations.
[Trump's pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy]
The aide, Yuri Ushakov, said Trump supported Putin's call for normalizing ties, and “expressed his readiness not only to normalize ties, but also develop them intensively in all areas.”
Mainas, the blogger who organized the pro-Trump demonstration scheduled for Saturday, said his idea has attracted more support than he expected when he applied for a permit for a rally of 40 people.
“I've gotten so many calls already and people are coming in from other cities, so I think there might be more,” he said. “We hope that Russia-U.S. relations will improve under Trump and so we have to express our support.”

Is this thing on?
Why hello. After a long, long time away, I'm back for wall-to-wall coverage of the 2017 NWSL Draft, including on-site coverage, live from Los Angeles.
While I'm waiting until the official list of declared players comes out to release any type of public big board, I've calculated my Four Factors rankings for attackers for this past season. What are the Four Factors? Here's my description from an earlier year's rankings:
As anyone who follows me fervently knows, I'm always looking for new ways to quantify performance within college and pro WoSo. Branching out on last season's analysis before the NWSL Draft, I've gone a step further by creating a “Four Factors” metric designed to measure efficiency and potency of attacking players eligible for the draft. As a quick check against last year's draft class, the majority of players at the top of the rankings were drafted. So who's eligible to be tracked and what are the factors? Who's eligible? Any player who scored ten goals this season that were NOT penalties. The Factors: SPG – Shots per Goal – How many shots does it take for a player to score? SOG% – Shot on Goal Percentage – How many of the player's shots force a goalkeeper into action? 50 – Goals Scored Against RPI Top 50 Teams 100 – Goals Scored Against RPI Top 100 Teams Each player in an individual draft class is ranked against the other eligible players, with the top ranked player in a category receiving the most points. If there are ten eligible players and a player finishes at the top of the RPI Top 100 category, that player gets ten “points” in the rankings. In terms of the 50/100 categories, players who didn't score against RPI Top 50/100 clubs get zero points for that category. Points for all four of the ranking categories are added together to come up with a grand total.
While I've previously separated things out by class, this year, I've lumped everyone into the same data pool for the sake of my own calculations. Again, this isn't meant to be a perfect guide, as stat keeping for the efficiency stats is shaky at times for some schools.
I've attached an Excel data file here if you're interested in raw data.
Here are the basic rankings, with some notes for some interesting/notable findings (players ranked from worst to first):
34 – Ashley Herndon – James Madison – SR
Oof. Herndon comes in dead last on these rankings at probably the worst time possible thanks to not scoring against anyone with a pulse and some horrid efficiency numbers. She was a borderline draft prospect in my eyes going into 2016, but I'd probably opt out now.
39 – Chloe Williams – Eastern Washington – JR
56 – Alexis Pelefas – Central Michigan – SO
59 – Lauren Koehl – Illinois State – SR
59 – Margaret ‘Midge' Purce – Harvard – SR
Purce is likely to be taken in the first half of the draft this year, but she's still a very divisive prospect. The continued absence of production against top teams (even considering Harvard's scheduling constraints) and poor efficiency numbers are still alarming. She passes the eye test, but I'd still be sweating bullets if choosing her.
60 – Megan Greene – Charlotte – FR
62 – Natasha Minor – Southeast Missouri State – SR
66 – Lexi Prillaman – Richmond – JR
68 – Savannah LaRicci – McNeese State – JR
72 – Jill Mullholland – Hofstra – SR
75 – Jemma Purfield – South Alabama – SO
77 – Emily Gingrich – Saint Joseph's – SR
89 – Jessica Frey – Northern Kentucky – JR
90 – Carissima Cutrona – Buffalo – SO
101 – Maddie Clark – Mercer – SR
104 – Kela Gray – Howard – JR
116 – Hannah Rosenblatt – Northeastern – SO
116 – Jenna Hellstrom – Kent State – SO
119 – Maddie Gibson – Monmouth – FR
121 – Sarah Segan – William & Mary – FR
123 – Carol Rodrigues – UCF – SR
If you're an international forward on the bubble, you better be high up on this list if you're expecting to be drafted. Rodrigues isn't and probably will be headed for other shores to get paid.
124 – Aaliyah Lewis – Alabama State – SR
126 – Allie Thornton – SMU – FR
127 – Ashley Smith – Central Arkansas – SO
127 – Sarah Collins – Stetson – JR
128 – Murielle Tiernan – Virginia Tech – SR
Tiernan's probably done enough throughout her career to earn the benefit of the doubt for 2016, but her senior season probably didn't help her draft stock.
128 – Tabby Tindell – Florida Gulf Coast – SR
131 – Kiersten Johnson – Toledo – SR
137 – Isabella Habuda – Liberty – JR
138 – Holly Enderle – North Dakota State – SO
140 – MacKenzie Cowley – George Washington – SR
140 – Maddie Mulford – Bucknell – JR
140 – Sarah Bonney – Texas Rio Grande Valley – FR
143 – Dakota Mills – Saint Joseph's – SO
149 – Eleonora Goldoni – East Tennessee State – SO
151 – Molly Dwyer – Furman – JR
151 – Chandler Backes – Western Kentucky – FR
153 – Libby Leedom – Dayton – SR
153 – Kendall Ham – Bucknell – JR
153 – Laadi Issaka – Mississippi Valley State – JR
156 – Ariela Lewis – Alabama State – JR
160 – Rachelle Ross – Monmouth – JR
161 – Simone Kolander – Minnesota – SR
If you can stomach some middling efficiency numbers, Kolander could be worth a late flyer for attack minded teams thanks to a lot of goals against top teams.
164 – Michaela Abam – West Virginia – JR
Abam's a statistical unicorn. The WVU forward scored the most goals against RPI Top 50 teams this season and finished dead last in shots per goal and shots on target % among players with ten non-penalty goals. Will the former outweigh the latter come next year? We'll see.
164 – Brooke Murphy – New Hampshire – JR
165 – Alex Anthony – USC – JR
166 – Sophia Zavala – Southern – FR
Zavala's hilariously overcooked 79.3 shot on goal percentage is a reason we should probably teach better (and more accurate) scorekeeping and why you should take these stats with a slight degree of skepticism.
167 – Claire Oates – SMU – JR
167 – Valerie Sanderson – Memphis – SR
170 – Anna Smalley – Wisconsin-Milwaukee – JR
172 – Danica Evans – Colorado – SR
174 – Jane Cline – Appalachian State – SR
175 – Katie Johnson – USC – SR
USC's new hero after this past College Cup may not get the attention that many of her other likely draftees from the Trojans will see in the next few weeks, but she's also posted better numbers on this measure than many much more vaunted forwards in this draft class.
176 – Madison Tiernan – Rutgers – SR
Takes lots of shots, didn't really score a bunch until this season. Clearly has a nose for goal, but that efficiency mark could scare suitors off.
177 – Ifeoma Onumonu – Cal – SR
180 – Sarah Luebbert – Missouri – FR
181 – Savannah McCaskill – South Carolina – JR
A likely first round pick in 2018, McCaskill fits the profile of other players like Abam from the class, in that they're big threats against big teams but often need a lot of shots to hit the target.
181 – Ella Stevens – Duke – FR
185 – Abby Reed – SR – DePaul
187 – Casie Ramsier – SR – Auburn
Ramsier is not a natural forward, so those are some massive impressive numbers for someone likely to play in midfield at the next level.
187 – Lily Sender – SR – UNLV
Who? Sender was an unknown going into this season but destroyed defenses to give herself a puncher's chance of being drafted.
188 – McKenzie Meehan – SR – Boston College
Meehan's pretty solid everywhere but shots per goal, and didn't exactly set the world on fire as a senior with BC.
189 – Camille Bassett – SO – Central Arkansas
190 – Lauren Sullivan – SR – Creighton
193 – Frannie Crouse – JR – Penn State
193 – Stephanie Ribeiro – SR – UConn
Ribeiro outperformed teammate Rachel Hill in raw scoring numbers but took a backseat with more advanced numbers, though she's still mighty impressive.
195 – Jaycie Johnson – SR – Nebraska
Johnson's likely moving to full-back as a pro, but maybe she should also get a look at forward given these numbers.
195 – Danielle Tolmais – SR – Saint Louis
Crazy but true: Tolmais put these numbers up for SLU despite starting just one match in 2016.
198 – Hannah Wilkinson – SR – Tennessee
Wilkinson's got a ton of red flags attached to her, but she had a deceptively strong season for a mediocre UT team. Will it be enough to get an NWSL shot? I'm skeptical, but I'm also no longer totally averse to the idea.
199 – Gracie Lachowecki – SR – Miami (FL)
Lachowecki couldn't match last year's insane numbers, but she also showed she isn't a one-hit wonder. Watch for her as a big sleeper.
200 – Evelyne Viens – FR – South Florida
Viens was somehow not deemed worthy for a look at the U20 World Cup by Canada. And you wonder why they're youth international teams are chronically shambles.
207 – Lindsay Agnew – SR – Ohio State
Agnew finally came good as a senior, taking advantage of her talent to finally produce at a high level. She'll get a long look from NWSL clubs looking to capitalize on that late surge.
209 – Grace Damaska – SR – Georgetown
Considering Damaska's sharing the ball with a handful of other goal predators, her numbers are even more impressive.
214 – Savannah Jordan – SR – Florida
Fewer goals but still producing at an elite level. Drop her on your draft board at your peril.
218 – Alexis Kiehl – JR – Dayton
219 – Ashley Hatch – SR – BYU
Super impressive as a senior and almost unstoppable when on form. These numbers only reinforce the point.
224 – Jermaine Seoposenwe – SR – Samford
Probably a stretch to make an NWSL roster at this point, but Seoposenwe should be getting paid somewhere this year after a great senior season.
228 – Rachel Hill – SR – UConn
Hill may have taken a backseat to Stephanie Ribeiro on the scoring chart, but she was better than her teammate in every marker of these rankings.
242 – Hailey Skolmoski – SO – Utah
248 – Kristen Dodson – JR – Auburn
256 – Rachel Thun – JR – Tulsa
266 – Amanda Carolan – FR – Georgetown
288 – Lindsey Mayo – SR – Arkansas
I wasn't exactly expecting this either, but Mayo had the season of her life and should at least get a look at someone in the NWSL if she's interested.
294 – Jessie Fleming – FR – UCLA
Shock: The Canadian is really good.
295 – Michele Vasconcelos – SR – BYU
Vasconcelos' numbers are utterly absurd, especially considering she's not BYU's automatic first option. I suspect she won't be near the top of the board on draft day but looks like a great mid-round sleeper, nonetheless
No surprise: The biggest gainers in overall service jobs are the biggest metros. Greater New York tops the list with more than 381,098 projected new service-class jobs, followed by Los Angeles (249,810), Chicago (225,132), Houston (152,884), Atlanta (135,680), Philadelphia (131,241), Washington, D.C. (127,489), Dallas (125,620), Phoenix (116,437), and Minneapolis (112,892).
My colleague Charlotta Mellander of the Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) used the BLS projections to forecast service-class job growth across U.S. metros based on their current mix of jobs. The map below by Zara Matheson shows the geography of this growth.
More than 60 million American workers do this kind of low-wage service work. And by 2020, these jobs are projected to make up more than roughly half of all projected new jobs – 9.7 million, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics projections .
This week, I've been looking at where the jobs will be in America over the next decade. My last post looked at blue-collar jobs . Today I turn the fastest growing job category of all - low-skill service jobs.
But job growth is a function of population size; so the next map plots the projected percentage change in service-class jobs for U.S. metros.
Using this metric, two Texas metros – Brownsville (16.3 percent) and McAllen (16 percent) – top this list, followed by Mankato, Minnesota (15.8 percent), Duluth, Minnesota (15.8 percent), Goldsboro, North Caroline (15.7 percent), Rochester, Minnesota (15.7 percent), Pittsfield, Massachusetts (15.6 percent), Alexandria, Louisiana (15.2 percent), Waterbury, Connecticut (15 percent), and Johnstown, Pennsylvania (14.9 percent).
While no large metros (those with more than one million people) are among the leaders in percentage of service-class job growth, some are projected to do quite well. New York leads the pack with a projected service-class growth of 15.5 percent (ranking 29th out of all metros). It is followed by Hartford, Connecticut (14.3 percent), Rochester, New York (14.2 percent ), Camden, New Jersey (14.2 percent ), Milwaukee, Wisconsin (14.2 percent ), and Detroit, Michigan (14.2 percent).
President Barack Obama's current jobs strategy neglects service jobs in favor of manufacturing. That's a prescription for failure. A comprehensive jobs strategy must put service jobs and service workers front and center.
The key is to see service-class workers as sources of innovation, continuous improvement, and productivity gains. Research by my Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) team shows that engaging these workers' skills can simultaneously boost productivity and wages.
To do this, Americans may have to consider paying more for services. Henry Ford long ago argued that autoworkers should make enough money to afford the cars they made. As part of post-war social contract, which created a broad middle class, blue-collar jobs were elevated to good ones, and Americans collectively all paid a little more for manufactured products.
If we want to combat inequality, create millions of good jobs, and make it possible for millions more to enter the middle class, we must do the same for service workers today.
In my next post, I will look at the places where you are more likely to find a higher-skill, knowledge-based, creative class job in the future.
Lots of people have lots of memories of cheap apartments and cheap burrito dinners in the Mission of the 1990's. And while there have been eras of relative stability in San Francisco when it didn't feel like there was a well heeled horde of transplants vying for every last charming garden studio and every table at Tosca Café, there have been multiple times in SF's past when people from without were clamoring to get a foothold here, and driving up the price of everything in the process.
Being a relatively small city with specific geographic constraints and development patterns that has been historically prone to boom-and-bust cycles, one can trace SF's economic tensions and sky-high prices well beyond five or even fifteen years ago. At the risk of drawing the wrath of those who believe SF has long been more affordable than it is now  which, in some ways and in some neighborhoods like the Mission, it was in our recent history, at least if you go back 20 years  SFist is going to explore some facts and figures from the city's past, anecdotal and otherwise, that may offer a smidgeon of comfort to everyone who feels like they've arrived at the worst possible moment, when everything is more insanely expensive than it ever has been here. In truth, it has been both better and worse, due to many factors, not the least of which has been supply and demand.
The Gold Rush and the 19th Century
If you think land values and food prices are crazy in the city now, it's educational to glance back at the chaos of real estate and the scarcity of goods in the early years of San Francisco. The Smithsonian Magazine just published an excellent piece on this topic, finding written records of the ways that miners and other early arrivers to town were being gouged for the simplest food items like bread and eggs. There have been many accounts of eggs being sold for a dollar apiece, with a dozen eggs costing roughly $90 in today's dollars in 1849 SF. Canteens reportedly would charge a dollar for a slice of bread too, $2 if it was buttered, which would be $56 in today's terms. Edward Gould Buffum writes in Six Months in the Gold Mines (1850) of a breakfast for two consisting of bread, cheese, butter, sardines and two bottles of beer for which he was charged $43, the equivalent of a $1,200 restaurant bill today.
It's often been said that most of San Francisco's early millionaires were not the prospectors but the people who sold things to them, like German-Jewish immigrant Levi Strauss who figured out that everyone needed tough, rugged pants in the gold fields.
And when it came to real estate, prices were way more insane in the years just after the Gold Rush. As writer Bayard Taylor, who penned dispatches about the Gold Rush economy for the New York Tribune, tells it:
[One] citizen of San Francisco died insolvent to the amount of forty-one thousand dollars the previous autumn. His administrators were delayed in settling his affairs and his real estate advanced so rapidly in value meantime that after his debts were paid, his heirs had a yearly income of $40,000 [$1.2 million today]
That means his property alone sold for the equivalent of several million dollars, even though the man himself believed he died in great debt.
A recent history of Alamo Square on Hoodline describes the land-grabbing and real estate squabbles that were going on in the area between the 1860s and the 1890s, when Alamo Square Park would finally start to take shape, alluding to the high value of land in the period. And by 1897, millionaires were building mansions like this one by the park.
And does this sound familiar? The excerpt below is from a 1930's history book about the Gold Rush years.

1906, Post Earthquake and Fire
Yet again, as the city recovered from the 1906 earthquake and subsequent fire, those whose homes were luckily not completely burned down found that their landlords weren't going to let them back in from the refugee camps where they found themselves without paying higher rent  in some cases double.
As the San Francisco Call reported in July 1906, "These persons say they are not paupers; that they are earning as good wages as ever they did, but they are unable to pay the increased rent. As a result they resort to the camps."
The War and Post-War Years: 1940s and 1950s
Housing became much more expensive and harder to come by in the years during and after the Second World War, due to an abundance of job opportunities, and it's clear from census data that the city's population was largely middle and upper class. The population boomed in these years while the city was a lot less dense in terms of building heights and in-fill development than it is now, leading to high demand.
The population rose a staggering 22 percent between 1940 and 1950, from 634,536 to over 775,000  a level it would not reach again until the dot-com boom in 2000, following out-migration in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.
And the people of San Francisco in 1950 weren't poor, on average. The median family income for the city was almost $4,000, 21 percent higher than the national average. While only 8 percent were college educated at the time, 22 percent listed themselves as professionals, executives, or managers, while another 22 percent worked in clerical or administrative jobs.
Median rents in the city hovered at $41/mo in 1950, which is the equivalent of $405/mo today, but that was way above the national average, which was $260/mo in today's terms.
Writing in his San Francisco Book in 1948, longtime Chronicle columnist Herb Caen wrote of the booming city that its "two great problems" were "housing and traffic," (see the photo above from 1946) complaining of landlords gouging people for substandard housing. "Even a couple of rooms in a basement bring seventy-five dollars a month," he wrote.
Sound familiar?
And as for the newly built areas filled with shiny offices and such, he wrote, "the dyed-in-the-fog San Franciscan isn't at all sure he is happy about the newer sections of town."
1980's
Dips in the population, urban flight, and a decaying Edwardian housing stock  much of which was built between 1907 and 1910 and was in great disrepair by 1970, when areas like Alamo Square were extremely "low-rent" and dilapidated  may have made life cheaper for the hippies, but that all began to change by the early 1980s. It was then that you saw the preservation movement and savvy investors fixing up many of the Victorians into the multi-million-dollar properties they've become today.
Also, the industrial areas of SoMa, beginning to be redeveloped as Yerba Buena Gardens and the Moscone Center, started to become less desolate and more desirable as arts and living space. You can look no further than this photo caption from a recent exhibit about SoMa in the late 70s and early 80s by photographer Janet Delaney. It describes a couple of artists, Perry Lancaster and Jill Scott, who in 1981 are talking about the precariousness of their living situation on Langton Street.
First Dot-Com Boom: The Mission Changes The First (Or Second) Time
The Mission, as you likely know, was once an Irish and Italian neighborhood, and during and after World War II it gave way to a wave of Latino immigration from across Latin America, some of whom moved families here to become shipbuilders and others just to profit from the city's booming economy. The 1960's and 70's also saw a wave of immigration to the 'hood from El Salvador following political oppression in that country.
Local architect Joelle Colliard, who was arguably part of the "first wave" of gentrification in the Mission circa 1995, remembers the huge, 1500-square-foot, three-bedroom flat at 24th and York that she shared with two friends that cost them $1200 total. "We each paid $400. That was how the world used to turn," she says. That all ended with an ownership change and spurious owner move-in eviction during the boom in 2000, and the rent for that unit was allegedly hiked to over $3000.
Local nurse Jason Overcash remembers a huge studio facing Alamo Square going for $650/mo in 1995, which was $50 more than he could afford.
It should be noted that median household income in San Francisco more than doubled between 1990 and 2010, from $33,000 to $71,000.
I, myself, moved to the Bay Area from New York just as the last boom was winding down, in late 2000, with no savings and no parental support. An initially easy-to-get job led to my first layoff, funemployment, and learning the ropes of the unemployment insurance system, but luckily I was sharing a loft in Oakland where we'd had to build out all our own rooms, paying $700 a month to share one bathroom with three other people. I can recall around 2002 visiting a friend's Nob Hill studio that was going for $1,575 a month, and that felt well beyond reach.
I wouldn't decide to move into San Francisco until 2005, at which point I couldn't afford to live anywhere decent on my own, and tired of roommates I settled into a spiffed up SRO on Market Street that was being marketed to students at the Art Institute and elsewhere, where I paid $625 a month to share a bathroom with an entire hallway and live in less than 300 square feet. My neighbors were non-profit workers and artists, many of them pretty young. At the time, even that was an unheard-of deal.
Still, having visited New York regularly, the $9 cocktails you could get here were already going for $12 or $14 there, and people had lovely, rambling, big apartments in historic buildings for way less than anyone paid for the equivalent amount of space back east, so SF still felt a bit like a deal.
All that has changed, of course, and there are pretty much no more deals.
I know one person who managed to find a nice big room this year for $1500 in a four-bedroom place in the Castro, and I know that I also just saw a room being advertised in Corona Heights in a beautiful, remodeled four-bedroom, with a view, for $3350.
But, the point is, while we are in a crazy moment, it might feel less crazy soon, or in a few years. Maybe something terrible will happen and everyone will leave, and it'll be like 1967 again with tons of empty space to rent  but even then, a lot of those under-employed hippies lived in communes.
Looking at the long view, it has been crazy before, and it will be again. Because San Francisco is a place that people flock to, and want to be, and it's going to take more than just a big earthquake to change that.

MANHATTAN — New Yorkers could receive an alert whenever a new gun offender moves into their neighborhood if a bill being introduced in the City Council Thursday gets approved.
The bill would make the NYPD's gun offender registry available to the public in a searchable database where people could sign up to receive an email alert if a gun offender moved into their neighborhood in the hope of reducing the recent rise in shootings citywide.
Under the law, the gun offenders' name and street will be listed along with a recent photograph, a physical description, the date of the gun crime and sentencing information.
"It will make our communities more aware of who is in our neighborhood and what actions they have taken," said Queens Councilman Costa Constantinides, who is sponsoring the bill with Council members Ritchie Torres of The Bronx and Paul Vallone of Queens. "Part of public safety knows who is on the field."
Leah Gunn Barrett, executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, said providing the public with more information about gun offenders can only help bring attention to the issue.
"New Yorkers have a right to know," she said.
While overall crime in the city is down, shootings are on the rise. As of Aug. 10, there were 823 shooting victims, up from 736 this time last year, a 12 percent increase. Shooting incidents also rose 13 percent to 702 from 621 this time last year.
There were also 23 shootings this weekend, including two fatalities.
"This weekend was a really tragic weekend," Constantinides said. "The mayor and police commissioner have a plan to deal with this, but this is another tool in their tool box that can help."
Last week Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $12.7 million plan to use "violence interrupters" to thwart shootings before they take place in neighborhoods most plagued by gun violence.
At a Monday press conference, de Blasio said he was not taking the shootings "lightly," but added that compared to the city's historic crime numbers, "this is going to be one of the lowest years ever for shootings if we continue on this pace."
New York became the first city in 2006 to pass a gun registry law requiring people convicted of gun crimes to register and check in twice a year for four years with police. Other cities including Baltimore and Washington, D.C. have since followed.
Those convicted of felony gun crimes are more likely to be arrested and more likely to commit crimes that involve violence compared to other felons, according to city statistics. They are also four times as likely to be re-arrested for homicide.
But unlike the sex offender registry, the gun offender registry is currently only for internal use by the NYPD.
Legislation to make the gun registry public was also introduced last year but failed to gain Council approval amid concern about stigmatizing people with criminal convictions. The City Council recently introduced a law that would ban companies from asking job applicants about their criminal record.
Glenn Martin, a criminal justice reform advocate who is founder of JustLeadershipUSA, said he was disappointed to see the legislation being reintroduced.
"At a time when the country and New York is being much more thoughtful about crime and what does and doesn't work, you have policymakers placating the public with measures that have no evidence that they are effective," Martin said.
The stigma of being on a public gun offenders database would prevent those listed from getting jobs and housing, added Martin, a former vice president for the Fortune Society who also spent six years in New York State prison.
"If you want people to put down the guns you have to put something more valuable in their hands like hope and opportunity," said Martin. "What people need are jobs, employment, housing and treatment, not further stigmatization."
Constantinides said the bill has been tweaked so that the names of gun offenders would be removed from the public registry after four years.
"There is a rehabilitation piece here," he said. "If you leave that life behind we are not going to put this undue burden on the offender."
But Martin said that might be too little, too late.
"The best way to get people to commit more criminal activity," he said, "is to tell them they are no longer a part of society."
The Monster Project is the undertaking of a passionate collection of artists who share a common goal: to help children recognize the power of their own imaginations and to encourage them to pursue their creative potential!
We're Proud to be Featured by:
How does it work?
We simply invite elementary students to draw monsters. Once their creations have taken shape, we bring them to life in our own artistic styles. Then, when we deliver these new interpretations back to the students in person, they are able to see what their idea sparked in others.
Check out the full Monster Gallery!
Why do we do that?
With a decreasing emphasis on arts in schools, many children don't have the opportunity for creative exploration they deserve. That's a monstrous trend we would like to destroy. As artists ourselves, we understand how important that initial creative exposure is and how it can truly alter the shape of a child's future.
By collaborating with the students and finding inspiration from their imaginings, we hope to help them recognize the value of their ideas and make them feel excited about the potential of their own minds. Creativity comes in many forms, and we hope to encourage their exploration of their own unique perceptions of the world we share. And, while we're at it, we want to introduce to them the notion of art as a legitimate career path.
1. To Make a Monster Project Activity Book
The kids get SO excited when they receive their monsters. We can see them starting to see art in a whole new way! So let's leave them with something really awesome to make sure that creative spark keeps growing.
The book contains 40 magical pages full of monsters, drawing prompts, and other adventures, designed and illustrated by our incredibly talented professional Monster Project artists! With your help, we can give a full book to each kid involved in our project! Plus, this book will help us share our love of monsters with kids and adults all over the world that we couldn't otherwise reach! What a great thing.
2. To Help Us Expand to More Schools
In the past, we've paid for anything we need out of pocket! That means we've only been able to work with 2 schools: 1 in Austin and 1 in Dallas, where we have the volunteers and resources we need. But it's time to take this show on the road! We'll start by adding a school in New York City! It's up to you folks how many other schools we'll have the funds to reach!
3. To Make Professional Prints for the Kids
We'll be able to pay a professional print shop to print the kids' monsters for them! Our artists spend so much time making incredible artworks–let's do them justice with beautiful prints that these kids can treasure forever.
4. To Start an Online Monster Project Store
We'll open an online store so we can keep funding the project beyond this Kickstarter! We'll start with t-shirts, stickers, and our monster activity books.
Stretch Goals (if we exceed our goal!):
LOOK! A BRAND-NEW AWARD!

This guest post is by Ali Luke, from The Creativity Toolbox.
How creative are you? A lot of bloggers feel that they're not very creative people. Perhaps they come from a technical background. Perhaps they've never picked up a paintbrush in their life, and think that means they're not creative. Perhaps they see creativity as something for other people.
The truth is, if you're blogging—or even planning a blog—then you're already much more creative than a lot of folks.
As a blogger, you're not just creating content (though that's the biggest area where you'll be exercising your creative muscles).
Right from the start, you're also creating:
the brand for your blog
your business plan and blogging strategy.
And if you're bootstrapping your blog (almost all of us are, when we start out), you may well be creating:
your logo and site header
the look and feel of your blog (the fonts and colors you choose, for instance).
If you're a little further along with blogging, you'll be looking at creating extras like:
a regular email newsletter
ebooks
audio programs
physical books
membership content.
All that involves a lot of focused thinking, hard work, and a few sparks of inspiration.
Why creativity is so important for bloggers
When you visit a new blog, what encourages you to stick around? I'd guess it's the quality of the content and the overall design.
If the posts are original and well-written, the blog looks good, and the topics fit together, then you'll probably read on.
But if the posts comprise scrappy content, or long quotes from other people's blogs, you'll be gone within seconds. If the blog's design looks like something from 1995, you probably won't stay long. And if there's no sense of cohesion—no plan or brand—then even if the content is good, you'll probably not want to read yet another post about that cute thing the blogger's cat did.
Your blog will succeed or fail on the strength of your creativity.
Blogs start to fail when bloggers:
get burnt out and carry on posting substandard content out of a sense of obligation
get tired and just post links to other people's content
get bored and stop posting for weeks on end.
You don't have to be wacky and weird in your creativity. It's fine if your style is quite straight-laced, or casual and laid back, rather than humorous. You don't have to have a complex metaphor or a really neat hook for every single post.
But you do need to create. Which means crafting your blog posts, not dashing them off. It takes energy, focus and dedication.
How to be creative—all the time
A lot of the folks I talk to seem a bit scared of creativity. They're convinced that it's something mystical or magical, like a bolt of lightning from the heavens.
The reality is that we're all naturally creative. Not convinced? Think about your dreams: we're all capable of making up wonderful stories and vivid pictures in our minds.
It's important, though, to nurture your creativity—especially as you go further and further with your blogging. You might well feel hugely excited and motivated when you're getting started with your blog, only to gradually lose that sense of inspiration and run out of steam. There's nothing wrong with you—you just haven't been focused on keeping your creativity bubbling away.
Write on topics you care about
This is crucial for me, and for many of the bloggers I talk to. You'll find it tough to write consistently on a topic which bores you.
Sure, celebrity blogs might be big business. But if you couldn't care less who's sleeping with whom, then you're better off writing about something else. Comic books, fine art, food, personal finance—whatever interests you.
If you've got a blog on a topic in which you've lost interest, see if you can find a particular angle that gives you a way back in. Maybe you're fed up with writing about the technical specifications of the latest gadgets, but you could easily create a series on the innovative use of technology in the developing world.
Keeping learning more
Whenever I go to a conference, like BlogWorld, I come back with a bunch of ideas. There's something invigorating about learning new things—and it often gets me back into a creative mood if I've been in a bit of a rut.
Of course, you don't need to go to conferences to learn (though if you can make it to South by South West or BlogWorld, they're well worth the investment). There's a huge amount of learning material available for bloggers, including:
I'd suggest setting aside one hour, twice a week, just for learning. That might mean listening to an audio program, reading a section of an ebook, or browsing through blog archives. Use a notebook or blank document on your computer to jot down your thoughts.
Write down all your ideas
Ever had a great idea when you were out walking, on the bus, or watching TV?
Often, ideas don't crop up when you're at your computer. They're sparked off by something which you see or do, and they pop into your head at the oddest moments.
It's so easy for those ideas to slip away, or to end up half-remembered. If you've got a notebook in your bag, you can just scribble them down—you may even find yourself outlining a whole blog post or an entirely new strategy.
In fact, any time that you're fleshing out an idea, try writing it down. It's often easier to think things through when you start to put them into a physical form, rather than trying to hold everything in your head.
Don't force yourself to create
Some days, you don't want to sit down at the computer and write. But you drag yourself there anyway. You open up a document and stare at it for a bit. You resist the urge to check email, or play on Twitter.
You make yourself write.
You think you're doing the right thing—after all, isn't this what all the productivity experts would advise?
So after a couple of miserable hours, when you've finally managed a half-hearted post, you shove it onto your blog and go and do something fun.
You don't get as many comments as usual. You don't get retweets or links. And the next day, you feel even more fed up. But you sit down to write anyway…
I'm hoping you can see why this is a mistake. Creativity isn't something you can force. Sure, you can probably apply a bit of self-discipline when you need to get the dishes done or clear your emails—but writing blog posts takes energy, and a certain amount of enthusiasm.
A number of the bloggers I talked to at BlogWorld said that they'd rather not write a post at all if they're really not inspired—and I agree with them.
Don't force yourself to create. Give yourself a regular time and place to write, but if you're really not in the mood, take a break and do something else instead.
When you need inspiration
Sometimes, you're keen to write, but you're just not sure where to start. You want to write a blog post, or come up with an ebook outline, or get a brilliant headline for your latest piece—but that creative spark needs lighting first.
Here are four easy ways to find that inspiration.
Start with an image
If you use images for your posts, you probably write the post first and choose the image afterwards, right?
When you're stuck, head over to Flickr, looking for a great image, then write the post to go with it.
As soon as you start looking at an image, your brain will begin to make connections and see possibilities. The picture you choose doesn't have to have any obvious relationship to your blog's niche—in fact, a seemingly-unconnected image will usually work best for sparking your creativity.
Brainstorm on paper
Staring at a blank Word document or the text box in WordPress?
Grab a piece of paper and a pen, and start jotting down ideas. If you've no clue where to begin, write down your blog's name or topic in the center, or use your list of categories.
Don't judge your ideas at this stage—write them all down, however unoriginal or boring they might seem. You'll find that the ideas start flowing after a few minutes, and often a weak idea can lead to a great one.
Read news articles in your area
This works better for some niches than others, but often a news report can bring you a new idea. If you're writing about health and fitness, you might look into some of the latest scientific research. If you cover techy topics, there'll always be something new to write about.
Even evergreen content can be inspired by a news article. A report on average happiness levels, for instance, could lead to a thoughtful post on why we're less happy today than in the past—despite generally having a better quality of life than people living 50 years ago.
Do something else entirely
When you're waiting for an idea to develop, try getting away from your computer. Go for a walk, take a shower, tidy your office—anything that doesn't require much mental effort. The thoughts you've been playing around with will continue to develop, and you'll often find that a great idea comes effortlessly into your mind.
Just don't forget your notebook so you can write it down…

We play-tested and ran through a 4-hour session of the Pariah Missouri campaign sourcebook RPG this weekend at Strategicon Gateway 2014 in Los Angeles.
It went off without a hitch. We had a full crew of players and everyone had a blast. Players played the main characters in the graphic novel series, Hiram Buchanan, a foppish cheat and spy, Toro, the Mexican-Comanche bountyhunter, Jean LaFitte a creole from New Orleans and a new character Obediah, an old coot and former Texas Ranger, or so he says. Lot's of great role-playing!
I included some props to make is a little more authentic, including some old money, poker chips and civil war playing cards, and included a replica of a 1960 Army Colt revolver, for those more dramatic moments.
We used the Savage Worlds game rules and it worked seamlessly. This world feels built for Savage Worlds!
If you are interested in getting yourself a copy of the graphic novels, or the RPG Sourcebook please visit

Also if you have a recommendation to demo at an event or store in the SoCal area, please let me know.
The next Demo will be Saturday Sept 6 2:30pm at Game Empire in Pasadena
A collection of LESS mixins and variables for writing better CSS from @mdo .
Introducing Preboot Preboot is a comprehensive and flexible collection of Fewer utilities. Its original variables and mixins became the precursor to Bootstrap. Since then, it's all come full circle. After a two-year hiatus, Preboot has been reborn with many of the LESS variable and mixin improvements from Bootstrap, along with some new enhancements, too. It's one of the lightest and most powerful tools for CSS development without any prebuilt components. Need something more powerful? Use Bootstrap. Download Preboot 2 GitHub project
Variables Variables still don't exist in CSS, but they do in LESS and other CSS preprocessors. Preboot includes a several group of meaningful and useful variables for any project. Colors Easily make use of two color schemes included in Preboot: grayscale and semantic. Grayscale colors provide quick access to shades of black (in increments of 10%) while semantic includes various colors assigned to meaningful values. 1 @black-10 : darken ( #fff , 10 %) ; 2 @black-20 : darken ( #fff , 20 %) ; 3 @black-30 : darken ( #fff , 30 %) ; 4 @black-40 : darken ( #fff , 40 %) ; 5 @black-50 : darken ( #fff , 50 %) ; 6 @black-60 : darken ( #fff , 60 %) ; 7 @black-70 : darken ( #fff , 70 %) ; 8 @black-80 : darken ( #fff , 80 %) ; 9 @black-90 : darken ( #fff , 90 %) ; 1 @brand-primary : #428bca ; 2 @brand-success : #5cb85c ; 3 @brand-warning : #f0ad4e ; 4 @brand-danger : #d9534f ; 5 @brand-info : #5bc0de ; Use any of these color variables as they are or reassign them to more meaningful variables for your project. 1 // Use as-is 2 .masthead { 3 ... 4 background-color : @ brand - primary ; 5 ... 6 } 7 8 // Reassigned variables in LESS 9 @alert-message-background : @brand-info ; 10 .alert { 11 background-color : @alert-message-background ; 12 } Scaffolding A handful of variables for quickly customizing key elements of your site's skeleton. 1 // Scaffolding 2 @body-background : #fff ; 3 @text-color : @black-50 ; Easily style your links with the right color with only one value. 1 // Variables 2 @link-color : @brand-primary ; 3 @link-color-hover : darken ( @link-color , 15 %) ; 4 5 // Usage 6 a { 7 color : @link-color ; 8 text-decoration : none ; 9 10 & :hover { 11 color : @ link - color - hover ; 12 text-decoration : underline ; 13 } 14 } Note that the @link-color-hover uses a function, another awesome tool from LESS, to automagically create the right hover color. You can use darken , lighten , saturate , and desaturate . Typography Easily set your type face, text size, leading, and more with a few quick variables. Preboot makes use of these as well to provide easy typographic mixins as well. 1 // Typography 2 3 // Font stacks for easy inclusion and customization 4 @font-family-sans-serif : "Helvetica Neue" , Helvetica , Arial , sans-serif ; 5 @font-family-serif : Georgia , "Times New Roman" , Times , serif ; 6 @font-family-monospace : Monaco , Menlo , Consolas , "Courier New" , monospace ; 7 @font-family-base : @font-family-sans-serif ; 8 9 // Generate a straightforward type scale 10 @font-size-base : 14px ; 11 @font-size-large : @font-size-base * 1 .25 ; // ~ 18px 12 @font-size-small : @font-size-base * 0 .85 ; // ~ 12px 13 @font-size-mini : @font-size-base * 0 .75 ; // ~ 11px 14 15 // Baseline for the line-height of the body 16 // To be used in conjunction with @font-size-base 17 @line-height-base : 20px ; 18 19 // Enable the option to customize headings 20 @headings-font-family : inherit ; // From @font-family-base 21 @headings-font-weight : 500 ;
Grid system Generate semantic, mobile-first grid layouts with a few variables and mixins, all without superfluous markup. Grid variables There are three grid variables that Preboot uses to power the grid mixins. 1 // Specify the number of available columns 2 @grid-columns : 12 ; 3 // Inner padding on each side of a column to create gutters 4 @grid-column-padding : 15px ; 5 // Point at which the floats kick in and horizontally align columns 6 @grid-float-breakpoint : 768px ; Customizing these variables should automatically work with any of the grid mixins, so tweak away. Grid mixins There are three available mixins for each part of a standard grid system: .make-row() provides a wrapper for the columns to align their content via negative margin and clear the floats.
provides a wrapper for the columns to align their content via negative margin and clear the floats. .make-column(n) is used to generate n number columns as a percentage of the available grid columns (set via variable to 12 by default).
is used to generate n number columns as a percentage of the available grid columns (set via variable to 12 by default). .make-column-offset(n) pushes a column right by n columns via margin . Heads up! These grid columns are mobile first, meaning by default they stack vertically. Floating only kicks in with viewports of 768px or higher. 1 .make-row () { 2 // Negative margin the row out to align the content of columns 3 margin-left : -@ grid - column - padding ; 4 margin-right : -@ grid - column - padding ; 5 // Then clear the floated columns 6 . clearfix (); 7 } 8 9 .make-column ( @columns ) { 10 @media ( min-width : @grid-float-breakpoint ) { 11 floats : left ; 12 // Calculate width based on number of columns available 13 width : percentage ( @columns / @grid-columns ) ; 14 } 15 // Prevent columns from collapsing when empty 16 min-height : 1px ; 17 // Set inner padding as gutters instead of margin 18 padding-left : @grid-column-padding ; 19 padding-right : @grid-column-padding ; 20 // Proper box-model ( padding doesn 't add to width ) 21 .box-sizing ( border-box ); 22 } 23 24 .make-column-offset ( @columns ) { 25 @media ( min-width : @grid-float-breakpoint ) { 26 margin-left : percentage ( @columns / @grid-columns ) ; 27 } 28 } Example usage Using these mixins to generate columns is easy. Here's the HTML and CSS of an example implementation. 1 <div class= "wrapper" > 2 <div class= "content-main" > 3 ... 4 </div> 5 <div class= "content-sidebar" > 6 ... 7 </div> 8 </div> 1 .wrapper { 2 . make - row (); 3 } 4 .content-main { 5 . make - column ( 8 ); 6 } 7 .content-sidebar { 8 . make - column ( 3 ); 9 . make - column - offset ( 1 ); 10 } Need another example? Our table of contents at the top of the page uses a custom grid as well. In the source docs.less file you'll find its super lightweight implementation: 1 .row { . make - row (); } 2 .grid-4 { . make - column ( 4 ); } That's it.

April 8, 2010. A watershed date for football. Not because Roy Hodgson's Fulham battered Wolfsburg to book themselves a place in the Europa League semi-finals and certainly not because Roberto Martinez was charged with improper conduct, but because Javier Hernandez signed for Manchester United.
Even now, harking back through the archives of the internet, most major news outlet covered that story the same way. With eyebrows raised and heads scratched. A huge club dropping big money on a complete unknown? They must be mad, surely.
Even the comment sections of these articles, so often a fountain of insight, opinion, and thinly veiled social prejudice, followed the same tone.
“Doesn't look like he'll cope with the physicality of the prem” commented MickeyT on the Mail Online. “Never heard of him. why r UTD signing him when we need to get David Villa” mused Geniestra on 606. “HAHA he looks like Sigourney Weaver” noted TheGreatOne07 on GuardianSport.
What's so special about any of this? It was the last time that a major English club plucked a first-
team player from total obscurity, and fans en masse happily admitted that they had no idea who he was.
Nobody pretended to be an expert on Liga MX, nobody dropped in his goal record for the Mexican Under 21s. This fine nations' footballing public were united and revelling in their own ignorance.
Fast forward to January of this year, when Real Madrid plucked 16 year old Martin Odegaard frommidtable Norwegian side Strømsgodset. Within hours of the deal being announced he was the number one trending topic on Twitter, a dozen ‘best skills and tricks' videos found their way onto YouTube, and think pieces about both his ability and potential flooded every footballing website.
Strømsgodset's average attendance is somewhere in the region of 6,000 people, I'm sure the club were fascinated to discover that most of them are apparently British journalists and bloggers.
In the last five years, it's all changed. You are not allowed to not know about a player now and it doesn't matter whether you're a professional or a punter.
How we all got from cave drawings of South American wonderkids to the dawn of football's Age of Enlightenment is open to debate. Some will tell you that popularity of games like Football Manager, with its comprehensive database and unrivalled look into the future of player development, has turned us all from armchair pundits to armchair scouts. They might be right, but the catalyst of this thirst for knowing was, of all people, Alan Shearer.
A few months after the aforementioned Hernandez transfer, Newcastle's latest acquisition Hatem Ben Arfa scored an eye-catching winner against Everton. That evening on Match of the Day, Alan Shearer sat legs akimbo in his chair, rolled out all the usual stock phrases, and shrugged his shoulders. “Nobody really knows much about him”, he muttered. Within moments, the internet was ablaze.
The show's producers will have known immediately that this was an awful segment, but they still probably only expected a few snide remarks in the canteen and, at worst, a strongly worded letter on Points of View. Instead they opened their curtains the next morning to a mob of furious bloggers and tweeters calling the show out on its irrelevance. Stan Collymore – presumably a Marseille season ticket holder – was incredulous at Shearer's lack of knowledge and led the charge in calling the show's pundits “dinosaurs”. It's almost as if Big Al hadn't snapped Ben Arfa up on Football Manager 2008 and watched him develop into one of the game's best AMRs. After all, the rest of us did.
Five years later, the BBC have just about managed to scrape Shearer's brains off the studio walls and the show now aims to be a lot more cerebral in its approach. Treading the line somewhere between a Carlsberg advert of three blokes in a pub, and a zonalmarking.net chalkboard – admittedly with mixed results.
Where the UK's flagship football show leads, the rest of us naturally follow, and this state of never being caught out over a player has gradually crept its way into modern parlance. If Robbie Savage is going to claim to have seen Lazar Marković during his Benfica days, then so will your mate Tony once he gets a pint in his hand.
You must know about absolutely everyone, or else you risk being cast out of the conversation completely. Even right now, as you're reading this article, Alan Hansen is sat at home pricing a new golfing glove because he didn't know Santi Cazorla would be just as effective as a deep playmaker as he would a right winger. Either he never bought him on FIFA Ultimate Team or he wasn't illegally streaming mid-table La Liga clashes.
Few will miss him, of course. Hansen knew nothing of the Championship's most underrated strikers and looked like he was going to be sick the first time he had to pronounce César Azpilicueta, but he could talk for hours about how to organise a defence. He might have known about very little, but he certainty knew a lot about it. Now the necessity is to know about a lot, no matter how little it is you know.
John Naisbitt, one of the world's foremost thinkers on Future Studies (which I presume involves robots and hoverboards), is quoted as saying “we are drowning in information but starved for knowledge”. While he probably wasn't talking about people who claim to be avid watchers of the Eredivise every time an Ajax player moves to England, his words so neatly surmise this tedious era of football fandom.
Whether you're being paid to have an opinion or you're just batting around transfer rumours with your mates, sometimes it's ok to admit you don't know anything. I promise, a pleasant surprise is twice as rewarding as saying “I told you so”. Just ask those Man United fans who saw their otherwise unheard of new Mexican score on his debut at Wembley.
You can follow Adam Clery on Twitter and tell him that *everyone* knew about Javier Hernandez and that if he doesn't like it he can f**k off and watch the rugby (@adamclery)

Captain Hayato Sakamoto erupted for four hits and five RBIs as the Yomiuri Giants blew out the Seibu Lions 11-1 to start the interleague games Tuesday.
Tomoyuki Sugano (6-4) was two outs away from throwing his second straight shutout, but an error by center fielder Takanori Suzuki scored the lone run for Seibu at Koriyama Kaiseizan Stadium.
Sakamoto's two-run home run in the third inning, only his third of the season, off Ken Togame (4-2) put the Giants up 3-0. The shortstop drove in two more runs in the sixth with a two-out single and another run the following inning.
Masayoshi Chono and Shinnosuke Abe also hit two-run homers for the Giants, who won their fourth in a row to move within a game of the first-place Yokohama BayStars in the Central League.
“It worked out well tonight,” said Sakamoto, who is still batting .252 for the year. “I hadn't been hitting much up until now. These last few games, I've had a pretty good feel for the bat. I hope I can keep this up.”
Sugano struck out nine and scattered seven hits over the distance, without giving up an earned run in the 122-pitch effort. He had just thrown his first career shutout a week ago.
“I thought I pitched well but it's a shame I lost the shutout at the end,” the nephew of manager Tatsunori Hara said. “It was preoccupying my mind because I did want to get it done.
“I hope I can throw a shutout at Tokyo Dome next time.”
Carp 7, Marines 4
At Hiroshima Prefecture's Shimanami Stadium, Yoshihiro Maru's eighth-inning grand slam lifted Hiroshima over Chiba Lotte.
Carp starter Kenta Maeda improved to 4-4, striking out eight and allowing one earned run in seven innings.
Fighters 12, Swallows 5
At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, Sho Nakata hit a three-run homer, his 17th of the year, and had five RBIs in Hokkaido Nippon Ham's 17-hit rout of Tokyo Yakult.
Tigers 3, Eagles 0
At Koshien Stadium, Minoru Iwata (4-2) threw his first shutout in four years, holding Tohoku Rakuten to three hits and striking out 10.
Mauro Gomez's two-run shot gave the Times some breathing room in the fifth.
Buffaloes 10, BayStars 3
At Yokohama Stadium, Francisco Caraballo opened the scoring with a sacrifice fly in the first before homering in consecutive at-bats to lift Orix over Yokohama.
Dragons 4, Hawks 3
At Nagoya Dome, Hector Lune's two-run single in the third and a solo home run by Anderson Hernandez in the fourth helped Chunichi snap its three-game losing streak against Fukuoka Softbank's Kenji Otonari (4-4), who struggled with location.
A 21-YEAR-OLD Tanzanian student has lodged a police complaint accusing a mob of stripping her and forcing her to walk “without her top” on the street in Bengaluru on the night of January 31.

The alleged incident took place following a road accident earlier in the day, when a car driven by a Sudanese medical student hit a local resident, 35-year-old Sabeen Taj, who died in the accident, while her husband Sanuallah sustained injuries.
According to the woman's complaint, a mob gathered that night and set on fire the Sudanese student's car, as well as a car in which the Tanzanian student was travelling. While the Tanzanian student had not made allegations of being stripped by the mob in the complaint filed on Sunday, she did so on Wednesday, when police summoned her following media reports of the alleged incident. She alleged in her statement that “her top was removed” by the mob, police said.

Reacting to the “shameful” incident, External Affairs Minister Sushma said that she has asked Karnataka Chief Minister S Siddaramaiah to take “stringent” action against the guilty.

Swaraj said that Siddaramaiah had informed her that a criminal case has been registered and four accused arrested. Local police said they had arrested the Sudanese student, 20-year-old Mohammed Ahad, in connection with the accident and six others for torching the two cars of the African students.

It is learnt that the High Commission of Tanzania has sent a Note Verbale to the Ministry of External Affairs about the reported attack, requesting it to take necessary legal action against the guilty.
Sources said the Joint Secretary in MEA's East and Southern Africa Division, Tanmaya Lal, spoke to the High Commissioner of Tanzania, John Tigazi, and expressed regret over the “unfortunate” incident.
Later, Swaraj tweeted, “We are deeply pained over the shameful incident with a Tanzanian girl in Bengaluru…I have asked the Chief Minister to ensure safety and security of all foreign students and stringent punishment for the guilty.”
When contacted, Bengaluru's Deputy Commissioner of Police (north division) T R Suresh said, “We were shocked by media reports on Wednesday and we summoned the woman to know what exactly happened. She appeared before the Soladevanahalli police and gave a new statement, saying she was stripped by a mob. We have added suitable sections of the IPC to the FIR that was registered earlier based on the complaint that her car was set on fire. We need to investigate further.”
The incident took place at Ganapathinagar in north Bengaluru, where a number of African students live and study at local colleges.
Following the incident, the Tanzanian woman, a student of Acharya College in Soladevanahalli, informed an association of African students that she was stripped and forced to walk half-naked in public by the mob. She also alleged that a police constable present at the scene remained a mute spectator.
Bosco Kaweesi, a legal adviser to the African Students Union (AASU), said the Tanzanian woman was not linked in any way to the road accident involving the Sudanese student.
“The victim and her friends were travelling in their car 30 minutes after the accident and the mob targeted them randomly. She was stripped and made to run to hide. She attempted to board a bus, but passengers pushed her away. Later, she tried to hire an autorickshaw but the driver refused,” he said.
Kaweesi said he called and informed the police inspector at Soladevanahalli police station about the incident on Sunday night, but was asked to contact the control room instead.
A group of students who went to complain at the police station about the alleged stripping was asked by officers to produce the student involved in the fatal accident, even though the Sudanese national was already in their custody, Kaweesi alleged.

A few months ago, in Kothanur region of north Bengaluru, locals ganged up to beat four students from the Ivory Coast following complaints about frequent late night parties. The police had arrested nine people in the case.
This morning, Apple pulled a number of games that featured the Confederate (or rebel) flag from its App Store.
From what we know, most of if not all of the games affected by this decision from Apple were historical strategy games set during the American Civil War.
The news first got around due to a tweet from development studio Game-Labs regarding its game Ultimate General: Gettysburg. It reads: "Apple has pulled the tablet version of the game from Appstore because of the Confederate Flag."
Finding this out, we then looked around for signs of other games that could be in the firing line of this decision. As it were, a number of HexWar Games's strategy games were missing - those that are set during the American Civil War.
We were able to catch up with HexWar Games's Andrew Mulholland who gave us the full details on what happened here.
This morning, HexWar received a load of notifications saying that some of its games had been suddenly pulled from sale.
There was a note from Apple which read: "We are writing to notify you that your app has been removed from the App Store because it includes images of the confederate flag used in offensive and mean-spirited ways."
The total number of games affected by this is four for HexWar Games. Plus, all of the different versions of them, such as the Lite and Gold versions.
"It seems disappointing that they would remove the games as they weren't being used in an offensive way, being that they were historical war games and hence it was the flag used at the time," Mulholland told us.
At the moment, HexWar Games is working to get the games that have been pulled by Apple back on the App Store. The hope is that changing the flag will be enough.
"We're going to use the Confederate flag from 1861 and 1862. The one that's considered offensive wasn't introduced until late 1862," Mulholland explained.
The flag that HexWar Games will replace the offending flag with is this one:
"Hopefully they'll accept the changes, but it will have to go back through the review process again - so who knows."
If you're unaware, the reason for Apple's sudden distaste for the Confederate flag is due to a renewed debate over its symbolism in America.
So far, Amazon, Etsy , Walmart, eBay, and Sears are ceasing the selling of the Confederate flag. There have been appeals to other companies to make similar actions.
Apple has presumably seen this and decided to remove any imagery of the flag from its App Store where possible. Hence these games have been targeted.
"We're in no way sympathetic to the use of the flag in an offensive way, we used it purely because historically that was the flag that was used at the time," Mulholland said.
For now these strategy games remain unavailable on the App Store. They may reappear soon but will not contain the Confederate flag.
Spookyspace is strange and scary, especially when it comes to piloting a capital. Being one of just three in your fleet, you can't expect to sit and soak up triage reps all day; you need to hold your own and bolster the main T3 fleet, bringing home the win. After just three passes by any capital ship though, that connection is going to collapse and seal you in with your foe. Taking caps to a fight means going balls-deep (or bhaals-deep in this meta!), cutting yourselves off from home and putting your fleet's SP on the line. For that reason you definitely want to put a lot of thought into your fit. It's no poors allowed in this place.
Being able to hold your own is vital
Rather than going into detail on every cap specifically, this article is going to take an experimental look at some of the changes and general fittings that we might see used in wormhole space in particular. Being able to hold your own is vital, so this article will focus more on that, without those silly remote cap transfers or remote reps.
Capacitor Tanking
Previously, the only thing that would typically be used was a large buffer of cap and tank. In conjunction with a (literal) boatload of hot-swappable mods, you would manipulate them and stay at your peak regen; a great example of how that was done can be seen here. With the recent Citadel release, CCP all but took this away from us by stopping any such refitting with a weapons timer. This change means that our initial fits are going to be much more important when going into a fight and you'll have a lot more to consider. A blap dread is no longer going to tank the world after a refit off the Nestor.
Depending on your ship of choice though, this style of play may still be possible without refitting. Take the Apostle, for example, as your solo triage. It comes with a built-in 5% bonus to cap pool per level. Slap some cap batteries, semiconductors, and decent implants on that and you're looking at a pool of 400k GJ capacitor capacity. Have a look at this Apostle with five X-Type fit Bhaalgorns on it:
Eight and a half minutes of constant neuting is a hell of a lot, especially considering that in my example the Bhaalgorns are using some of the best neuts money can buy. In an actual fight you would have your own Bhaals counterneuting them, reducing their effectiveness and letting you last even longer. You can, of course, push it up higher with faction cap batteries or by dropping that sebo, but this is something a little more balanced and perhaps realistic.
Cap Boosters Gone Wild
So another big change is the introduction of extra-large 3200 GJ cap booster charges which injects about half a Battleship worth of cap into you on every cycle. It may not be much compared to the 400k cap of an Apostle, but over the 72 seconds that a cap booster cycles for, you can gain back about a quarter of a Naglfar's cap, give or take.
Taking this further, the Lif has a +10% per level bonus to cap booster amount. From that you end up with a module that's essentially giving you +351 GJ of capacitor per second; easily enough to run either your local or remote tank and unmatched by any other module at any size. To take an example, you could run a Lif a little like this:
As with any fit, there are different ways you can play it out. This one is focusing on cap resistance and RR augmentor rigs to really conserve your cap boosters. If you were to go into a brawl with a DST or similar, then there is certainly room for a powerful dual cap booster fit that would be incredibly difficult to break. This is of course based on cargohold size. As with solo PvP Marauders, a fit like this would fall flat on its face once it runs out of cap charges. By bringing say an Impel with 90% resists, it could happily sit on grid with a store of 800 more Navy 3200's in the fleet hangar; enough to tank for 90 minutes on two injectors.
I can see capacitor tanks being treated quite similarly to any other tank soon with these new capacitor resistance mechanics. It may be more about boosting your cap up and holding onto those precious gigajoules against neuts. Being able to protect your life juice from Bhaalgorns is vital and maybe CCP will consider the introduction of capacitor resistance rigs to help encourage this kind of “tanking”.
Going Capless?
An interesting option might be to go for entirely capless capitals; a dread that doesn't require any capacitor whatsoever. How would you do this does you ask? Ancillary shield boosters.
Yes, it's a bit of a niche fit, but it might have a place amongst the neuts you see thrown around nowadays. Based on the 1.81m EHP buffer gained per 60 second reload, you're looking at tanking a maximum of 30k dps before you start bleeding armour on your cycles. 30k isn't a huge amount but against just a couple of dreads plus a fleet it might just be enough. You're also pretty much going to perma-tank like this. Even leaving space for ammo, you have enough cargo for 110 (+18 in the injectors themselves) Navy Cap Booster 3200's. That's enough to run your tank for 14 minutes, not to mention the possibility of having a DST to top your supply up.
The main benefit here is that it makes trying to cap you out completely pointless and if you're lucky you'll serve as a nice neut primary until they realise what's actually going on. The same thing can technically be done with a shield extender fit in a Pulsar or a plated fit in a Wolf-Rayet. Having about six million EHP is enough to survive your siege cycle, and some, but has complete reliance on your triage pilot to get you back up again for round two. Maybe that could work, maybe it's only for home defence, maybe that will be the cookie cutter fit going forwards.
Forging our own Paths
In the end, everything really is still up in the air. Nobody knows which way the meta will pan out and it certainly won't be going backwards any time soon. I'm glad we have all these options open to us though; a deviation from cookie cutter is usually a good thing and the game will benefit from it. I'll look at publishing an update once we start seeing brawls happening, but until then… we always have Pyfa and a nice cup of tea for the evening.

The original promise of Litecoin, and the reason that it originally held such prominence, was that it would remain decentralized. With the introduction of scrypt ASICs it essentially no longer serves this purpose while Vertcoin does.

Basically this, Verticoin appears to be the most resistant by far to ASICs of the current crop of alt coins. Basically this, Verticoin appears to be the most resistant by far to ASICs of the current crop of alt coins.

How this coin would appeal to non-miners over other coins?
vertcoin seems to appeal to miners more than the market. Vert mining may increase as more asics start showing up, but more vert doesn't mean anybody's buying it.

Also, the VTC wallet (on Windows at least) supports the vertcoin: protocol for accepting http requests from QR Code scanners.
So you can display a QR Code on your website, customer scans the qr code & the vertcoin wallet opens to confirm & authorise the request.
How many other alt-coins have implemented this?
I believe BTC, LTC, DOGE, VTC has this functionality... If you know of others, let me know.

YAC was the first scrypt/cha-cha coin with increasing N factor so it is definitely one to watch when scrypt asics come out.
There are another two big N factor increases scheduled for this year.
Yacoin is also also heavily undervalued right now so this is a golden opportunity for speculators to come in and buy YAC by the truckload for very cheap.

YAC has been largely forgotten in the excitement of the other new coins but it will deliver.
The fact that many investors have forgotten about YAC means that ASIC resistance has not yet been priced in giving huge potential for gains.

-updated 3rd December 2017
Buck caught the eye of the colony's director, Dr. Albert Priddy, a rabid eugenist. Like other doctors at mental hospitals across the country, Priddy had performed extralegal sterilizations of inmates for a decade, and he had been searching for a test case to bring to the Supreme Court, one that would give Virginia and other states the constitutional power to sterilize people against their will. Buck's case was perfect because it offered three generations of females who could be used to prove that “imbecility” was heritable and led to sexual immorality: Emma Buck, Carrie Buck, and Carrie's illegitimate baby daughter, Vivian.
Priddy filed a petition to sterilize Carrie Buck, and the state of Virginia approved it under a 1924 law that allowed sterilization in limited circumstances. But the plan had never been to sterilize Buck right away. Instead, Priddy's allies appointed an attorney to represent Buck, Irving Whitehead, who appealed to prevent the sterilization. Whitehead was a Virginia good old boy, seemingly selected because of his willingness to present a weak case that would ultimately bolster the eugenic cause. That case became Buck v. Bell and it glided quickly through the lower courts. Whitehead's arguments and briefs never presented basic evidence that showed Buck to be far from a “moron,” such as school records of Buck having been a good student. Nor did Whitehead raise questions about the questionable evidence on the record. Vivian Buck, Carrie's daughter, was only eight months old when she was subjected to a sham examination that claimed to declare her mentally unfit and thus the inheritor of genetic imbecility via her mother and grandmother.
This was the faulty foundation upon which the Court built its ruling. The majority opinion in Buck was written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and joined by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, Justice Louis Brandeis, and five other justices. Holmes wrote, “It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. … Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”
Cohen structures Imbeciles around the stories of four of the men who determined Carrie Buck's fate, each representing a profession that failed to live up to its highest ideals: medicine, academia, law, and jurisprudence. Dr. Albert Priddy was obsessed with sterilizing “oversexed,” “immoral,” and “man-crazy” young women. He hired accomplished attorney and state legislator Aubrey Strode, a Jim Crow Democrat, to argue for Virginia's right to sterilize Buck. Strode's case relied on the research of Harry Laughlin, a starkly racist and anti-Semitic Nazi sympathizer who rose from intellectual backwaters to lead the Eugenics Record Office, an academic organization funded by the Carnegie Institution, John D. Rockefeller, and other leading philanthropists.
Forced sterilizations remain legal because American courts never overturned Buck v. Bell.
Cohen's fourth male subject, Oliver Wendell Holmes, is the man for whom the author reserves the most ire. Holmes's reputation as a liberal is almost entirely unearned, Cohen argues, since his sporadic progressive decisions in favor of civil liberties were “almost always about something else—generally deference to legislatures or larger social forces.” A Boston Brahmin, Holmes “had been raised to believe he and his peers were part of a hereditary aristocracy,” Cohen writes. “Eugenics was a movement of people who believed themselves to be inherently superior, and in Holmes it found a fitting judicial standard-bearer.” Holmes would recall Buck as “one decision that I wrote” that “gave me pleasure.”
Cohen demonstrates that many of Holmes's contemporaries were well aware of the fundamental flaws of eugenic thinking. The Supreme Court justice socialized with the editors of this magazine, which in 1922 published Walter Lippmann's devastating series on the false “science” of IQ testing. Prior to Buck, a federal judge had struck down Iowa's sterilization law, calling it an example of “Dark Ages” thinking. Leading scientists of the day noted that eugenic “studies” were “uncontrolled by experiment and … based largely on uncritical data.” The Catholic Church lobbied forcefully against sterilization laws, emerging as the most effective opposition to the eugenic movement. One Catholic legislator in Louisiana, speaking against a proposed eugenic sterilization law said, “God created these poor unfortunates just the same as he did legislators.” Indeed, the Supreme Court's one dissenting vote in Buck v. Bell came from Justice Pierce Butler, the conservative Catholic son of Irish immigrants. (Butler declined to write a dissenting opinion.)
Race was central to the sterilization movement. Poor white women like Buck, and white immigrant groups such as Jews and Poles, were initially targeted partially in an attempt to justify a white-black racial hierarchy. If “lesser” whites could be prevented from reproducing, then whiteness would supposedly retain the moral and sexual purity associated with the “Nordic” class. Eugenists understood white genetic superiority as a crucial rationale for maintaining the segregation of blacks, but once the Supreme Court accepted sterilization, it was used widely to prevent women of color, including Puerto Rican women, Native American women, and black women, from having children. Disabled and mentally ill women have also been disproportionately coerced into sterilization.
It is unfortunate that Carrie Buck remains a cipher at the center of her own story, one told through the well-documented lives of four powerful men. But considering the limited material Cohen had to work with—Buck is on the record as having uttered just one sentence at her initial sterilization hearing, and she gave only a few interviews to journalists, as an old woman—the format of Imbeciles makes sense, and Cohen deals with his subject sensitively. When Buck was 21, the state of Virginia cut her fallopian tubes. We do not know what, if anything, she understood about what was happening to her. Her biological sister, Doris Buck, was also forced to undergo the procedure, and was told she was having an appendectomy. Carrie and Doris were elderly in 1979, when psychologist Dr. K. Ray Nelson, then the director of the state mental institution where the Bucks had been sterilized, sought the sisters out to explain what had been done to them. As Nelson sat in Doris Buck's home and told her and her husband the date she had been sterilized, the couple began to cry. They had been married for 39 years and had sought help for infertility; Doris had no idea why she was unable to conceive. Carrie, meanwhile, had married, been widowed, and then remarried to a sickly man named Charlie, whom she doted upon. She, too, expressed regret that she had never been able to raise children of her own. “They're done me wrong,” she said.
Oliver Wendell Holmes thought keeping up with current events was a waste of time, but Carrie Buck “lived to get the paper,” according to a friend at the old-age home where she lived in her final years. She also enjoyed crossword puzzles, music, and theater, and participated in the home's reading groups. “The final theme running through Carrie's life was precisely what the Supreme Court had refused to see: a quiet intelligence,” Cohen writes.
Imbecile's only significant weakness is its failure to situate Buck's story within the history of reproductive and women's rights (apart from two paragraphs noting that some prominent feminists allied themselves with eugenists in an effort to promote access to birth control). Cohen writes, “Carrie had never been an ‘immoral' woman'—even as that term was understood in the 1920s. She had been a rape victim.” In fact, rape was widely understood then—and in some quarters, today, too—as a crime to which a good man could be tempted by a loose woman. Given the class difference between Buck and the man she accused, she almost certainly would have been disbelieved or, at the very least, held partially responsible for her own rape.
What's more, in the 1920s, a woman had no right to sexual autonomy, either inside or outside of marriage, and no right to abortion or birth control. The sterilization movement was a direct product of women's disempowerment, and eugenic thinking was, at its very core, misogynist. It entrusted male experts with the bodily decisions that rightfully belonged to women. Cohen should have plumbed these ideological connections more deeply, especially given the fact that Buck was cited in Roe v. Wade as setting the precedent that women's bodily rights are never “unlimited.” That concept has, in turn, been used by today's anti-abortion rights movement to bring cases that have successfully limited when and where women can access abortion.
Cohen never mentions abortion, but legal history shows that the right not to mother is inextricably linked to the right to carry a pregnancy to term. Both are essential human rights still partially denied by the law. As reproductive and genetic technology becomes more sophisticated and ethically complex, Imbeciles could hardly be a more urgent book, preferably read alongside Linda Gordon's classic history of birth-control politics, The Moral Property of Women.
Cohen reminds us of the simple, shocking fact that while forced sterilizations are rare today, they remain legal because American courts have never overturned Buck v. Bell. As recently as 2001, in a case brought by a mildly intellectually disabled woman who said Clinton County, Missouri, coerced her into having her tubes tied, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals cited Buck, writing, “involuntary sterilization is not always unconstitutional.” It should be.
After Vancouver and other Canadian cities, a new Bitcoin ATM produced by Robocoin might be arriving in Boston (United States) in the beginning of 2014. The device will allow the city's cryptocurrency community to exchange fiat for Bitcoin and the other way around.
The man behind the plan of bringing this different ATM to Boston is Alex Peterson, a Bitcoin adopter and local entrepreneur that is now looking to become a fully licensed money transmitter in order to properly manage the machine. According to the site Mass Live, Peterson is currently trying to decide where to place the device within the Cambridge and Harvard Square area.
Peterson, who has been selling Bitcoins to the local community for a while, got the idea when the first ATM landed in Vancouver. In the meantime, he is also trying to raise awareness among the local merchants and business owners to make the Bitcoin community grow.
“I had a lot of customers from all over different neighborhoods in Boston, and I really wanted to try to bring an ATM here to bring it all into one location instead of the fragmented doing deals in coffee shops and being nervous about bringing cash to someone you met on the internet”, Peterson told Mass Live.
Boston could be one of the next cities to get a Bitcoin ATM and if the success rates are nearly as good as the ones achieved in Vancouver, then Peterson would have made the right investment. The first Robocoin's machine operating in Canada, at the Waves Coffee House in Vancouver, exceeded CAD$1 million in volume from 1,576 transactions after only a month of activity.
Experts say that cold weather and western drought is caused by global warming and disappearing Arctic ice. Global warming makes the jet stream take deep dips into the Eastern US, causing cold in the east and drought in California.
New study says global warming causing more frigid winters
In 1977, experts blamed nearly identical cold winters and western drought on global cooling and increasing Arctic ice.
In 1977, experts said global cooling makes the jet stream take deep dips into the Eastern US, causing cold in the East and drought in California.

One hundred fifty years ago, in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, Ulysses S. Grant won the Civil War.* His chief opponent, Gen. Robert E. Lee of the Confederate States, had surrendered, all but ending the rebellion that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives but freed millions more.
But this was just the beginning of Grant's career. Three years later, after Abraham Lincoln's assassination and the terrible tenure of Andrew Johnson, he was elected president and served two terms, leaving office as a celebrated statesman. Afterward, he would manage a bank, lose his wealth, and die from cancer, although not before penning the greatest memoir of any former president. But this isn't the end of his story; Grant would die a second death of sorts, as opponents reduced his life to its worst qualities: His bloody tactics came to the forefront, as did his drinking and the corruption in his administration. There are few monuments to Grant, and they are mostly ignored.

By contrast, Robert E. Lee didn't have Grant's long career in public life. He died in 1870, just a few years after the war. But in his short tenure as president of what's now Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, he became a Southern saint, never defeated, and a man who surrendered his army with honor and dignity. In death, this part of Lee would subsume the whole person. In 1890, when ex-Confederates erected a monument to Lee in the middle of Richmond, Virginia—the old Confederate capital—he would stand as an avatar for the Old South, the symbol of a romantic age. At present, there are Lee memorials across the South: highways, parks, monuments, and state commemorations. And in popular memory, he remains a figure of admiration, an example of duty, honor, and chivalry.
How did the hero of the war become a quasi-ignominious figure, and how did the champion of Southern slavery become, if not the war's hero, its most popular figure?
To millions of Americans, 150 years after the end of the Civil War, Lee is a role model and Grant is—despite his gifted generalship and consequential presidency—an embarrassment. What happened? How did the hero of the war become a quasi-ignominious figure, and how did the champion of Southern slavery become, if not the war's hero, its most popular figure?
The answer begins with Reconstruction. As best as possible, President Grant was a firm leader of Reconstruction America. Faced with the titanic challenge of integrating freedmen into American politics, he attacked the problem with characteristic clarity and flexibility. He proposed civil rights legislation (and would be the last president to do so until Dwight D. Eisenhower, nearly a century later) and deployed troops to hot spots across the South, to defend black Americans from white supremacist violence.* And while there were failures—at times he was too passive in the face of white violence, too paralyzed by petty politics—there were real victories too. After Congress passed the Enforcement Acts—criminal codes that protected blacks' 14th and 15th Amendment rights to vote, hold office, serve on juries, and receive equal protection of laws—Grant authorized federal troops to confront the Ku Klux Klan and other groups of anti-black terrorists. Declaring them “insurgents … in rebellion against the authority of the United States,” Grant and his subordinates—most notably Attorney General Amos Ackerman and the newly formed Department of Justice—broke the Klan and restored some peace to the Republican South.
In using federal power to prosecute white supremacists and support Reconstruction governments, Grant had tied his fortunes to those of freedmen and their allies. They were grateful. Grant won re-election in 1872 with the vast backing of black voters in the South, as well as former Union soldiers in the North. Appalled by his use of force in the South, his enemies dogged him as an enemy of liberty. Indeed, for as much as scandal plagued his administration, it's also true that many cries of corruption came from angry and aggrieved Democrats, who attacked military intervention in the South as “corrupt” and “unjust.” Opponents in the North and South reviled Grant as a “tyrant” who imposed so-called “black domination” on an innocent South.

Grant wasn't blind to his critics, and he devoted his presidency and post-presidency to defending both his record as general and the aims of the war he won. “While I would do nothing to revive unhappy memories in the South,” he once declared, “I do not like to see our soldiers apologize for the war.”
Facing him was a phalanx of Southern sympathizers and former Confederates, from ex-president Jefferson Davis to polemical writers like Edward Pollard, who would give the name “Lost Cause” to the movement to redeem and defend the former Confederacy. Born out of grief and furthered by a generation of organizations (like United Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy), proponents of the Lost Cause would wage a battle for the nation's memory of the war. To them it was not a rebellion or a fight for slavery; it was a noble battle for constitutional ideals. As Davis put it in his two-volume memoir and defense of the Southern cause, The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, slavery “was in no wise the cause of the conflict, but only an incident,” and the South was fighting against “unlimited, despotic power” of the federal government and its “tremendous and sweeping usurpation” of states' rights.
Which brings us to Lee, who—in his surrender at Appomattox—gave raw materials to the Lost Cause. “After four years of arduous service marked by unsurpassed courage and fortitude, the Army of Northern Virginia has been compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources,” wrote Lee in his farewell address. “You will take with you the satisfaction that proceeds from a consciousness of duty faithfully performed; and I earnestly pray that a Merciful God will extend to you His blessings and protection.”
Not only would this order help cement Lee as a Southern icon—as historian David Blight writes in Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, Lost Because advocates would canonize Lee as a “blameless Christian soldier, a paragon of manly virtue and duty who soared above politics”—but it would fuel other narratives: that the nation should honor Southern bravery, that the Union's victory was one of numerical superiority and not tactical skill (it's in this that we see the claim that Grant was a “butcher” of men, despite all evidence to the contrary), that Reconstruction was a disaster of federal overreach, and that white supremacy was the proper order of things in the United States. And in at least the case of Southern bravery, Lost Causers would find help from Grant, who admired Lee and the soldiers he led. “I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall of a foe who had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse,” Grant wrote in an oft-quoted passage of his memoirs. “I do not question, however, the sincerity of the great mass of those who were opposed to us.”

Grant's post-facto nod to Lee would stand as a powerful symbol of reconciliation. Blight writes, “Grant's passing was invoked as a moment of national unity. Some Confederate veterans' groups in the South passed resolutions of honor and sympathy for their former foe.” Two of his pallbearers were former Confederate generals—appointed by Democratic President Grover Cleveland—representatives of a nation united in mourning and eager to move on. Exhausted by Reconstruction and the battles over black rights, white Northerners were eager to put the past behind them and reunite with their Southern cousins. The Lost Cause was a template for doing just that. White Americans didn't want to dwell on the challenges of race and emancipation, and the South's narrative of honor and sincerity—aggressively pushed by Confederate veterans and their supporters—allowed everyone to celebrate the individual greatness of men like Lee and Grant, even as the latter never abandoned his view that the Southern cause was slavery and that the North was right to wage the war.
To many, Robert E. Lee is what he's been for almost 150 years: a decent man on the wrong side of history.
In popular culture, this sentimental picture of sectional rapprochement was spread by a cottage industry of writers and publishers; in academia, it was helped along in the early 20th century by scholars under the tutelage of historian William Archibald Dunning of Columbia University. Following his lead, a generation of writers would bring the Lost Cause and its ideas into American historiography. To the “Dunning School,” Reconstruction was a terrible failure, a product of dangerous revolutionaries (the Radical Republicans) and an enfeebled, drunken, and corrupt President Grant. Dunning and his students justified the proto-Jim Crow “Black Codes,” and derided the entire project of the Republican Party as a dangerous experiment in “Negro rule.” “A concept that for them,” writes historian John David Smith, “signified a saturnalia of corruption and fiscal excess by black, carpetbag, and scalawag state governments and the tyranny of U.S. Army occupation forces.” Blacks were inferior, they reasoned, and unfit for any government. They praised Andrew Johnson's lenient Reconstruction and attacked Grant's in an effort to bury his reputation.
If the ideas of the Dunning School stuck with the public, it's in large part because it gave white Northerners license to ignore black oppression, and white Southerners a way to justify it. “The traditional or Dunning School of Reconstruction was not just an interpretation of history. It was part of the edifice of the Jim Crow System,” said historian Eric Foner in a recent interview with The Nation. “It was an explanation for and justification of taking the right to vote away from black people on the grounds that they completely abused it during Reconstruction.” It's hard to overstate Dunning's influence. President Woodrow Wilson—a virulent white supremacist—held to the Dunning School, as did a generation of the men and women responsible for American mythmaking. Dunning's narrative was the basis for the novel The Clansman, later adapted into the pathbreaking film The Birth of a Nation—it has all the elements of Lost Cause mythology and history—as well as the novel Gone With the Wind and its film adaptation several decades later. And you can see vestiges of it in our continued fascination with the noble ex-Confederate, sent West in pursuit of life, revenge, or both.
But while historians have rehabilitated Grant in academia—as a flawed president who nonetheless held a strong commitment to black rights—his standing still lags in public memory. The reverse is true of Lee. To many, he is what he's been for almost 150 years: a decent man on the wrong side of history.
Whether this changes depend on where the country goes. Both men are eternally tied to Appomattox and everything it meant, from the end of the Confederate dream to the promise of emancipation. And in turn, their legacies are tied to what those things mean today, from the particular heritage celebrated by millions of white Southerners to the fight for full inclusion of black Americans to national life. Maybe, if full racial equality is in our future, Grant will rise higher as the man who helped move the country a step toward its destination, while Lee declines to the background of history. And if that isn't our path? Then Lee might remain as an image of what we want our past to look like, and not what it was.
A newly published study describes recent observations of the remnant of a stellar collision, revealing that the remnant of the stripped red giant is a new type of pulsating star.
A team of astronomers from the UK, Germany and Spain have observed the remnant of a stellar collision and discovered that its brightness varies in a way not seen before on this rare type of star. By analyzing the patterns in these brightness variations, astronomers will learn what really happens when stars collide. This discovery is published in the 27 June 2013 issue of the journal Nature.
Stars like our Sun expand and cool to become red giant stars when the hydrogen that fuels the nuclear fusion in their cores starts to run out. Many stars are born in binary systems so an expanding red giant star will sometimes collide with an orbiting companion star. As much as 90% of the red giant star's mass can be stripped off in a stellar collision, but the details of this process are not well understood. Only a few stars that have recently emerged from a stellar collision are known, so it has been difficult to study the connection between stellar collisions and the various exotic stellar systems they produce. When an eclipsing binary system containing one such star turned up as a by-product of a search for extrasolar planets, Dr Pierre Maxted and his colleagues decided to use the high-speed camera ULTRACAM to study the eclipses of the star in detail. These new high-speed brightness measurements show that the remnant of the stripped red giant is a new type of pulsating star.
Many stars, including our own Sun, vary in brightness because of pulsations caused by sound waves bouncing around inside the star. For both the Sun and the new variable star, each pulsation cycle takes about 5 minutes. These pulsations can be used to study the properties of a star below its visible surface. Computer models produced by the discovery team show that the sound waves probe all the way to the center of the new pulsating star. Further observations of this star are now planned to work out how long it will be before the star starts to cool and fade to produce a stellar corpse (“white dwarf'”) of abnormally low mass.
Dr Pierre Maxted from Keele University, who led the study, said “We have been able to find out a lot about these stars, such as how much they weigh, because they are in a binary system. This will really help us to interpret the pulsation signal and so figure out how these stars survived the collision and what will become of them over the next few billion years.”
The team involved in the discovery are: Dr Pierre Maxted and Dr Barry Smalley (Keele University, UK); Dr Aldo Serenelli (CSIC-IEEC, Spain); Andrea Miglio (University of Birmingham, UK); Prof. Thomas Marsh and Dr Elmé Breedt (University of Warwick, UK), Prof. Ulrich Heber and Veronika Schaffenroth (Dr. Karl Remeis-Observatory & ECAP, Germany), Prof. Vikram Dhillon and Dr Stuart Littlefair (University of Sheffield, UK), Dr Chris Copperwheat (Liverpool John Moores University, UK)
ULTRACAM is a high-speed, 3-channel CCD camera for astrophysical research ULTRACAM was funded by PPARC and is a collaboration between, Professor Tom Marsh (University of Warwick) Professor Vik Dhillon (Sheffield) and the Astronomy Technology Centre (Edinburgh).
The observations were made using the 3.6-m New Technology Telescope at the European Southern Observatory (ESO).

As the Greek crisis deepens, questions are already being asked about whether another Eurozone member could end up in the same situation.
With huge public debt, a vulnerable economy and the prospect of a radical left-wing government on the horizon there is one obvious contender.
Portugal's public debt now stands at 129 per cent of GDP, the seventh worst figure in the world according to the CIA World Factbook. Greece is third with 175 per cent.
Although it has been bailed out before and adopted various austerity measures demanded by its creditors, the country's conservative government may well be ousted in elections later this year by radical leftists.
The Portuguese Socialists, the traditional party of the left in the country, have become increasingly radicalised under their current leader, Antonio Costa, pledging to reject austerity measures demanded by the country's creditors.
Costa has pledged to end the “obsession with austerity” and promised to grow the public sector if he wins re-election. He told journalists in Lisbon: “There must be an alternative that allows us to turn the page on austerity, revive the economy, create jobs, and – while complying with euro area rules – restore hope to this county.”
Although the Socialists only have a slim lead, polls suggest they may be able to team up with the old Communist Party to form a majority, creating a government that could rival even Syriza in terms of radical policies.
Costa also pledged to block the sale of Portugal's national airline and various utilities, as well as increase spending on healthcare and make it harder for companies to sack workers.
Unlike Greece, however, Portugal is no longer under troika control, having exited its bailout programme last year. It remains, however, under “post-programme surveillance”, with European ministers able to issue “recommendations” if it starts borrowing too much again.
One potentially deadly factor for the country is that nearly 70 per cent of its debt is owned abroad, meaning that devaluation will not solve the problem. As Market Watch writes:
The Portuguese are close to unique, in both having very high debts, and most of it being owned abroad. Nor does it just end there. Once household and corporate debt is added into the equation, Portugal has more debt in total than any other eurozone country, Greece included (which mainly has government debt to deal with). There aren't any reliable figures on whom that debt belongs to, but it is fair bet that is mostly foreigners as well.
[…]
At some point, all those foreign holders of Portuguese debt are going to realize it will have to be written off, at least in part. Once that happens, there will be a stampede to sell — and the elections later this year could well be the trigger for that.
As the euro crisis deepens, Portugal is the next one to watch. If Greece crashes out of the euro, and if the Socialists and Communists come to power, the future of the Eurozone will be in even further doubt.
MONTREAL - Gabrielle Bouchard, the first trans woman to lead Quebec's main women's advocacy federation, says her detractors are guilty of trickle-down feminism.
As long as white, privileged and wealthy feminists achieve equality, then less fortunate women will eventually see some benefits too, the logic goes, Bouchard said.
``They are saying we'll tolerate trans women as long as they are not in a position of power,'' she told The Canadian Press. ``We'll tolerate lesbians in the movement as long as they stand 10 feet away.''
Not long after Bouchard's recent election to the presidency of the Quebec federation of women, the backlash began.
A columnist in a Montreal newspaper wrote in early December, ``who is this man who became a woman as an adult?
``How can she speak on behalf of all women, as someone who was raised in a masculine culture, ignoring the experiences that women have lived through since they were born?'' wrote Denise Bombardier, a well-known media personality in Quebec.
Bouchard, 49, said she was chosen by members of the federation to be president and ran unopposed.
Yet she's been criticized on social media and privately in emails by members of the public.
``From the members of the federation and the board _ the reception has been great,'' she said. ``I am truly enjoying the team dynamic we have.''
Outside the federation, however, ``Some women are really, really, not happy,'' Bouchard said.
The federation of Quebec women represents roughly 300 feminist organizations across the province as well as about 700 individual members.
It's an organization that leans heavily to the left, and its mission, as described on its website, includes an aim to ``deconstruct and eliminate patriarchy and all the other systems of oppression or domination with which it is intertwined, such as capitalism, racism, imperialism, heterosexism, colonialism.''
The federation's website also singles out Israel and demands the country end its blockade of Gaza.
Bouchard's vision for the presidency is to better enshrine her organization's mission: Equality for all women and equality among all women.
Her definition of feminism is inclusive: ``It's about not leaving anyone behind,'' she said.
Over the past few years, governments across Canada have made significant movement toward recognizing trans rights.
The federal government passed Bill C-16 last June, which amends the Canadian Human Rights Act to add gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination.
Bouchard agreed society is more accepting today than just six years ago, when she began her activism, but barriers remain.
Some women feel uncomfortable when a trans person seeks shelter at refuges for female victims of violence. Employees at those centres have been known to ask trans women if they've received gender-reassignment surgery, Bouchard said.
Bouchard said part of her work as president will be to fight against so-called trickle-down feminism and for a more inclusive interpretation of womanhood.
She rejects the idea she can't president of a women's rights organization.
``(This opinion) presumes all women live the same experience _ which is not true,'' she said.
``It also presumes the identity barriers I face, the risk of violence I face, the risk of unemployment and not finding housing are illegitimate and not based in sexism.
``All the barriers I face are actually based in sexism. They also happen to be based in transphobia. I am living at the intersection of trans identity and being a woman, and it creates a marginalization that some women don't face.''
The larger the dot in the interactive map above, the more frequently the surrounding ZIP code deals with sewage overflows, per to the city's tally of sewage spills between 2009 and 2014. The map, put together by Rachael Gleason with data prepped by John Harden and Mike Morris, goes along with Morris's update in the Chronicle this weekend on the city of Houston's ongoing negotiations with the EPA over what to do about the city's sewage-related water quality issues, with the estimated cost of required infrastructure upgrades and education programs on the horizon currently hanging out in the neighborhood of $5 billion dollars.
The Chronicle's analysis also notes that most of the areas with above-average sewage spill rates are home to above-average poverty rates, as well as above-average proportions of black and Hispanic residents than the city as a whole. The map above allows readers to superimpose the spill numbers over each ZIP code's median income and poverty rate (you'll have to look elsewhere for maps backing up the other claim, though). Another map released earlier this summer pinpoints more precisely the spots where the sewage flows most freely — areas in purple below have seen a minimum of 45 documented sewage spills in the 5-year data period:
***
Dr. Robert Bullard of TSU points out to Morris that the neighborhoods most regularly seeing the raw sewage backups are a sort of laundry list of areas he's focused on during his career in Houston environmental justice: “The same neighborhoods we're talking about are the neighborhoods where, historically, services have bypassed them. This is not a new phenomenon . . . what makes it a real story is we're talking about 2016,” Bullard tells Morris. “It reinforces this whole concept of environmental injustice and the impact of unequal distribution of resources, and the allocation of dollars based on race and class — you can predict where the worst problems are.”

Sniffing Out the Cause
Welcome to this section here you will learn about microfarm aquaponic garden.Types of microfarm aquaponic garden and how to set up this garden in backyard.You also learn here which are the best vegetables for this garden.
Aquaponics is among mostly the greenest ways for you to grow foods right in your backyard. It's easy and clear-cut, and the stability included in the system might be accomplished quite effortlessly once you learn the idea regarding Microfarm aquaponic garden. The underside line is, Microfarm aquaponic garden incorporates waste material from the aquarium to provide food to vegetation.Microfarm aquaponic systems are usually designed in a limited space, and it's important to figure out a design that offers the best use of that space and allows you to grow the greatest amount of food.
A well-designed Microfarm Aquaponic Garden is not only aesthetically pleasing, but it also works efficiently and produces a high quantity with minimal cost. Designing a system like this is tough because you should also leave room for future expansion. Something like using tanks that are stack-able can pay off when you want to add another level to your operation. Saving space can save money.
Choosing a general design for your aquaponics garden is a choice between three main setups:
01.Media filled beds
02.Nutrient films
03. Deep water culture
Each of these methods of gardening has its pros and cons and can be used for different plants.
01.Media Filled Beds:
Media filled beds are the most common method for Microfarm aquaponic gardening. A media-filled bed is a growth bed that is full of some solid substance like rocks or expanded clay to hold the plants in place as they grow. Roots need to be held securely, so it's good to use fairly sizable rocks that anchor the roots in place and keep plants upright. Your pumping system will then move water through the media filled beds, and the roots can soak up nutrients as the water moves past them.
02.Nutrient Film:
Nutrient films employ a slightly different but equally effective method of providing nutrition to your plants. The plants are placed in small, enclosed gutters which are fed a thin stream of water that is very rich in nutrients. This system is widely used for leafy vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage or Chinese broccoli. It is also popularly used for growing tomatoes. The key to this method is that while it conserves water, something desirable for most farmers, it doesn't allow the growth of plants with large, invasive roots. Provided the plant's roots can fit in the gutters. However, this remains a popular growth strategy.
03.Deep Water Culture:
Deepwater cultures are growing in popularity in the Microform aquaponic garden world because they provide a consistently good system for most plants. A styrofoam raft is used to support the plants at the base, and this raft floats in a tank of water that contains nutrients and may also contain fish. This system is great because it conserves space and minimizes electricity costs that result from pumping water. One disadvantage is that the water gets dirty more quickly and may need to be replaced.
The aquariums ought to ever be below your grow beds (the spot that the vegetation is put) making sure that water can only drain out of the grow beds in the direction of the aquarium. The water pump frequently circulates a particular quantity water to make certain the crops inside the grow beds may clean up your water before it being drained your aquarium.

We've reached a bit a landmark. As you'll know if you've been following us since we started documenting what happens when you decide to make a tiny computer for education back in 2011, the first Raspberry Pis were made in China. Back in September 2012, we started moving manufacture to a plant owned by Sony in South Wales. Gradually, both of our manufacturing partners, RS Components and Premier Farnell, have reshored all the production of Raspberry Pis to that factory, and for the last few months, all the Pis you buy have been made in the UK.
The really big news today is that the Pencoed factory has made its millionth British Raspberry Pi. Add these to the existing Chinese ones, and that makes one and three quarter million Raspberry Pis out there worldwide, the majority of them made right here at home. Sony's Pencoed factory has just won a slew of trophies at the British Factory Awards: they took home the Best Factory award, Best Electronics Factory, Best Factory for Innovation – and were highly commended for their work on minimising energy use and environmental impact. They're great to work with, their quality control process and attention to detail is exceptional (as those of you with UK Pis have been happy to tell us), and we can't think of anyone who deserves those awards more.
What's happened to the millionth British Raspberry Pi, you ask? Sony have made us a gold-plated case to keep it in, and we'll be displaying it proudly here at Pi Towers.
Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC's Technological Correspondent (and a man without whose blog there might never have been a Raspberry Pi – it was only when some personal footage he'd taken with his phone went viral that we realised that hundreds of thousands of you might actually be interested in buying the thing) dropped into our offices last week to do some filming about the millionth Pi. Keep an eye on BBC news bulletins today, and especially on BBC Breakfast – you might spot us there!
Updated to add: the BBC has a big article by Rory on its news website, along with some video of Gareth talking to Rory at the factory and showing him how the Pi is built, and an interview with Eben. Head over and have a look.
Perky. Bubbly. Upbeat.
If you've caught even just one episode of ABC's Emmy-winning and tear-jerking Extreme Makeover: Home Edition in the last few years, these descriptions might come to mind when you think of Paige Hemmis, the animated blond who always seems to have a smile on her face and a pink tool belt slung around her waist.
You might even describe Paige Hemmis as one who's likely to be the recipient of cliché construction site catcalls rather than one of the hardhats herself.
A description that might not come to mind, however, is depressed. It's certainly not a word many people associate with lively and helpful go-getters like Paige Hemmis, yet, somewhere between building new homes for struggling families and changing lives for deserving folks across the nation, that's exactly how Paige found herself.
Depressed.
I was fortunate enough to talk with Paige last week about her struggle with depression, how treatment has helped her refocus her energies on the show, and the exciting new campaign she's started to help shed light on depression advocacy, awareness, and resources.
After her plane landed and she was safely settled in the back of a car (hey, this is Paige Hemmis we're talking about – in addition to the show, she's juggling her Tuff Chix line of work gear for women and volunteer time with Habitat for Humanity – she's a busy gal), I dove right into the question that'd been bouncing around in my head since learning about Paige's new advocacy efforts:
Given the stigma that still surrounds mental health issues, what prompted Paige Hemmis – so well known for her happy demeanor – to go public with her depression?
Paige laughs and agrees there is definitely still a “big stigma” surrounding mental health, but launches into a story about a good friend of hers who admitted she'd sought help for her own struggles after listening to Paige talk about her situation. “It's so amazing my story could inspire other people!”
But before we learn about how Paige is hoping to inspire more people with her story, we first have to learn her story.
You might think building a new home for a devastated family each week – seeing the smiles and tears of joy, hearing the laughter and endless “thank yous” – would be enough to keep anyone happy – that Paige Hemmis shouldn't even have a story of depression to tell. However, depression doesn't care who you are, what your job is, or how many good things you do for other people, and for Paige, sometimes this meant Home Edition caused more sadness than joy:
“It [the show] takes an emotional toll. I like getting involved, but the emotional toll is very hard.”
Before she went public with her depression, Paige admits she often put on a happy face to make it through the day and sometimes relied on the excuse of her hectic work schedule to avoid hanging out with friends and loved ones, and she feels the way she handled her depression in both her public and private lives is just one example of how depression and its symptoms span a pretty broad range:
“You don't have to be suicidal to be depressed; there is a gray area. I think I represent people who go on about their daily lives.”
Now that she's learned how to treat and manage her depression, Paige finds it easier to deal with that emotional toll: “I focus on the help now…I have a better grasp of that.”
Which brings us back to Paige using her story to inspire others – something the energetic self-taught carpenter is perfectly poised to do.
Shortly after the conversation with her friend, Paige put the word out that she was interested in getting involved with advocacy. With the help of the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA), Dr. Jesse H. Wright, and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Paige launched Blueprint for Hope, the aptly named depression awareness campaign geared toward helping others learn more about the mental health condition and the many tools available for people suffering from depression.
And if you think Paige is just another celeb who's slapped her famous face on some well-meaning campaign for all the primo public relations benefits, you couldn't be more off. She is passionate about the campaign and I can hear the sincerity in her voice when she tells me, “Blueprint for Hope is the website I wish I had when I was going through it.”
Keeping true to her DIY roots, Paige has rolled up her sleeves and started a series of videos for the campaign's website to help people learn about how they can create their own “blueprints” for hope to deal with depression. And, just like a typical blueprint is a “plan to create an awesome house,” Paige believes developing an individual blueprint for dealing with depression will help each person better deal with the condition. To get started, she would encourage a person to “[g]o talk to your doctor, and look online for resources. Break it down so it's not so scary.”
Blueprint for Hope currently focuses on providing information and free resources for people with depression, and in the coming months Paige – along with a DBSA representative and a doctor – will attend Blueprint for Hope events in communities throughout the nation to share her story, offer DIY tips for inspiration and motivation, and encourage people to explore resources for managing depression. The tour dates will be posted on the Blueprint for Hope website as they're finalized, but if you live in or near Sacramento, Denver, Houston, Atlanta, or Philadelphia, you can expect a visit.
Overall, Paige wants Blueprint for Hope to educate people about depression and help them realize they're not alone, and she can sum up in five simple, yet powerful, words with resolute determination in her voice the one goal above all others she hopes Blueprint for Hope achieves: “Inspiring people to get help.”
And here's to hoping it does just that.
Visit the Blueprint for Hope website to learn more about the campaign and it's supporters, as well as nab some resources and watch Paige's DIY videos for developing your own blueprint for hope.
© Reuters. Crude futures made a positive start to the week
Investing.com – Crude futures settled higher on Monday, after Opec producer Saudi Arabia pledged to lower crude exports in August while Nigeria agreed to curb production.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange for August delivery rose 1.3% to settle at $46.34 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, added 1.21% to trade at $48.64 a barrel.
At a gathering of ministers from major crude-producing nations in St. Petersburg, Russia on Monday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country would limit crude oil exports at 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, almost 1 million bpd below levels a year ago.
The Saudi energy minster added that the production-cut agreement could be extended beyond March if necessary but any further extension would rely on non-compliant nations adhering to the agreement.
Also adding to positive sentiment on oil, were reports suggesting that Nigeria committed to take part in production if it reaches a production level of 1.8m bpd.
Nigeria output reached 1.7 million bpd in June, according to independent sources cited by OPEC in a monthly report.
Some analysts praised Nigeria decision to agree to cap production but expressed concerns about Opec's compliance rate – with the deal to curb production – which fell to 78% June, the IEA said in its report earlier this month.
“The only significant thing about the meeting is that Nigeria has voluntarily agreed that they will not increase their production above 1.8 [million barrels a day] once they have achieved that level,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets U.K.
But when it comes to the “compliance side of things,” that's getting “really ugly,” he said. “A lot of cheating is already happening and we are only half [way] through this agreement,”
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8m bpd for a period of nine months until March but rising production from the U.S., Nigeria and Libya has undermined the cartel's efforts to curb excess supply.

The Forth Road Bridge is to be closed until the new year because of structural faults, Transport Minister Derek Mackay has said.
The bridge has been closed since midnight with initial guidance saying it would be shut for at least 24 hours.
The minister has now said it would need at least three weeks to repair the bridge and safety was "paramount".
He said a full travel plan was being prepared, including extra trains and buses and possibly a ferry.
Early on Friday morning, 11-mile tailbacks were reported approaching the Kincardine Bridge, the alternative route across the Forth from Fife to Edinburgh.
Heavy congestion was reported on the same routes on Friday evening.

At a media conference, engineers said a 20mm-wide crack in a truss under the southbound carriageway close to the bridge's north tower could not have been predicted and happened quickly.
They said continuing to allow traffic to use the bridge would "increase the risk of causing extensive secondary damage to the structure".

Why is the Forth Road Bridge closed?

Firms warn of bridge closure costs

The fault was not on the bridge during the last inspection in May and was only spotted on Tuesday. Officials said the shear fault was discovered in the most difficult area of the bridge to access.
Bridge operator, Amey, said it was an "unprecedented situation".
Traffic Scotland has said all current and planned roadworks on the diversion routes for the bridge have been removed to reduce congestion.
A dedicated hotline is to be set up to help commuters while the bridge remains closed for three weeks.
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: "The closure of the Forth Road Bridge until the new year is a very serious development which will have a major impact not just on local communities and travellers but on the wider Scottish economy.
"I met today with Fife Council and we discussed the impact the closure will have on the local area.
"While this is a devolved responsibility of the Scottish government and they now have the task of ensuring that all possible measures are taken to minimise the disruption during the bridge closure, the UK government stands ready to assist in any practical way we can."
Image caption Traffic Scotland has published a diversion route for motorists
The transport minister said he anticipated the 51-year-old bridge, which is due to be replaced by a new crossing in about a year, would be open for commuters returning to work in January.
Mr Mackay said there would be about a week of further inspections and two weeks to carry out the repairs.
He said the work was weather-dependent and it was difficult to predict exactly how long it would take.
Image copyright Forth Road Bridge Image caption Safe access to carry out the repair is the first challenge
The minister said additional rail, ferry and park-and-ride facilities are to be put in place.
Emergency service vehicles will still be able to use the bridge when responding to 999 calls.
Mr Mackay said "We are aware of the potential economic impact, for strategic traffic in the east of Scotland and on people living in local communities.
"This is an unprecedented challenge in the maintenance of the Forth Road Bridge. On balance following advice from engineers and independent experts, the full closure is essential for the safety of the travelling public and to prevent further damage to the structure of the bridge."
While ministers anticipate reopening the bridge to traffic, one expert cautioned there was a possibility only public transport would be allowed on the bridge in future.
Mack West, chairman of the Institution of Civil Engineers (Ice), told BBC Radio Scotland's Newsdrive programme: "I think there's a possibility that there will be restrictions on the existing bridge and it's likely that it may be restricted to public transport usage and cycling."
Image caption There were huge queues to the Kincardine and Clackmannanshire bridges on Friday morning
Rob Shorthouse, ScotRail communications director, said they had managed "so far" to increase the train capacity between Glenrothes and Edinburgh by about 25%, from 81 journeys a day to over 100 to help relieve congestion.
He said: "This is a really difficult set of circumstances because services are busy.
"All the trains that we have got are out there on the network.
"So, because this is such a national priority we are looking right across Scotland to see where we can move some capacity."
A Stagecoach spokesman said: "Stagecoach has on Friday operated a number of extra buses between Fife and Edinburgh and will continue to do so, wherever possible, to provide extra capacity to enable customers to travel by public transport rather than driving, helping to alleviate traffic congestion in the affected areas.
"Customers are able to use both Ferrytoll Park and Ride and Halbeath Park and Ride sites in Fife to leave their cars and take the bus to Edinburgh."
An NHS Fife spokesman said: "Any potential effect on patients and staff is currently being assessed and we are exploring the provision of accommodation and transport, where necessary, to ensure we continue to provide high quality care."
A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said: "Ambulances will continue to travel across the Forth Road Bridge when responding to emergencies.
"Arrangements are being made to maintain ambulance transport of non-emergency patients to appointments using alternative routes and hospitals, as appropriate."
He added that local teams were working with partners at NHS Fife, Tayside, Lothian and Forth Valley to mitigate any potential disruption to services for patients.
The southbound carriageway of the bridge has been shut since the discovery of steelwork defects during inspections on Tuesday.
Since then engineers have identified eight other parts of the bridge where similar problems could be encountered.
The decision to close the bridge completely was taken late on Thursday after the latest reports indicated the faults were more serious than had earlier been thought.

Traffic volumes have increase dramatically since the bridge's opening in 1964, shortening its projected lifespan.
Concern about corrosion of the main suspension cables, first confirmed more than a decade ago, prompted ministers to order a new crossing.
A new £1.4bn Queensferry Crossing over the Firth of Forth is due to open in December next year.
Forth bridge to be shut until new year
Ubuntu MATE project leader Martin Wimpress has announced today, April 5, 2016, the release of the second Beta build of the Ubuntu MATE 16.04 port to Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 2 single-board computers.
Yes, you're reading it right, the Ubuntu MATE for Raspberry Pi operating system has just been updated to the upcoming Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) branch, bringing users the new Welcome screen, which has been tweaked with Raspberry Pi-specific features, and many updated components.
Best of all, Ubuntu MATE 16.04 for Raspberry Pi 3 now supports the on-board Wi-Fi and Bluetooth hardware, thanks to the BlueZ 5.37 component. The system is powered by Linux kernel 4.1.19 LTS, and includes raspberrypi-firmware 1.20160315-1, wiringpi 2.32, nuscratch 20160115, sonic-pi 2.9.0, and omx-player 0.3.7~git20160206~cb91001.
"Ubuntu MATE 16.04 Beta 2 for the Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3 is available for download," said Martin Wimpress. "Many thanks to The Pi Podcast presenters Joe Ressington, Winkle ink and Isaac Carter for testing some early images and providing valuable feedback. Thanks to them this Beta is in pretty decent shape."
Experimental hardware-accelerated OpenGL support
Another interesting change that landed in the Beta 2 builds of the Ubuntu MATE 16.04 for Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 2 single-board computers is that it's now possible for users to enable hardware-accelerated OpenGL technology, but it's not a thing for the faint-hearted.
Lastly, it looks like the team also managed to migrate the configuration tweaks to the raspberrypi-sys-mods and raspberrypi-general-mods components. If you want to test, go ahead and download the Beta 2 of Ubuntu MATE 16.04 for Raspberry Pi 3 from the project's website, where you'll also find the more stable Ubuntu MATE 15.10.3 images.
A key ingredient to improving your marriage might be the simple sweetener called gratitude, according to researchers.
“We found that feeling appreciated and believing that your spouse values you directly influences how you feel about your marriage, how committed you are to it, and your belief that it will last,” said study co-author Ted Futris, an associate professor in the College of Family and Consumer Sciences.
The study by the University of Georgia asked 468 married individuals questions about their financial well-being, their communication styles, and expressions of spousal gratitude.

The results indicated that the most consistent significant predictor of marital quality was how often the spouses showed their gratitude.
“It goes to show the power of ‘thank you,'” said the study's lead author Allen Barton, a postdoctoral research associate at UGA's Center for Family Research. “Even if a couple is experiencing distress and difficulty in other areas, gratitude in the relationship can help promote positive marital outcomes.”
The study also found that higher levels of spousal gratitude expressions protected marital commitment from the negative effects of poor communication during fights.

“Importantly, we found that when couples are engaging in a negative conflict pattern like demand/withdrawal, expressions of gratitude and appreciation can counteract or buffer the negative effects of this type of interaction on marital stability,” Futris said.
“This is the first study to document the protective effect that feeling appreciated by your spouse can have for marriages,” Barton said. “We think it is quite important as it highlights a practical way couples can help strengthen their marriage, particularly if they are not the most adept communicators in conflict.”
Demand/withdraw communication occurs when one partner tends to demand, nag or criticize, while the other responds by withdrawing or avoiding the confrontation. Gratitude, however, can interrupt this cycle and help couples overcome negative communication patterns in their relationship.

Gratitude was measured in terms of the degree to which individuals felt appreciated by their spouse, valued by their spouse and acknowledged when they did something nice for their spouse.
“All couples have disagreements and argue,” Futris said. “And, when couples are stressed, they are likely to have more arguments. What distinguishes the marriages that last from those that don't is not how often they argue, but how they argue and how they treat each other on a daily basis.”
The study was published last month in the journal Personal Relationships. (Photo credits: (top) Candida Performa; (home) miltonhuallpa95, CC)
Syncope.
That's the official term for feeling breathless or lightheaded or like one is about to faint, and I also believe it's the perfect word to describe I felt when I first saw Karolina Laskowska's 'Celestial Bodies' collection.
I sometimes worry I'm overly effusive on TLA. The internet favors cynicism, a frosty veneer of unimpressedness that takes great pains to never get too excited. When I say a collection makes me gasp or makes me swoon, we all know I'm exaggerating slightly (sometimes) and that I just really, really like a thing. But this...this makes me feel a tightness in my chest. My eyes dilate, my breath quickens, I lean towards the screen because this is one of the most exquisite, the most breathtaking, collections I've ever laid eyes on.
As you may have noticed, at least if you're a regular reader, this is my first lookbook feature in awhile, and it's somewhat appropriate that it would be about Karolina Laskowska, who's not only an award-winning luxury lingerie designer but also one of TLA's very own writers. Yet that prior relationship is an Achilles' heel at the moment, and I have the unenviable sensation of having bitten off more than I can chew. There's so much detail in this collection, an overabundance of richness and opulence mingled with a fresh, raw sensuality and some rough-edged eroticism. I'm terrified of not doing a good enough job on this piece, of not describing this symphony of lingerie adequately enough to do it justice.
In an industry obsessed with low prices and efficient design, Karolina Laskowska daringly returns to heritage fabrics and couture construction techniques. The textiles chosen are decadent, extravagant even, and sourced from some of the finest lace manufacturers in Europe. More importantly, Ms. Laskowska knows how to use this lace to brilliant effect. Her talent and expertise are especially evident in the Libra and Andromeda ranges, which both feature, among other things, cut-and-sewn French lace stockings.
In addition to lace, gold and platinum leaf are used with glorious, artistic abandon on Auriga's bobbinet tulle corset while the three-dimensional embellishment on Lacerta's hobble skirt and short cape evoke darkness and death and the majestic infiniteness of the universe, beautiful and horrifying all at once (we are made of stardust, after all). These are designs for Hel and Hecate, for The Morrigan and The Unseelie Queen. It is a privilege to watch a designer spread their wings, to stretch into their capabilities and fully inhabit their work. Were I to see the Celestial Bodies collection in person, I might cry.
Celestial Bodies is a two part collection, composed of an off-the-rack, mass-produced range made in Poland and a couture, made-to-order range sewn in London. As a point of reference, the Ara and Carina sets are factory-made, while most everything else would be couture and made upon request. Sizing for off-the-rack items generally runs S-L, fitting band sizes 30-36 and dress sizes 2-8 US. Made to measure items are fit in person at Karolina Laskowska's West London atelier and are not subject to these sizing restrictions. Prices for the main line range from £45-185 (approximately $65-$270), while the couture range begins at £550 (approximately $800) with the most limited edition items reaching £10,000 (approximately $14,500).
What are your thoughts on 'Celestial Bodies' by Karolina Laskowska? Do you have a favorite piece or look? And what do you think about an indie brand taking a risk by being super-luxe?

Feminism: 10 differences between the bourgeois and the anarchist.
by noticias y anarquia shared with thanks translation TheFreeOnline 1- The bourgeois feminists seek the protection of women through the coercive apparatuses of the State. Libertarian feminists advocate self-advocacy for women in community.
2 – bourgeois feminism wants every woman to compete on ‘equal opportunities' and be rewarded according to their individual merits. On the contrary, anarcha-feminists struggle so that each individual develops in solidarity in equality and that each one is satisfied according to her/his needs.
3 – The bourgeois feminists desire the incorporation of women in positions of power, in the parliament and the armies; In the upper management of capitalist enterprises and in government executives. Anarchist feminists want the abolition of hierarchical institutions. That is why they declare themselves anti-statists, anti-militarists and critical of parliamentarism.
4- Bourgeois feminism maintains that the equality of gender is a “human right” that must be guaranteed by the State. Libertarian feminists argue that the state can not guarantee equality, since equality can not be achieved through the hierarchy of society that generates the pyramidal and repressive organization of the state.
5. The bourgeois feminists create “citizen feminist consciousness”, that is, a set of practices and values that create a subject docile and submissive to democratic-neoliberal relations. Anarcha-feminists create “feminist class consciousness,” that is, libertarian principles and ends with the intention of abolishing power relations and replacing them with free relationships in equality.
6- The bourgeois feminists insist on explaining feminism historically through “waves” (first wave, second wave, third wave, etc.), ignoring and censoring feminist and anarchist community workers. Libertarian feminists, without neglecting the theoretical and conjunctural contributions of hegemonic feminism, are centered above all on the historical struggles of women of the oppressed and exploited classes.
7- Bourgeois feminists want a capitalism “green, friendly and inclusive”. Anarcha-feminists struggle against capitalism and against all forms of oppression, be it economic, political or cultural.
8- The bourgeois feminists are linked to hierarchical organizations and parliamentary parties. They promote state electoralism and the importance of the inclusion of women in bourgeois politics. Anarcha-feminists, organize in horizontal associations, practice direct action, mutual support and self-management.
9- Bourgeois feminists consider gender parity laws as vital to “feminize” the hierarchical institutions of capitalism. Libertarian feminists consider that the anti-patriarchal struggle is not to dominate ‘equitably' at the same time as statist males, but to abolish domination relations.
10- The bourgeois feminists want the male to collaborate in the division of labor in the home and that is a complement of the woman under binaristic canons. Libertarian feminists, on the other hand, radically question heterogeneity, the patriarchal family structure, and the concept of love that sustains it.
If you make a video claiming that social media is making us sad and you're relying on social media to make it go viral, just fuck you.
Social media, cell phones and modern technology are destroying our social lives, making us so very lonely and - ironically enough for a "jacked in" generation - disconnected.
That's the line you're going to keep hearing from a very special kind of pretentious person who likes to lecture you about how they're not one of those stupid sheeple who stare at their glowing screens like slack-jawed consumerist robots, sacrificing their precious and limited lives on the altar of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. While this message can be shared via any medium - from obnoxious status updates about how they're "going off the grid" to vaguely-scientific claims about how social media impacts peer-group interaction - it's at its worst when it comes in the form of a preachy, irony-blind viral video that couldn't have conceivably succeeded without a swarm of uncritical social media users to share it for them.

Worst quotes: "An 18-year-old boywho uses texting for almost everythingsays to me wistfully, 'Someday, someday,but certainly not now,I'd like to learn how to have a conversation' ... When I ask people 'What's wrong with having a conversation?'People say, 'I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation.It takes place in real timeand you can't control what you're going to say.'"
Why it sucks: No actual 18-year-old boy has ever expressed this opinion, but I'm guessing plenty of strawmen have! They don't have time for all that precious real social interaction, because they're made of goddamn straw and lack not only the ability to appropriately limit their online time but the very self-awareness that would allow them to condescendingly interact with others in real time in the first place.
TED Talks are often "middlebrow megachurch infotainment," but Sherry Turk's one here is an elaborate exercise in nostalgic wailing about the shallowness of the digital self and patting oneself on the back for it. Cyborgology's David Banks writes that Alone Together author Turk's whole shtick that the internet has created a "separation of physical and virtual selves and the privileging of one over the other is not only theoretically contradictory, but also empirically unsubstantiated." Unless you accept that "there is something in the technology that enables/causes antisocial behavior and we must overcome this false consciousness by actively refusing to use our devices," Banks argues, then you have to adopt the "augmented reality" perspective which views our behavior online as extensions of our offline identities. I'll leave it to you which opinion is smart and which one is dumb, but if you decide to go with the first one then please stop tweeting viral videos about it.

Worst quotes: "As a social fabric in the western world weakens, it is not surprising that more and more people define themselves as lonely. And thus, loneliness has become the most common aliment of the modern world ... One of the possible reasons for this aliment is the online social network. In a world where time is money, in which our surroundings heavily pressure us to achieve more and more, our social life becomes tainted and more demanding than ever before ... Instead of building true friendships, we're obsessed with endless personal promotion, investing hours on then building our profile, pursuing the optimal order of words in our next message, choosing the pictures in which we look our best."
Why it sucks: This is little more than an amalgamation of psuedoscientific Biotruths, or amateur extensions of real scientific knowledge to complex domains of human behavior. Normally this kind of stuff is used in the service of fringe movements like the paleo diet or men's rights activism, but the key denominator shared by most Biotruths is not only buying into the naturalistic fallacy but using it as an excuse to lecture others about how modern life is a sham.
In reality, the debate over social media in psychology is quite rich and evidence exists that it provides a number of social benefits to users. If you view social media as nothing but a vehicle for self-promotion, you're rich, an asshole or a web writer. If you think that the "social fabric" of the western world is weakening because of Twitter, you might also be an idiot.

Worst quotes: The screen that says, "FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO" (that's an exact count, by the way) while the protagonist scowls at a smartphone.
Why it sucks: If you were too tired to hang out, don't complain when all your friends are having fun without you. TAKE A NAP. Jesus.
For the record, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) originated not as an actual psychological theory, but as an in-joke among Harvard MBA candidates in 2004. Despite not actually being used by many real psychologists, FOMO has spawned similarly vague concepts like "MOMO," the "mystery of missing out" when your social media feeds fall silent. I'm with GQ's Will Welch, who argues that "#FOMO is really just another word for insecurity," which of course is "as old as typhoid, birthday parties, and fermented beverages" - or Cyborgology's Nathan Jurgenson, who points out that "missing out" is essential to online networking because "what we do offline is the fuel that runs the engine of social media."

I'll leave you with this excellent post from a FacePunch commenter on "Can We Auto-Correct Humanity?":
Simulation
The Robonaut simulation was developed to bridge a gap between operations and development activities. In theory, the only way to validate control algorithms, grasping algorithms, path planning, etc., is to interface directly with Robonaut. This method is less than desirable for several reasons. Firstly, it is always risky to test unverified control algorithms for the first time on robotic hardware; assurance that no damage will be done to the robot is essential. Secondly, there are far more users vying for Robonaut's time than there are hours in the day. Many of these users are from remote industry and university sites that, in addition to in-house engineers, desire access to Robonaut for research and testing. Finally, a separate platform for developing and refining telepresence interfaces was also desired for safety reasons. A simulation that matched the appearance, kinematics and dynamics of Robonaut could fill this gap in addition to providing the additional capabilities mentioned. During the design phase, the desire was to develop a simulation that would:
Serve as a platform to test new control theories and configurations without having to construct elaborate and expensive hardware mockups.
Provide a method for internal groups, as well as select industry and universities, to develop independent projects, theories, and software to control Robonaut.
Provide a method for Robonaut personnel to validate new control, inverse kinematics, path planning, etc. software with regard to safety and operational concerns. Increase situation awareness for the teleoperator; provide overlays of the current robot posture to compensate for limited field-of-view. Allow testing and development of new communication protocols and telepresence hardware without risk to Robonaut. Allow development of new kinematics and dynamics software control algorithms without risk to Robonaut. Perform forward and inverse kinematics on the head, left and right wrist, tail, and fingers for Cartesian space control. Permit joint space control within the simulation, as this capability is currently not allowed on Robonaut for certain operations. There are currently 43 degrees of freedom (DOF) on Robonaut with additional DOF already planned. Dynamically mimic Robonaut as closely as possible. Operate at or near real time speeds on laptop or desk side PCs. A minimum refresh rate would be 15 Hz with 30 Hz being optimal. Interface with standard current telepresence hardware such as Virtual Hand Technologies CyberGloves and Polhemus motion tracking sensors.
The current version of the simulation meets most of the criteria stated above. The only criteria it does not meet are finger Cartesian space control and rigid body dynamics. These will be added sometime in the near future. Current dynamics are limited to all 43 joints having hard limits and angular rate limits. This provides realistic motion without resorting to computationally more expensive methods.
A benefit of the simulation development is the derivation of communication protocols between Robonaut and the outside world. Initially, Robonaut was hard wired to all input devices. With the advent of the simulation, protocols have been developed which allow Robonaut to converse with outside control software, thus moving it one step closer to full teleoperation over long distances. The simulation also acts as a situation awareness tool since the simulation can be driven directly by Robonaut, thus showing the actual pose (as opposed to the command pose) to remote operators.
Another benefit of the simulation regards path planning. Now operators can test arm motions on difficult tasks before actual operation of the robot, thus minimizing the risk to the hardware.
The simulation was developed using Enigma Core and specially designed interfaces and IK for the 43 DOF Robonaut. The Enigma Core is a set of libraries developed in-house by NASA/JSC for computer animation and simulation. Enigma runs on Windows 95/98/2000/NT, SGI Irix, and Sun Solaris. It provides animation of shuttle mission operations for flight director briefings and media publications. Enigma also serves as a front-end graphics package for numerous NASA, industry, and university simulations. By using the Enigma Core, not only did we significantly reduce the development time of the Robonaut simulation, but we benefit from being able to record video, mpegs, and stills in various formats. All of the IK was developed specifically for Robonaut. Most of the IK was derived from Robonaut control algorithms such that the simulation would more closely match the actual hardware. All communications are handled through NDDS version 2.3 and specially designed data packets.
The first trial for the Robonaut simulation will be the Texas Fly-High Mentorship program experiment. This experiment will measure the effect of teleoperation on humans within a microgravity environment. The experiment will be conducted on the NASA KC-135 zero-G aircraft, affectionately known as the "Vomit Comet." In order to perform this experiment, the simulation will reside on two laptop PCs with two Virtual Hand Technologies CyberGloves, Polhemus motion sensors, and a telepresence helmet mounted display (HMD). The laptops will provide images for each eye, which in turn, will drive each eye in the HMD. The Robonaut simulation handles synchronization of the hardware and graphics. Test subjects will perform tasks against a virtual task board. It is hoped that this data will provide valuable insight into zero-G teleoperations.
The future of the Robonaut simulation is very bright indeed. Uses for the simulation are continuing to expand. Currently, new control algorithms for various appendages, grasping techniques, path planning, etc. are being developed using the simulation. Rigid body dynamics will be added in the near future. As with all software packages, the simulation will be developed based on the needs of its user group of people.
Analysis Tools
We used several novel analysis methods to design Robonaut, NASA's humanoid system developed to work in Earth orbit. One of the main goals of Robonaut is matching task requirements with a robot system configuration, synthesized with computational methods, interactive design and 3D visualization. Developed as a program called Optimus, the software's main analysis modules are kinematics, power flow (from electrical input into work and heat), thermal transient endurance modeling, and deflection of the multi- armed system subject to loading on all limbs. This software is then used to analyze specific tasks, with a spectrum of tasks then being considered for overall system optimization.
General Humanoid Model
This figure shows a generic multi-armed system, with N limbs, each with M degrees of freedom, for a total NxM mobility set. The D-H parameter structure is general for each segment, with the forward kinematic model therefore having 4xNxM design degrees of freedom (DDOF). The body, unconstrained, has an additional 6 axes of free motion, with 6 DDOF associated with the relative placement and orientation of each arm's origin on the central structure. The two armed, one legged model shown in the figure (N=3, M=7) has a total of 108 DDOF.
A database of drive train components is used to further refine the manipulator models. Drive train data includes motors (mass, motor constant, resistance, radius, length) and gearing (ratio, radius, torque, length), linked in a parametric model to 3D animation. Selection of drive elements determines joint volumes, masses, and motion ranges, which are then linked to the arm design. This interactive model is then driven by the analysis software modules, displaying candidate robot configurations for the human designer's review and guidance in the optimization process.
For given tasks, the first analysis is a workspace assessment, adjusting D-H parameters to allow the system to meet trajectory requirements, exploiting the self motion null spaces to minimize robot scale. The second step is a power analysis, matching trajectory force-speed requirements to arm kinetics, which are in turn linked to joint loads and a calculated set of motor torques, currents, and ultimately their resulting heating loads. This task analysis is time-based and produces an end-to-end thermal task profile that is used in a transient heat transfer model of the whole robot system. Thermal endurance can then be calculated for a spectrum of tasks, optimizing the robot for a broad class of humanoid service.
Late last week, our ESPN fantasy football experts held our third mock draft. Practice makes perfect, so take a few minutes and jump into an ESPN mock draft!
This time we expanded to 12 teams using a PPR (point per reception) format with standard roster construction.
You can check out our first mock draft, with a 10-team non-PPR setup, here. Our second mock, using a 10-team PPR system with two starting quarterbacks can be found here.
If you compare these three formats, you'll begin to see how the value of players changes depending on whether you tack on an extra point for each catch, start twice as many quarterbacks, or impact the size of the player pool by adding two more teams to your draft.
The participants in order of draft position are Leo Howell, Tristan H. Cockcroft, Joe Kaiser, Mike Clay, Stephania Bell, KC Joyner, Pierre Becquey, Field Yates, Kyle Soppe, Jim McCormick, Tom Carpenter and Matt Bowen.

When Danny Amendola went down in the St. Louis Ram's Thursday night win over the previously undefeated Arizona Cardinals, it was feared that he broke his collarbone and would miss the remainder of the season. Fortunately, it appears as if he has avoided that. If early reports are correct, Amendola only has a dislocated clavicle, which will keep him out until the end of November, but will allow him to return this year:
Source said #Rams WR Danny Amendola (dislocated clavicle) is expected to miss about 6-7 weeks. Better news than expected. — Adam Caplan (@caplannfl) October 5, 2012
Amendola was injured when he came down hard on his shoulder after leaping to try to catch a pass. He grabbed his shoulder as he left the field and was later seen on the sideline out of uniform and in a sling.
The Rams will take a bit hit in Amendola's absence. He is the Rams' leading receiver, with 32 catches for 395 yards on the season and a couple touchdowns, while also serving as the team's punt returning. But while losing him is a blow, a 6-7 week absence sure beats the rest of the season.

Wildlife photographer Norbert Rosing was taking photos in northern Canada when a polar bear arrived on the scene. Most of the tethered dogs went crazy, barking and jumping, and Rosing thought it was going to be the end of dog breeder Brian Ladoon's Canadian Eskimo sled dogs. But one dog, Hudson, remained calm and wagged his tail, and to Rosing's astonishment, the bear nuzzled the dog and in return, the dog licked the bear's face.
Then another polar bear arrived and began walking toward Ladoon's dog Barren, but the dog simply rolled onto his back and he and the bear began tumbling in the snow. Amazed, Rosing began snapping photos from the safety of his vehicle, and he witnessed the bears return for more playtime and cuddling sessions with the dogs every afternoon for 10 days in a row.
The heartwarming photographs of the dogs and polar bears can be viewed in Rosing's book “The World of the Polar Bear,” in which he recounts the charming story of these natural enemies' unexpected friendship.

Cargo jet reportedly carrying millions of South African rand and a stowaway landed in Harare for refuelling en route from Germany to South Africa
Zimbabwe aviation authorities have impounded a US-registered cargo jet after a dead body believed to be a stowaway and millions of South African rand were found on board.
The Herald, a state-run newspaper, reported that the MD-11 trijet was travelling from Germany to South Africa “with millions of rands”. At the current exchange rate, 1m rand is worth £43,866.
Officials learned the money belonged to the South Africa Reserve Bank. Police planned to issue a statement later on Monday.
David Chawota, the general manager of Zimbabwe's Civil Aviation Authority, said the plane had landed in Harare for refuelling. He said the jet, registered with Western Global Airlines, was impounded at Harare international airport on Sunday. Western Global Airlines is reportedly based in Estero, Florida.
The crew did not know there was someone else on the plane, according to a police officer. It appears from photos on social media that the person found dead had sneaked into the plane's landing gear. The Herald said the crew included two Americans, a South African and a Pakistani.
In 2004, Harare airport authorities impounded a plane with 64 people on board, who were arrested on accusations that they had been on their way to stage a coup in Equatorial Guinea.
Iran and Russia have threatened to hit back if the US follows up on its air strike in Syria last week, ramping up tensions in the Middle East.
It comes after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson cancelled a trip to Moscow and prepared a new diplomatic offensive against Russia.
He is also set to urge the Russians to pull their forces out, something which would involve a major loss of face for President Putin.
Eighty-nine people, including 33 children, died on Tuesday after a nerve agent was used in an attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in northern Syria.

The Assad regime has denied it was responsible and the Russians have claimed it was a 'false flag' incident carried out by jihadists who want to stir up tensions between Russia and the US.
President Trump infuriated Moscow when he authorised an airstrike on a Syrian air base on Friday, which killed at least six people.
British Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said today it was the 'right call' for the Americans to bomb the air base as retribiution for a 'barbaric, immoral and illegal' act by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who he described as a Russian 'proxy'.
But in a joint statement the Russian and Iranians said: 'We will respond to any aggression'.
The Sun reported that a joint command centre in Syria said: 'What America waged in an aggression on Syria is a crossing of red lines. From now on we will respond with force to any aggressor or any breach of red lines from whoever it is and America knows our ability to respond well.'
The nerve agent attack happened in Khan Sheikhoun, in rebel-held territory and the US fired missiles at al-Shayrat airfield in response
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani earlier condemned 'flagrant US aggression on Syria' following the Tomahawk strike on al-Shayrat.
While Russia's support for the Assad regime dates back to the 1970s and 80s when Bashar's father, Hafez, was a stalwart supporter of the Soviet Union and an implacable enemy of Israel, Iran's support is based on religion.
Assad is from the Alawite minority and has long nursed fears of a rebellion by the Sunni majority and has welcomed the support of Iran, an overwhelmingly Shia Muslim country which also has reason to fear Sunnis.
Boris Johnson has pulled out of a visit to Moscow in the wake of the Syrian chemical weapons attack saying 'we deplore Russia's continued defence of the Assad regime'
Boris Johnson, who was due to visit Russia tomorrow for talks with counterpart Sergey Lavrov, said yesterday: 'We deplore Russia's continued defence of the Assad regime'.
He called off the visit at the last minute after a midnight phone call with US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, which led to accusations by Russia that Britain had no independent foreign policy.
Lavrov spoke to Tillerson last night and he reportedly told the American 'that an attack on a country whose government is fighting against terrorism is only playing into extremists' hands'.

Mr Johnson said: 'We deplore Russia's continued defence of the Assad regime even after the chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians,' he said.
'My priority is now to continue contact with the US and others in the run up to the G7 meeting on 10-11 April.'
Mr Johnson then called on Russia to do 'everything possible to bring about a political settlement in Syria and work with the rest of the international community to ensure that the shocking events of the last week are never repeated'.
But Alex Salmond, the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman, said Johnson's move made him look him 'some sort of Mini Me' who cannot be trusted to hold his own talks withLavrov.
Salmond said : 'Boris Johnson just looks daft. What is the argument for not going ahead with a visit? Rex Tillerson is going on Wednesday so it can't be that we have moved to a Cold War position of no talking whatsoever.
'The idea the Foreign Secretary can't be trusted because he might pursue his own line or have an independent thought or crossover what the Americans are going to say just makes him look like some sort of Mini Me to the United States of America.'
But the Sunday Telegraph claims Johnson is trying to persuade Tillerson to move back to the original plan for regime change in Damascus.
Johnson's visit would have been the first visit by a UK foreign secretary in more than five years.
It comes as Britain gave full backing to the dramatic US missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to Bashar al-Assad's 'barbaric' chemical attack - with Theresa May having given her blessing to Donald Trump before it happened.
Mr Johnson attacked the Kremlin and said he would instead focus on building support with allies to secure a ceasefire in war-torn Syria

For 75 months it has been the same story. The nine members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee gather, consider all the latest evidence and decide that official interest rates should remain at 0.5%.
Interest rates are at rock-bottom levels pretty much everywhere in the developed world and the moment for raising them continues to be pushed back. But central banks have not just relied on interest rates. They have also been active in the financial markets, exchanging bonds and other assets for cash. This process, known as quantitative easing, has increased the supply of money and driven down long-term interest rates.
For a while, finance ministries also did their part. During the worst of the crisis in 2008-09, they cut taxes and increased spending in order to boost economic activity. In Britain, the result of running much bigger annual budget deficits led to a doubling of the national debt as a share of economic output from 40% to 80%.
The stimulus worked, but only up to a point. The US, for example, has a history of bouncing back from recessions but growth has averaged only 2% a year in the six years since the economy bottomed out. Put another way, America's most severe post-war recession has been followed by the weakest recovery. The eurozone is on course to post growth of around 1.5% this year - and that's considered good. By recent standards, it is.
After all this time and all that effort, central banks would also not have expected inflation to be so low. Yet in the UK, the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index has gone negative for the first time in half a century. Earnings are increasing at half their pre-crisis rate. So, seen from the perspective of both growth and inflation, there is good reason for central banks to be wary of tightening policy.
There are, though, other reasons why central banks might want to raise interest rates or to start unwinding QE. One is that too much stimulus for too long, particularly if it is of the unconventional sort, can have unintended consequences. Interest rates at close to zero plus oodles of cheap credit have encouraged a search for yield, the hunt for investments that provide a decent return. This, inevitably, means riskier bets, as it did in the years leading up to the financial crisis. One key lesson of that period is that crises can erupt even when inflation is low.
The second reason central banks would have liked by now to have returned policy to a more normal setting is that they have little wriggle room if things turn nasty again. Official forecasts always assume that economies will enjoy reasonable levels of growth with modest levels of inflation. But, regular as clockwork, stuff happens. Recessions occur, often suddenly, and for all sorts of reasons. In those circumstances, central bankers and finance ministers need firepower. Ideally, they want to be in a position to slash interest rates, run bigger budget deficits and, if necessary, resort to the more unconventional instruments such as QE.
This firepower is currently lacking. On average, the US Federal Reserve has cut its main interest rate by five percentage points in each of the recessions since the 1970s. That's impossible with interest rates so close to zero. Increasing QE runs the risk of further inflating share prices, which are already high. Governments can always spend and borrow more in times of trouble, but ideally would like to have built up a war chest first. In most countries, this has proved impossible.
Given time, central banks and finance ministries will replenish their ammunition. Interest rates will gradually be raised. Growth will lead to higher tax returns and lower spending on welfare. It would be greatly beneficial were the global economy to be set fair for a repeat of what Lord Mervyn King described as the Nice decade (non-inflationary, continual expansion).

But this can't be guaranteed. Imagine that Greece defaults on its debts and returns to the drachma, with knock-on effects on the eurozone and the wider global economy. Or that the recent plunge in shares on the Shanghai stock exchange are the portent of a hard landing in China. Or that the recent rise in bond yields (the interest rate paid) is a sign of a bubble about to burst.
Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC, calls this the world's “Titanic problem”, by which he means there are plenty of icebergs but no lifeboats. So what are the options for policymakers? King lists six. Firstly, they could try to avoid hitting one of the icebergs. They tighten supervision and regulation of the financial sector, force banks to hold more capital, keep a wary eye on asset prices. But the next crisis might not originate from the banks. It might stem from the insurance industry, struggling to cope with ultra-low interest rates or from over-leveraged hedge funds.
Secondly, they could do more QE. Given the limited success of QE so far, coupled with the risk of dangerous side-effects, this looks unlikely to be all that effective. Thirdly, they could decide to ignore the fact that inflation is well below the targets set for central banks and decide that the threat of asset-price bubbles warrants higher interest rates. This might trigger the recession policymakers are seeking to avoid.
Fourthly, they could decide to turn to fiscal policy – tax cuts and higher public spending – on the grounds that there was little scope to boost the economy through interest rates and QE. But as King notes, this is only possible if governments are “willing and able to tolerate deficits and debt levels far higher than seen in the peacetime past”.
Fifthly, they could resort to “helicopter drops” of money, which is where a central bank creates money and the finance ministry hands it out in the form of tax cuts or higher public spending. There are two downsides with this option. One is that in some countries, including the UK, the increased spending would result in higher imports and a balance of payments crisis. The second is the risk of hyper-inflation.
King says his sixth and final option would be to raise retirement ages. There is a global glut of savings, he says, caused by people salting money away for their old age. Working longer would mean people spending more, raising growth rates. This would boost tax revenues and allow interest rates to rise. Governments would once again have some ammo, but at the expense of political unpopularity.
King says that if history is any guide, we are probably closer to the next US recession than the last one. Back in 2008-09, there were lifeboats even if there weren't enough of them. Next time, if there is a next time, the losses would be worse.
Infamous Internet troll and so-called “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli has been suspended from Twitter after a spat with Lauren Duca, weekend editor for Teen Vogue and a freelance writer for the publication, on the social media platform.
Shkreli is, of course, infamous for the price hike of an anti-parasitic medicine, Daraprim, in 2015 and has been a notorious figure on the Internet ever since.
It all began when Shkreli sent Duca a direct message inviting her to attend Donald Trump's inauguration later this month. “I would rather eat my own organs,” she replied publicly.

Shkreli went on to change his profile image to a photo of Duca and her husband with Shkreli's face Photoshopped in over his. He also changed his banner image to a collage of photos of Duca and his bio to read “also i have a small crush on @laurenduca (hope she doesn't find out).”
Twitter has since intervened and suspended Shkreli's account. “I will miss Twitter but my love for Lauren will never die.” Shkreli told Breitbart News in the wake of his suspension.
Duca recently appeared on Fox News with Tucker Carlson, where she defended the man who harassed Ivanka Trump on a JetBlue flight last month. Since appearing on Fox, Duca has been a target for criticism on social media.
At the time she tweeted, “Ivanka Trump is poised to become the most powerful woman in the world. Don't let her off the hook because she looks like she smells good.”

She's also been a vocal critic of President-elect Trump, penning a scathing piece calling him a “sexual predator” and saying that his rise to power “has awakened a force of bigotry by condoning and encouraging hatred.”
In a bizarre twist to the Shkreli-Duca Twitter feud, a new meme has been born after this man chimed in to the ongoing debacle, with some ill-conceived advice for women everywhere (or at least women on Twitter):
“Have kids get married and be happy – feminism leads down a dark path of cats, pizza, and wine.” So said Internet philosopher @GorillaRadio_Tv:
@BadassGinsburg @laurenduca @everywhereist have kids get married and be happy- feminism leads down a dark path of cats, pizza, and wine — Alan John (@GorillaRadio_Tv) January 6, 2017
Other Twitter users jumped on the thread and flooded the conversation with photos of themselves with wine, pizza, and cats … seemingly endorsing them as good things, despite@GorillaRadio_Tv's dire warnings against them :

French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, a first-timer aboard the International Space Station, ventured out into the void of space for his first spacewalk on Friday. While he spent nearly 6 hours working outside the orbiting laboratory, Pesquet snapped several photos, including some spectacular self-portraits.
Pesquet may be a spacewalking rookie, but he breezed through this first spacewalk like a veteran. NASA astronaut and International Space Station (ISS) commander Shane Kimbrough joined Pesquet on the spacewalk, and the duo finished all primary objectives in half the allotted time before knocking out the entire list of optional “get-ahead” tasks.
The goal of the spacewalk was to complete the installation of new lithium-ion batteries and accompanying adapter plates. This was needed to wrap up a major power upgrade that began in December, when the new batteries arrived on the Japanese HTV-6 cargo spacecraft. [Spacewalk Photos: International Space Station Gets a Power Upgrade]
Both Kimbrough and Pesquet carried cameras during the spacewalk to photograph parts of the space station for ground controllers, who will use the pictures for future reference and planning upcoming EVAs (extravehicular activities).
Pesquet took also took the opportunity to snap his first-ever spacewalk selfie. Planet Earth and Pesquet's camera-wielding hand are seen in the reflection of the astronaut's gold-tinted sun visor. The camera is strapped to the hand of Pesquet's Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), or spacesuit, to keep it from floating off and getting lost in space.

In another spacewalk photo, Pesquet points the camera down at his feet and to the Earth below -- 250 miles below, that is. “This is what a spacewalk is: 400 km of void under your feet,” Pesquet tweeted along with the photo. To the right of his dangling legs is what appears to be either a Russian Soyuz or Progress spacecraft currently docked at the space station.
When Pesquet isn't spacewalking outside the ISS, he still takes plenty of photos of Earth from inside the orbiting lab. Check out more of Pesquet's amazing photos from space in this Space.com gallery.

XCOM is a great game. It can also be a very frustrating game, particularly if you aren't used to turn-based tactical strategy. That's why I'm here to help (note: the actual helpfulness of these rules is open to some debate).
Editor Note: If you've read any of Chris Kluwe's recent articles online, you know that his vocabulary is sometimes not safe for work...or children...or lovers of cats. Reader discretion is advised.
Rule 1: Save Early, Save Often
When you first start playing XCOM, you should probably play it on normal difficulty and no Ironman. There are a variety of lessons the game will teach you, and the vast majority of them involve your squad dying horrible and painfully messy deaths. You will learn about cover (it's a good thing). You will learn about flanking (it's a good thing when you do it, not so good when the enemy does it). You will learn about staggered fields of fire, keeping a tactical reserve, and why clustering your troops together against grenade opponents is Tactically Unsound. Every single time you learn one of these lessons, it will be because someone just died, and IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT. Hit "load" and try again.
Rule 2: Stop Saving And Nut Up
After you have the basics down pat, it's time to play for real. Start a new game on whatever difficulty you prefer, but click the Ironman box in advanced options. This prevents you from reloading an earlier save, and makes all your actions permanent. Lose a squaddie, and he/she is gone for good. YOU MURDERER. This is a good thing, however, as it will cause you to become much more attached to the hapless meat vessels you're so casually toying with. When Sergeant Herpaderp takes a heavy plasma rifle to the face because you decided to run him through the front door of a building you didn't clear properly, you'll gain a newfound appreciation of just how important he was to the squad.
Rule 3: Always Send The Rookie In First
Sergeant Herpaderp has a wife and three kids. Rookie Fister McGrundle is unloved and molests cats in his spare time. If you're going to kill one off, make the right choice. Always send the rookie in first. There's plenty more where he came from.
Rule 4: Rocket Science Is Your Friend
Build satellites. Build LOTS of satellites. Build uplink nodes to control your satellites. The essential resource in XCOM isn't scientists, or squad members, or engineers – it's straight cash, homey. With cash you can buy everything you need (and you'll need a lot). Without cash, you're staring at a mountain of insurmountable obstacles while E.T. wags his stupid glowing finger at you and laughs. You just researched a plasma rifle? Whoop-dee-friggin-do. If you can't buy it, you might as well be throwing Ding-Dongs at a Muton Berserker.
Rule 5: Know When To Launch Your Satellites
Whenever you launch a satellite, the country you launch it in immediately drops two Panic levels. Don't blow your space load right away. Wait until right before the end of the month, and then launch satellites to bring red Panic level countries back into the fold. This can mean the difference between a prosperous United States contributing 180 space bucks a month versus a Thin Man fiesta in your bedroom. No one wants to clean up after one of those.
Rule 6: Go Straight For Plasma
No one cares about beam weapons. They're stupid, look ugly, and will most likely give you scabies. Go plasma or go home.
Rule 7: Squaddies Stick Together
Your beautifully dysfunctional team is absolutely worthless if everyone runs around playing John Rambo. You need a scouting element, fire support, an assault component, and medical backup if you want to get through the tougher missions, and all of these units have to work together. Understand how the game mechanics work; when you think there's a group of enemies up ahead, make sure you can bring firepower to bear when you disturb them. If you don't, you're giving them a free turn of shooting, and if Corporal Facecheck runs into a nest of Heavy Floaters, you might as well break out the memorial urn now. Bring buddies or bring a body bag.
Rule 8: Never Run Into A Sectopod Without Serious Firepower And Oh My God Now It's Firing Reaction Shots With A Small Nuclear Cannon And Dropping Mortar Rockets On Cars
Fairly self-explanatory.
Rule 9: Sell Your Crap
The gray market is the perfect place to get money in a hurry, and you can sell anything you get from missions. I wouldn't advise selling any higher-end corpses, elerium, or weapon fragments, but you don't really need 18 UFO flight computers, so dump a couple of those bad boys off for some cold hard credits. Treat yourself to a pretzel and an Orange Julius while you're at it. Killing aliens is hard work.
Rule 10: Never Name Your Squad Members After Someone You Care About
Seriously, you're just asking to get them killed. Name them after an ex, or that dog you had that kept crapping on the couch. You'll feel much better when they inevitably get head-asploded after you miss three straight 95% accuracy shots on a target that absolutely has to die. Alternatively, name them all "Andy Reiner" and cackle with glee as they continuously pay the price for letting you down.
Rule 10a: Never Trust Accuracy Percentages In The Game
If you have three squaddies available, and one target that absolutely has to die, maneuver as if each half-blind, drooling imbecile you've somehow trusted with a gun is guaranteed to miss their incredibly crucial shot. Because they will. Miss. Repeatedly. It's a wonder they can tie their own shoes.
Hopefully these rules will lead to salvation of the human race in your game of XCOM. If they don't, write your own stupid rules. I'm too busy keeping Lieutenant Chodehammer from drinking all the paint thinner in the barracks. F---ing squaddies.
Chris "Warcraft" Kluwe is the Minnesota Vikings' punter, Tripping Icarus' bass player, and Andrew Reiner's Pokémon.

One of the shooting victims was in stable condition while the other was critical, officers said.
The roadway was shut down in the area while investigators processed the scene.
By 5:30 p.m., University Boulevard had reopened.
"Whether these were intended victims, we don't even know," Melbourne Police spokeswoman Lt. Cheryl Trainer said. "Obviously (the shooters) didn't have any regard for the people that were in the area; the people who were working here in the buildings; people who might be at the U-Mart, the business itself."

Katy Perry's Grammy performance last night, a stripped-down rendition of “By the Grace of God,” was introduced with a message from President Obama about violence against women and a moving speech from Brooke Axtell, a poet and anti-violence activist who spoke bluntly about her experience as a survivor of abuse.
In her speech, Axtell addressed the powerful mix of emotions and instincts -- love, shame, compassion, denial -- that kept her locked into the relationship. “I believed he was lashing out because he was in pain, and needed help. I believed my compassion could restore him and our relationship,” she said. “I was terrified of him and ashamed I was in this position. What bound me to him was my desire to heal him. My compassion was incomplete because it did not include me.”

I have little doubt that Axtell's words resonated with other survivors watching in the audience and at home, and hopefully she will inspire victims of abuse to find help where they can. And while bringing a message about intimate partner violence to millions of viewers is obviously a good thing, there is something odd to me about Perry and the Grammys' short-sightedness about the issue they apparently wanted to bring center stage last night.
Most of the headlines about Perry's performance, even in advance of the show, were about her sharing the stage with a survivor of domestic violence. In an interview with Slate, Axtell said that Grammys executive producer Ken Ehrlich had asked her to be part of the show as a way for the Grammys "to speak about issues that are important to them." But one thing I kept thinking as I read story after story about Axtell's presence onstage was how, in reality, it isn't unique to perform with a survivor of domestic violence. It happens all the time, we just don't talk about it.
Going on the data we have about the pervasiveness of violence against women in the United States, it actually seems that it would be unusual if the Grammys didn't feature a survivor. We know that the Grammys have featured Rihanna and other high-profile women who have experienced abuse in their relationships. Similarly, a big production Grammy performance, with backup singers and dancers, also almost definitely features a woman who was at one point a victim of intimate partner violence. That is just what the numbers tell us. One in four women will experience abuse in her lifetime. We interact with them daily. They are our neighbors. Our bosses. The singers we love. We know them. They are us.
Which is maybe why Perry's performance left me with a feeling of, Thus concludes our anti-domestic violence portion of the evening, now back to our regularly scheduled coddling of abusers. This is so often how we are asked to think about domestic violence, as something separate and foreign and distinct from the rest of our lives. An issue to be addressed solemnly and then ignored completely.
But living out the kind of awareness President Obama called for -- “a culture where violence is intolerable, where survivors are supported” -- requires more than just a performance at the Grammys that gives a platform to one survivor's voice, no matter how powerful that one voice may be. If the Grammys and artists like Perry want to take domestic violence seriously, "to speak about issues that are important to them," then they'll need to start incorporating this perspective more broadly in the partnerships they seek out and the artists they celebrate and perform alongside.
Perry, who recently told Rolling Stone that she was “all about female empowerment,” performed earlier this month at the NFL's Super Bowl halftime show. The NFL has long protected violent players and coddled the coaches and executives who have helped conceal their abuse, but 2014 was a year in which it became impossible to look away or feign ignorance. And yet Perry performed during the league's halftime show.

And while producers at the Grammys may, rightly, feel good about giving Axtell a platform, they also gave Chris Brown, a domestic abuser with a history of other violence, a platform in 2014. And Brown, along with alleged serial rapist R. Kelly, were both nominees this year.
This isn't easy work, ending a culture that props up abusers and creating space for survivors to speak. And while I was moved by Axtell's speech, Perry's and the Grammys' commitment to the issue rings incredibly hollow. Axtell's remarks were so powerful in part because of how candid she was about her own struggle. Leaving the relationship wasn't an easy process for her. She spoke directly to the messy realities of what survival looks like for women in abusive relationships. But the Grammys can't match Axtell in her bravery or vulnerability. It wants its involvement in the issue to be clean -- a feel-good performance to raise “awareness' about domestic violence -- while the actual, messy work of making abuse unacceptable and holding abusers accountable is left to others.
Update: A reader brought it to my attention that Eminem also won awards this year in two non-televised categories. Eminem took home best sung/rap collaboration and best rap album, an award he also won 14 years ago. The list of women Eminem has rapped about violently abusing or sexually degrading includes but is not limited to: Kim Mathers, Lana Del Rey, Pamela Anderson, Mariah Carey, Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian.
I'm not a fan of WordPress, as it is neither cloud-ready nor serverless. That's why this blog runs on CloudFront and S3 and is built by Hexo. But 25% of all websites are proudly published with WordPress. You will learn about the easiest way to run WordPress on AWS . Including fault tolerance and scalability.
The following figure shows the architecture of a fault tolerant and scalable WordPress environment on AWS.
Read on to learn more!
The problem
WordPress is a PHP application using two different data storages: a MySQL database and files on disk. Storing files on disk is a problem if you want to make use of a fleet of EC2 instances to run WordPress in a fault tolerant and scalable fashion.
The following example and figure are illustrating the problem.
Mary is uploading a new image for her blog post. The image file is stored on EC2 instance number 1. Mary is reading through her article. EC2 instance number 1 is answering her HTTP request to get the image. Bob is reading Mary's article. EC2 instance number 2 is answering his HTTP request with a 404 Not Found error, as the image is stored only on EC2 instance number 1.
Tricky, you need to find a way to either synchronize files between all EC2 instances or outsource the files to a managed service.
The solution, 1st try
I tried to solve the problem of running WordPress on AWS before. WordPress on AWS: you are holding it wrong describes the solution in detail.
To summarize it briefly:
Using a WordPress plugin to store user uploads like images on S3 instead of storing them on disk.
Disabling all other WordPress features that are writing files to disk: install and update plugins or themes, the auto-updater, and writing a .htaccess file.
file. Automating the process of installing WordPress with all of its plugins and themes during the boot process of each EC2 instance.
But not being able to install plugins and themes and to use the auto-updater is inconvenient.
The solution, 2nd try
The Elastic File System service (EFS) joined the AWS family in January 2016. EFS is a highly available and scalable network file system that you can connect to your EC2 instances by using the NFS protocol. The perfect place to outsource files.
The following figure shows how each EC2 instance running WordPress is connecting to EFS to read and write files. You don't need to distinguish between user uploads and files belonging to WordPress itself.
The diagram was created with Cloudcraft - Visualize your cloud architecture like a pro.
As a network call is necessary every time your EC2 instances want to read a file from EFS, it is important to have file caching in place.
Especially for .php files, as WordPress needs to access a lot of .php files for each incoming request. Something you can solve with opcache quickly.
Caching static files is necessary as well. Because each visitor of your WordPress blog will need to load the same .css and .js files a CDN like CloudFront is a perfect fit.
The following figure shows the complete architecture of WordPress on AWS based on these services:
CloudFront: CDN for dynamic and static content
ELB (Elastic Load Balancer): load balancer forwarding requests to EC2 instances and terminating SSL
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): virtual machines running the web servers
EFS (Elastic File System): storage for WordPress files (WordPress core, plugins, themes, and user uploads)
RDS (Relational Database Service): MySQL database
The diagram was created with Cloudcraft - Visualize your cloud architecture like a pro.
The deployment
Do you want to run WordPress on AWS by using EFS as described above? I have created a CloudFormation template that you can use to create the needed cloud infrastructure within minutes including the following features:
Reliable: Fault tolerant and scalable due to multi-AZ usage
Secure: HTTPS only
Fast: CDN caching static content
Growing: scalable file storage for endless user uploads

Actors Who Are Pro Gun
In la-la land when tend to think in terms of Liberals and Conservatives, we find that Liberals are far and away more numerous in the acting profession than Conservatives. That seems pretty clear, though I feel many right leaners tend to stay quiet about their views in order to have a career and I won't fault them for that.
But here is the funny thing, the right to keep and bear arms is not a Liberal v Conservative issue (though it often falls that way), it is a control v freedom issue and many of my friends who are center left have come to embrace gun ownership as part of the American identity. While we may not agree on healthcare, taxes or any other big government socialist like agenda's we come together on the 2nd Amendment.
It is the notion of freedom and control of one's own destiny that has seen a large increase in gun ownership in both women and liberals.
It comes at no surprise then that there are many actors in Hollywood that keep themselves armed. So long as they don't pull the traditional liberal hypocrisy of saying THEY deserve to be armed while the peons should go without, I will not fault them for their other misguided notions for they got the most important one right.
Of course you have the Tom Selleck‘s of the world who are notable in their support of the 2nd Amendment and an open supporter of the NRA and the Luke Bryan‘s (country singer) who is the co-owner of Buck Commander.
But then you have some other stars who you may be surprised to know take gun ownership and protecting their family personally.
Stars like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.
Jolie: “Brad and I are not against having a gun in the house, and we do have one. And yes, I'd be able to use it if I had to… If anybody comes into my home and tries to hurt my kids, I've no problem shooting them.” Pitt: “America is a country founded on guns. It's in our DNA. It's very strange, but I feel better having a gun. I really do. I don't feel safe, I don't feel the house is completely safe, if I don't have one hidden somewhere. That's my thinking, right or wrong.”
Very sensible opinion. Now, do I expect the couple to go out and campaign against the SAFE Act, or lobby the federal government to do away with Title II requirements? No. But I know a lot of “traditional” gun owners who don't believe in the individuals right to own so-called “assault” weapons. I think Pitt and Jolie have the understanding of the basis of gun ownership and in Hollywood that's a pretty big step.
Other Hollywood stars offering different logical views on guns:
James Earl Jones: “The world is filled with violence. Because criminals carry guns, we decent law-abiding citizens should also have guns. Otherwise they will win and the decent people will lose.” Christian Slater offers up a classic: “It's better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it.”
And while we have country singers who is a one would traditionally view as pro gun such as Luke Bryan and Miranda Lambert, Lambert takes on a very Libertarian view on the whole thing;
Lambert: “I carry a weapon. I got a death threat a few years ago and was really scared. But I don't want bodyguards. I am my own security.”
While some personalities have grown with the idea of the 2nd Amendment others have had the ephiphany dawn on them in dramatic fashion such as The View's co-host Sherri Shepherd:
Shepherd (after being the victim of a home invasion): “I have nothing, a bat, nothing. We're going to get a gun.”
But bar none the Hollywood Star that spoke about gun control is the Clint Eastwood.
Eastwood: “I have a very strict gun control policy: if there's a gun around, I want to be in control of it.”
Now that is sensible gun control I can get behind.

The 2016 election was the gift that keeps on giving for the Libertarian Party. The Libertarian Party of Iowa (LPIA) will soon officially be given major party status, allowing libertarians to be on the ballot in future state elections, and greater exposure for its candidates.
“We plan to have a record number of candidates in 2018,” said LPIA Chair Keith Laube in an interview for IVN. “There were a record 25 Libertarian candidates on the ballot in Iowa in 2016. We have been building a base of Libertarian registered voters in Iowa since 2008, the first year Iowa voters could register as a Libertarian. Our plan is to reach out to voters to continue increasing the number of registered Libertarians in Iowa.”
Iowa state law allows political parties to gain status when 2 percent of the vote is earned by the party's presidential candidate. Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential candidate in 2016, received a little over 3 percent in the state — about the same percentage he got at the national level.

We plan to have a record number of candidates in 2018. LPIA Chair Keith Laube
American elections have always been dominated by the two-party system at every institutional level of elections and the political landscape. The plight of third parties to get on the ballot has been a long struggle. Ballot access is easy for Democrats and Republicans, but that isn't the case for Libertarians or other third party candidates.
And while the Libertarian Party has garnered ballot access and party status in several states after 2016, Laube says obstacles remain to keeping the LP's party status.
“Per Iowa code, to maintain party status in Iowa a party must receive at least 2% of the vote for the top of the ticket. So in 2018, our governor candidate must receive at least 2% of the vote,” he explained. “We met with state officials and have been conversing back and forth with them as we go through the transition in party status. The state officials have been very professional and good to work with.”
Laube added:
“We need to continue to educate voters that Libertarian candidates are very capable of serving at the State and Federal level. Libertarian views attract qualified candidates who run for office because they want positive change to occur in Iowa. Libertarian candidates are often independent thinkers who do not want to be dragged along with the partisan political baggage that comes with the two older parties.”
And there may be no greater time to be a libertarian. The Libertarian Party has gained popularity amongst voters as more people break off from the Democratic and Republican parties in dissatisfaction. Supporters of the Libertarian party share a common belief that the government should be less involved in people's lives, in the household and with their wallets.
As such, libertarians tend to be viewed as fiscally conservative and socially open or liberal or tolerant. Such a stance on government and domestic and foreign policy is making the party more attractive to many voters because such an approach looks outside the current political establishment for solutions.
“I believe Libertarian candidates in 2018 will rely on the majority of the population who want to have their individual liberties restored and who desire a more accountable,” Laube said. “As a major party, 2018 will be the first year our candidates will be able to participate in the Primary Election. Candidates will know they are on the ballot in early June rather than late August. This will create stronger campaigns and allow voters to learn about our candidates and issues earlier in the election cycle. Having more candidates talk about issues earlier in the election cycle is a positive for Iowans.”
Iowa's secretary of state will make LPIA's party status official on March 1.

UPDATE:Greg Gasiciel's 9.32-pound smallmouth bass has been certified by Michigan DNR as the new state record! Read their release here.
Greg Gasiciel had a day to remember fishing Hubbard Lake in Northeast Michigan on October 18, 2015. Gasiciel landed the next state-record smallmouth bass for Michigan when he caught a 9.32-pound bass on a watermelon seed 5-inch Yamamoto Super Grub on a split-shot rig. The fish was weighed on certified scales and verified by Kathrin Schrouder, a DNR fisheries biologist in Bay City. He eclipsed a record that has stood for more than 100 years. The old record was caught from Long Lake in 1906 and weighed 9.25 pounds.
Enjoy the pictures of this behemoth of a smallmouth bass. What a fishing dream come true! Congratulations Greg!

In a two sentence statement, Ohio Supreme Court Justice Sharon Kennedy said that she will not recuse herself in a contentious abortion case that could close Toledo's only abortion clinic.
On Thursday, Capital Care Network asked Kennedy to recuse herself from their case, arguing that Kennedy's recent speech at a Greater Toledo Right to Life event damaged the appearance of impartiality. “Having reviewed the request, I find it to be without merit and will continue to participate in the case,” Kennedy wrote in response to the request. Kennedy spoke at the event two days after the Ohio Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of Capital Care's case.

Prior to Capital Care's challenge, two previous complaints were filed against Kennedy. In April, a grievance over conflict of interest was made to the Ohio State Bar Association after Kennedy's appearance at the anti-abortion's group's annual breakfast. In May, a second complaint was filed with the Ohio Supreme Court's Office of Disciplinary Counsel by ProgressOhio and signed by 51 individuals and groups, including Physicians Action Network, NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, and the National Organization for Women.
In June, the Toledo Blade reported that a judicial panel dismissed the second complaint against Kennedy. The panel wrote that “good cause does not exist for further investigation of the grievance.” According to an editorial written by Ohio Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor, Kennedy did not violate any ethics rules by appearing at the Greater Toledo Right to Life event because she did not directly address Capital Care's pending case. “She did not discuss or refer to any cases pending before the Supreme Court of Ohio, nor did she mention abortion and the host group's positions,” O'Connor wrote. The Toledo Ohio Right to Life has also argued that the event was not a fundraiser but rather a “legislative briefing,” and noted that Kennedy spoke only about the Constitution.
After the second complaint against Kennedy was dismissed, the Capital Care asked Kennedy to recuse herself. The Associated Press reports that the clinic's lawyer “said the Ohio Code of Judicial Conduct requires justices to disqualify themselves any time their impartiality ‘might be reasonably questioned.'” Kennedy turned down their request. According to Kennedy's campaign website, her 2014 candidacy was endorsed by numerous anti-abortion groups, including Ohio Right to Life and Ohio ProLife Action.

At issue is whether or not the clinic can stay open. In 2014, the Ohio Department of Health ordered that Capital Care shut its doors for allegedly violating state-imposed restrictions. Ohio requires that abortion clinics maintain a transfer agreement with local a local hospital. Capital Care had an agreement with University of Toledo Medical Center until 2013 when the state passed a law that effectively barred public institutions from partnering with abortion clinics. Though Capital Care later secured a transfer agreement with the University of Michigan, an examiner from the Ohio Department of Health ruled that the 52-mile distance between Capital Care and the University of Michigan did not satisfy the “local” requirement of the state's law. Though “local” was not clearly defined at the time, the law was later amended to define “local” as within a 30-mile radius.
Capital Care sued the state shortly after the Ohio Department of Health ordered the clinic shut. Two lower courts have previously sided with the clinic, allowing it to stay open. The state appealed those decisions to the Ohio Supreme Court. The court will hear Capital Care's case on September 12.
The new Giving USA report shows a slight downturn for churches and other religious organizations against an improving charity landscape. American individuals, groups, foundations and corporations gave $335 billion in 2013—a 3 percent increase from 2012, adjusted for inflation. It's the fourth consecutive year in which giving rose after taking a beating during the recession that officially ended in 2009. But religious groups saw donations drop 1.6 percent from 2012 to 2013. That contrasts to healthy jumps in education (7.4 percent), the arts and humanities (6.3 percent) and environmental and animal groups (6 percent), according to the study, which Giving USA produced with the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. Still, the religious sector continues to collect a greater proportion of total charitable giving—31 percent—than any other, the report shows. The next-largest share of the philanthropic pie went to education, with 16 percent of donors' dollars. The Giving USA study drew on many government and private groups for data, including the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Census Bureau.
Many Americans don't want atheist in-laws. A new Pew Research survey shows Americans divided when someone in the family picks a nonbeliever to marry. Atheists are the most unwanted future relative, by far. Nearly half—49 percent—of Americans say they would be unhappy if a member of their immediate family picked an unbeliever for a spouse. Respondents most likely to be upset are Americans who identify themselves as “consistently conservative” (73 percent); Protestants (64 percent), including 77 percent of white non-Hispanic evangelical Protestants; Republicans or those who lean that way (59 percent); and Roman Catholics (55 percent). By contrast, only 9 percent overall said they would be upset by the prospect of a relative wedding a “born again” Christian. The questions were part of a comprehensive look at polarization in U.S. society. The overall survey, conducted from January through March 2014, was of 10,013 people, but only about a third were asked the marriage questions. The margin of error for that portion of the survey is plus or minus 2 percentage points.
Regional UCC votes to boycott Redskins. The United Church of Christ for the mid-Atlantic region passed a resolution asking its 40,000 members not to buy game tickets or wear any souvenir gear of the Washington NFL club until it changes its embattled team name.The resolution, which also calls on the team to change its name and refrain from using American Indian imagery, passed unanimously at the UCC's Central Atlantic Conference in Dover, Del. The UCC has nearly 1 million members nationwide and more than 5,100 congregations, including 185 in its mid-Atlantic region of Washington, D.C., Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware and parts of Virginia and West Virginia. The Protestant denomination is headquartered in Cleveland and has been active in protests against the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo mascot.
Alert readers may have spotted that the “Vote No Borders” cinema advert featured on this much-viewed Wings article from a few days ago can no longer be played from the campaign group's YouTube page, returning a “Private” error.
An even more alert reader, however, had already made a copy.
And while the entire series of ads has now been effectively banned by all of Scotland's cinema chains, all the other ones are still present on the website while the NHS one (described as “a light-hearted sketch”) has vanished. And now we've found out why.
The above is an email sent to a Wings Over Scotland reader from Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, probably the UK's – if not the world's – most famous such institution. As the transcript linked above shows, GOSH was cited in the VNB ads with the suggestion that it would become “out of bounds” to Scottish children (or as the ad put it, “foreigners”) should Scotland vote for independence.
The reality seems to speak for itself.
We don't think we're yet anywhere near the lowest depths the various factions of the No campaign will sink to between now and September, but it seems determined to drag bystanders down into the sewers with it in its at-all-costs defence of the Union.
We've already seen Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar grossly misrepresenting the views of esteemed anti-poverty campaigners the Joseph Rowntree Trust – something for which Sarwar never publicly apologised, nor corrected his falsehood – not long after his party did much the same to the Economic and Social Research Council.
And of course this week we've had not one but two highly respected institutions complain that the UK government was utterly distorting and exaggerating their findings on the cost of setting up an independent Scotland's infrastructure.
We obviously can't predict who the next innocent casualties of the No campaign's indiscriminate lie-bombing will be. All we can say with any degree of confidence is that the good people of Great Ormond Street Hospital won't be the last.

There is good news on the disarmament front: US President Barack Obama is fine-tuning a new nuclear strategy. As White House officials said last week during a meeting between Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, he plans to reach a decision by April. The new strategy could include the scrapping of "thousands of nuclear weapons," and even a commitment by the United States not to develop any new nuclear weapons.
In addition, what may be the final round of Russian-American talks on the further reduction of strategic offensive weapons started on Tuesday in Geneva. The successor for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) is "almost 100 percent complete," says a Moscow negotiator. "We have agreed on the number of launch systems and the warheads, as well as the inspection and destruction of the nuclear payloads. All problems have been solved."
So much optimism has rarely been seen in Moscow and Washington, particularly when it comes to the two countries' arsenals of nuclear weapons.
Unfortunately, though, the elation is not genuine. The idea that the world can become a planet free of nuclear weapons one day -- as promised by Obama in his visionary speech last year in Prague -- remains a fallacy for the time being.
And the new treaty won't change that. Even if Russia and the US finally put aside their decades of hostility during the Cold War and sign a treaty outlining the further reduction of their nuclear arsenals, their behind-the-scenes relationship is, once again, characterized by deep mistrust -- perhaps even more so than during the administration of the abrasive former US president, George W. Bush.
Honorable Intentions
The Russians, in particular, feel that they are once again being misled. They may believe that man now in the Oval Office has honorable intentions, but they do not believe he is capable of reversing his country's position on nuclear weapons, says Dmitri Trenin, head of the Moscow Carnegie Center. According to Trenin, the biggest anti-Russia skeptics have retained key posts in Obama's administration. For the Russians, this is clearly reflected in Washington's plans to develop new missile defense systems around the world.
The plan was presented on Feb. 1 -- only a few months after the US had decided not to install a comparable system in Poland and the Czech Republic.
Now the United States wants to develop a missile defense system to protect European members of NATO. There are to be four stages, with a scheduled completion date of 2020. At first, SM-3 missiles, which are designed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles outside the earth's atmosphere, will be stationed on ships in the Mediterranean. In a second phase, ground-launched missiles with corresponding radar systems will be installed in southeastern European countries. After that, similar systems will be installed in northern Europe, followed by intercept devices designed, in particular, to destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles coming from the Middle East and targeting the United States.
The document remains vague and does not specify the countries in which the systems would be based. But it was already revealed earlier that Romania had agreed to accept American SM-3 missiles, and neighboring Bulgaria is also open to such plans. "We have to demonstrate solidarity," said Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov, by way of justification.
'New Weapons System'
"They have jettisoned Poland and the Czech Republic, which they portray as a major concession," says Dmitry Rogozin, Moscow's ambassador to NATO in Brussels. "But this plan presents us with even greater challenges. Our military will react with a new weapons system."
This doesn't sound like disarmament. But why should Russia be concerned about a defense system officially aimed at missiles from rogue states like Iran and North Korea?
First, because there is an imbalance between the Russians and the Americans in the development of their respective strategic armed forces. Moscow is still focusing on the expansion and renewal of its offensive weapons. Washington, on the other hand, is no longer developing any new nuclear offensive systems, instead concentrating on expanding the missile shield.
Under the rules of the START treaty, which expired last December, the Russians were required to routinely furnish Washington with technical data on new missile tests. As a result, the Americans are relatively well informed about Moscow's missile capabilities. But nowhere was it stipulated that either party had to provide the other side with details on the development of a missile defense system. The Russian military, therefore, knows next to nothing about its rival's capabilities.
Nothing Has Happened
"It is clear to us that missile defense is an extremely sensitive issue in Russian-American relations," concedes John Beyrle, Washington's ambassador in Moscow. Indeed, in recognition of that sensitivity, Obama and his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev agreed last year that Russians and Americans would conduct a joint analysis on which world regions are potentially threatened by missiles from a rogue state and, therefore, where the development of missile defense would make sense.
But nothing has happened -- Washington appears to be dragging its feet. "There is nothing but stubborn silence on the other side," Russian NATO Ambassador Rogozin told SPIEGEL. "The Americans are avoiding dialogue." Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said angrily that he instructed the Russian ambassador in Washington to find out "how to interpret all of this, and what is behind the Romanian and the Bulgarian surprise."
The Kremlin -- and this is the second reason behind Russia's agitation -- doesn't believe Washington's claim that the planned defensive missiles on Russia's western flank would only serve as a protection against Iran. "This is where the White House's age-old plan to suffocate our strategic armed forces and destroy our own intercontinental missiles, directly after START, is being implemented," say military experts in Moscow. They insist that Russia is being surrounded by an "anti-missile fence" that will provide the Americans with one-sided superiority.
Moscow sees its nuclear second-strike capability threatened, and it believes that it would hardly be able to react in the event of an attack. This would render its nuclear deterrent capability worthless -- yet another humiliation for the major power in the East.
Vanishing Balance
The problem of American missile defense has to be closely tied to that of Russian offensive weapons, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in a recent speech in the Pacific coastal city of Vladivostok. If Russia did nothing to oppose the missile defense system, he added, the other side would "feel completely safe under its missile shield, and it would do as it pleased. The balance would be gone, and aggression in politics and business would grow abruptly." Putin's conclusion is that "Russia needs new offensive systems."
This is no easy task for Moscow's military leaders. Russian NATO Ambassador Rogozin fears that the American missile ships "operating in the Mediterranean and the Arctic Ocean in the future will be more difficult to pursue and hard to pinpoint."
Russia's presumed counter-weapon is called "Jars," and military leaders in Moscow have already announced its deployment. It could be a further development of the Topol-M ICBM (known as the SS-27 in NATO code), with which Moscow is now furnishing its strategic armed forces. Unlike the Topol, which only contains a nuclear payload, the Jars can release up to 10 warheads, which can head for different targets independently of each other. This makes it more difficult to destroy them. But why Russia declared the Jars as its new miracle weapon some time ago remains a mystery. Was the more recent upgrade planned for much earlier? Does it have anything at all to do with the US plans?
It is doubtful, however, that the Kremlin is spending enough money to bring its already deficient missile units up to date. Indeed, it is partly for this reason that Russia places great stock in diplomacy -- and in the new arms reduction treaty.
Although the details have already been worked out, the treaty is still not ready to be signed. The Kremlin wants it to include a ban on the further expansion of missile defense.
Russia in NATO?
The Russian parliament is threatening to not ratify the treaty if the US refuses to agree to such a ban. Should that happen, the carefully conceived plan of radical disarmament would be discarded before it even gained momentum -- and the next crisis of confidence between the world's leading nuclear powers will have begun.
Given such circumstances, the proposal by former German Defense Minister Volker Rühe and three other military and political leaders comes at an opportune time. According to Rühe, the basis for the Russians' feeling of being threatened by the West should be eliminated once and for all. The only solution, he says, is to bring Moscow into NATO. For Rühe, trust can only be established if Americans and Europeans finally put their cards on the table when dealing with the Russians.
Rühe's appeal sounds surprising, and yet it makes sense from a European perspective. There is only one hitch: Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov has always dismissed the notion of a Russian NATO membership as a "fantasy." He also doesn't believe that Washington would go along with the idea. However, Moscow's position doesn't have to be written in stone.
Madeleine Albright, secretary of state under former President Bill Clinton and currently involved in the development of a new NATO strategic concept, has only nurtured Lavrov's skepticism. Washington, she says, will never allow Russia to influence NATO strategy: "We will not allow the tail to wag the dog."
I think that I should begin by evoking René Magritte's famous painting of 1929, The Treachery of Images, with its simple, literal depiction of a pipe and the provocative caption beneath—Ceci n'est pas une pipe. “This is not a pipe.” (How strangely people seem to have reacted to this self-evident statement! Though no one in actual life would confuse a pipe with the drawing of a pipe.)
This is not a traditional lecture so much as the quest for a lecture in the singular—a quest constructed around a sequence of questions: Why do we write? What is the motive for metaphor? “Where do you get your ideas?” Do we choose our subjects, or do our subjects choose us? Do we choose our “voices”? Is inspiration a singular phenomenon, or does it take taxonomical forms? Indeed, is the uninspired life worth living?
Why did I write? What sin to me unknown
Dipt me in Ink, my Parents', or my own?
Alexander Pope's great “Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot” (1735) asks this question both playfully and seriously. Why did the child Pope takes to verse at so young an age, telling us, as many a poet might tell us, with the kind of modesty that enormous self-confidence can generate, “I lisp'd in Numbers, for the Numbers came,” by which the poet means an intuitive, instinctive, “inborn” sense of scansion and rhyme for which some individuals have the equivalent of “perfect pitch” in music: you are born with it, or you are not.
For sheer virtuosity in verse, Pope is one of the great masters of the language; his brilliantly orchestrated couplets lend themselves ideally to the expression of “wit” (usually caustic, in the service of the poet's satiric mission). The predilection to “lisp in numbers” suggests a kind of entrapment, though Pope doesn't suggest this; the perfectly executed couplet with its locked-together rhymes is a tic-like mannerism not unlike punning, to which some individuals succumb involuntarily (“pathological punning” is a symptom of frontal lobe syndrome, a neurological deficit caused by injury or illness) even as others react with revulsion and alarm.
Pope's predilection for “lisping in numbers” seems to us closely bound up with his era, and his talent a talent of the era, which revered the tight-knit grimace of satire and the very sort of expository and didactic poetry from which, half a century later, Wordsworth and Coleridge would seek to free the poet. Pope never suggests, however, that the content of poetry is in any way inherited, like the genetic propensity for scansion and rhyme; he would not have concurred (who, among the poets, and among most of us, would so concur?) with Plato's churlish view of poetry as inspired not from within the individual poet's imagination but from an essentially…
A magnitude 7.0 earthquake has struck in the Pacific near the overseas French territory of New Caledonia, the US Geological Survey (USGS) reports. Tsunami waves have been observed after the quake, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) reports.
The quake was centered 82 km (51 miles) east-northeast of Tadine, on Mare Island, which has a population of over 5,600. The epicenter was 10 km (6 miles) deep. The numbers have been revised by USGS from earlier reports, which placed the epicenter 68 km from Tadine and 25 km deep, and reported its magnitude as 7.3.

The PTWC has warned of "hazardous tsunami waves" possible for coasts within 300 km of the epicenter, which puts the Loyalty Islands archipelago, with a population of over 17,000, within range. It later issued a message saying tsunami waves "have been observed."
Waves up to 1 meter higher than the high-tide mark were forecast to hit New Caledonia, with the actual height varying depending on the coastline. The PTWC has warned that additional waves may roll in at intervals of five minutes to an hour, and may be higher than the initial ones.
The 7.0 quake is one of the strongest in a recent string of tremors in the seismically active area, with the USGS reporting over 120 mostly shallow earthquakes of varying magnitudes since the end of October. Tsunami waves have not been detected before.
Evacuations were ordered for coastal areas in New Caledonia, local broadcaster NCI reports, and also advised for the southern provinces of the island nation of Vanuatu, located north of the earthquake's epicenter.
The PTWC has now released a final message saying that the tsunami threat has passed.
The U.S. army has enjoyed a long and incendiary relationship with TNT, but the explosive that has provided the pop in everything from artillery shells to demolition munitions could be on its way out. The Army has approved a safer, more stable alternative to replace the TNT in 155-millimeter artillery shells, and engineers at Picatinny Arsenal where it was tested say it could completely replace TNT in Army and Marine munitions within a decade.
The new explosive, IMX-101 (for Insensitive Munitions Explosive 101) is just as powerful as TNT, but brings a lot less risk to the table. Researchers at Picatinny Arsenal found that during loading, storage, and transport, the IMX-101 remained far more stable than traditional TNT, which can be highly temperamental. BAE Systems, maker of the new explosive, designed it to remain chemically stable when subjected to shocks like those created by explosions (with RPGs and IEDs in mind), fire, impact by shrapnel, and gunfire.
IMX-101 costs more than TNT, but the more the military buys the cheaper it gets, and that economies of scale may further accelerate its adoption in other large-caliber munitions. Having a less volatile explosive means the military can store more of the stuff in one place and transport more of it in any given vehicle than they could previously. That cuts down on supply chain problems and logistical headaches, not to mention the vulnerability of convoys delivering the goods in combat zones.

Rather, in the future, the password will be part of the security "constellation," as Forrester analyst Eve Maler put it. For the most important gateways to our lives, like email accounts, Google's 2-step authentication, which The Atlantic's James Fallows is a vocal proponent, combines a password and an ever-changing code sent via-text. The second aspect might look an awful lot like a password—Google texts a string of characters, for example. Or it might entail something more personalized, depending on the type of information we're trying to protect. But the password will still be in the mix.
While hacks loom, any extra steps means more of a burden for the user. Yes, having to go upstairs to get your phone is more annoying than remember 25 passwords. That hassle will never be worth it for certains things. Also, because of that perceived annoyance, it might take awhile for the multi-step thing to catch on, unless companies mandate it.
The Mobile Password
As far as extensions of our beings go, mobile phones do a pretty great job. Google's 2-factor process uses text messaging because people often have their phones right there with them. Cell phones are small, light, and mobile. But, they're also secure. Because of that and the proliferation of smartphones, Maler expects other companies will join this trend. (Some already have, PayPal for example has a very similar process as Google.)
The possibilities, however, extend beyond texting. Google, for example, has an Authenticator app that generates the code needed for the second part of authentication, changing the password every 10 seconds. Another company working with Grant, for example, is working with push notification technology, you know, those little alerts that pop up on smartphones when things happen. "You enter a username, the app pops up on your phone, asking you to push the green button or to push the red button," he explained. "Suddenly instead of having to carry an extra card, it's just an app on your smartphone."
A Computer That Recognizes You
It's possible, too, that the Internet could validate us without the middle-man. Those mobile solutions use our phones to say "this is the right person." In the future, computers might be able to just know it's us. "The system to just be able to recognize that you're exhibiting behavior that is you," said Grant. Banks already do this, to an extent. If someone makes a transaction from an obscure location, for example, that will trigger an alert. But, these systems could get smarter.
"There are companies that have been out there for years, looking at things like key strokes as biometrics," notes Grant. DARPA is researching that "keystroke dynamics" idea, for example. "Or with touch screens, you might have a certain pattern that you tend to use," he adds. Instead of an app on your phone, companies might require a mobile voice, facial, or eye-scan recognition for certain types of transactions.
Uta F., 52, has lived in her Berlin-Hellersdorf apartment for the past nine years, but now her occasional nightly routine of having an evening cigarette has been halted by a court, according to B.Z..
Her upstairs neighbour took her to court because he said the smoke coming from her balcony was blowing into his apartment and bothering him.
Uta F. told B.Z. that she enjoyed having her evening cigarette on her balcony in her fourth floor apartment.
“I don't smoke a lot - in the evening with wine or sometimes when I cannot sleep at night,” she said.
But a local court ruled that Uta F. may no longer smoke on her balcony between 8pm and 6am. The two parties ultimately agreed to the conditions of the judgement, and Uta F. may therefore not appeal, a civil court spokeswoman told broadcaster rbb on Monday evening.
The judge further stated that if the woman were to violate the conditions, she would face a fine of up to €250,000, or six months in prison.
“This punishment is, however, very unlikely,” the court spokeswoman said.
The judgement had been based on a federal court ruling in 2015 that said smoking tenants are only guaranteed to be able to smoke on their balconies during limited time periods, because the smoke presents a significant disturbance to others.
In that case, two married couples had battled it out for years over one couple's smoking habits. After the federal court ruling, the case was sent back to a lower court for further review, but was ultimately thrown out because the wife in the pair of smokers had died.
Last year, one of Germany's 'most famous smokers' won a years-long legal battle against eviction before a Düsseldorf court. The court found that there was not sufficient evidence to show that he was disturbing the peace.
One liberal politician from the Free Democratic Party (FDP) condemned the latest ruling in Berlin. The Berlin state parliament representative and FDP spokesman for legal and constitutional protection said that he could only shake his head at the ruling.
“Forbidding an occasional smoker from having an evening cigarette on her own balcony constitutes a very big encroachment on her personal sphere,” said the FDP's Holger Krestel.

TOKYO (AP) — Japanese police said they were investigating a possible attack on a U.S. Army base near Tokyo after finding a pair of launchers and a projectile Tuesday following reports of explosions in the vicinity.
Two iron pipes planted into the ground and aimed at Camp Zama were found about 800 meters (half a mile) southwest of the base, which sits near a residential area and an elementary school, police said. No injuries or damage were immediately reported from the incident and police were investigating.
Police found the pipes after a resident reported hearing three explosions in the area in the early hours of Tuesday.
Investigators later found a projectile at another field nearby that was believed to have been fired at the base from one of the launchers.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is on a weeklong tour of the United States, where the two sides agreed late Monday to a revision of defense guidelines that would boost the Japanese military's role in bilateral cooperation amid China's growing assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region.

A TRAINSPOTTER who has watched Bolton trains from the same spot for 40 years has been left frustrated after a wall was built blocking his view of the tracks.
David Hutchinson used to watch trains from the bridge in Moor Lane, near Bolton Central Fire Station in the town centre, three times a week.
But last week he was shocked to see huge concrete blocks had been cemented on the top of the wall, blocking his view of the trains.
The blocks have been erected by Network Rail for safety reasons ahead of plans to electrify the line in 2016.
Mr Hutchinson said he was devastated by the move.
The 53-year-old, from Halliwell, says he loves watching the trains go by and always carries a pair of binoculars and a notebook to write down the numbers of the trains as they go past.
He usually meets several friends at the spot to watch the trains, and says the bridge is the only vantage point where he can see the trains moving slowly enough to be able to read their numbers.
Mr Hutchinson, who suffers from epilepsy and is unable to work, also watches the buses from the spot as they drive to and from the nearby Moor Lane Bus Station. On Sundays, the transport fan also watches aeroplanes near Manchester Airport.
He said: “I think the bridge should be kept clear. You can't see over the blocks and it means you can't see the trains. I want them to be taken down, it is really frustrating.”
A Network Rail spokesman said: “We have increased the height of the bridge parapets at this location in preparation for the electrification of the route in four years' time.
“It's a safety requirement to help keep people safe and away from the 25,000 volts in the overhead electric wires that will one day be strung underneath this bridge.”
The American people are "war-weary," we are told, and that's the only reason they're overwhelmingly opposed to bombing Syria: this bit of conventional wisdom is invoked by warmongers and peaceniks alike, but is it true? Well, to some degree, no doubt, but not in any tangible sense: after all, there is no conscription, we have a professional army, and most people are not aware of how war impacts their lives. So if they're "war weary" it must mean they're tired of hearing about these faraway conflicts in places they probably can't find on a map. So yes, the public is indeed weary, but not in the sense the pundits mean. What they are weary of are the lies.
The US government lied us into war in Iraq with some of the most egregious fables this side of the Brothers Grimm. There was the Niger "yellowcake" fabrication – an outright forgery cited in the State of the Union address by George W. Bush. This crude concatenation of documents which took a team of UN specialists less than an hour to debunk was supposed to "prove" the existence of Iraq's ongoing (and fast-developing) nuclear weapons program. Oh well, back to the drawing board!
There was the Iraqi-intelligence-agent-meets-Mohammed-Atta-in-Prague narrative, a tall tale from beginning to end, which was "leaked" to the neoconservative media and trumpeted as proof positive that Saddam and Al Qaeda were in on the 9/11 attacks together. That turned out to be a hoax. Oh, and don't forget the Al Qaeda "training camp" that was supposed to have been sheltered and succored by Saddam Hussein – which, along with those famous "weapons of mass destruction," turned out to be nonexistent. I could go on – but I'm not in the mood to catalogue and describe the complete works of Laurie Mylroie. If you are, please be my guest….
In short, we were lied into war once before with slapped-together bogus "intelligence," and so the public is wary – and so is Congress, and much of the media, albeit not for the same reasons.
Congress is wary because of the polls – no one wants to own this one. As for the media: they, too, are taking it slow, writing articles about how everyone has "learned the lesson of Iraq." But their version of that "lesson" has little to do with the "intelligence" we're being given that's supposed to justify this latest Crusade for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. For the most part, they've swallowed the administration's account of what supposedly happened at Ghouta, and in earlier incidents of alleged poison gas attacks, which is that Assad "is gassing his own people."
The blind acceptance of this "fact" is one of the stranger elements of the current war hysteria – because if we truly have learned "the lesson of Iraq" then why is everyone repeating the US government's war propaganda as if it's beyond dispute?
One fact is indeed beyond dispute – someone used some kind of chemical warfare agent in the village of Ghouta on Aug. 21. The question is: who did it? John Kerry keeps telling us the rebels couldn't possibly be responsible because they don't have that "capability." But a new report issued by the Russian government claims the sarin gas mixture deployed at a previous and very similar incident in the town of Khan al Assal – the incident the UN team was in Syria to investigate when the Ghouta atrocity occurred – was not military grade. It also purports to show that the rocket delivering the substance was makeshift, not at all like those regularly utilized by the Syrian military.
We're also being told by the Obama administration the rebels have no access to sarin or other chemical weapons, but you don't need access to classified information to know this isn't necessarily true: since various rebel factions now control big swathes of Syrian territory, it's quite possible they've "liberated" chemical weapons caches once controlled by the Syrian government. As the Washington Post reported back in December:
"U.S. officials are increasingly worried that Syria's weapons of mass destruction could fall into the hands of Islamist extremists, rogue generals or other uncontrollable factions.
"Last week, fighters from a group that the Obama administration has branded a terrorist organization were among rebels who seized the Sheik Suleiman military base near Aleppo, where research on chemical weapons had been conducted. Rebels are also closing in on another base near Aleppo, known as Safirah, which has served as a major production center for such munitions, according to US officials and analysts."
According to a Syrian general who defected this summer, Assad's chemical weapons sites "are not secure. Probably anyone from the Free Syrian Army or any Islamic extremist group could take them over."
No chemical warfare capability? Not so fast: the Libyan jihadists who overthrew Qaddafi were among the first foreign fighters to land in Syria, and they certainly had access to the former Libyan dictator's chemical arsenal. In 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported on "a massive, unguarded weapons depot that is being pillaged daily by anti-Gadhafi military units, hired work crews and any enterprising individual who has the right vehicle and chooses to make the trip." Included among the goodies: "Artillery rounds designed to carry chemical weapons" which that reporter saw "stashed in the back of" a warehouse." (See also here.)
During Hillary Clinton's confirmation hearings, Senator Rand Paul asked her about "rumors" that the Benghazi attack on our embassy was somehow involved with an attempt by the Libyan rebels to ship arms looted from Qaddafi's arsenal to the Syrian jihadists. Hillary tut-tutted that she'd "never heard" any such thing. Really? Given what's happening in Syria today, the question arises: were chemical weapons transported from Libya to Syria?
Ha'aretz reported in March that the rebels were definitely behind a chemical weapons attack outside Aleppo, with the chemical of choice apparently chlorine:
"The explosion claimed the lives of Syrian Armed Forces soldiers who are apparently loyal to Assad, and the Syrian government was quick to demand an international investigation of the incident. These two facts would indicate that Assad's forces were not behind the attack….
"It appears that the target of the attack was a checkpoint manned by Syrian Armed Forces, which reinforces the theory that rebel forces, probably jihadists known to be operating around Aleppo, were behind it. A report by Britain's Channel Four, based on Syrian military sources, claims that the weapon used in the attack may have been a missile carrying a warhead filled with chlorine mixed into a saline solution. The Syrian source also said that a factory that manufactures chlorine is located nearby."
The last time the Syrian "opposition" raised a hue and cry over alleged chemical attacks by the Assad regime, Carla del Ponte said she had evidence from UN inspectors that the real culprits were … the rebels. She wasn't listened to. Why is that?
Oh, those cuddly "rebels" would never do anything like use chemical weapons banned internationally: why they're mostly "moderates," according to Kerry. Only "fifteen to twenty percent" are Al Qaeda type radicals, he avers. As Vladimir Putin put it the other day, "he is lying and he knows that he is lying." Jihadists are pouring in from all over the world – including from places like New Zealand, and even the US – to take part in the battle to create an Islamic state in Syria. The armed wing of the "opposition," as Kerry dubs them, is dominated by radical Islamists formally affiliated with Al Qaeda.
Reuters cites a European expert on terrorism in the region as saying:
"Extremist rebel factions were so strong and well-organized in the north and west of Syria that they were setting up their own public services and trying to create an Islamic ministate along the Iraqi border.
"By contrast, the official said, more moderate rebel factions predominate in the east of Syria and along its southern border with Jordan but have largely devolved into ‘gangs' whose leaders are more interested in operating local rackets and enriching themselves than in forming a larger alliance that could more effectively oppose Assad's government."
It makes sense the Obama administration would latch on to "moderates" with a modus operandi similar to their own, but it looks like Syria's Mod Squad is on the way out as al Nusra and other jihadist groups take the lead.
The lies proliferate like flies on a corpse: Kerry has spent the last week or so telling members of Congress and the American people "no boots on the ground," and yet it turns out this really means "no combat boots on the ground." "Noncombat" troops (like the thousands we still have in Iraq) are just fine.
"This isn't Iraq" – we keep hearing it from the President and his underlings, but that's a barefaced lie, too. The original authorization for the use of military force proffered by Kerry was so blatantly broad that you could drive a whole regime change operation through it. The only difference in the revised "watered-down" version is that the loopholes aren't quite so obvious to the untrained un-lawyerly eye. You'll recall that, up until this point, all aid to the rebels was supposed to have been "non-lethal." John McCain succeeded in slipping in a clause that allows Washington to "upgrade" our "lethal and nonlethal" aid to the rebels in order to "change the momentum" on the battlefield.
Another lie in the form of a half-truth: the often stated factoid that "over 100,000 people have been killed in the Syrian civil war." This is true as far as it goes, but it raises the question: who is being killed and who are the killers? If you listen to the war-screamers, you get the definite impression that the Assad regime killed them all. The reality is that around 45,000 of the fallen were Syrian army and police: anywhere from 25,000 to 45,000 were jihadists and their "moderate" frontmen, including foreign fighters. The rest were civilians caught in the crossfire, including this Catholic priest beheaded by the rebels. (Gee, I hope they weren't from the "moderate" faction!)
Yes, the American people are weary all right – we're damned comatose with the effects of war propaganda coming at us from all directions, 24/7. We're sick unto death of being lied to – and wondering why our "free" media feels obliged to regurgitate government press releases as if they were the gospel truth.
This government lies about everything – James "least untruthful" Clapper is the poster boy for the distinct style this gang has brought to the White House. Kerry is fast catching up to him, however, as the whoppers come thick and fast.
These folks are no different from their neocon predecessors – except that the neocons were better liars. The lies they told were bigger, more imaginative, and far more elaborate, although the Obamaites are doing some pretty quick catching up. Perhaps the administration ought to call in veterans of the Bush regime's old Office of Special Plans for some pointers. I hear Doug Feith is looking for a new gig.
Although, on second thought, maybe the administration is indeed already taking lessons in Advanced Deception from the pros. The alleged "smoking gun" in the US government's classified account of what happened at Ghouta is an intercepted communication between Unit 8200 of the Syrian army and the Syrian high command, which – we're told – definitively proved the Syrians' guilt. The Daily Caller, however, has unearthed the truth: the Obama administration's report on the interceptions was "doctored," writes Kenneth Timmerman, according to "former military officers with access to the original intelligence reports." Timmerman writes:
"The original communication intercepted by Unit 8200 between a major in command of the rocket troops assigned to the 155th Brigade of the 4th Armored Division, and the general staff, shows just the opposite.
"The general staff officer asked the major if he was responsible for the chemical weapons attack. From the tone of the conversation, it was clear that ‘the Syrian general staff were out of their minds with panic that an unauthorized strike had been launched by the 155th Brigade in express defiance of their instructions,' the former officers say.
"According to the transcript of the original Unit 8200 report, the major ‘hotly denied firing any of his missiles" and invited the general staff to come and verify that all his weapons were present.'"
There's a note at the end of the report saying the Syrian officer was recalled to headquarters, interrogated for three days, and returned to his unit. "All of his weapons were accounted for," the report stated.
We're being lied into war once again – with the complicity of the "mainstream" media, which is ignoring any and all evidence that contradicts the Obama party line.

April 4, 2014 (US Premiere)
Summary for Moms:
Captain Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is getting comfortable with his new life in the 21st Century. He runs dark ops for SHIELD along with the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), but is getting tired of being Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson) lapdog, especially when secrets are kept from him. Simultaneously, Fury is investigating secrets being kept from him regarding a new, sinister SHIELD project headed by Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), which leads Captain America down a dark path crossed by the mysterious Winter Soldier (Sebastian “spoiler alert” Stan). Suddenly things are revealed to be not what they seem and Cap must call upon his new friend Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) to help set things right.
Review:
Captain America: The Winter Soldier is arguably the best movie Marvel has made so far. At least, I think so. It stands very well on its own and works as a fairly tense spy-thriller with superhero trappings. Since my mom likes movies that trend toward the slightly dryer and realistic world of political (and/or legal) intrigue, I thought that she would really enjoy this movie.
Unfortunately, since coming back from her vacation, my mom has caught a bit of a cold, and slept through a lot of the movie, even though we split it up into two sittings. Regardless, she enjoyed the parts of it she did see.
Before we started, I had to re-cap (haha “re-Cap”) her on the politics of the Marvel Universe. Since it's been a while since we've heard from SHIELD, she needed a refresher course on who they were and what HYDRA was, especially since our last mention of HYDRA was just a short throw-away mention in The Avengers. That being said, the movie did a great job of reminding her who everyone and everything was with a lot of well-crafted dialogue and context clues. She remembered everything, even Toby Jones as a computerized Arnim Zola, which I was impressed by. But she still refers to Nick Fury as Samuel L. Jackson which, again, is still completely accurate.
However, the big attention grabber this movie afforded my mom was Robert Redford. She loves Robert Redford, and was surprised that he was in the film, even though I had told her about him, like, three times beforehand. His presence also helps the film attain an air of legitimacy in the political intrigue genre it's straddling.
Speaking of surprises, this movie has quite a few of them. So if you haven't seen this movie: a) Spoiler Alert and b) Why are you reading this blog?
Anyway, the first and foremost surprise is that SHIELD (or most of it, anyway) is actually HYDRA and has been all along. My mom was shocked by this and reiterated her consistent, on-brand disdain for “evil people”. It really is a great plot twist, and I remember being surprised by it in theaters. Mom also thought HYDRA's plan for Project Insight (i.e. killing all potentially rebellious good guys) was “very evil” and she “didn't like it.”
The second surprise is the identity of the titular Winter Soldier as Cap's childhood friend Bucky. My mom was, surprisingly enough, less surprised by this. I remember that she had an inkling back during The First Avenger that he would come back at some point, but she seemed to have forgotten that. She was thoroughly whelmed by the revelation and I had to remind her who he was, as she had slept through the museum scene earlier. That being said, she recognized him afterward, and was still like “oh, that guy.”
The third surprise is the fact that they kill Nick Fury in the second act. As soon as Sam Jackson flat-lined on the operating table, my mom immediately declared: “He's not dead. No one stays dead in these things.” I had to stifle myself from revealing anything further. But, suffice to say, she did not bat an eye when he resurfaced in the third act.
The movie ends with a high-stakes assault on three helicarriers which, to be honest, is the most paint-by-numbers aspect of the movie. The heroes have to do three identical things to bring the villains' plan crashing down (quite literally) and if they fail at even one of those points, they fail at everything. Despite the cookie-cutter action movie plan, the sequence was a blast and a joy to watch. Except for my mom, who fell asleep during most of it. She's never been one to be entranced by fighting and ‘splosions. She did, however, pay attention to the final battle between Cap and Bucky. Despite Bucky's saving Cap at the end, she still thinks he's a bad guy.
Overall, The Winter Soldier proves itself both to be an enjoyable, interesting movie that conveys a lot of nice twists while simultaneously providing a refresher on that state of the Marvel Union through well-written interesting dialogue and context. It also gave my mom a great bit of nap time, while I balanced on the edge of my seat.
Mom Rating (Out of Five):
Miscellaneous Notes:
She was surprised when the Winter Soldier caught Cap's shield. “Oh, no. He can do that?”
The elevator fight was also well received.
She was very impressed by the Falcon's entrance. “Oh! Who's THAT guy?”
Despite knowing that nobody really dies, she was convinced that Black Widow died when she shocked herself.
…but she still thought Robert Redford would survive.
She later watched Netflix's original movie “The Wheelman” starring Frank Grillo and recognized him as “the agent guy from the Captain America.”
Post Credit Sequences:
Sequence 1, wherein Baron Von Strucker continues HYDRA and reveals his experimentation on “the twins”: “Who's that guy? Is that the same HYDRA guy?” “Who's this lady?” “Ugh. I hate when people do experiments.”
Sequence 2, wherein Bucky goes to the museum. “Oh. He's remembering.”

The WestJet Professional Pilot's Association has asked the Canadian Industrial Relations Board to conduct a union certification vote.
The association, in a post on its website, said it filed the application for a vote among the Calgary-based airline's more than 1,200 pilots Monday. If the application is approved, the industrial relations board is expected to oversee a secret ballot vote of all eligible WestJet pilots to determine support for creating a legally recognized union.
A requirement for requesting a certification vote is demonstrating more than 40 per cent support for the WPPA via membership card count, a threshold the association said it “comfortably” exceeds.
“This will be the first time in WestJet's 19-plus year history that our pilots will have an independent third party run a completely confidential vote,” the website post states.
WestJetpilots agreed to a four-year contract in December. The separate, non-unionized WestJet Pilots Association currently negotiates on behalf of the airline's pilots.
Last month, WestJet‘s almost 3,000 flight attendants approved a five-year work agreement with the airline. WestJet said just under 82 per cent of its flight attendants represented by the WestJet Flight Attendant Association Board took part in the vote.
Overview Xenobia is one of four support Hero's in Gigantic and her role is, I would argue, the opposite of Vadasi. Where Vadasi is all about giving life (or health), Xenobia is focused on stealing life and debuffing those around her. Although she can sustain herself through her Gaze of Envy and its life drain, she isn't indestructible and relies heavily on stamina management, positioning and the strength of her utility in order to defeat enemies. With a set of skills that can break armor, poison, weaken or cripple, she's a powerful ally to have. A well skilled Xenobia can significantly reduce the strength of her opponents and with the right build choices, ensure an easy kill against an unsuspecting target. Unsurprisingly and due to her kit, she's incredibly weak if out of position and with no mobility, can be focused incredibly quickly. Guide Updated: 27 June 2017 Pros Cons Incredible at debuffing enemies She has no "out", meaning she relies entirely on her stamina and positioning to stay alive (or a quick slow before running away) A powerful kit that can cause slow, poison, weakness, cripple and knockback. Although she can sustain herself through LMB, she's rather squishy when focused due to her lack of escape skills Can comfortably solo most Hero's 1 on 1 when she's obtained her upgrades She relies on skill upgrades to be truly effective Invaluable at supporting a team push due to her crowd control pressure Regularly focused by Tripp, Tyto and Wu
Skills This section of our guide contains a list of Xenobia skills, what they do, which upgrades you should choose (and when). Gaze of Envy (LMB) - This beam is Xenobia's default attack, and allows her to channel her attack for several seconds. During its duration she'll deal damage but also heal herself for a small amount . Although the amount of self healing isn't huge, it's primary purpose - as far as I'm concerned - is to offset incoming damage, as opposed to gaurenteeing your survivability. As a beam attack, Gaze of Envy also bypasses Deflects so it's very useful against Heroes such as Mozu. I'll also add that with the right upgrade choices, Gaze of Envy - combined with use of her other skills - can offer Xenobia large health returns. Words of Spite (RMB) - Probably my favorite skill in the game, Words of Spite is an incredibly powerful tool that when fired, will home onto the enemy and break their armor. The homing element is relatively forgiving and the projectile travels fast, meaning it's difficult to actually miss with it as long as you point it an enemies general direction. Reducing an opponents armor allows you and your team to deal much higher damage against them. Words of Spite is also particularly strong when upgraded as it allows Xenobia to significantly slow the affected player, but also gain health and movement speed in the process. Cast against a high value target such as Tripp or Sven, it can make their life very difficult. Wave of Sorrow (Q) - As your primary means of defence, Wave of Sorrow is a projectile that travels forwards from Xenobia's feet. By default the first targets you hit will be knocked up and weakened (reduces the damage they deal). It's invaluable for hitting enemies off cliffs or preventing them from reaching you, but it also pairs exceptionally well with Mark of Despair at later levels, where it eventually knocks players back. Despite being a defensive skill, Wave of Sorrow is also fantastic when used aggressively. A combination of Words of Spite > Mark of Despair > Wave of Sorrow is a period of damage and lock-down that most heroes can struggle to recover from. Mark of Despair (E) - Offering Xenobia a long-range targetted AOE skill that slows all enemies caught in its zone, Mark of Despair is exceptional in a team fight. It's incredibly strong late game as you can upgrade it to cause damage to all those caught in it, or to reduce healing received. Due to the fact it causes so many debuffs in a relatively large area, it's incredibly important to Cursed Soul (F) - Undoubtedly a unique Focus, Cursed Soul allows Xenobia to place enemies caught in its radius into stasis. During this time enemies cannot move or use skills, nor can they take damage. It effectively removes them from the game for at least 4 seconds, up to a maximum of 8 when upraded. It only has a small radius and after casting, the pool takes about 0.5 seconds to trigger. If you can, you should always try to use it on the enemy tank or healer (The Margrave or Uncle Sven), or against the enemy team when they're attempting to defend a wound. It effectively removes one (or several) players from a fight, ensuring you have team numbers in your favor. I'd also add that Cursed Soul can be obtained quickly as long as you regularly use Gaze of Envy; have a level 1 Focus available to defend yourself is never a bad thing. Skill Upgrade Paths and Order Active Link Level 1: Demoralizing Cry (RMB Right) Level 2: Banishing Sorrow (Q Right) Level 3: Building Anguish (E Right) Level 4: Greedy Gaze (LMB Left) Level 5: Feast of Spite (RMB Right) Level 6: Amity (Focus Right) Level 7: lifeline (Focus Left) Level 8: Survival of the Cruelest (LMB Left) Level 9: Crippling Anguish (E Left) Level 10: Heightened Sorrow (Q Left) Clash Talent (accessible at level 5): Insult to Injury
Threat This section of our guide contains a list of tactics for fighting against other Hero's with Xenobia. Please note that only the Heroes that are the highest risk and threat to Xenobia are included in this list. Charnok will always be a difficult Hero to face because his range, damage and burst, if he has his Focus, can reduce most Hero's to ash. If he's attacking you from afar, there's very little you can do. It's during mid-range fights that you stand a chance. Be aware that most Charnok players will bait your Words of Spite or use Detonate. If you do land Words of Spite, go through your typical rotation. If you miss, you need to have enough stamina to avoid his Focus (if he has it) but also Hot Hail. Threat: 7/10 Griselma can be a challenge for Xenobia only if she has her Portal Beasts out. If she doesn't, she's more than likely going to portal away rather than stay and fight. If her Portal Beasts are active, there's very little you can do besides trying to focus Griselma (who will use her hands to block your shots whilst still dealing damage to you). Threat: 7/10 HK 206 versus Xenobia is dependant on how far away you are from HK at the start of a fight. If it's at full range, you're going to take significant damage from Bullet Barrage and his Rail Gun, before you get close. If it's mid to close range, you're in a very good position to beat him as long as you avoid his Mortar. His lack of mobility combined with your slow, weakness, armor break and burning mean you can cut him down fairly easily even if he's fortified. Threat: 7/10 Lord Knossos is always going to be a threat irrespective of what you throw at him because of his ability to knock you down. Key to beating him is to kite, but to also utilise your slow and knockback effectively. You have to keep him at arms reach, which means alternating your skills. Rather than bursting him, use Wave of Sorrow to knock him back and keep pressure on with LMB. Threat: 8/10 Mozo, similarly to Lord Knossos, is a challenge for Xenobia. I've always found that when you get too close she'll teleport away or if she doesn't, she'll use Arcane Vortex. If she has neither, she'll then slow and interrupt you with Attractor Beam. When she does eventually gain full distance, she'll then unload Magic Bolts and melt you in seconds. If you can, the best you can hope for is to interrupt her Dimension Door with Words of Spite. Threat: 7/10 Tripp, just like Tyto, is always a threat to Xenobia because of her speed and burst. If she catches you from stealth, it's gaurenteed you're going to take a huge amount of damage with very little you can do whilst knocked down. If you are facing trip when she isn't stealthed, a typical rotation of Words of Spite > Mark of Despair > Wave of Anguish > Gaze of Envy is enough to kill her. Threat: 9/10 Tyto The Swift is somewhat easier to deal with than Tripp because he can't stealth. Unfortunately for you, he's still fast and very strong. He'll almost always throw Fang your way to break your armor and follow it up with a Blade Dance. Fortunately you've lots of skills to keep him back, so just follow the same routine as with Lord Knossos and Tripp. Use Words of Spite early, Mark of Despair on yourself when he comes at you, and when he gets too close, Wave of Anguish. Threat: 8/10 Wu at this moment in time is a headache for anyone as a single Tongue Lash can result in you being chained stunned/beaten until you're dead. If you don't avoid his Tongue Lash, you're surely going to die. That said and if you do, he's fairly easy to kite and you can keep him immobilized/knocked back/slowed long enough to wither him down. Just remember that if you're a couple of meters in front of him and if he's facing you, he's going to use Tongue Lash. Be prepared to dodge. Threat: 9/10
Dust II has long been both a favorite map for some and the most hated map for others. It is a very balanced map for both teams meaning that no team has any advantage over the other. This requires players to come up with ingenious tactics to try and get an upper hand over the enemy. Being an AWPer on this map is one of the key roles you can fill in order to help your team out as much as possible. However, given that the Ts are the ones attacking, there aren't many key spots they can AWP from where they would get a key advantage over the CTs. As a Counter-Terrorist, however, there are a plethora of clever spots to AWP from where you are likely to surprise unsuspecting Terrorists. Without further ado, let's get into it.
On Short Watching Cat
This first one is a fairly simple yet effective spot. Using the picture above as reference, you'll want to position yourself atop the ledge right above CT. From there you'll want to scope in through the space between the gray pipe and the wall. From there you can spot anyone trying to push up cat and quickly take them out. Should you be confronted with more than one attacker and you still have a fair amount of health, you also have the option of jumping down into CT and allowing your teammates to kill any pursuers. Once the situation has cleared you can then push up ramp onto A site and snipe anyone coming from long or perhaps cat or you also have the option of taking the long route through mid doors and up cat. You should take this route only if your teammates are either doing a good job holding A site or they are all dead and going A ramp would mean certain death.
Long Watching Long Doors
For this spot, you'll want to stand with your back against the building in front of pit and, using the wall in front of you as cover, quickly peek and kill anyone at long doors. Should you find the need to fall back, you can always fall back to car and continue sniping anyone coming towards long, ideally with the help of a teammate from somewhere on A site. At the beginning of a round, this tactic can also be paired with a pop flash to blind anyone at doors after which you can easily kill them. Another thing you can do is have a teammate play from pit. That way if the Ts rush and you either die or are forced to retreat, your teammate can take some, if not all, of them out.
Mid Watching T Spawn/Palm Tree/Top of Mid
This spot is a very versatile spot because from here you can lock down three key areas of the map. For this one you'll want to play close to the left door at mid and, if this is the start of the round, kill any Ts watching mid. The reason why you would not want to be playing this from closer to CT spawn is because a lot of AWPers will pre-aim that spot and the bottom of mid doors is a more unusual place to play from. If there is no T watching, you can then shift your aim towards palm tree (end of cat towards long) and kill anyone there. Should any Ts try to cross towards top of mid, you can kill them or alert your teammates of their position. This is also a good spot for letting your teammates know the terrorists' movements should they go anywhere you can see from mid doors (i.e. lower tunnels).
Back Plat Ledge on B Site
The last position is on B site. Instead of going straight to back plat, you will be playing crouched from the back plat ledge as seen in the picture above. From there, you have the cover of the box straight ahead of you and should they push from upper tunnels, you have the ability to retreat onto site and have your teammates lend you a hand. This does expose you to both window and door, so you will want to have a teammate playing with you on site should things get ugly. Of course, if the Ts do rush, your teammates on site with you can also give you some help while reinforcements arrive.
These are just a handful of the different ways to snipe on Dust II as a CT. Given how versatile and balanced the map is, different plays can be created based on the kind of players you have on your team or how the game has been going up to that point. Be sure to check out my guide on places to AWP from on T side of Dust II, coming soon.

A Lithuanian man appeared before magistrates today charged with the murder of 81-year-old Albertina Choules.
Tautvydas Narbutas is charged with the killing of Mrs Choules as well as causing grievous bodily harm to two Thames Valley Police officers at the murder scene, Hill Green Cottage near Marlow Bottom, Buckinghamshire.
Mrs Choules' body was found in the garden of her home at 6.30am last Wednesday after an emergency call was made to police reporting a disturbance.
Scroll down for video
Tautvydas Narbutas is accused of murdering Albertina Choules in her garden in Buckinghamshire
The pensioner was found dead in her garden last week. Her had been hit with a blunt object and burned
The pensioner had been struck over the head with a blunt instrument and her body set on fire.
Narbutas, 23, stood in the dock at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court this morning wearing handcuffs and a heavy bandage on his right hand and lower arm.
Through an interpreter, the defendant, wearing grey tracksuit bottoms and a jumper, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address. He made no application for bail.
Narbutas, of High Wycombe, was ordered to appear at Reading Crown Court tomorrow for a preliminary hearing. He was remanded in custody overnight until his case is heard by a judge.
According to his Facebook page, Narbutas is from Kelmė, a small city in the west of Lithuania.
Fit and active, Italian-born Mrs Choules is sent to have spent much of her time tending her garden at her remote country home. She had no electricity and is believed to have used gas lanterns.
A van brings Tautvydas Narbutas to court where he was remanded in custody ahead of another appearance
Mrs Choules was described as an 'incredibly special' woman who loved her garden and other people
The widow had allowed generations of villagers to freely tour her estate as part of a Buddhist trail she created with her late husband Michael, a company director and fellow convert to the religion, who died from cancer in 2004.
Albertina's family released a tribute which read: 'Tina was incredibly special, as was her simple, self-sufficient way of life with no electricity, television or washing machine.
'She never liked to sit still and worked tirelessly to maintain her beautiful garden and produce all year round.
'Even in her old age she would chop trees, dig up flowerbeds and wrestle with her lovely dog, Georgie.
'She was completely selfless in giving away her fantastic fruit and vegetables to friends and family as well as sharing her wonderful Buddhist Stupas (that she built with her own hands) with those that chose to walk in the woodland.
'Her friends and family in both the UK and Italy will miss her very dearly.'
Twice in the span of a month, the Taliban has unleashed human waves on one of the U.S. Army's most isolated Afghan outposts. Twice, the American soldiers guarding the tiny fort have beat back the attackers, killing scores of extremists while suffering no losses of their own.
The U.S. troops' skill, and luck, have been remarkable. They're going to need both, as more large-scale attacks seem likely.
The Oct. 7 and Nov. 8 assaults on Combat Outpost Margah, in remote Paktika Province on the border with Pakistan, came almost exactly a year after one of the biggest pitched battles of the decade-long war. An October 2010 attack on COP Margah by hundreds of Taliban foot soldiers wielding rockets and AK-47s resulted in a lopsided tactical victory for the Americans. More than 90 Taliban died in a counter-barrage of gunfire, helicopter-fired missiles and satellite-guided bombs. As in the recent assaults, no Americans died – though the fighting left deep psychological scars.
The sustained fighting around COP Margah underscores the Americans' battlefield prowess and the Taliban's continuing ability to mass large numbers of troops despite concerted NATO efforts to seal off the border with Pakistan and thus strangle the Afghan insurgency. U.S. operations in and around the town of Margah, depicted in my video above, are actually ramping up while NATO activities elsewhere in Afghanistan slowly wind down.
By now the 172nd Infantry Brigade, the unit currently occupying COP Margah's brick walls, chilly concrete buildings and sandbagged bunkers, has a firm handle on the Taliban's tactics. The enemy uses a crisscrossing network of dry river beds called wadis to sneak within firing distance of the football-field-size outpost. "The intent is to mass 150 or more [fighters] in the wadis and then merge from three sides," Maj. Joe Buccino, a public affairs officer, tells Danger Room.
Once the shooting starts, the Taliban know they probably have only a few minutes before the Apache helicopters and Air Force jet fighters arrive overhead and unleash Hell. "When fighters arrive on station, the insurgents can't run away fast enough," said Capt. DeShane Greaser, commander of the Margah troops.
But bad weather on the night of Nov. 8 might have lulled the Taliban into thinking they had the advantage. "They believed the heavy cloud cover and fog would prevent CAS from blowing them up," Greaser said. "It did not."
The Air Force's response was swift and decisive. While the soldiers manned the outpost's walls and bunkers and picked off attackers one by one, F-16s and F-15s raced in from Bagram Air Field. Guided by an Air Force controller named Seth Pena, the jets lobbed eight guided bombs.
The air support arrived just in time, Greaser said. "There was a vehicle-borne Improvised Explosive Device heading to the COP and after the first bombs hit we got reports that the enemy said, 'We're turning around, there are jets overhead."'
No fewer than 70 Taliban died outside COP Margah on Nov. 8. At least, that's the estimate the soldiers came up with after picking up body parts the following day – standard procedure following a major attack.
With a history of bloody assaults stretching back at least a year, COP Margah's American defenders probably realize that it's a question of "when," not "if," another massive attack will target their lonely Afghan outpost.

US Ranks 44th in Mobile Download Speed, 65th in Upload Speed
A new report from Ookla indicates that the United States ranks 44th when it comes to average mobile download speeds. The firm's 2017 US Market Report collected data from the first half of 2017, during which 3 million unique mobile devices were used to perform over 14 million consumer-initiated cellular network tests. While average mobile download speeds in the US increased 19.2% between 2016 and 2017 to 22.69 Mbps, the US still ranks 44th in the world in terms of average download speed.
The report notes that at 8.51 Mbps, the US ranks 65th in the world at average mobile upload speed.
Among major carriers, the report notes that T-Mobile reported the fastest mobile network in the United States with a Speed Score of 23.17. That's compared to speed scores of 21.13 for Verizon Wireless, 20.05 for AT&T, and 15.39 for Sprint. The firm notes that it calculates this speed score by "incorporating low-end, median and top-end performance for both download and upload speed."
"The combination of a tightly-spaced cell site grid and a smaller subscriber base than Verizon and AT&T could be the keys to T-Mobile's success in the US market and to their ability to support the exponential growth in mobile data consumption," posits Ookla.
While Sprint still came in a distant fourth place, Ookla notes that the company's mean download speed increased 23.7%, a notable improvement.

A while back we joined the JSF 2.3 EG as zeef.com. While we had contributed as individuals before (mostly via code suggestions and snippets in JIRA issues) we are proud that today our first more direct contribution was committed to Mojarra for the ongoing JSF 2.3 effort.
Co-spec lead Manfred Riem tweeted about this earlier today:
And the JCP process in action! Thank to Arjan Tijms for his recent #JSF 2.3 contribution! Generic injection of the applicationMap. Enjoy! — Manfred Riem (@mnriem) January 27, 2015
The commit in question can be seen in our GitHub mirror. To summarize the change; before it was only possible to inject the application map as follows:
@Inject @ApplicationMap Map applicationMap ;
As can be seen, the map is missing its generic parameters. This is of course far from ideal. With the latest patch, this map can now be injected as it should be:
@Inject @ApplicationMap Map < String , Object > applicationMap ;
Injection into a raw map is still supported, but for most cases the generic variant should be preferred.
It's a fairly small change, but hopefully many more of such changes will follow soon 😉

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho hinted he could overhaul his strikers at the end of the season after claiming he is very unhappy with their performances.
Jose Mourinho said he was forced to field Andre Schuerrle as a makeshift striker in the 3-1 Champions League quarterfinal first-leg defeat at Paris Saint-Germain due to his dissatisfaction with Fernando Torres and Demba Ba.
• Worrall: Mourinho's approach backfires
• Johnson: PSG pass first major test
• Spurs and Everton battle for Lukaku
• Ibrahimovic expected to miss return leg
• Fans clash in Paris streets
Chelsea, without Samuel Eto'o due to injury, began with Schuerrle in the lone striker role, but the Germany international struggled to provide a focal point for the attack as he drifted into wide areas, and he was eventually replaced by Torres on 59 minutes.
Mourinho -- who has repeatedly expressed concern at his attacking options this season -- has defended his decisions.
“I'm not happy with my strikers' performances, so I have to try things,” he said. “With Andre, at least I know we have one more player to have the ball, we have one more player to associate with the other players. Even not being dangerous because he is not a striker, he can associate and the team can have control of the ball possession like we had.”
On the introduction of Torres with the score at 1-1, he added: “Football is also about scoring goals. That is for strikers, for real strikers. I had to try.
“I change with 1-1 because I thought Fernando could give us more depth than Andre. With Andre, the team had good control and possession -- he was dropping deep. I thought Fernando could give us a bit more.”
Torres made little impact at the Parc des Princes and, when asked if Chelsea are falling short because they lack strikers like PSG trio Edinson Cavani, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ezequiel Lavezzi, he replied: “Of course.”
Mourinho was also concerned by his team's defending after the loss. Having singled out his back four for praise after the weekend's defeat to Crystal Palace, he said on Wednesday night that all three PSG goals had been avoidable and that Javier Pastore's injury-time strike was “ridiculous.”
However, he feels the strikers and doing little to take the pressure off.
“It's difficult for us to score goals,” he said. “Especially when the games are tight. It's difficult for us to transform the half-chances into chances and when you make the defensive mistake you are in trouble.”
Mourinho insisted recovery at Stamford Bridge next week was “not impossible” -- the Blues would progress to the semifinals with a 2-0 win -- but added: “We are not a team full of talent to score goals, especially at this level, but you never know. We have to try. We have to go with everything. Let's try.”
The most stunning statistic to come out of China's offshore money-laundering mecca located in Vancouver, where over the past two years Chinese buyers have created the biggest developed world housing bubble in recent history as a result of unprecedented capital flight from China's financial system, is that just by sitting on their assets local homeowners "made" more in 2015 than the entire city population earned by actually going to work.
According to SCMP, while top-paying jobs aren't easy to come by in the City of Vancouver - which partly explains its spiralling unaffordability - at least 75,000 "tireless workers" in the British Columbia city made the incredible average rate of C$126 per hour. Sadly, the Hong Kong website notes, "these workers are not among the city's human inhabitants. They are its single-family homes." Putting this in numbers, the quiet "efforts" of Vancouver's houses (or, more accurately, the dirt on which they sit) whose value exploded in the past year, were rewarded so handsomely last year that they made their owners about C$25 billion, or about 30% more than the C$19 billion the entire city population made in employment earnings the entire year.
That shocking calculation comes courtesy of mathematician Dr Jens von Bergmann, a former teacher at Notre Dame and the University of Calgary. As SCMP reports, Von Bergmann now runs MountainMath Software in Vancouver, but his side interest is combining and presenting data in ways that help us better understand the city. He is best known for his “census mapper” depictions of Vancouver, that vividly chart the distribution of everything from poverty and mortgages to Irish ancestry.
For Vancouver workers, the results are disheartening: von Bergmann's calculations - which are the result of combining data from the Census and National Household Survey, the City of Vancouver, Metro Vancouver and BC Assessment – show just how much more lucrative it is to own a house in Vancouver compared to, say, slogging away in a cubicle or on the end of a shovel with the rest of the schmucks. Of course, to own a house in Vancouver one first has to work long hours for many years; however the baseline price has now risen so high it has become virtually impossible to be a local homeowner in Vancouver thanks to honest, hard work. Now crime and subsequent money-laundering by Chinese oligarchs on the back of the world's biggest financial bubble with $35 trillion in bank assets which have to be parked offshore asap... that's a different matter entirely.
Von Bergmann, who first posted his findings on the MountainMath site earlier this year, also raises an interesting point about the Vancouver affordability debate: while there is a hue and cry about the origins of buyers' money as it floods into the market, there is a lot less about how to treat that money once it has arrived in the bank accounts of sellers. “[There is] a tendency to view the money that is buying Vancouver real estate very critically, whereas once locals pocket the land value rises that same money is suddenly welcome and well-deserved,” he said. “I find the vilification of the money pre-purchase in contrast to the silent acceptance of the money post-purchase problematic.”
Bingo, and that is precisely why the Vancouver housing bubble will continue because local politicians are mostly focused on the "post-purchase" aspect of the transaction. Of course, potential buyers could care less and are merely shocked by just how unaffordable the pre (or post)-purchase prices have become. And as long as this selective focus remains unchanged, so will the general Vancouver situation as the bubble gets even bigger, despite the unexpected warning by none other than the OECD last week warned of a "disorderly housing market correction" In Canada. The OECD is of course correct becuase while many of those have an incentive to perpetuate the status quo, only the poor and powerless want change and they obviously don't matter.
How does von Bergmann reach his conclusion that owners of single family houses earned more than all City of Vancouverites did by working? The latter part is pretty easy. The 2011 National Household Survey shows that the city's average household income was C$80,460 (for the 2010 tax year). Multiply this by the 264,575 households in the city for total income of C$21.29billion. But of this total, only 78 per cent is attributable to employment or self-employment income (versus, say, investment income or welfare). So the total pre-tax amount that City of Vancouverites earned by actually working in 2010 was C$16.6billion.
Assuming that Vancouverites' overall employment income rose at the rate Statscan suggests that median incomes did from 2010 to 2013, then did so again from 2013 to 2015, this results in total citywide pretax work income of about C$19.2 billion.
Von Bergmann offers a slight caveat here: “Average incomes have probably risen a tiny bit more than median incomes [because of] the nature of incomes at the top … generally growing faster. But [the] effect will be very small.”
On the other hand, calculating the amount “earned” by Vancouver's single family homes is trickier. First, von Bergmann had to identify these homes, which he did by combining a City of Vancouver property outline dataset with Metro Vancouver land use data to calculate all single family and duplex properties, then subtracting stratified properties identified as having received multiple property tax bills.
In this way, he included houses with non-stratified basement suites or other dwellings, which are excluded from oft-cited census data that suggests about 47,000 single-family homes in Vancouver. Instead, von Bergmann concludes there are 78,740 single-family houses in Vancouver. [It should be noted that the City of Vancouver has previously tallied about 76,000 single family houses; Von Bergmann said he could not explain that discrepancy. However, it's not a big enough difference to alter his overall findings] Von Bergmann then looked at the increase in value of these 78,740 properties, according to data from BC Assessment. Excluding building-value increases, the land-value-only increases averaged C$313,072, for a total land value rise of C$24.65 billion.
By simply dividing the average land-value rise by the average Vancouver household's 62 person-weeks of work per year (and assuming a 40-hour work week), von Bergmann calculates that the owners of Vancouver houses earned about C$126 per hour for what he called “thumb-twiddling”. East of Main Street, the rate was C$92 per hour; west of Main, a whopping C$173 per hour.
“I am not entirely sure why anyone would want twiddling thumbs to stay so lucrative…or why earnings from thumb-twiddling should remain tax-free [as untaxed capital gains on a principal residence],” von Bergmann said on the MountainMath site.
Not everyone agrees with Von Bergmann's general point, that the speed, scale and taxability of house equity increases demands scrutiny. It was in February's throne speech, outlining her government's agenda, that BC Premier Christy Clark made it clear she would “carefully protect the savings and equity that existing homeowners have painstakingly placed in their homes”.
“Painstaking” is not a word many would use to describe the process that last year saw the average price of a single family home in the Metro Vancouver rise by 40 per cent, hitting C$1.8million.
Of course, anyone concerned about Vancouver housing prices rising by 25% in one year and casting blame on homeowners who did nothing more than "twiddle their thumbs" will surely have nothing but praise whose destructive monetary policy may have crushed the American middle class and led to the widest chasm in income inequality on record (one which even the Fed admits is helped create) thanks to a market which has nearly tripled in the past 7 years purely as a function of a few money printers not twiddling their thumbs but instead repeatedly pushing the buttons CTRL and P.
One thing is certain: neither the US asset bubble, nor Vancouver's housing bubble have a happy ending.
London, United Kingdom - A bionic suit sounds like something out of a 1970s science fiction blockbuster.
But the movies have come to life for users of an innovative wearable robot that is allowing even people who are totally paralysed below the waist to walk again.
The innovative Ekso bionic suit could offer millions of patients with some form of paralysis new freedom from their wheelchairs, which have been linked to numerous physical and psychological side effects. The wearable robot works by using sensors to detect upper and lower body movements to control the machine and walk forward.
It offers exciting new rehab options for a huge number of patients with lower body weakness and paralysis, ranging from devastating lower body injuries to simple old age.
For Arash Bayatmakou, the bionic suit could be the key to learning to walk again, after he was paralysed from the waist down in an accident last summer. A broad smile spreads across the 30-year-old's face as he stands up to take his first, wobbly steps supported by the device.
"I can get used to this thing - my body just wants to walk," he said.
Watching proudly alongside, his mother Minoo Moallem commented: "I am really excited to see him in this position because Arash used to be very athletic - running, biking, motorcycling, everything."
Inevitable price-drop
Currently, only a few dozen of the robotic exoskeletons are in use at medically supervised rehab centres. But a home version of the robot could be for sale within two years - at a cost far lower than the $110,000 hospital price tag.
Its creators at Ekso Bionics in the US state of California say it could ultimately replace the wheelchair in many everyday situations.
"I think you are going to see a lot of people walking in future with an exoskeleton device," predicted Nathan Harding, the co-founder and CEO of Ekso Bionics in California.
"In the long run, there's nothing about the machine that should make it cost more than, say, a high-end motorcycle."
Harding believes that robotic exoskeletons could be about to move into the mainstream, as prices go down and doctors and patients become more aware of the possibilities they offer.
"Hopefully, it is going to come to a point where you don't really know who is paralysed," he said.
"They might just be a person who is just trying to get some extra walking time and may just have an injury problem, or they could be a paraplegic, but hopefully you won't be able to really tell."
The potential for a breakthrough in working with mobility problems is huge, and developments in medical technology have offered relatively few innovations for patients.
Bayatmakou, who has been wheelchair-bound since his accident, described his spinal cord injuries as "incredibly devastating".
"It affects everything from physical strength to when you need to go use the restroom - and not being able to look at people at eye level, constantly having to look up," he said.
Many wheelchair users are unhappy with the stigma and social disconnect of being at a different height from others. Equally, rehab exercises for the lower body have often been painful and discouraging for patients, as they usually require patients to support their full body weight on their upper arms.
The Ekso aims to deal with all of these problems.
State of the art
Originally developed from a project with the US military to help soldiers carry huge amounts of weight, the bionic suit was later adapted at the suggestion of doctors to offer rehab and support to patients with lower body weakness and paralysis.
Some 40 technicians helped to develop the prototype, who grappled with technical challenges including working out how to recreate natural, human-like steps, and ensure the machine did not stumble.
The robotics company also ended up calling in the services of an artist who specialises in leather work to help create the leg straps, which had to be meticulously designed to avoid causing pressure sores.
The finished product looks something like a deconstructed wheelchair that has pulled itself up onto two spindly legs, while a sign on the back warns bystanders: "Stand clear - Ekso may start moving at any time."
Leg straps replace the support the knee muscles would normally give, allowing users to stand with their full weight on their legs and feet.
Meanwhile, numerous sensors measure the user's posture and movements to detect when they place their hips over their front foot - a position that humans naturally take when they are about to take a step forward. The Ekso will then take the step for them.
By learning how to move their weight, users can control the machine even if they are completely paralysed below the waist. And by allowing them to stand on their own two feet and take control of their balance and steps, the Ekso offers an invaluable rehab tool for patients looking to regain or strengthen the use of their legs after an accident.
Bayatmakou, who has used the Ekso once a week for about a month, said it was "pretty effortless" to walk using the robot.
He predicted it be could be a "hugely beneficial" part of recovery, as well as a replacement for the wheelchair in many everyday situations in the future.
"What they have done with the Ekso is pretty brilliantly inventive," he said. "People don't think how many things go into walking."
Alternative uses
The bionic suit is already being used to treat numerous mobility problems, from relatively simple lower body weakness to paralysis caused by spinal cord injuries or neurological problems, including multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome.
It can also offer audio training for users, and collect and store data on how patients are walking to monitor their progress.
A newer "variable assist" software upgrade has also been created, which is specially designed to offer rehab for stroke patients, who are often weaker down one side of the body and need more help to lift one leg than the other.
Even for patients who are permanently paralysed, the Ekso could offer psychological benefits in being able to stand and walk.
Researchers at Ekso Bionics are also collecting data to show that the device may be able to help medical problems associated with sitting down in a wheelchair for long periods of time, including pressure sores and urinary infections.
Harding said he believes robotic exoskeletons could become as common as wheelchairs over time.
"The future is going to get really exciting just in the bionic space in general," he said.
"I think you're going to see someone come into an airplane in an Ekso skeleton and sit down in an economy seat. And you're going to see grandma in the mall and she's going to show off her hip new Ekso pants. And you know she's going to be able to take a walk with her grandkids.
"It's not far. That's what's really exciting - that it's not science fiction any more."

OBJECTIVE:
The ultra-high risk clinical phenotype is associated with substantial distress and functional impairment and confers a greatly enhanced risk for transition to full-threshold psychosis. A range of interventions aimed at relieving current symptoms and functional impairment and reducing the risk of transition to psychosis has shown promising results, but the optimal type and sequence of intervention remain to be established. The aim of this study was to determine which intervention was most effective at preventing transition to psychosis: cognitive therapy plus low-dose risperidone, cognitive therapy plus placebo, or supportive therapy plus placebo.
METHOD:
A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 12-month trial of low-dose risperidone, cognitive therapy, or supportive therapy was conducted in a cohort of 115 clients of the Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation Clinic, a specialized service for young people at ultra-high risk of psychosis located in Melbourne, Australia. Recruitment commenced in August 2000 and ended in May 2006. The primary outcome measure was transition to full-threshold psychosis, defined a priori as frank psychotic symptoms occurring at least daily for 1 week or more and assessed using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States. Secondary outcome measures were psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life.
RESULTS:
The estimated 12-month transition rates were as follows: cognitive therapy + risperidone, 10.7%; cognitive therapy + placebo, 9.6%; and supportive therapy + placebo, 21.8%. While there were no statistically significant differences between the 3 groups in transition rates (log-rank test P = .60), all 3 groups improved substantially during the trial, particularly in terms of negative symptoms and overall functioning.
CONCLUSIONS:
The lower than expected, essentially equivalent transition rates in all 3 groups fail to provide support for the first-line use of antipsychotic medications in patients at ultra-high risk of psychosis, and an initial approach with supportive therapy is likely to be effective and carries fewer risks.

It is a fact that has many consumers concerned, compounded by the Baird government's plan to seek a mandate for the partial privatisation of state-owned electricity "poles and wires" companies this year. Premier Mike Baird has said the government expects around $20 billion from the sale. "Looking forward, electricity prices are not going to go backwards," said Mr Kelk, who has recently had the solar panels installed on his off-grid Murrumbateman home in the Southern Tablelands. Their $79,000 off-grid system will include a large stand alone power system that will be used to produce all the energy for the house; hot water, cooking and a ground heat pump. The price tag comes after the small-scale technology certificates (STC) discount of around $30,000, applied under the federal government's small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES).
A 2013 report for the Australian Trade Commission found that two per cent of Australia's population lives in the off-grid electricity market, which consumes more than six per cent of Australia's total electricity demand. Off-grid systems are most common in regional Australia where the cost of joining the grid can be more than $30,000. In inner city Sydney, where network connection costs are affordable and stationary batteries remain expensive there has been little drive for people to move off the grid. However, with electricity prices on the rise and battery prices tipped to decline 50 per cent by 2020, more households could begin looking to alternatives. There are two main reasons a household elects to go off the grid, said Chris Dunstan, research director at the Institute of Sustainable Futures.
"There's the cost side, with electricity prices doubling over the last six or seven years; where might they go in the next six or seven years," he said. "But people who go off the grid also do so because they are often not happy with sorts of energy choices being made on their behalf." As the price of batteries and solar PV falls the front line of where off-grid living becomes cost-effective is coming closer to major population centres. "At the moment it's much more cost effective to never connect to the grid but, once the grid is built, the equation changes," said Mr Dunstan. "So for most in the metro area it would be significantly more expensive to go off the grid."
For anyone considering life off the grid, sustainability coach Michael Mobbs says solar retailers should be the first stop. "Get three quotes from solar retailers who've been in business for at least 10 years. The reason for that is many who are selling solar don't have 10 years' experience - and are unlikely to be around in another five years to honour or implement warrantees or guarantees," he said. "Second, tell them you want to get all your energy needs from the solar system and measure your monthly use." The 2014 AEMC review also found a growing need for retailers to adapt to technological changes which are transforming the traditional methods of supplying and consuming electricity. It pointed to Origin as one retailer adapting to changing needs. "Origin is offering customers the ability to install an electric vehicle charging unit in their garage through an alliance with ChargePoint. They also have a specific tariff for electric vehicle charging," the report said.
When power blacked out in New York following Hurricane Sandy there were reported cases of homeowners hooking their Toyota Prius up to their house to power the lights, television and refrigerators. "I don't recommend trying this at home but it does illustrate what the future might look like...the technology has been developed," said Mr Dunstan. New automotive models, like the Tesla Model S 85, are likely to have big impacts on the battery market. The 85 refers to its 85 kilowatt hour battery. Comparatively, the average electricity consumption in NSW is 20 kilowatt hours per house, per day. "Every time the market grows the potential to use technology for other purposes becomes greater," said Mr Dunstan.
"Traditionally in remote Australia off grid batteries are lead acid. Now we are starting to see lithium applied in these contexts, as prices come down."
For Mr Kelk the decision to build off the grid has changed the way he looks at things. "It was going to cost $40,000 for us just to just get connected on a rural block," he said. "You've got to look at the long-term view now. If I was starting from scratch again I would definitely go off grid again."
If you're a WhatsApp user with an older device, I have some bad news for you: your OS may no longer be supported by next year.
To summarize, WhatsApp will only be available on Android 2.3+, iOS and Windows phone 8.1+ “by the end of 2016.” In total, it's ending support for:
All BlackBerry OS devices, even the newish BlackBerry 10
Nokia S40
Nokia Symbian S60
Android 2.1 and Android 2.2
Windows Phone 7.1
That said, the company doesn't say if it will remove its software from the respective app stores or if it will just stop updating the app. Either way, it means those users will miss out on any new features and perhaps be totally incompatible if the WhatsApp makes any major changes to the software by the end of the year.
For US users this may not be much of a big deal – WhatsApp says the big three OSs account for 99.5 percent of sales today – some regions of the world where BlackBerry devices or older OS's are still fairly popular will suffer more.
Still, you can't really blame WhatsApp, as it's supported more platforms than the vast majority of competitors for some time no. It's somewhat surprising they held out on older phones for so long; I mean, who still updates on Symbian?
If you are on one of the soon-to-be-unsupported operating systems, WhatsApp is offering obvious advice not everyone will be happy to hear: upgrade to a newer phone.

Well folks, it had been a long two and a half weeks. Let me tell you why. I had been sick, you see, for a little more than that time with some nasty virus going around. It happens every year, the kids go back to school, spread a bunch of germs and bring them home to the parents. And this year they brought back a doozy. So, after being sick enough not to want a beer (and for me, that's pretty sick) and then on antibiotics, beer was off the menu.
All things come to an end though, as they say, and so it was I found myself at Taco Mac one fine fall Saturday afternoon, to end the drought and drink some beers. Feeling my old self again, I ordered up a foamy mug of a brand-new pumpkin beer, Avery Gored! Pumpkin. It was delicious, and probably tasted even better because I had gone so long without a brew. Tasting notes to arrive shortly in this review.
Anyway, I came home prepared to check Avery's website for details on the beer, only to find there were none. There was a mention of Gored! Being on tap at the brewery tasting room, but nothing more. This then, was a very new beer indeed. In fact, my good friend Dale Roberts, he of Avery's home state of Colorado, said that he had not seen this yet. I therefore believe this is draft only.
I do know that the beer has an alcohol content of 5.3% by volume and I paid $6.50 for a full mug pour at Taco Mac.
My mug of Avery Gored! Pumpkin arrived a murky orange-brown color with a very spicy nose of cinnamon, nutmeg, and perhaps cardamom. Taking a sip, the beer has a slightly nutty cookie malt chocolate character in the palate that is not at all sweet. More pumpkin spices emerge, especially the nutmeg which dries at the last. Very dry spices indeed mix well with a bit of stringy pumpkin flavor shortly after sipping, because what would a pumpkin beer be without pumpkin?
Avery Gored! Pumpkin may be a bit of an enigma, but it's definitely worth seeking out my friends.
Alabama Football Spring Practice Day 12
Alabama wide receiver Raheem Falkins (80), wide receiver Chris Black (1), wide receiver ArDarius Stewart (13) and wide receiver Armani Purifoye (89) grab a breather in drills during Alabama's 12th spring football practice, a scrimmage, Saturday, April 11, 2015, at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
(Vasha Hunt/vhunt@al.com)
Let's just get this out of the way. Alabama has another quarterback competition that'll dominate the discussion for a second straight August.
We'll spare you another glancing blow at the complex situation at that position for these purposes. Instead we will take a look at the other positional competitions that'll be worth following this August.
It culminates with the Sept. 5 game in Arlington, Texas against Wisconsin, but starts Thursday with the opening workouts.
Wide receiver
It's not like quarterback where a group competes for one spot. There are three starting jobs and key role positions up for grabs without Amari Cooper and Co. There's talent returning and playmakers arriving.
The real question involves the speed with which five-star freshman Calvin Ridley fits into the scheme. Returners Robert Foster, ArDarius Stewart and Chris Black showed they could adjust to bigger roles in the spring, but Ridley appears to be one of those special players with game-changing ability. The South Florida product drew strong reviews in summer workouts after enrolling in May.
The other wide card is Richard Mullaney, the graduate transfer from Oregon State. The ACL injury to sophomore Cam Sims in spring and the experience gap that comes with graduating three seniors led Alabama to look for an experienced receiver.
At 6-3, 209 pounds, Mullaney brings a solid target for whoever is throwing the ball. His 2013 numbers (52 catches, 788 yards) are solid before injuring his elbow and missing significant time last fall. How quickly Mullaney and Ridley fit into the offense will determine a lot and Sims' is expected to contribute later in the season.
Running back
Derrick Henry is obviously the lead dog in the suddenly shallow depth chart. It'll also be the first time the junior carries that top billing and the pounding that includes. A long strider, Henry was typically Part II in the T.J. Yeldon combination. He feasted on tiring defenses in second halves of 2014 games.
Perhaps the most interesting offensive component (non-QB division) is Kenyan Drake. The mystery of his speed after breaking a leg last October and what Lane Kiffin has cooked up will make his August one to watch. How the workload is distributed with Henry won't be evident until September, but Drake's ability to play full speed will show itself in August.
There's also strong interest in top recruit Damien Harris' ability to catch on. Like Ridley, he didn't enroll until the summer but had the 7-on-7 and conditioning drills to build chemistry and learn how it works. He won't do much if anything in August, but Alabama expects Bo Scarbrough back at some point this fall after tearing an ACL in the spring.
Middle linebacker
With anything on defense, formation and scheme matters in this realm. Unlike just a few years ago, Alabama plays more in nickel and dime formations (extra defensive backs) than the base 3-4. The traditional look is reserved mostly for opponents like Arkansas and LSU -- the ground and pound teams.
That said, Reuben Foster finished spring as a first-team middle linebacker in the nickel. Shaun Dion Hamilton was working first in the base defense. Both need to be ready to play the other's position in a moment's notice given the physical nature of the position. Tackling technique continued to be an issue for Foster last season, so his ability to tackle without burying the helmet will be a factor to watch.
Safety
This is another spot complicated with the many schemes and formations Alabama uses defensively. The core remains, though, and there will be some new pieces this August. It started in the spring with new secondary coach Mel Tucker moving some players. Most notably, cornerback Eddie Jackson shifted from cornerback to safety, where he played some in high school. He received strong reviews in the spring, but there's still significant work left for August in the operation of the position.
Playing safety requires ultimate understanding of every players' role and the confidence to call plays on the fly. Jackson was always one of the better hitters at cornerback, but it's another beast at safety when there's open field to navigate. Nick Saban said he likes Jackson's instincts when it comes to stopping the run.
Junior Maurice Smith also saw action at strong safety in the spring, but Jackson was the starter on A-Day. It appears to be his position to lose playing next to free safety Geno Smith, another former cornerback who moved to safety a few years ago.
Offensive guards
Two starters return to Alabama's offensive line -- center Ryan Kelly and left tackle Cam Robinson -- and have seemingly settled on Dominick Jackson at right tackle. The leaves the two guard jobs. Redshirt freshman Ross Pieschbacher looked like the solution at left guard in spring.
On the right side, Bradley Bozeman moved ahead of last year's backup Alphonse Taylor after a spring knee injury. Taylor saw action last year at the position as Bozeman saw his most significant action filling in for Kelly at center after an injury at Ole Miss. There's still room for competition in that position in August.
Pop icon Madonna celebrated the Fourth of July with a racy picture in which she posed topless with an American flag wrapped around her waist — but not all of her fans appreciated the holiday greeting.
The 58-year-old “Material Girl” superstar found herself mocked by some social media users after she posted the picture to her Twitter account Tuesday afternoon.
The singer captioned the photograph “AMERICA!!!” and “HAPPy 4th,” along with numerous American flag and heart emojis.
It wasn't immediately clear when the photograph was taken, but at least one commenter noted it could have been taken during filming of the singer's 1990 get-out-the-vote ad for Rock the Vote.
While a number of Madonna's fans expressed their enthusiasm over the photo, others offered up criticism; one user told her to “put some clothes on,” while another simply commented: “Gross.”

Madonna has a long history of sharing racy photographs of herself, often for different reasons.
Shortly before November's presidential election, the singer shared a naked photograph of herself in support of former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, whom she endorsed and enthusiastically supported during the 2016 campaign.
After Trump's victory and just before his inauguration in January, Madonna shared a photograph of a Nike “swoosh” symbol shaved into a woman's pubic hair to promote the anti-Trump Women's March on Washington. At the march, the pop star came under fire (and reportedly sparked a Secret Service investigation) when she told thousands of attendees during a speech that she had often thought of “blowing up the White House.” She later said the remarks were taken out of context.
In May of last year, the singer explained her attitude toward risqué outfits in a social media post defending a revealing ensemble she had worn to the Met Ball Gala, which had left her rear end exposed.
“My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement,” she wrote in a post to her Instagram account. “The fact that people actually believe a woman is not allowed to express her sexuality and be adventurous past a certain age is proof that we still live in an age-ist and sexist society.”
Madonna appeared to spend the July 4 holiday in New York City, posting a brief video on Twitter later Tuesday of fireworks lighting up the city's skyline.

A lot of the places we've thought of as ‘mission fields' are actually full of Christians now, and they don't need our help anymore. This is great, but is there any place left for missionaries to go?
There are still a few places in the world where hardly anyone knows Jesus. People living in these places almost never get a chance to meet a follower of Christ face-to-face, especially not one that speaks their language.
In fact, 1/4 of the world has no personal access to a follower of Jesus. (stat) 86% of all Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists do not know a Christian. (stat) That leaves a lot of people that you can go to.
Go somewhere unreached, somewhere where people don't know him, and start from scratch. Go somewhere, learn a language, and be the only living ambassador of Christ that people ever meet.
There are millions of people eagerly waiting for someone just to come and take the time to talk to them. And most of the time, they're incredibly friendly.
“It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation.”

Across the world, every day people are becoming more and more angered by the illegal wildlife trade and the toll it is taking on key species, many of which are being pushed to the brink of extinction by nothing more than human greed.
The statistics are shocking. The meek and secretive pangolin is the most trafficked mammal on Earth, with millions falling prey to the culinary preferences of the Far East every year. Every quarter of an hour, somewhere in Africa, an elephant is killed for its tusks. Africa's rhinos are faring no better, with poachers taking one every nine hours for a substance which has become the most expensive on the global black market – rhino horn. There are fewer than 22 000 Asian elephants left in the wild and Asian rhino will soon be just a memory. It is estimated that there are as few as 23 000 African lion left in the wild.
The illegal wildlife trade has grown to rival narcotics as the world's most nefarious, and lucrative, of crimes, driven by an insatiable demand from China and the Far East.
These are the many and various reasons why on October 4, World Animal Day, millions of people will be taking to the streets in more than 113 cities across the world to march for wildlife under the banner of the Global March for Elephant and Rhino (GMFER).
“Aimed at highlighting the plight of the world's elephant and rhino, the GMFER is not about raising money, it's about raising voices for those who have none,” says businessman and conservation educator Dex Kotze, South Africa's main GMFER organiser.
“We've got every-day people across the world going the extra mile to arrange marches in cities from as far afield as San Francisco and Auckland, Toronto and the Maasai Mara. Besides taking to the streets in a peaceful protest to draw attention to the plight of our elephant and rhino, we are also delivering a powerful Memoranda of Demand to the governments of range and demand states,” says Dex, who is CEO of Jenna Clifford Jewellers. “In addition, the South African marchers are delivering to the president and key government departments stringent demands for urgent changes to the country's legislation to allow for stiffer penalties for poachers and tougher laws surrounding the illegal wildlife trade.”
In South Africa, there are currently 13 cities hosting GMFER marches, including Johannesburg, Pretoria, Stellenbosch, Durban, Rustenberg, Nelspruit, Bloemfontein and Grahamstown. Africa Geographic's editor, Anton Crone, and CEO, Simon Espley, will be taking part in the Stellenbosch march, as well as the H.O.G (Harley Owners Group) motorcycle ride to Cape Town to present the memorandum.
“We need a real show of force in South Africa,” says Dex. “This is where the bulk of the world's rhino population is steadily losing the battle against poaching, so we absolutely have to get out there on October 4 and show the world we are not going to take this slaughter of our precious wildlife any more,” he says. “Our elephants will soon go the same way. Already we have had two big tuskers killed in the northern part of the Kruger Park for their tusks. Elephant poaching is coming, and it's going to hit us hard,” he adds.
“I want to ask everyone to give up a few hours of their time on October 4, to bring their families and have a nice, enjoyable walk on an easy route in their home cities or cities near them while showing their support for these incredible animals, who deserve a future where they will not be hunted down for their horns and tusks,” says Dex.
And of course, with technology the way it is these days, it's not just about physically turning out for the GMFER, especially if you don't live near a city hosting a march or are unable to join in on the day. The powers of social media are vital in a cause like this, as Dex explains. “We can raise a real storm on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and the like, and get virtual feet across the world to join us in this campaign.”

The graphic video has been aired by Pakistani TV channel Geo [LiveLeak]
The Taliban has released a video of Pakistan policemen being executed by firing squad after being captured in the northwest, the Pakistani police have said.
A senior police official told the AFP news agency that the video was filmed on June 1, when the Taliban besieged a police checkpost in Upper Dir, about 6km from the border with Afghanistan's Kunar province.
The footage, parts of which have been aired by Pakistani TV channel Geo and which is available on LiveLeak.com, shows at least 15 men standing on a hillside in traditional civilian dress with hands tied behind their backs.
A commander and other apparently Taliban fighters, also wearing shalwar khamis, but armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled grenades, stand in front of the apparent policemen, none of whom are wearing uniform.
The commander then delivers a brief speech, declaring the policemen enemies of Islam and deserving of death.
"These are the enemies of Allah's religion and have left Islam. Allah orders to kill such people," he says, speaking in the local Pashto language.
"We arrested them in fighting here. They killed six innocent children in [the northwestern valley of] Swat in the same way," he claims.
The commander and his fighters then open fire on the men. They later pump bullets at close-range into the bodies which are still moving.
'Pre-dawn attack'
Mian Iftikhar Hussain, information minister for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said the video was taken in Upper Dir, where officials said Taliban crossed the border from Afghanistan to attack Pakistani police.
Mir Qasim Khan, police chief for Upper Dir district, put the number of victims in the video at 18, saying they were policemen and paramilitary police captured on June 1.
"It was a pre-dawn attack and that's why most of them are not wearing uniform," he said.
The Taliban was not reachable for comment on Monday.
Another police official said at the time that 500 fighters, including Afghan and Pakistani Taliban, took part in the attack, which began before dawn on June 1 and continued throughout the next day.
Taliban and other armed groups have carved out strongholds on both sides of the porous Afghanistan-Pakistan border, a region that the United States has called one of the most dangerous places in the world.
Upper Dir borders the region where the Pakistan military waged a major offensive against the local Taliban in Lower Dir, Buner and Swat in 2009.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Armed motorbike raid on Brent Cross jeweller
Footage of robbers on bikes riding into a shopping centre and raiding a jewellery store has been released by police.
Six people on three bikes sped into Brent Cross Shopping Centre, north-west London, on Tuesday morning.
The pillion passengers smashed the windows of Fraser Hart, leaving with a haul believed to be worth up to £2m.
Police also released pictures of three bikes that were abandoned four miles away near a golf course in Mill Hill.
No-one has been arrested over the raid.
The offenders entered the shopping centre about 15 minutes after it opened to public.
Image caption The robbers abandoned the three bikes near a golf course
As shoppers and workers watched, the robbers, who were armed with bats and axes, smashed windows and made off with watches and jewellery.
The robbers, who were wearing dark clothing and crash helmets, fled the scene before abandoning their bikes about 15 minutes later on Ashley Walk, police said.
The bikes were a purple Triumph Street Treble, a white triumph Daytona and an orange KTM.
Det Ch Insp Harry Hennigan said: "It is miraculous how nobody was injured during yesterday's shocking events.
"The suspects had absolutely no regard for public safety and they could have very easily mown down an unsuspecting shopper or member of staff."
The officer has urged anyone who may have seen the raid or seen the motorbikes being driven from the shopping centre to Mill Hill to come forward with information.
The earliest breakup on record has begun in the middle Kuskokwim River, but ice is still holding in the upper and lower sections of the river, according to a story from KYUK Public Media. Those are the results from an aerial survey by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which photographed the Kuksokwim from the Holitna River tributary to Napakiak on Monday.
Crane Johnson, National Weather Service hydrologist, says the crew observed in-place sheet ice upstream of the Holitna with some large, open areas.
He says the ice sheet at Sleetmute has shifted. The river from Red Devil to 15 miles upstream of Napaimute has in-place sheet ice that's starting to weaken.
Open water begins just upstream of Napaimute to just upstream of Aniak with ice clinging to the banks. Then, Johnson says, chunk ice and small pans have formed an ice jam around Aniak.
"Then it was sheet ice from Aniak all the way down to the Kuskoquak with some open areas and some shifting but mostly sheet ice that was beginning to weaken," Johnson said. "And then downstream from the Kuskoquak it was in place ice with larger open areas, and the ice was darker and it weakened more."
Johnson says it's typical during a thermal breakup, or mushout as it's also called, for breakup to occur at multiple points along the river. That's different from typical breakups where a main ice front moves downstream.
"The important thing right now is those areas that have open water at Napaimute and Chuathbaluk, they'll see heavy runs of ice as the upriver continues to break up," he said.
Which means, boaters, watch out.
Johnson says Wednesday the National Weather Service will dispatch its annual River Watch team to Aniak. The crew will spend a few days flying the river, sending ice reports to communities and stopping in various villages to help residents prepare for potential flooding. Johnson says it's a precaution, since a mushout reduces the likelihood of flooding occurring.
According to NWS archives, the earliest breakup on record for Aniak since 1957 occurred April 24, 1998. The earliest breakup on record for Kalskag since 1938 occurred April 22, 1940. And the earliest breakup on record for Crooked Creek since 1938 occurred April 13, 1960.
Official breakup dates for communities with open water along the middle Kuskokwim have not been designated. David Streubel, NWS hydrologist, says the river's main ice front moving past communities usually classifies breakup. With the mushout changing that definition, Streubel says the River Watch team will consult with these communities on their selected breakup date.

Oversight Board Spares NYPD's Feelings By Softening Language In Taser Complaint Report
from the say-a-prayer-for-the-people-in-power dept
The NYPD's estranged relationship with its oversight continues. The Civilian Complaint Review Board -- put into place after it became apparent the NYPD wasn't interested in policing itself -- has noticed the department is vocally supportive of better policing, but has no interest in actually making any changes to the way it disciplines its officers.
The NYPD has yet to see a civilian complaint it can't make disappear and has almost always recommended a lesser punishment for misconduct than the Board has recommended. In controversial "chokehold" cases, the Board found the NYPD was completely uninterested in doing anything about officers' use of a tactic it has outlawed.
In those cases where CCRB substantiated chokeholds, recommended Administrative Charges, and DAO became involved, none of the substantiated cases ever went to trial before a NYPD Trial Commissioner. Instead, DAO departed from CCRB's recommendation every time. Rather than pursue the more serious Administrative Charges, DAO recommended lesser penalties or no discipline whatsoever.
Despite being shown no respect by the NYPD, the CCRB has decided to protect the badged-and-armed delicate flower of the department by softening the language in its Taser use report before publication.
In the spring, an oversight agency for the New York Police Department circulated a draft report on the use of Taser stun guns. The report highlighted “troubling” findings and issued stern recommendations: The police should create an annual report on the use of Tasers and prohibit their use on handcuffed suspects. But the latter recommendation was removed from the final version of the report, quietly released in October by the agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, with no formal announcement. The other was removed from the executive summary and relegated to the report's final page. The agency also removed language highlighting what police reform advocates and civil liberties groups later said was the board's central finding: In most Taser encounters reviewed, officers used the stun guns on people who were unarmed.
What the CCRB found wasn't encouraging. The NYPD already has a troubled history of Taser misuse. Not much is made of it because Taser deployment in the force is severely limited. But the NYPD's ability to make even a small number of civilian complaints vanish into the ether remains unchanged. The New York Times highlights the report's findings, which are disturbing and have remained unaltered.
Over the period studied in the report, from 2014 through 2015, the board's investigators conducted full investigations of 51 of the 153 complaints filed and substantiated only three of them.
The other 102 fell by the wayside because the complainants failed to cooperate with the investigation. Perhaps some of them felt the outcome would be no different than the 94% that did make it all the way through the process. Perhaps some had outstanding warrants, unpaid tickets, a general disinterest in interacting with law enforcement, or whatever. But with only six percent of complaints being substantiated, the outcome of the NYPD's internal efforts are par for the course: lots of complaints, almost zero repercussions.
But just as disheartening is the fact that the CCRB edited its report to ensure the NYPD wouldn't even feel the weight of PRINTED WORDS.
The alterations to the report run throughout and appear to play down the findings — which remain unchanged — and remove language that could be considered charged or critical of the Police Department.
This is an organization with an inordinate amount of power -- both over the people it serves and the politicians that ostensibly control its budget and activities. Specific edits were made to turn the report into something as proactively exonerative as statements made by the NYPD itself in the wake of excessive force allegations. Police brass say things like "the officer's gun discharged." The CCRB -- post-editing -- says things like this:
[T]he draft report found that “there is also evidence” that Tasers were being used in response to unruly or obstinate behavior by suspects. That phrase was changed in the final version to say that “there is concern.”
Also excised was the Board's "troubling" finding that Taser deployment often occurred when suspects were already in custody. The stat -- 30% of the time -- remains. The word "troubling" is nowhere to be found. Another sentence was removed completely, apparently out of concern the NYPD might react badly to it.
"[A] review of several of the police custody complaints supports the perception that the Tasing may have occurred unnecessarily."
The NYPD needs to be subjected to strong language that draws attention unavoidably to its use of excessive force. This is the sort of thing the NYPD finds to be "appropriate" Taser use.
Mr. Sells said in an interview that during the discovery phase of the lawsuit, he learned that two separate officers used Tasers on Mr. Paul, striking him a total of 13 times — six by one officer; seven by the other — over the course of 41 seconds.
Anthony Paul is dead. He was 29 years old when he died in NYPD custody. The NYPD brushed off accusations of excessive force with the above "appropriate" statement, as well as the excuse that the Tasers failed to deliver even more electricity to the eventual corpse of Mr. Paul.
"...not all of the “activations” resulted “in actual electrical circuit charge transmissions.”
A government entity that has the power to kill civilians who do not immediately subject themselves to an arrest is apparently too weak to handle direct criticism of its actions. The Board has wiped any implications from its findings, leaving the stats to speak for themselves. The facts aren't pretty, but the NYPD has no problem ignoring hard numbers and incontrovertible facts. But it must be protected from any insinuations that its use of force is sometimes too much… or occasionally unjustifiable.

I'm an expert at learning things the hard way.
For example, my two-year-old Acer PC had reached the point where it desperately needed a hard drive reformat/Windows reinstall. (For background, read "How to decide when it's time to reformat and reinstall Windows.")
Having been through this process many times before, I backed up all my data, made a list of the programs I'd need to reinstall, located my Windows DVD, and, because I'm a smart cookie, made a backup of all my drivers.
This last is really important, because once you wipe your hard drive and reinstall Windows, your system may have no audio, no Ethernet, no Wi-Fi, and possibly even no USB--all potentially major problems.
Following my own advice from a couple years back, I used the free Semper Driver Backup utility to copy every installed driver to the same external drive that contained all my backed up data. I checked the folder and, sure enough, saw a lengthy batch of driver-looking files. Now I was good to go.
Or so I thought. Once I'd finished reloading Windows, I checked Device Manager and found exactly what I expected: little yellow flags next to a half-dozen drivers. No problem; for each one I clicked Update Driver, navigated to my external drive, and let Windows do its thing.
Except it didn't work. Windows balked at nearly every driver I'd backed up, saying they "weren't digitally signed" or simply weren't compatible with the device in question. D'oh!
And because the problem drivers included Ethernet and Wi-Fi, I couldn't go online to get the correct ones.
Thankfully, Acer makes it fairly easy to find model-specific drivers via its support site, so I was able to use another PC to download what I needed. For the record, most of these drivers had their own installers, so it's possible Windows needed more than just the "raw drivers" for the various hardware elements.
Interestingly, I had one moment of serious concern when the machine wouldn't even read my external hard drive, meaning there was no way to access any drivers. Turns out I'd plugged into the sole USB 3.0 port, which itself required a driver that wasn't present. But the USB 2.0 ports worked just fine with Windows' stock drivers.
The moral of the story: When you're prepping for a reformat, head to the system maker's site and download all the drivers for your machine, because a driver backup may not provide everything you need.

Why Questlove's 201-Song Playlist For Keith Olbermann Is Bigger Than Hip-Hop

When it comes to music history, Questlove is an Afro-pick rocking compendium of knowledge. So when the co-founder of The Roots got wind that Keith Olbermann's come-lately compliment of Eminem's Trump smackdown was couched within a tweet that seemed to dismiss the entire genre of rap, he vowed to take the progressive pundit to school.
Olbermann, whose new book Trump Is F****** Crazy (this is not a joke) came out this week, was likely just tipping his hat to a fellow anti-Trumpite when he tweeted: "After 27 years of doubts about rap I am now an Eminem fan. Best political writing of the year, period." But the host of GQ's The Resistance unwittingly revealed his willful ignorance of the genre in the process.
"You have to have your mind SET to shut out hip hop," Questlove wrote Saturday in a series of 23 (unthreaded) tweets that questioned how the political commentator — with whom the five-time Grammy Award-winner often agrees — could be so culturally un-hip. "Saying you ignored rap for 27 years is basically saying you're indifferent to the very black lives you champion on your platform."
Then he proceeded to do the most Questlovian thing ever. He made Olbermann a mixtape.
Titled The Keith O Challenge, the resulting 201-song playlist is now streaming on Spotify. (And before you ask whether this is just some promos deal on the low, you should know that Questlove is also a "strategic ambassador and advisor" at the competing platform Pandora, which airs his weekly Questlove Supreme podcast. In other words, he did this one for — you guessed it — the culture.)
But here's the twist: Questlove's playlist contains not one single rap song. We'll get back to that in a minute.
Turns out he wasn't Olbermann's only vocal critic over the weekend, or the first. After appearing on All Things Considered last Friday to parse the fallout surrounding Eminem's BET Hip Hop Awards freestyle, I continued my commentary, originally intended for my on-air conversation with Kelly McEvers, on social media.
"[H]ow much rap have you listened [to] — or ignored — over the past 27 years?" I tweeted at Olbermann in a thread that somehow went viral. "[F]rom Chuck D to Joey Bad*ss, hip-hop has been the most politically outspoken genre of the last three decades."
The question posed to Olbermann was an attempt to grapple with all the misconceptions flourishing in the wake of Eminem's dis. With the hype reaching a mainstream pitch, Eminem's attack of the president's policies and personal character was being framed as some kind of first — as if hip-hop, and the bulk of African-American MCs who make up the genre, have been biting their tongues for the past year, and even the past 27, as Olbermann's tweet implied.
It revealed a deeper truth, in a sense. "By and large, white America still doesn't hear black people," I tweeted. And that in no way contradicts Nielsen's mid-year report for 2017, which ranked hip-hop/R&B as the most consumed music genre. Rather, it suggests that despite being entertained by our rhythm and modern-day blues, Middle America often fails to comprehend the black experience, even when painstakingly articulated. Hip-hop's righteous rage and political outspokenness still falls on deaf ears outside the culture. Eminem just echoed what his black and brown peers have been saying, spitting, screaming and streaming in record numbers for the past year and a half.
"So we get no credit for dissing Trump a year ago," West Coast rapper YG tweeted in the midst of last week's media frenzy. His song "F*** Donald Trump," featuring Nipsey Hussle, was released back in March 2016. It's one of numerous presidential critiques, ranging from profane to profound, released by artists including A Tribe Called Quest, Common, Kendrick Lamar, will.i.am, T.I. Amine, and a lot more.
The main thing that made Eminem's rehearsed freestyle different is his intended listener. He knows as well as anyone how much overlap there is on a Venn diagram of his fanbase and Trump's constituency. And that's no attempt to discredit Em because of his whiteness; he's an undeniable giant of the genre. But when his contemporaries of color take part in similar political discourse without receiving the same elevated platform or heightened fanfare, it highlights the insidious role race has played in the appropriation of black music since the industry's beginning.
By applauding Eminem's critique without full consideration of that context, Olbermann contributed to that historical downplaying. He shouldn't be expected to have an exhaustive knowledge of the genre; taste in music is totally subjective. But implying hip-hop lacks political heft is beyond laughable; it's legacy denial, whether intended or not.
Which brings us back to Questlove's monster playlist: More than 10 hours long and not one solitary rap song.
Listen To Questlove's 'The Keith O Challenge'
What it does contain, however, is a deep dive on the genre's genetic forebear: the funk. Questlove mines hip-hop's sonic DNA with heavily-sampled '60s/'70s classics from Earth, Wind & Fire, The Ohio Players, Sly and the Family Stone, The Meters, Booker T. and The MGs, Betty Davis, Diana Ross and, of course, a heap of James Brown.
It's a crate-diggers dream, full of familiar-sounding obscurities such as Dyke & The Blazers "Let A Woman Be A Woman - Let A Man Be A Man," notably sampled by artists ranging from Stetsasonic ("Sally") to Public Enemy ("Welcome To The Terrordome") to Tyler, the Creator ("Rusty"). There's Blackbyrds' "Mysterious Vibes" (Paris' "The Days Of Old," Big K.R.I.T.'s "Highs And Lows," et al.) and Faze-O's "Riding High" (EPMD's "Please Listen To My Demo" and more). The opening saxophone riff from Jay-Z's "Show Me What You Got"? It's in there, all languid and mellow, on Lafayette Afro Rock Band's "Darkest Light." And if you're looking for some of those uncleared gems buried in De La Soul's classic discography, still in digital limbo, you'll recognize the piano licks from Erma Franklin's 1969 cover of "Light My Fire" as the end transition of De La Soul Is Dead's "A Roller Skating Jam Named Saturdays."
Point being, this is deeper than rap. There's an entire cultural continuum that undergirds even the most commercial rubble of any genre. To doubt hip-hop is to dismiss its rich heritage and to shrug off the contemporary trials and triumphs of its progeny.
Though I seriously doubt Questlove ever saw the #KeithOlbermannMixtape hashtag I tweeted out the night before, hip-hop heads — whether afros or baldies like me — tend to think alike. The artist-scholar and occasional DJ probably already had the syllabus I'd merely alluded to cued up and ready to go. The best part is his 201-song playlist is just the jump-off. He's already promised to return next month with another installment.
More power to Questlove. It takes a special kind of emotional labor to play cultural ambassador to an indifferent audience. But to Olbermann's credit — and my surprise — he replied to my tweets the following day. "Hate to hit your narrative but I've been a fan of political protest music, rap and otherwise, for 50 years. My 'doubts' were about my personal tastes," he explained, before name-dropping a couple references meant to highlight his hip-hop bona fides. "I had Coolio and LL Cool J cassettes before I owned a CD player."
With that admission, he may have earned more pity than cool points. But point taken, nonetheless.
"Eminem's bodying Trump was the first time I got the thrill," Olbermann continued. "No disrespect intended, a more public questioning of my own tastes."
And every man should indeed be entitled to his own taste. But if Keith O ever feels the urge to challenge himself with a deep dive into hip-hop's historical and sociopolitical significance, Questlove's curated the perfect playlist for that.
I'll be bumping it on repeat in the meantime.
I'm standing in Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, struggling to get my bearings. A group of Marines huddles in front of me, but I can't quite hear what they're saying, so I turn around and look for something more interesting. All I find is a pile of chairs and other junk. I wonder what it's doing there. And that's when I hear the gun shots.
In reality, I'm in Manhattan, sitting in a comfortable black office chair with headphones on and a virtual reality simulator called the Oculus Rift strapped to my face like a pair of ski goggles. But I still feel a real sense of danger as I spin my chair to look for the shots' source.
And that is exactly the point.
Danfung Dennis
The creator of this video is Danfung Dennis, who is best known for Hell and Back Again, a film he directed about the war in Afghanistan. Dennis was inspired by war photographers like Huynh Cong “Nick” Ut, whose famous photograph of children running away from their burning village after a napalm attack seared an image of the war's cost into the minds of Americans. But even as Dennis's own footage from a far-off war was nominated for an Oscar, he didn't feel that it had accomplished what he wanted it to. “I wanted people to witness it first hand,” he says. “I wanted to bring people into the story and let them see it. I maybe naively believed that images could change the world. It's not like [the “napalm girl”] image hasn't been taken in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's been taken so many times that it no longer has any impact on how we react to war. It's so abstract, it's so far away, so distant.”
It's what might happen if a documentary about virtual reality were crossed with the Matrix.
His frustration bred an obsession with immersive video. Four years ago, he started a company called Condition One that built technology to play 180-degree videos on the iPad and iPhone. If viewers moved their phones to the right, they would see what someone inside the scene would see if she turned her head to the right. Meanwhile, the company Oculus VR created a headset that costs $300, giving virtual reality the potential to expand to the masses (such headsets previously cost tens of thousands of dollars are been primarily used for military simulations). Condition One pivoted and started working on a virtual reality short film called Zero Point. The footage I'm watching is from that film.
Zero Point, Dennis says, will explore the world of virtual reality using scenes not only from Camp Pendleton, but also from the trade floor of the E3 video game convention in Los Angeles, and from an animated version of the international space station. It is not about war, but it's part of an effort to establish a medium that Dennis thinks could more accurately portray it. Condition One used a 360-degree, 3-D camera set-up to capture the footage and created a video engine that could stitch together all of those viewpoints–every angle, plus a separate camera for left- and right-eye views–into a seamless virtual reality environment.
The short film is due out this spring for developers (the consumer version of the Oculus Rift has not yet been released). In it, there will be interviews with virtual reality experts from Stanford and USC, independent game developers, and the founder of Oculus VR (Dennis describes Oculus VR as a “partner” in the film, but says it didn't provide funding). There will be a fictional dystopian storyline about where virtual reality could lead if people start spending all of their time in it. And all of this will take place in different corners of the space station, a solution that Dennis developed to avoid the abrupt cut.
Let's test React components with TDD, Mocha, Chai, and jsdom
Anthony Ng Blocked Unblock Follow Aug 18, 2016
In this tutorial, we'll learn how to write tests for React Components.
By keeping things simple, we'll end up with a webpack.config.js and a package.json file that we can still understand.
Why I recommend Test Driven Development
What's the big deal about Test Driven Development (TDD)? There are a lot of great articles and books on TDD, but here are some benefits I see from it:
Benefit #1: You create better code.
When you write tests first, you keep your code focused on what you are doing.
I've been in situations where I code by coincidence. I keep writing code until it works…assuming I remember what the goal of my code was.
TDD will keep you on track and cut fat from your code.
Benefit #2: You create cleaner code.
When you have well designed tests that pass, you know that you can safely refactor. How many times have you refactored your working code, only to break everything?
TDD gives you the vital signs of your code and warns you when something is wrong. It's an efficient way to catch regressions in your code.
Benefit #3: It's fun.
Creating code is a long, tough process. It may take you a while to see progress in your project.
TDD gives you instant feedback that you are going in the right direction. Seeing your tests pass gives you tiny victories and makes coding (for me, at least) a lot more enjoyable.
Do note that TDD isn't solely about unit tests. I like to think of TDD as a mindset where you create clean, succinct and purposeful code. Unit tests are just a side effect of TDD.
Tools we'll use
Testing React components is relatively simple because React components are pure functions. When you have Stateless/Presentational components, they are just functions that should return the same result given certain inputs.
Mocha
For this tutorial, we'll be using Mocha. Make sure to download this globally so you're able to run mocha from your command line.
$ npm install -g mocha
We'll add a script into our package.json to run our tests. Note the additional flags we are using to run the mocha from our command line.
— watch // Mocha will watch our source and test files and automatically rerun tests when the files change.
— compilers // We will use Babel to compile our ES6/JSX code in our tests.
— require // We will be running our “test_helper.js” file before our tests start. Our “test_helper.js” file will set up a fake DOM environment in Node.js that we will need to test our React components.
Chai
Chai is an assertion library that will help us write our tests in something that reads more like English.
// Instead of our tests reading as..
assert.equal(2 + 1, 3);
// …using Chai we can write…
expect(2 + 1).to.equal(3);
jsdom
jsdom is a JavaScript implementation of the DOM and HTML that we can use in Node.js.
When we test our React components, we will mount them to a DOM. Node.js doesn't come with a DOM, so that's where jsdom comes in: it sets up a fake browser environment for us.
Source Code
We have three components to test:
1. A To-do item that displays text.
2. A TodoList that displays a list of To-do components.
3. An TodoInput component which has an input field and a button. This component calls a callback when the button is clicked.
Let's get testing.
Tests To Run
By the way, you can see the full test files in Github.
1. To-do Component. What do we want to test?
With this component, we'll test to see whether the <div> tag with a class of “to-do” is rendered, and whether it rendered the correct text.
We'll use the “react-addons-test-utils” from the React team in our tests. It provides us with a “renderIntoDocument” function to render our To-do Component into our fake DOM:
const component = renderIntoDocument(
<To-do
to-do={‘Walk dog'}
/>
);
“react-addons-test-utils” also gives us some tools to traverse our DOM. The first one we'll look at is “findRenderedDOMComponentWithClass”, which will search our component for one element with a class of “to-do”:
const to-do = findRenderedDOMComponentWithClass(component, ‘to-do');
expect(to-do).to.be.ok;
Now, let's verify that the text content is what we expect it to be:
const todoText = todo.textContent;
expect(todoText).to.equal(‘Walk dog');
Let's move onto the TodoList.
2. TodoList Component. What do we want to test?
Let's make sure that we're getting a To-do component for each to-do.
First, we'll create a TodoList component and pass in three to-do items. We would expect three To-do components to be created.
Let's use another method from the React utils, “scryRenderedComponentsWithType”, to look through our component and find any child components whose type is of a given React class.
const todosEle = scryRenderedComponentsWithType(component, To-do);
expect(todosEle.length).to.equal(3);
3. TodoInput Component. What do we want to test?
We want to test if the input field and button is properly rendered onto the DOM.
React utils provides us with a method, “findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag”, which looks for one element with a given HTML tag.
const inputField = findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag(component, ‘input');
const button = findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag(component, ‘button');
expect(inputField).to.be.ok;
expect(button).to.be.ok;
Now, we want to test whether the button will run our callback method.
This is where it's good to have stateless components. We can mock our component's props and test that the component works.
let addTodoInvoked = false;
let addTodo = (to-do) => { addTodoInvoked = to-do };
const component = renderIntoDocument(
<TodoInput
addTodo={addTodo}
/>
);
We pass the “addTodo” function as a callback to the TodoInput component. Whenever the callback is run, it should update the “addTodoInvoked” variable with the text inside the input field.
You might be wondering how we're going to click this button to test whether the callback was run. Again, react-utils has a method, “Simulate”, to help us out. “Simulate” does what it sounds like it does — it simulates DOM actions (such as a “click”) for us.
First let's input a value into the text field. We do this by updating the value of the input field itself, then using Simulate.change to update the value in the DOM:
inputField.value = ‘Mow lawn';
Simulate.change(inputField);
Then, we'll use Simulate.click to click the button:
Simulate.click(button);
Our test should test that the callback has been run:
expect(addTodoInvoked).to.equal(‘Mow lawn');
And that's it — we just tested Stateless React components. Now it's more straightforward to set up tests and mock any callbacks, since we've keep our functions pure.
Testing Reducers
If we wanted to use Redux, we could test reducers in a similar manner, since they're also just pure functions.
This is actually even easier than testing React components, because states are just vanilla JavaScript data types. We don't need any additional utilities like we did for React components.
Let's say we have a reducer in our project, like below:
const initialState = [];
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
let newTodos;
switch(action.type) {
case ‘ADD_TODO':
newTodos = state.slice();
newTodos.push(action.data);
return newTodos;
default:
return state;
};
};
To test this, we have to stub an initial state and an action. An example of a test would look like the below:
const initialState = [‘Mow lawn'];
cons action = {
type: ‘ADD_TODO',
data: ‘Walk Dog'
};
const nextState = reducer(initialState, action);
expect(nextState).to.deep.equal([‘Mow lawn', ‘Walk Dog']);
Testing AJAX
Working with AJAX calls is another common functionality that you may want to test.
I recommend using “axios” for your AJAX needs. Axios is an HTTP client that you can use in the browser or with Node.js. This means that you'll get to use a consistent API no matter where you're making your AJAX calls from.
A basic GET request in axios would look like this:
axios.get(‘myUrl');
There are different approaches to testing this. For this tutorial, we'll use “sinon”, a testing library that gives us a lot of testing utility functions. It's similar to what react-addons-test-utils provided.
We'll look at a method called “stub”, which will let us see information about a method, such as how many times the method was called.
Our code to check that we're using axios to make a request would look like so:
// stub on the axios.get() method to see how many times it was called
sinon.stub(axios, ‘get');
// make a request using axios.get()
utility.makeAjax();
// expect that axios.get() was called once
expect(axios.get.callCount).to.equal(1);
Sinon gives us a lot of functionality, including spies, mocks, and creating fake XMLHttpRequests and fake servers.
When you start out, be cognizant of where you're running your tests (browser vs. Node.js). If you're running your tests in Node.js (like we did in this tutorial), do note that you won't have access to XMLHttpRequest and other browser objects because…well…you're not in a browser.
Some of sinon's functionalities expect a browser environment. If that's the case, you may want to consider running your tests through a browser.
You could also look into Karma to run your tests through a headless browser through your command line.
Have any questions? Do you do testing differently? Feel free to comment below.
For other people named Michael Smith, see Michael Smith (disambiguation)
Michael Smith (born August 27, 1972) is a Canadian actor, comedian and musician born in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, and raised in Thorburn. He is best known for his portrayal of "Bubbles" and co-writer of the ongoing cult classic television program, films and stage production Trailer Park Boys. He was also the guitarist for the Canadian rock band Sandbox. Smith earned a degree in English from St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia.[1] For a short time in 2006, he was engaged to actress Nichole Hiltz.
Musical interest [ edit ]
Smith showed early signs of musical talent, after learning to play the guitar at age six. Before becoming involved in Trailer Park Boys, he was a guitarist in the rock band Sandbox,[1] and signed a record deal with EMI in Canada, and Nettwerk in the United States. Sandbox released two albums with EMI and Nettwerk, entitled Bionic and A Murder in the Glee Club. Sandbox was nominated for a Juno Award, East Coast Music Awards, and a CASBY Award.
Smith has worked on such films as The Weight of Water and Serendipity.[2]
Later, Smith performed as part of Bubbles & the Shit Rockers, a band that also featured founding Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson and Tom Wilson for the original song "Liquor & Whores" featured on Trailer Park Boys: The Movie Soundtrack. A Trailer Park Boys episode also features Smith's character Bubbles playing the 1977 Rush track "Closer to the Heart" with Alex Lifeson.
Smith has performed "Liquor & Whores" with Guns N' Roses on multiple occasions on their Chinese Democracy Tour Series, in 2006, 2010 and 2011.[3]
Smith has also recorded with Emm Gryner in "Get Brave" released in 2010.
Acting career [ edit ]
Smith had been a long-time friend of Trailer Park Boys director Mike Clattenburg, and starred in "Cart Boy" with Robb Wells (Ricky) and John Paul Tremblay (Julian) in 1995.
Smith was "messing" around on the set one day and slipped into his Cart Boy character from the short "The Cart Boy".[1] Clattenburg apparently realized the depth this character held, and the Cart Boy, now known as Bubbles, was written into the show. Bubbles was never intended to be a main character, but the more outrageously he behaved, the more audiences loved him, developing him to become a breakout character. Bubbles then became one of the three main protagonists, having established that he knew Julian and Ricky from school back in the late 70s to high school in the late 80s.
Smith made an appearance as Bubbles in Snow's 2002 music video Legal, but his swearing remained censored. He was also featured in Country Star George Canyon's video for "Drinkin Thinkin", which showed Bubbles going after his girlfriend. Mike and the rest of the Trailer park boys appeared in The Tragically Hip video, "The Darkest One". He has appeared in character as Bubbles at several Guns N' Roses 2006 Canadian tour dates and dates in Australia and Japan in 2007. Bubbles, along with Ricky and Julian, hosted the 2006 and the 2007 East Coast Music Awards, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island and Halifax, Nova Scotia respectively.
In March 2008, Smith, along with three others, opened a sports bar in Halifax called "Bubba Ray's".[4]
Smith also was involved in another bar, "Bubbles' Mansion", located in Downtown Halifax. The bar, partly owned by Smith, closed its doors on Wednesday, March 24, 2010 after 4 years of operation, a decision the management attributed to government hikes in the minimum wage and minimum drink prices.[5]
In 2010, Smith reunited with many of his former Trailer Park Boys castmates in the new series The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Fun Time Hour.[6]
He also performed a live version of "Closer to the Heart" with progressive rock band Rush.
On October 22, 2012, it was confirmed that Smith will return to his role as Bubbles for a third feature length Trailer Park Boys film entitled "Don't Legalize It" which concluded filming in late April 2013. The film was released on April 18, 2014.
In the spring of 2013, Smith along with his Trailer Park Boys cohorts Wells and Tremblay started Swearnet, an internet-based television network that is entirely uncensored. The trio have also produced a film that is a fictional take on their website.

HONG KONG — The state news agency in China, the official voice of the government, has called for the United States to quickly adopt stricter gun controls in the aftermath of the shooting rampage in Connecticut that left 28 people dead, including 20 schoolchildren.
According to the state medical examiner who was overseeing autopsies of the children, all of them had been hit multiple times. At least one child had been shot 11 times.
All of the children were in the first grade.
“Their blood and tears demand no delay for U.S. gun control,” said the news agency, Xinhua, which listed a series of shootings this year in the United States.
“However, this time, the public feels somewhat tired and helpless,” the commentary said. “The past six months have seen enough shooting rampages in the United States.”
China suffered its own school tragedy on Friday — a man stabbed 22 children at a village elementary school in Henan Province. An 85-year-old woman also was stabbed.
There were no fatalities, although Xinhua reported that some of the children had had their fingers and ears cut off. The attacker, a 36-year-old man, was reportedly in custody. There was no immediate explanation for his possible motives.
On Sunday, the Web site China Smack compiled a range of comments on Sina Weibo, the Twitter-like service in China. One said: “They should issue a bulletproof vest to every American elementary school student as their school uniform.”
Another comment related to President Obama fighting back tears while addressing the nation on Friday:
In the face of Henan children suffering harm, did our country's leaders shed a tear!? Why is it that when this kind of incident happens, they always pretend to be deaf and mute!? I'm not saying that our leaders have to be like Obama shedding tears, but can we at least be like others in facing the incident? Instead of the mainstream media not even covering it, hiding it, attempting to avoid it every time the country has a “special incident.”
China experienced a spate of attacks on schoolchildren in 2010, with almost 20 deaths and more than 50 injuries. In the fourth of the assaults, a crazed man beat five toddlers with a hammer, then set himself on fire while holding two youngsters.
In another of those attacks in 2010, Zheng Minsheng, 42, stabbed and killed eight primary school students in Fujian Province. Five weeks later, after a quick trial, he was executed.
My colleague Michael Wines reported at the time: “Some news reports stated that Mr. Zheng had mental problems, but most state media said no such evidence existed. Mental illness remains a closeted topic in modern China, and neither medication nor modern psychiatric treatment is widely used.”
“Most of the attackers have been mentally disturbed men involved in personal disputes or unable to adjust to the rapid pace of social change in China,” The Associated Press reported Saturday, adding that the rampages pointed to “grave weaknesses in the antiquated Chinese medical system's ability to diagnose and treat psychiatric illness.”
Private ownership of guns — whether pistols, rifles or shotguns — is almost unheard of in China. Handgun permits are sometimes (but rarely) given to people living in remote areas for protection against wild animals.
The Chinese school assaults were carried out with knives, kitchen cleavers or hammers, the usual weapons of choice in mass attacks in China. As a precaution before the recent Communist Party Congress in Beijing, the sale of knives was banned in the central area of the capital.
Dr. Ding Xueliang, a sociologist at the University of Science and Technology in Hong Kong, speaking about the Chinese tragedy on Friday, told CNN that “the huge difference between this case and the U.S. is not the suspect, nor the situation, but the simple fact he did not have an effective weapon.
“In terms of the U.S., there's much easier availability of killing instruments — rifles, machine guns, explosives — than in nearly every other developed country.”
In a blog on the Web site of The New Yorker, the magazine's China correspondent, Evan Osnos, wrote:
It takes a lot to make China's government — beset, as it is, by corruption and opacity and the paralyzing effects of special interests — look good, by comparison, in the eyes of its people these days. But we've done it. When Chinese viewers looked at the two attacks side by side, more than a few of them concluded, as one did that, “from the look of it, there's no difference between a ‘developed' country and a ‘developing' country. And there's no such thing as human rights. People are the most violent creatures on earth, and China, with its ban on guns, is doing pretty well!”
Japan, too, has a near-total ban on private gun ownership, and the infrequent mass attacks there — which included a tragic rampage at a primary school in 2001— typically have involved knives.
“Almost no one in Japan owns a gun,” said Max Fisher, writing in The Atlantic in July. “Most kinds are illegal, with onerous restrictions on buying and maintaining the few that are allowed. Even the country's infamous, mafia-like Yakuza tend to forgo guns; the few exceptions tend to become big national news stories.”
In 2006, Japan had two gun-related homicides. “And when that number jumped to 22 in 2007,” Mr. Fisher said, “it became a national scandal.”
“East Asia, despite its universally restrictive domestic gun policies, hosts some of the world's largest firearm exporters and emerging industry giants: China, South Korea and Japan,” according to GunPolicy.org, a comprehensive global database maintained by the Sydney School of Public Health at the University of Sydney.
In recent weeks, Chinese police officials in Jiangsu Province seized more than 6,000 illegal guns from two underground workshops and warehouses; a retired prison guard in Hong Kong was jailed for 18 months for keeping an arsenal of guns, silencers, grenades and thousands of rounds of ammunition in his public-housing apartment; and 17 suspected gun smugglers went on trial in Shanghai as part of a joint investigation with U.S. law enforcement officials.
In the Shanghai case, more than 100 semiautomatic handguns, rifles, shotguns and gun parts were express-mailed to China from the United States. One of the masterminds on the American end was Staff Sgt. Joseph Debose, 30, a soldier with a Special Forces National Guard unit in North Carolina. He pleaded guilty to federal charges in September.
“The defendant traded the honor of his position in the National Guard for the money he received for smuggling arms to China,” said Loretta E. Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. “In blatant disregard for everything he was sworn to uphold, the defendant placed numerous firearms into a black market pipeline from the United States to China.”
What's your view? Would the United States do well to emulate China and Japan, with their comprehensive bans on guns? Or is America a special case because of its Constitutional protections of gun ownership? And apropos of the Fujian attack described above, would you support similarly speedy trials and the death penalty for mass murderers of children?
Homeschooling Family Sued For Allowing Kids To Play Outside
A homeschooling family in Texas is being sued by their neighbors for letting their children play outside during the day. According to the neighbors, the family let their four home-schooled children play outside during the day when most other kids are in regular school. They say that the kids caused a noise disturbance and they are seeking remedy over the incident. However, the mother of the four children says that's not exactly what took place.
Mother, Kelly Counts, says that her neighbors never voiced their concerns to her, but she says that they did proceed to play loud and offensive rap music from their windows every time that the children would go outside to play. Count says that their actions have made it so that she doesn't even feel comfortable in her own house and now she's having to go to court over her children playing outside in the backyard during the day.
Neighbors, Irving and Anita Ward, are allegedly complaining that the kids are too loud and that their playing outside upsets their dogs and disturbs their peace and quiet. Ultimately, the neighbors are saying that Counts' children are disturbing their right to a peaceful home. The Wards are suing the family for the noise that is created by the kids outside. The Wards claim that their “tranquil quality of life” is destroyed by the noise from the children and that the playhouse in the backyard causes “visibility issues for them and their pets.”
Mother of the four, Kelly Counts, says that every time she has tried to speak with them over the issue, that they aren't co-operative or that they slam the door in her face. It will be interesting to see how the case unfolds, as to whether or not the Wards are guaranteed their “peace and quiet” during daylight hours.
Over the last several years the homeschooling, UN-schooling, and hack-schooling trends have been increasing. These innovative new approaches to education are becoming more popular with parents, as more people seek to find an educational service for their children that will foster their individuality and creativity; while catering to their very own unique needs.

The Erotic World of Women Who Don't Know They Have Cats On Their Heads
*** PLEASE READ THE FAQ BEFORE POSTING***
I am sick of saying this. This is NOT a forum about women being FORCED to put cats on their head. This is NOT a forum about women CONSENTING to put cats on their head or women who are CURIOUS about putting cats on their heads. It is not a dumping ground for generic Women With Cats On Their Heads fetish pictures. This is a forum ONLY for pictures and stories about women who UNKNOWINGLY have cats on their heads, OK???? There are already dozens of places catering to those other tastes and if you post off-topic material you WILL be banned.
And OVER-18s only.

When a constituent confronted Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) Thursday about why he wasn't holding a town hall event during this week's congressional recess, Rubio gave what seemed an honest answer.
“I don't know man, because town halls, people get rude and stupid ― on both sides,” the senator told the man.
A community organizer for the Florida chapter of the Service Employees International Union tweeted a video of the encounter, which happened in a lecture hall at Florida International University, where Rubio teaches a class. The questioner appears to be Rafael Velasquez, a member of the Florida Democratic party's board of trustees.
We finally caught up with Senator Marco Rubio at @FIU. He told us that he won't host a townhall because people act "rude and stupid." pic.twitter.com/DrefDkvrFD — Tomas Kennedy (@Tomaskenn) February 23, 2017
The senator is one of several Republican members of Congress struggling with angry constituents as lawmakers take a break from Washington, D.C. Instead of getting yelled at for working with President Donald Trump to repeal Obamacare, Rubio and many other Republicans decided not to hold any public forums.
Rubio's constituents held a town hall on his behalf Thursday night, with an empty suit standing in for the senator. One woman pleaded with the suit not to repeal Obamacare, since doing so would leave her uninsured, unable to afford her medication, and then confined to a wheelchair and unemployed.
The man confronting Rubio earlier on Thursday suggested a town hall would allow the senator to hear from the people his represents, but Rubio said he didn't need to.
Your copy of Endless Legend should have a free update today, adding various bits and pieces from the free Eye on the Stars expansion. As I wrote a couple of days back, the game is getting this (free) update and a paid expansion in April.
Eyes on the Stars will be Amplitude's third free update for the well received 4x title.
As well as releasing a few new screenshots (which you can see around this news piece,) Amplitude has gone into more detail about what's added by Endless Legend: Eye on the Stars.
Top billing goes to a new Victory Quest, which involves locating and fixing up an abandoned spaceship so that your faction can leave the planet. There are also three new map generation presets (New World, Scattered and Symmetrical,) plus a new minor faction: the Dorgeshi. Integrating these guys gives you a bonus to luxuries and “a powerful charging cavalier unit.”
Diplomacy has been slightly expanded; it's now possible to ask your allies to declare war on another faction.
You can read the full and extensive patch/changelog for Endless Legend on Amplitude's site, here. The update is estimated to be due at 6-7pm today; presumably in Amplitude's own European timezone.
April's paid DLC will be called Guardians and is due on the 16th of that month.
For the ground-breaking effects of the original 1977-Star Wars, the filmmakers didn't have racks of servers and terabytes of computing power to create the movie's fantastic alien worlds and spectacular space battles. They used the practical tools at hand and combined them with the creative, “anything is possible” sensibility of a mad scientist.
With that type of approach to their work, you can imagine then that those original special effects artists might have a certain level of admiration for what filmmakers Bryan Harley and Roque Rodriguez recently pulled off.
The friends and Star Wars fans finished a “sweded” version—a low-budget, quickly made adaptation of a popular, big budget movie—of one of the latest trailers for the film series' upcoming installment, The Force Awakens. That trailer was posted Wednesday by Reddit user troyisprettydamncool in the Star Wars community after it popped up on YouTube.
“Making this was just like being a kid again, except we had to build our toys from scratch,” Harley, operations manger of a Fresno, Calif., TV station, shares with Upvoted.
Some of those homemade playthings that were used to re-create the teaser footage included corrugated doppelgängers on sticks for the Millennium Falcon, X-wings, and TIE fighters; plastic toy soldiers as stand-ins for the evil First Order army; and a ton of cardboard boxes that doubled as droids, Stormtrooper armor, and the desert planet Jakku. (Thankfully, a large work shipment provided Harley with a huge supply of empty cardboard boxes.)
“It took about three to four weeks in between sleep, our day jobs, and other commitments,” Harley, 31, says. “We've been working on it pretty much since Lucasfilm released the trailer online in October. We also had a lot of help from friends—playing the roles, building props and costumes, and actually executing the shots. Some shots required up to four people just to hold or puppeteer the various set pieces and props.”
The biggest challenge for Harley and Rodriguez was finding innovative and inexpensive shooting solutions for scenes that captured the feel of the originals they were mimicking.
“BB-8 was definitely a big challenge because we wanted him to roll, but also had to keep his head from moving,” Harley says about bringing to life the mechanical breakout star of The Force Awakens, an astromech droid that looks like R2-D2's head attached to an orange-and-white beachball. “The hyperspace shot was difficult, too. It took several attempts and a couple failed concepts.”
Harley and Rodriquez are no strangers to making sweded movies and trailers. They've been doing it since the 2008 release of Michel Gondry's Be Kind Rewind, the movie that popularized the concept and coined the term. Their YouTube channel, Dumb Drum, hosts sweded versions of Die Hard, Pacific Rim, and other blockbusters. In 2011, Harley and Rodriguez gained attention for their sweded trailer of The Avengers.
The duo also has taken the idea of sweded movies a step further and used it as the foundation for a yearly event.
“We decided to create an annual film festival here in Fresno called Swede Fest where we encourage movie fans of all ages to re-create their favorite movie in under four minutes, and then we get together and show them on the big screen at a local movie theater,” Harley explains. “We always create our own sweded film to show at the event.”
Harley and Rodriguez's next undertaking is to rest and recover from their grueling Force Awakens shoot. But the filmmakers are definitely planning to do more sweded trailers in the future.
And how does the sweded trailer for The Force Awakens compare to the official version? Watch this side-by-side video and decide for yourself.
Kate Brown bill signing.JPG
SALEM, APRIL 17, 2017 -- Gov. Kate Brown signs Senate Bill 863, which prohibits Oregon marijuana retailers from keeping or sharing customers' personal information.
(Anna Marum/The Oregonian)
Oregonians who worry about a federal crackdown on legal marijuana use now have an extra layer of protection: Gov. Kate Brown on Monday signed a bill that prohibits the state's marijuana retailers from sharing or keeping information about their customers' identities or purchases.
Senate Bill 863, which drew broad bipartisan support, flew through the Legislature and is one of the first bills to be signed by the governor this session.
"I think it's appropriate under the circumstances," Brown said after signing it.
She fears the Trump administration could make good on its threat of a "higher level of federal engagement" when it comes to legalized pot, she said.
The bill's signing comes after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in January that he couldn't promise to continue to ignore federal laws prohibiting marijuana use, and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer suggested in February that states will be subject to "greater enforcement" of those laws.
In March, Brown said she was willing to "go to bat" for Oregon's burgeoning pot industry and that she would "respond appropriately" should the White House take any action.
In Trump era, Oregon pot industry leaders surprisingly chill about possible crackdown White House officials have warned of "greater enforcement" of recreational marijuana programs, but Oregon's pot industry has more protections than you might think.
Earlier this month, Brown, along with the governors of Alaska, Colorado and Washington wrote a letter to Sessions and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin asking for clarity on the administration's marijuana policy.
In response, Sessions said the Department of Justice will look at marijuana as part of a broader crime-reduction policy review.
For now, the newly signed bill protects pot users by prohibiting shops from keeping or transferring customers' personal information, including names, birth dates and addresses.
This data, typically used for marketing and customer service, is often collected from customers' IDs, often without their knowledge. Shoppers may still sign up for emails from shops to get coupons or discounts.
Now that the law is in effect, Oregon marijuana retailers have 30 days to destroy their customers' data from their databases. The law does not apply to medical marijuana patients.

I had the opportunity to meet and purchase some books from Julia Gfrörer (ge-FRAIR) at Stumptown Comics Fest in Portland, Ore., last week. I had already acquired copies of her minicomics TOO DARK TO SEE and FLESH AND BONE and quite enjoyed her webcomic, BLACK IS THE COLOR, that was published on the Study Group website. She had copies of all of her minicomics, including printed editions of both parts of BLACK IS THE COLOR, which feature eye-catching green screenprinted covers that, intentionally or not, pair well with Gfrörer's own bright red hair. I decided that I'd like to have the minis, even though I'd already read the story several times online. It's about a sailor cast adrift in a small boat and the mermaids he encounters while slowly dying there. (The BLACK minicomics seem to be temporarily sold out online, but Fantagraphics is collecting the full story later this year.)
Gfrörer's stories are often dark and emotional, but BLACK also features wisps of dark humor, and I was struck by the way she depicted the mermaids and mermen acting like everyday humans, if a little on the hipster side. They prattle on about parties and recording music in their homes and gossip about other merfolk as soon as they leave the scene. Contrasted with the dying sailor's emotional turmoil, the mermaid scenes will make you smile. I asked Gfrörer what her inspiration for those scenes was, and she told me that she'd recently read the original Hans Christian Anderson story of The Little Mermaid and was taken aback by the way that mermaid sisters simply didn't understand the differences between the human and the mer worlds. Gfrörer said she found the whole idea so beautiful that it made her choke up just to think about it.
Gfrörer has published two other minicomics as well as having contributed to a number of anthologies, including the 2013 free comic book day release RUNNER RUNNER #2 from Tugboat Press, which features a one-page comic/illustration by Gfrörer titled “The 39 Ryan Goslings.”
Gfrörer's 2010 minicomic, FLESH AND BONE, published by Sparkplug, is again a bit of a morbid affair, featuring shocking imagery of demon worship and vegetable love. Gfrörer's grotesque sexual imagery should seem perverse, but in the service of this story about a man so desperate to be reunited with his dead love that he employs a child-eating witch, it works. Gfrörer's simple black line artwork and sturdy 9-panel grid create a well-paced exploration of the intersection of grief and black magic.
TOO DARK TO SEE, released in 2011, is a delicately terrifying story about a succubus that visits a young man in his sleep. The succubus is traditionally a female demon that visits men during the night and has sex with them, sometimes robbing them of their vitality altogether. Gfrörer draws them as scribbled shadows that creep from the corners of a darkened room, but they don't seem particularly menacing beyond being shadow beings. They have an ethereal, almost dreamlike quality. Perhaps they are more representative in this story than literal? In any case, any sense of unease created in this story is replaced with wonder by the end.
It's rare for minicomics to feel whole. Often they are repackaged versions of webcomics or other anthology pieces, and their minicomic incarnation feels like something slapped together for a con table. Not so with Gfrörer's minis. Even though BLACK IS THE COLOR first appeared online, its print edition is beautiful enough that it should be considered canon. Her other minis are books that I am proud to own and display, up there with Becky Cloonan's THE MIRE and WOLVES.
Give BLACK IS THE COLOR a read and decide if you'd like to add some of Gfrörer's minis to your collection. Also visit her website for lots of illustrations and other goodies: http://www.thorazos.net/

Attorney General Ken Paxton on Friday lost his last-minute bid for a court injunction to prevent the federal government from transferring its oversight of internet registrations to an international body.
Hours before the transition was set to take effect, a federal judge in Galveston ruled against Paxton and three other state attorneys general who had asked him to temporarily halt the transfer while they pursue a lawsuit challenging it. The four sued the federal government late Wednesday after Republicans in Congress, led by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, failed to halt the transfer.
At midnight Friday, the United States is set to cede control of the internet's domain system — essentially its address book — to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Critics say the move could open up the internet to censorship by unfriendly countries, while administration officials and many tech industry heavyweights say such concerns are misinformed.
In a statement late Friday, a Paxton spokesman called the ruling disappointing.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
"It's a dire day in our country when the president is allowed to unilaterally give away America's pioneering role in ensuring that the internet remains a place where free expression can flourish," the statement read. "We will continue to weigh our options as the suit moves forward."
Among other things, Paxton's lawsuit argues the move violates the property clause of the U.S. Constitution by giving away government property without congressional authorization. In a response to the lawsuit earlier Friday, the federal government criticized it as a last-ditch effort to stop something that has been years in the making — with everyone involved "fully aware" of it.
The ruling by Judge George C. Hanks Jr. came after a hearing in Galveston that lasted more than an hour. His reasoning was not immediately known.
Introduction
Vim , an improvement on the classic vi text editor, is extremely powerful at editing code and plain text. While it may seem obtuse and difficult at first, it is one of the most efficient ways of editing text due to its language like command syntax.
In a previous article, we discussed how to install vim and perform basic editing. In this document, we will continue to more advanced topics that may help demonstrate the versatility available when editing.
We will assume that you have installed vim and are familiar with the basic movement and editing commands discussed in the article linked above.
Advanced Navigation
Before beginning new material, let's review just a little navigation that we learned in the previous article:
Basic Movements h: left l: right j: down k: up
Other Movements gg: top of the document G: bottom of document or to line number if a number is placed in front of G w: next word e: end of word 0: beginning of line $: end of line
As you can see, we already have quite a few movement commands at our disposal. However, we can direct movement in other ways as well.
We can move the cursor to different areas in the currently visible portion of the page by using these commands:
H : Move cursor to the top of the currently visible page (think "high")
M : Move cursor to the middle of the currently visible page
L: Move cursor to the bottom of the currently visible page (think "low")
If we want to move the page instead of the cursor (as in scrolling), we can use these commands:
CTRL-D : Page down
CTRL-U : Page up
CTRL-E : Scroll down one line
CTRL-Y: Scroll up one line
We can also navigate by logical blocks of information. This can be useful if you are typing regular text instead of code. These are similar to the word and line navigation commands.
) : Move to start of next sentence
( : Move to start of last sentence
} : Move to start of next paragraph (as delimited by a blank line)
{: Move to start of last paragraph (as delimited by a blank line)
You can also define your own points in the file to jump to. You can set marks at any point in a file. You can then reference those marks to either jump to that point or pass that point to a command that accepts movements:
m : Typing "m" followed by a letter creates a mark reference by that letter. Lower-case letters are specific to the current document, while upper-case letters can only be used once (they can be used to jump to sections in different documents.
' : The single quote followed by a mark letter (previously defined with the "m" as above), will move the cursor to the beginning of the line containing that mark.
`: The back-tick followed by a mark letter will move the cursor to the exact position of the mark.
These commands allow you to place a mark and then yank, delete, or format on the area defined between the current position and the mark. This allows for very fine-grained control over editing options.
How To Manage Documents
Often when you're working, whether on a software project or a term paper, you want to be able to reference multiple documents at once. Vim has a few different ways of doing this, depending on how you wish to work.
How To Manage Buffers
One way to manage multiple files is through buffers . Buffers usually represent a file open for editing. They are basically everything that vim has open currently and can get access to easily.
We open multiple files with vim like this:
vim file1 file2 file3
Each of these files is opened in its own buffer.Currently, we can only see the first file.
We can see which buffers we have available by typing :buffers .
:buffers
:buffers 1 %a "file1" line 1 2 "file2" line 0 3 "file3" line 0 Press ENTER or type command to continue
If we wish to check out the next buffer, we can type :bn . This will change to the next buffer. Similarly, we can switch to a buffer by number (in the first column above), or name, by typing b followed by the number or name. This works even if the file name is not complete.
Here are some of the commands to manage buffers:
:buffers : List available buffers
:ls : Same as above
:bn : Switch to next buffer
:bp : Switch to previous buffer
:bfirst : Switch to first buffer
:blast : Switch to last buffer
:bdelete : Delete the current buffer
:badd : Open a new buffer with the filename that follows
:e: Edit another file in a new buffer and switch to it.
How To Manage Windows
A separate control mechanism that vim has for managing multiple files is the concept of windows or views . This allows you to split the current editing area into different windows so that you can view multiple buffers at the same time.
To split the current workspace into separate windows, you can type :split or :sp . This opens a new window above the current one and changes focus to that window. You can change the buffer shown in the new window by using the buffer commands shown above.
Here are some commands that we can use to create and manage windows:
:sp : Split the current window in two. The same buffer will be shown in each window initially. Precede the "sp" with a number to set the new window height.
:vs : Split the current window vertically. The same buffer will be shown in each window initially. Precede the "vs" with a number to set the new window width.
CTRL-ww : Change focus to the next window
CTRL-w(movement) : Change focus to the window in the direction (h,j,k,l) indicated
CTRL-wc : Close the current window
CTRL-w+ : Increase size of current window
CTRL-w- : Decrease size of current window
CTRL-w= : Set all windows to equal size
#CTRL-w_ : Sets the height to the size indicated by the preceding "#"
:only : Close all windows but the current one
CTRL-wn: Opens a new window with a new buffer
How To Manage Tabs
A third concept for managing multiple documents within vim is that of tabs . Unlike many programs, in vim, tabs can contain windows, not the other way around. Tabs can contain windows, which act as viewports into buffers.
We can manage the window layout of each tab separately. To create tabs we can use the :tabnew command to open a new tab.
Some easy ways to manage tabs are:
:tabnew : Open new tab
:tabclose : Close current tab
:tabn : Switch to next tab
gt : Switch to next tab
:tabp : Switch to previous tab
gT : Switch to previous tab
:tab ball : Open all buffers in individual tabs
:tabs: List all available tabs
With shuffling around with buffers, windows, and tabs, it sometimes becomes confusing which file you are currently viewing. A quick way to find out the filename you're currently viewing is to type:
CTRL-g: Displays current file name
Document Specific Commands
Depending on what kind of documents you are dealing with, vim has certain functionality that may help you.
Plain Text
If you are editing plain text documents, vim can assist you in a variety of ways. One of the features that is essential for this function is spell check.
To turn on spell checking within vim, you can type:
:set spell
To set the language that is being used, you can type:
:set spelllang=[language abbreviation]
Now, your document will be checked for spelling. The normal squiggly line will appear under misspelled words. This is how you use it.
To jump back and forth between misspelled words, type:
]s # Jump to next mistake [s # Jump to previous mistake
Once your cursor is over a misspelled word, you can see spelling suggestions by typing:
z=
This will give you a list of possible matches. You can select the option you want by choosing the associated number, or you can press ENTER to keep the word as it is.
If you want to mark a word as not being misspelled, you can add it to one of the spelling list. Vim maintains two spelling lists, a regular list and a temporary list that will be used for the current session.
To add the word to the "good" words lists, use one of these commands:
zg # Adds word to regular dictionary zG # Adds word to the current session dictionary
If you accidentally add a word, you can remove it by going to the word and typing:
zug # Remove word from regular dictionary zuG # Remove word from the current session dictionary
If you find yourself having to type out long words of phrases often, you can add an abbreviation.
If we type :ab followed by an abbreviation and an expansion, vim will input the expansion whenever we type the abbreviation followed by a space.
For instance, if we are sticklers who follow Richard Stallman's example of correcting any usage of "Linux" with "GNU/Linux", we can create an abbreviation that automatically does that:
:ab Linux GNU/Linux
Now, when we type "Linux", vim will automatically substitute "GNU/Linux".
Linux is an operating system.
Changes to:
GNU/Linux is an operating system.
If we find ourselves talking specifically about the kernel though, where only the word Linux would be appropriate, we can cancel the expansion by typing CTRL-V before typing the space.
GNU/Linux is an operating system with Linux(CTRL-V) as a kernel.
If we no longer wish to use this abbreviation, we can remove it with this command:
:una Linux
Now our "Linux" will remain "Linux".
Another thing you might have to do from time to time is insert characters that are not on a traditional qwerty keyboard. We call these "digraphs". You can see a list of vim's digraph by typing:
:digraphs
NU ^@ 10 SH ^A 1 SX ^B 2 Exes ^C 3 ET ^D 4 EQ ^E 5 AK ^F 6 BL ^G 7 BS ^H 8 HT ^I 9 LF ^@ 10 VT ^K 11 FF ^L 12 CR ^M 13 SO ^N 14 SI ^O 15 DL ^P 16 D1 ^Q 17 D2 ^R 18 D3 ^S 19 D4 ^T 20 NK ^U 21 SY ^V 22 EB ^W 23 CN ^X 24 EM ^Y 25 SB ^Z 26 EC ^[ 27 FS ^\ 28 GS ^] 29 RS ^^ 30 US ^_ 31 SP 32 Nb # 35 DO $ 36 At @ 64
Now, you can insert any of the characters on the right column by typing CTRL-k followed by the two letters on the left column.
For instance, on my computer, to enter a British pound sign, I can type this when in insert mode:
CTRL-k Pd
£
Source Code
If you are coding, there are a number of different things that will help you interact with your code.
One of the most basic is syntax highlighting. You can enable syntax highlighting by typing:
:syntax on
This should set up syntax highlighting for your file based on the file extension that is detected. If you would like to change the language that is being highlighted, you can do so by setting the language with:
:set filetype=[language]
If you would like to use a system utility to modify some lines in your file, you can call it by using the ! command in normal mode.
This command accepts a motion and then sends it to the command that follows.
![motion] filter
For example, to sort the lines from the current position to the end of the file, you can type:
!G sort
Sort is a Linux command that sorts the input, alphabetically by default.
If we want to insert the output of a command into the file, navigate to a blank line where you want the output. Type:
!!command
This will place the output of the specified command into the document.
If we want to see the results of a command, but do not wish to insert it into the document, we can also use the command mode (:) version, which would be:
:!command
This will show you the results of the command, but will return you to your unaltered document when finished.
Reducing Repetition
Often in editing or creating any kind of file, you will find yourself repeating many of the same or similar operations. Luckily, vim provides some ways to save groups of commands into macros.
To begin recording a macro, you can type q followed by a letter to reference the macro.
qa # will save macro "a"
Any commands you type will now be recorded as part of the macro. To end the macro, you can type q again.
So if we type:
qa0c3wDELETED<esc>q
This would start a macro (saved as "a"), go to the start of the line, and replace the next three words with the word "DELETED". It then exits insert mode and ends the macro.
To play this macro back, starting at the current cursor position, use the @ character followed by the macro reference:
@a
This will replay the macro commands starting at the current position.
If we wish to create a macro that ends in insert mode, we have to end the macro in a different way (typing "q" will just insert a q). We can execute a normal mode command in insert mode by preceding it with CTRL-O .
Thus, if we want to change the contents of the first parentheses on this line, you could have a macro that says:
qi0f(lct)<CTRL-O>q
This creates a macro "i". The macro moves to the beginning of the current line. It then finds the opening parenthesis and moves to the right one character (to move inside of the parentheses). It then changes everything until the closing parenthesis. With vim in insert mode awaiting replacement text, we press CTRL-O followed by q to end the macro, leaving us in insert mode ready to replace the text.
Conclusion
You should now have an idea of some more complicated ways that vim can help you. While this might seem like a lot, it is only scratching the surface.
There are plenty of functions that we have not touched, and you don't need to know everything. You will learn what is important based on how you choose to use vim. The more you practice and use it every day, the more natural it will feel, and the more powerful it will become.

On Labor Day, visitors to the Drudge Report, the conservative news aggregator operated by Matt Drudge, were greeted by an above-the-fold story about the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Obama at the G20 Summit in China. Drudge's headline for the story was “Lion And The Pussycat”:
The Drudge headline is part of a larger pattern from the site of consistently promoting Putin and his strongman style of leadership (the “Lion”), which Drudge has often contrasted with President Obama, whom he characterizes as a weaker leader (the “Pussycat”). Drudge has also consistently promoted pro-Russian news and information, repeatedly harping on the idea that American power is weakening and in decline.
Matt Drudge has extolled the virtues of Vladimir Putin for some time. In 2013, Drudge declared that “Putin is the leader of the free world,” adding to a chorus of conservatives backing the Russian leader. Around the same time, Drudge featured Putin at the top of his site as “Putin To The Rescue” (a headline he would re-use two years later) as the leader began discussing a possible military role for Russia in Syria.
Over the past few years, Drudge has used his site to promote a steady stream of stories favorable to Putin, often while denigrating President Obama and the United States.
Drudge's boosterism of Putin has continued even as the FBI and other investigative services have alleged that hackers working at the behest of Russian intelligence have compromised American computer systems, including via an intrusion at the Democratic National Committee.
The U.S. director of national intelligence has also recently testified that an inquiry is currently underway to see whether Russians are attempting to influence the 2016 presidential election.
Drudge Makes A Putin/Trump Connection
Drudge has couched some of his stories about Putin with accompanying articles and headlines comparing his leadership style to that of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
In December, Drudge highlighted a Financial Times piece that compared Putin to Trump using the text, “Russian president offers glimpse of strong leader.” This was paired with an article describing Putin as part of a “strongman revival” showing a “global trend.”
During the Republican primaries, Drudge spotlighted a comment from Putin describing Donald Trump as a “very talented man.”
Drudge Hypes Putin As A Strongman
The Drudge Report has repeatedly highlighted stories focusing on Putin as a strong or tough world leader, often in a military context.
The Drudge Report placed an above-the-fold link to a threat from Putin that he could use nuclear weapons against ISIS.
Putin made it above-the-fold in a link to a Breitbart News article referring to ongoing negotiations over Syrian chemical weapons. The headline was “Hand ‘Em Over,” with a photo of Putin.
Drudge hailed Putin for “flex[ing] muscle” as elections approached in Russia, bundling that link with others offering defenses of Putin against American criticism:
Drudge gave above-fold treatment to a story asking if Russian airstrikes had killed the leader of ISIS (they hadn't) with the headline “Did Putin Kill ISIS Leader?” The report linked did not name Putin or even reference Russian forces and their activities in the Middle East at the time. It appears Drudge invoked Putin's involvement on his own.
As Putin moved to annex Crimea, Drudge put the headline “Putin Promises ‘Aid' For Ukraine” above-the-fold.
As the annexation progressed, Drudge labeled the campaign as “Putin In Control.”
Hailing Putin, Attacking Obama
In addition to articles promoting Putin as a strongman, Drudge has also sought to use those stories as a contrast to President Obama and United States policy.
When Putin wrote a New York Times op-ed questioning the concept of American exceptionalism, it was featured at the top of the Drudge Report.
While linking to a New York Post story claiming that Obama has turned Putin into the most powerful leader in the world, Drudge used the headline “Red Planet: Putin Snubs Obama.”
Drudge promoted a Chinese claim that “Putin Humiliated USA.”
He also highlighted a story about a “Putin cafe” that “has Obama toilet paper.”
Drudge linked to a story purporting to tell “how Putin beat Obama in Syria.” The original headline referred to “monstrous Putin,” but Drudge removed the adjective once he aggregated the story.
After Russia engaged in airstrikes in Syria, Drudge juxtaposed a news link of that action with another story in which Putin called America “weak.”
After the November 2015 terrorist attack in Paris, Drudge led his site with a headline asking if Putin would be the one to “rescue” the world from ISIS
Defending Putin
When Putin has been involved in international controversies, the Drudge Report has been a part of his administration's pushback, often with links to official Russian news outlets, or those with state sponsorship.
The Drudge Report highlighted a story from the state-financed Russian news outlet RT in which Putin claimed that he would neutralize a purported “missile shield threat” coming from America.
When leaked files showing international efforts to move money offshore to avoid taxes referenced Putin, Drudge linked to an official denying Putin's involvement.
Putin Chronicler
Drudge has also used his platform to chronicle Putin's day-to-day activities as leader of Russia.
He made a note of a Putin visit to Iran, which for some reason was featured above-the-fold.
When Putin said he was considering running for a fourth presidential term, Drudge compared him to Stalin, and it was meant in a positive light.
A story from the official Russian news agency Tass speculating that Elton John might meet with Putin while in Russia for a concert received a Drudge link.
Drudge headlined photos of Putin working out “Ripped Putin Hits The Gym.”
When Russian planes bombed targets in Syria, Drudge headlined the story above-the-fold as “Putin Blitz.”
When world leaders attended a meeting of the G20 in Russia, Drudge posted photos of Putin greeting them along with the headline, “World Into The Arms of Putin.” He also wrote that “Obama shows up late -- and alone -- to dinner with Putin.”
A story about the Russian Defense Ministry purchasing dolphins was paired with an article headlined “Fighter Jets Sent To Watch Putin.”
An announcement that a state media agency in Russia was dissolving also made it above-the-fold on Drudge.
Drudge linked to a report from the Russian news agency Tass about a meeting between Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping with a picture captioned “Putin Courts Xi.”
When Putin played in a hockey game, that made the Drudge Report too.
Drudge illustrated an ABC News story on Putin's exercise regimen with a photo of the president.
.
Drudge took note of a Putin encounter with leopard cubs in Sochi, Russia.
After the 2014 Olympics in Russia had concluded, Drudge put “Games Over: Putin Ready to Take Off Gloves?” above-the-fold.
Longtime WorldNutDaily columnist Craige McMillan has penned an open letter to Chief Justice John Roberts calling for him to not swear President Obama in for a second term. The reason? The oft-quoted birther shibboleth that since Obama's father is not a citizen, Obama is not a natural-born citizen.
Now that Mr. Obama has been re-elected and is preparing to serve a second term of office, there can be no doubt regarding his qualifications. This is because by Mr. Obama's own admission, his father was of Kenyan nationality and perhaps holding British citizenship as well. In addition to the nationality of Mr. Obama Sr. listed on Barack Obama's birth certificate, we know that Obama Sr. was not an American citizen because of correspondence surrounding his stay in this country. Because Obama Sr. lacked American citizenship, Barack Obama is not a natural born citizen, as required by our Constitution. He is not natural born, and can never be natural born, because of his father. Therefore, Barack Obama is not qualified to be president and never will be qualified. This would still be true, even if he received every vote cast.
Your own oath of office, sworn before God and the American people, requires you to uphold the Constitution. (If not you, then who?) If you now administer the oath of office for the presidency to a man who by his own admission fails to meet the natural born citizen requirement imposed by that Constitution, you have violated your own oath of office and are rightly subject to impeachment by any House of Representatives, at any time, now or in the future.
In typical WorldNutDaily style, McMillan makes a veiled threat--if Roberts does swear in Obama, he will face calls for his impeachment and removal from office.The notion that both parents must be citizens in order for a president to meet the "natural-born" requirement has been debunked several times over. The Wong Kim Ark case established definitively that under the 14th Amendment, everyone born in this country is automatically a citizen.
For those who don't know, Obama will actually have to take the oath twice this year. Since January 20 is a Sunday, Obama will be sworn in for a second term in private that morning and in public the next morning.
Acquired Tastes In Acquired Tastes, The Takeout explores the food and drinks we can't live without.
My first job was working at a baseball card shop in Ames, Iowa. Every day after middle school, I'd walk three blocks to Mr. Tryon's store on Main Street and do God's work: numerically sort cards and serve as Old Man Tryon's errand boy. Child labor laws being what they were in early 1980s Central Iowa, the job was a cashless gig. I was paid in baseball cards. And more importantly, in loose meat sandwiches.
On truly special days, my boss would walk out from his office at the back of the shop with a crisp five- or 10-dollar bill and ask me to run down the street to the Maid-Rite restaurant. Because he was a benevolent soul, he'd buy me one, too. Thus began my love affair with one of the Midwest's most underrated delicacies.
To be clear, no one considers loose meat sandwiches haute cuisine. Essentially a sloppy joe minus the sloppy joe sauce, the sandwiches consist of small pebbles of lightly seasoned hamburger meat spilling out from a standard white bun. Think of them as an inefficient but delicious method of consuming ground beef. So much of the meat falls out as you lift the sandwich to your mouth that a spoon is required to scoop up the piles left behind. Nothing fancy here. The bun soaks up the grease, making even the bread a bit gloppy. Somehow it works.
Unlike a hamburger patty, loose meat is essentially porous, thereby allowing condiments to burrow into the protein. This gives a depth of flavor that's hard to achieve in a plain old burger. It's a matter of engineering—because there's more surface area coated in seasoning, and more beef gets browned when it contacts the grill top, loose meat sandwiches manage to deliver more beefiness and flavor.
As with anything worth its salt, the loose meat sandwich isn't for everyone. My wife, bless her non-Midwestern heart, doesn't see the point. She's not a fan of the messiness and considers it a downgrade from a hamburger patty. But then, she's from Boston. Boston! They stuff lobster in a roll, so I shouldn't expect such effete palates to embrace the down-home humbleness of a loose meat sandwich.

Legend has it the loose meat sandwich (known in snootier circles as a “tavern sandwich”) was invented in 1924 by a man named Dave Higgin at Ye Olde Tavern in Sioux City, Iowa. Others say it was invented four years earlier by an equally enterprising chef in Montana. But that doesn't fit my narrative, so I'm sticking with the Iowa connection. Either way, the first Maid-Rite was created a short time later, in 1926, by loose meat legend Fred Angell in Muscatine, Iowa, launching the modern-day loose meat empire.
The appeal for Midwesterners was genuine. Unpretentious and affordable, the sandwich became a staple in small towns throughout the region. The restaurants were usually as simple as the sandwich—ma 'n' pa diners with wraparound counters, Naugahyde-covered seats, and often (for both cost and practical reasons) plastic utensils. When Roseanne Barr's character opened a restaurant in the quintessentially Midwestern sitcom Roseanne, the menu was built around the venerable loose meat sandwich.
Though not as plentiful as they were during the halcyon days of the Roseanne revival, loose meat purveyors still dot the Midwestern landscape. At The Barn in Brainerd, Minnesota, you can get a loose meat sandwich for just $3.70. At NuWay in Wichita, Kansas—considered by some to be the mecca of loose meat sandwich chains—a large “crumbly burger” will set you back $3.39. A medium saves you 40 cents. There is no small.

“People just love it,” said Bradley L. Burt, president and CEO of the Des Moines-based Maid-Rite Corporation, which oversees 36 Maid-Rite restaurants across five states. Its unfussy ethos imbues the entire operation: When you call the company's headquarters, Burt himself answers the phone.
At the Iowa State Fair a few years ago, a survey was conducted asking fairgoers to rank their favorite home-grown food. Corn on the cob finished first. The Iowa chop finished second. The Maid-Rite was third, Burt claims. “It has a unique taste,” he said. “It has a nice mouthfeel. It's not hard. When we cook our meat, it's kind of sautéed. You can't get a Maid-Rite anywhere else.”

Every restaurant claims to have its own special recipe, with secret spices that make their sandwiches unique. But don't look for them in, say, California or New York. Why hasn't loose meat expanded to the coasts? “I have no idea,” said Eddie Morin, owner of B&G Tasty Foods in Omaha, which has been slinging loose meat “Bee Gees” since 1953. According to Morin, people often overthink the connection between Midwesterners and loose meat sandwiches. It isn't rocket science, he said. “The only thing I can think of is it's beef-heavy. We have beef. Why not mash it up?”
There are some rules. At B&G, as is the case elsewhere, the standard toppings are mustard, onions, and pickles. “There are a ton of customers who order it with catsup, but we don't recommend it,” Morin said. “I don't dislike catsup. I put it on hot dogs and cheeseburgers. But I don't put [catsup] on a Bee Gee. The people who order them with catsup are generally the people who don't know what's going on.”
Mea culpa: Growing up, I always put catsup on my Maid-Rite. I sold almost all of my baseball cards to help pay for college. I have a few of the best ones left, which I will give to my kids when I'm convinced they're old enough not to ruin them. Also, and more importantly, I'll pass on my love for loose meat sandwiches. It's the greatest love a father can give.
In the summer lethargy, the Italian government is attempting to pass new constitutional amendments that would take power away from Parliament and concentrate it in the executive branch's hands. Public debate has been avoided, despite potentially dramatic consequences.
President Napolitano and PM Letta. Flickr/Enrico Letta. Some rights reserved.
Italy's summer lethargy and the open warfare over Berlusconi's recent conviction are masking the proposal for a radical constitutional change. If passed, it will unleash the country's least attractive instincts and give them a constitutional validity; for unfortunately behind most political initiatives in Italy is the acceptance of weakly checked power and the desire to have someone take charge and solve the country's problems.
At the moment a structural change to both the institutions of the constitution and its intentions is under way. Its implementation would complete the de facto changes which have happened over the last couple of years. All with almost no debate in Italy - and none at all abroad.
Last month, the Five-Star Movement (M5S) brought the issue to the top of their agenda and Il Fatto Quotidiano has launched a petition hoping to reach half a million signatures but for the rest, the heat wave (appropriately named Charon, the ferryman to the Inferno) seems to have stifled any discussion. Of course, there's also the fact that most of these constitunational issues are arcane; none will change the number of jobs available or the price of pasta, hence the general lack of discussion.
The first step is a bill, the DDL 813 passed by the Senate last month, which until an M5S filibuster, was due to go before the Chamber of Deputies before the end of July. It is a constitutional amendment which would make future amendments even easier. All codified constitutions are in some way “entrenched”; they are more difficult to change than normal legislation because constitutions should not be subject to the political fads and fashions of the moment. In Italy, an amendment currently needs to be passed by both houses twice with at least three months between the readings, which is still a very simple and rapid process compared to how constitutions are amended in other countries.
The present bill would change article 138, which regulates constitutional amendments. It would cut the three months to one and set up a bicameral commission which would act in a similar way to a constituent assembly, following a tight schedule. In practice, it is a blueprint for a new constitution.
This is an unusual government bill. It is explicitly part of the government's 18-month reform programme and includes a very tight schedule as part of the constitutional amendment. The bicameral committee set up by the amendment must be formed within fifteen days of the law's passage. If not, the Speakers will appoint members, and the committee must start work within 30 days. This is also very unusual as constitutional amendments are normally excluded from emergency measures; they encourage reflection rather than precipitated action. But not in this case.
Prime Minister Enrico Letta had hoped that the bill would be passed by the Chamber at the end of July - so that the two Chambers could re-pass it in early November and the commission could start its work before the end of that month. This would be rapid for ordinary legislation, for a constitutional amendment it is supersonic. The M5S filbuster has probably delayed the first passage before the Chamber till September.
This first amendment would then allow the substantial reforms to be passed rapidly. There are two elements in the reform proposals: the nature and relationship between the two chambers of Parliament and the nature of the state and government itself.
On the first score, no one would seriously argue in favour of maintaining Italy's perfect bicameralism, where the two chambers have equal power. This flaw and potential wrench in the works has been pointed out since the constitution was passed in 1948, but it was only in February this year that there actually were different majorities in the Chamber and the Senate. The US is used to the concept of gridlock between the two houses, but a presidential system can deal with it – a parliamentary system, which depends on the executive having the confidence of both houses, cannot.
Nor is there much explicit defence of the numbers of parliamentarians: 630 plus 315, more than most comparable systems. There could, of course, well be stalling tactics as some senators at least do not like the idea of reducing their powers while both houses are nervous about reducing their numbers. But the other suggestions are much more controversial.
There seems to be a consensus among government party leaders (Democratic Party (PD), People of Freedom (PdL) and Civic Choice (SC) that the executive should be greatly strengthened - either by introducing a presidential system, or more likely, something similar to the French semi-presidential system. They would at least like to see a directly elected head of state with the implication that the new president would have much greater legitimacy and therefore power.
The vision is still vague but their idea is to confirm President Napolitano's de facto increase in power, to enhance it and enshrine it in the revised constitution.
Strictly speaking, Napolitano's job is mostly symbolic. Yet, for two years now, he has been increasingly active in everyday politics and party issues. Prime Minister Letta now consults with Napolitano on all major issues and plenty of minor ones too. The reforms would only make these changes constitutional.
Three weeks ago, Napolitano admonished parliament not to support a no confidence motion against the minister of the Interior, Angelino Alfano. The previous week, the Supreme Council of Defence, an advisory body chaired by the president, issued a statement saying that Parliament had no veto on defence matters, in particular on the decision to purchase 90 F35s. There was no protest from the legislature on either count.
Parliament has already been seriously weakened by the electoral system which gives party leaders the control over who is elected and who is not. Candidates do not campaign and have no link with any territory. They are beholden either to Berlusconi, Monti or Grillo or to the PD apparatus.
In 1946-7 the Constituent Assembly drew up a document which gave the legislature the most power. Italy had just come out of 20 years of dictatorship and the goal was to curb the executive. Today, neither Berlusconi, nor his successors, nor the PD's aspiring presidents are going to become a new Mussolini. But the damage which Berlusconi has wrought over the last 20 years and Napolitano's inexorable slicing away at the legislature's powers are both cause for concern, a concern which is only shown by a few senior constitutional lawyers. There is no debate.
Without a debate, the only hope to delay this hurried process is the other Italian vice, getting stuck in a bureaucratic swamp, or the most likely option at the moment, that the coalition government falls because of the Berlusconi conviction. But the proposals have been made and could return with the next unholy alliance between centre-left and centre-right. Italy has plenty of problems but they will not be resolved by concentrating power in the hands of a president.
This article is an updated version of a post originally published on 29 July on the author's blog, Italian Politics with Walston.
Way back in 1992, the Marlins were a twinkle in Major League Baseball's eye, and were allowed to make their first amateur selections to start to build their farm system before the major league team debuted in 1993. With their first pick, the Marlins struck gold, essentially snagging a Hall of Famer. And no one noticed.
No one noticed because this one player, Charles Johnson, was not a Hall of Famer. He was only worth about 22 wins over the course of his career above replacement. But what Johnson begot, through the Marlins' maddening refusal to hold on to useful players, was something along the lines of an elite Hall of Fame-level of production.
As we approach July and the trade deadline, the Marlins sit at 30-42, and experimental manager Dan Jennings' .412 winning percentage is even worse than the .421 winning percentage that got Mike Redmond fired. As I write this, they are 8.5 games back in the NL East and 10.5 games back of any kind of Wild Card. In short, it's not happening in South Florida again this year, and eventually that realization will dawn on whoever is responsible for Jeffrey Loria and whichever former stepson he has put in charge of transactions while his general manger relays signals from the dugout. And what is amazing is that, when the Marlins trade Martin Prado (assuming he gets healthy), they will add even more value to their franchise that they will be able to trace back to Johnson.
Johnson was a local kid, something I'm sure the cagey Marlins considered when they selected the 20 year old catcher out of the University of Miami, who had grown up just two hours north of the city, and had backed up Jason Varitek for Team USA in the 1992 Olympics, as the 28th overall pick.
As it turned out, it was a good one. Johnson flew through the minors and caught four games in May for the Marlins, hitting .455/.462/.818 while filling in for Benito Santiago. Johnson was returned to the minors long before the players struck, and finished the season at double-A. Santiago left to sign with the Reds that offseason, and Johnson broke camp as the starting catcher when the delayed season got started in 1995. He got hurt in August, came back for a couple weeks and then was hurt again. He finished the year .251/8.351/.410 with 11 homers, won his first of four consecutive NL Gold Glove awards, and finished 7th in the Rookie of the Year voting. He made the Star team in 1997 and was part of the club's first world championship team, hitting .357/.379/.464 while starting all seven games.
Of course, the next year, Johnson was caught up in the first Marlins fire sale as well. With the Marlins just one game under .500, owner Wayne Huizenga ordered the team gutted. Johnson, Gary Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, Jim Eisenreich, and a prospect went to the Dodgers for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile. It was pretty shameless, especially since neither Piazza nor Zeile lasted the rest of the season in Miami. In fact, Piazza barely lasted a week, getting dealt to the Mets for three players, including useful center fielder Preston Wilson and not useful pitcher Ed Yarnall.
Amusingly, Wilson was traded with the recently reacquired Johnson in the 2002 offseason to the Rockies for Mike Hampton (who was quickly sent to the Braves) and Juan Pierre, who would help Marlins win their second world championship in 2003 and eventually lead to the Marlins acquiring Ricky Nolasco.
More important for our purposes, however, is Yarnall, who was packaged in the 1998-1999 offseason with two other players to bring in Mike Lowell from the Yankees. Lowell would, of course, be a steadfast Marlin for the next seven years, teaming with Pierre on that 2003 World Series winner, and hitting .272/.339/.462, making three all star teams, and winning a gold glove and a silver slugger while manning third base. Lowell, of course, went with Josh Beckett and Guillermo Mota to the Red Sox in 2005 to get them ready for their own 2007 championship, while four players, including Anibal Sanchez and Hanley Ramirez came back to the Marlins.
Sanchez struggled with injuries for much of his Marlins career, but found himself in serious demand at the trade deadline in 2012, when the Tigers acquired him for three players, Bryan Flynn, Rob Brantley, and former top prospect Jacob Turner. Brantley lasted a couple seasons as a backup catcher. Flynn was traded this offseason to the Royals for Aaron Crow. Finally, Turner flopped, but was still sent to the Cubs for minor leaguers Jose Arias and Tyler Bremer, who are still in the Miami system.
Ramirez quickly became the greatest player in Marlins history, winning the NL Rookie of the Year in 2006, and being worth around 23 wins in his first four full seasons. As injuries began to take their toll, Ramirez was traded in 2012 to the club where all former great Marlins eventually go, the Los Angeles Dodgers. One of the players the Marlins got in return, Scott McGough, still toils for the Fish in double-A when he's healthy. The other, Nathan Eovaldi, pitched pretty ok for the team from 2012-2014. This past offseason, as he was set to start earning real money through arbitration, he was sent to the Yankees with Garrett Jones for the aforementioned Martin Prado and for David Phelps.
Phelps has pitched pretty ok in 2015 for the Marlins. He has done good work limiting his walks and homers, while struggling to strike batters out with average stuff. He will still make little enough through arbitration, however, that the Marlins can hold onto him for at least another season before he too gets dealt. Prado, however, should deliver a return that will keep this crazy chain alive. Thanks in many ways to their refusal to hold onto tradable assets, the Marlins have actually gained something like 88 wins thanks to their selection of Charles Johnson 23 seasons ago. And they're still counting.
Listen, I've spent enough time with a pocket protector and graphing calculator to know cool engineering when I see it. So when Ford invited me to Grattan Raceway to check out their 2016 GT350R, I kept my eye out for some engineering goodness. I was impressed.
First let's talk weight, because that's been a... shall we say, controversial issue with the new Mustang. The base GT350R weighs in at 3650 pounds. This car gets no air conditioning, rear seats, or stereo system. Heck, even the exhaust resonators were removed to cut down on heft.
That weight puts it down about 57 pounds from a GT fastback with a manual gearbox. Not massive, but not bad either. Lighter's always better. Here's how they did that, plus more engineering goodness.
Sexy Lightweight Wheels
Advertisement
That carbon fiber wheel you see above weighs under 20 pounds, and provides nearly 15 pounds of weight savings over an equivalent aluminum wheel. Ford had a wheel on display, and it was scary how easily I could lift it. There are tons of benefits to lighter wheels. They have lower moments of inertia, making them easier to accelerate. The 60 pounds of overall vehicle weight savings minimizes centripetal forces on the vehicle and also help with braking and acceleration.
Lighter wheels also help to minimize torques that arise from gyroscopic action, which can make the car difficult to steer. These torques, governed by the law of conservation of momentum, make turning a rotating wheel pretty difficult (try turning a spinning bicycle wheel with your hands). But probably the most important benefit is the drop in unsprung mass, which allows the suspension to better accommodate irregularities in the road and keep the tires planted to the surface.
Slick Air Intake
Advertisement
See that little grille opening to the right of that grille divider? That entire opening is devoted to the air intake duct. By isolating it away from the main radiator grille opening, Ford is preventing against “recirculation,” a phenomenon where hot air leaks around the seals, out through the grille or other holes. This intake's position means it's likely to get nice, cold air.
The air box is well sealed to the hood, and the path from the intake grille opening to the airbox is short and direct. By keeping the ducting length down, less heat is transferred from the hot underhood to the air running through the duct.
This means that “Rise over Ambient,” a term used to describe the difference in ambient air temperature and air temperature that enters the engine, remains low. This is good, because engines like cold air.

Air To Oil Cooler and Transmission Oil Cooler
On either side of the GT350R, there sit two remote-mounted heat exchangers. The car is naturally aspirated, so they're not intercoolers. Perhaps remote mounted auxiliary radiators? Nope, one of them is a transmission oil cooler and one is an air-to-oil oil cooler. These are totally unconventional heat exchangers to find on a street car.
Advertisement
Usually cars have oil to coolant oil coolers and usually manual transmissions are cooled via underbody convection only. To have a dedicated heat exchanger out front for engine oil and manual transmission oil just goes to show that this is a legit track car.
Rear Differential Cooler
Advertisement
And it doesn't stop there. No, the GT350R even comes with a dedicated air to oil differential cooler. Those ducts you see in the belly pan above funnel air into the heat exchanger to keep that 3.73 rear end nice and happy.
Enormous Two Piece Brake Rotors
Advertisement
The GT350R comes with 394mm diameter front brake rotors and 380mm rear brake rotors. Oh, and you've got six piston calipers to go along with those giant front pizzas. Big rotors not only maximize friction between the rotor and the pad, but they also increase the moment arm of the brake force- this essentially gives the brakes a “mechanical advantage.”
The biggest benefit though, is the additional heat capacity of those giant rotors. Keeping brakes cool is crucial if you want to maintain good brake feel and performance lap after lap.
Aerodynamic Goodness

Want downforce? Look no further than the rear wing, which was optimized up to the very last minute in design. Each change to the body or trim can affect the wing's effectiveness, so dialing it in is an always ongoing process. Here's Ford's blurb on the rear wing:
The wing moves the vehicle's center of pressure rearward while improving downforce and lift balance – ideal for high-speed track work.
There's also a hood vent, which removes air after it has picked up heat through the cooling module. The vent also reduces front end lift and likely decreases underhood pressure to provide better radiator airflow.

The GT350R has plenty of underbody belly pans to keep down drag. See those shark gilles on the front fenders? Those are there to vent the pressure from the wheel wells to minimize drag and maximize brake cooling. The wheel arches were designed with “air curtains,” whose job it is to funnel air around the wheel wells to prevent turbulence and lower drag.
All in all, the car has some sweet hardware to go along with the aggressive, handsome good looks. I was able to ride along in the GT350, and I will say: The Shelby's hardware all seemed to work well as a system, as the car was a total riot around the racetrack.
More on that later today. Get excited.
Scientists have discovered that breaking a biological signaling system in an embryo allows them to change the destiny of a cell. The findings could lead to new ways of making replacement organs.
The discovery was made in the laboratory of Joel H. Rothman, a professor in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at UC Santa Barbara. The studies were reported in the interdisciplinary journal Genes and Development, and were carried out by Ph.D student Nareg Djabrayan, in collaboration with Rothman and two other members of the laboratory, Ph.D student Erica Sommermann and postdoctoral fellow Nathaniel Dudley.
"At some point along the way toward becoming part of a complete individual, cells become destined to choose a particular identity and long-term profession," Rothman noted.
"Once a cell chooses who it will be, it locks onto that identity for the remainder of its life."
A cell that is destined to become a heart cell functions exclusively in the heart until it dies, and never chooses later to change jobs by becoming, for example, a brain cell. "If Oz's wizard possessed the powers he claimed, and had a spare brain lying around, he could switch it to a heart as a gift for the Tin Man. And he could reverse the trick for the Scarecrow," Rothman said.
Similarly, the researchers have found a way to unlock cells' destinies and lead them to take on a new profession.
The scientists found that a widely used cell signaling system, known as "Notch" signaling, causes cells to commit to a particular occupation, such as a skin or brain cell. When they blocked the signal by genetic manipulation, the researchers discovered that they could force a cell to change its destiny, such that they instead became cells of the intestine.
"We found that we could break the signal in such a way that cells would follow their usual destinies, but were somehow less committed to doing so: We could convince them to change professions long after they would normally refuse to do so," Rothman said.
The scientists made the discovery by harnessing the genetics of a tiny nematode worm known as C. elegans, a model animal that has become famed in fundamental studies in biomedicine, and has been the subject of six Nobel prizes.
The researchers discovered that shutting off the Notch signal in early embryos made it possible for them to change the destiny of cells much later on, at a stage when they normally could not. "The later cells seemed to remember what had happened to their great-grandparent cells," Rothman said. "Imagine if the experience of your great-grandparents predestined you to become a lawyer, dentist, or coal miner, and you could not choose to change your professional destiny. That is what is happening to cells whose cellular ancestors received the Notch signal."

The discovery could someday help scientists develop new ways to produce tissues and organs in the laboratory that could be used to replace a patient's injured, diseased, or aged organs. By unlocking a cell's normal destiny, it may be possible to change it into an altogether different type of cell that could be used to grow a new organ for a patient –– or perhaps, a Tin Man.

Some brains struck by pathology seem to stave off its effects thanks to a “cognitive reserve”: a superior use of mental resources that may be related to the way we use our brains over a lifetime, for instance through high levels of education or, possibly, learning a second language.
Bilingual people certainly seem to use their brains differently. For example, practice at switching languages has been associated with enhanced mental control. It's even been claimed that being bilingual can stave off dementia by up to four or five years.
If true, this would have serious implications for public policy – learning a second language would be as much a desirable health behaviour as it is an educational or cultural one. But are the brain benefits of bilingualism real? The Journal of Alzheimer's Disease has published a systematic review and meta-analysis to establish the strength of the evidence base.
The University College London research team, led by Naaheed Mukadam, surveyed hundreds of papers published up to November 2016, finding fourteen high-quality studies that measured dementia and/or mild cognitive impairment (a more subtle analogue and frequent precursor of dementia) as well as participants' status as either mono-lingual or bilingual.
Eight of the studies drew their conclusions from patients who had attended clinics complaining of memory problems, and their results were in favour of bilingualism. In one study, the age of diagnosis for amnesic mild cognitive impairment was around four to five years later for bilingual patients compared to monolingual. Another five studies asked when people began noticing their symptoms, and these also found the similar four to five year delay for bilinguals. Two of the eight found no significant effects, but the preponderance of evidence here looks pretty good.
The trouble is, all of these papers were retrospective, and depended on when people decided to show up to a clinic, and/or their accurate dating of when their symptoms began. Complicating matters is the fact that bilingual people from minority ethnic backgrounds are known to seek help later for dementia, on average, probably for social and cultural reasons. Moreover, these studies rarely controlled for education, which tends to be higher for non-minority multi-linguals, and as education itself contributes to cognitive reserve, this may be another confound.
Better controlled studies that identify a sample of people free from dementia and then follow them in the future are easier to interpret. Mukadam's team identified five such studies. These found that five years after recruitment there were no significant differences between bilingual and monolingual participants in terms of whether they had developed any memory problems or neurological diagnoses. A meta-analysis using the raw diagnosis numbers from each study – a total of just over 5,000 participants – confirmed that bilingualism does not stave off dementia.
But a weak evidence base doesn't mean an effect isn't real. Indeed, more recent research from a team of Italian researchers used neuroimaging techniques to make a more systematic case for the benefits of bilingualism, including that it is associated with greater neural connectivity.
This Italian work is too recent to feature in the new review, but it's notable that it escapes some of the methodological problems discussed above. However, when I brought this to Naaheed Makadem (the lead author of the new review), she raised a few considerations: firstly, that the new neuroimaging study investigated people who were generally lifelong bilinguals, living in a bilingual context (the Italian-German borderlands of Italy), which affords more opportunities for lifelong mode-switching than would be found for cases of adult migration or deciding to pick up a new language; secondly, she points to other potential confounding factors, such as employment and social status (i.e. the apparent neural advantages of bilinguals might be related to their being more likely to be in employment and higher social status).
The multi-lingual mind may have important consequences, but it's not clear that recommendations to learn a second language later in life will necessarily produce the protections that have been claimed. Makadem's team conclude their work by suggesting that “public health policy should therefore remove recommendations regarding bilingualism as a strategy to delay dementia and instead concentrate on more generally reducing cognitive inactivity.”

Saw (retrospectively also referred to as Saw 0.5) is an Australian short subject horror film, released in 2003. It was directed by James Wan and written by Wan and Leigh Whannell, the latter also starring in it. It was originally used to pitch their script for a full-length feature film of the same name to various studios and actors. The full-length film was eventually made in 2004. The short film later became a scene in Saw, with Shawnee Smith as Amanda Young wearing the Reverse Bear Trap device instead of David. The original short can be viewed on the second disc of Saw: Uncut Edition. The song "Happiness in Slavery (remix)" by Nine-Inch Nails is featured in the first scene and end credits of the film.
Plot [ edit ]
A young man, David (Whannell), is in an interrogation room talking to an unnamed, unsympathetic police officer (Paul Moder). David is in handcuffs, and he has blood on his face and shirt. He is smoking a cigarette. He tells the officer that after he finished his work as an orderly at the hospital, he was knocked unconscious and taken to a large room.
Inside the room, David was strapped to a chair with a large, rusty metal device locked onto his head. To his left was a small television, which began playing a video showing a frightening puppet that tells him that the device on his head is a "reverse beartrap", which is hooked into his jaws and will pry his face open with great force if he does not unlock it in time. The puppet tells David that the only key to unlock the device is in the stomach of his dead cellmate (Dean Francis).
David is able to break free of his bonds, but by doing so he sets off a timer on the back of the device. Across the room, he finds the body that the puppet mentioned, but also finds that the man is actually alive but under paralysis. David panics and stabs his cellmate before starting to look for the key. He slices into the man's stomach and after finding the key, David unlocks the device and throws it to the ground, just as it snaps open.
David begins screaming and weeping in horror. At the entrance to the room, the puppet from the video appears on a tricycle. He congratulates David on surviving, and tells him that he has proven he is no longer ungrateful for being alive.
The film ends with the police officer asking "Are you grateful, David?" causing the young man to again break down. As the end credits begin to roll, a CGI replica of the bathroom used later in the full Saw film is shown, although with some differences. A small peephole is shown with an eye visible behind it, which was a concept reused in another trap in Saw.

Production and legacy [ edit ]
Prior to 2003, colleagues James Wan and Leigh Whannell had begun writing a script based for a horror film, citing inspiration from their dreams and fears. Upon completing the script, Leigh and James had wanted to select an excerpt from their script, later to be known as Saw, and film it to pitch their film to studios. With the help of Charlie Clouser, who had composed the score for the film, and a few stand-in actors, Leigh and James shot the film with relatively no budget. Leigh had decided to star in the film as well.
During filming, it was said that the trap used on Whannell was revealed to be fully functional and very rusted, making it very dangerous. The version of the trap used in the full film was made safer and had artificial rust. Wan later revealed that the film was shot in just over eight days. Upon completing the film, the pair traveled to Lions Gate studios to screen the film. Lions Gate immediately accepted the deal and got approved for a US$1.2 million budget to make their script into a full feature film. Instead of being paid in advance, Wan and Whannell agreed to take a percentage of the profits from the film's release, which turned out to be much more than initially expected.
This allowed for the creation of Saw, a film that was intended to be a direct-to-DVD release that was later released into theaters worldwide after it received a positive reaction at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. The film retained the scene from the short, which was reshot with different actors. Leigh Whannell would also return to star in the full-length film, and in Saw III.
After the release of the full-length Saw, the film was met with overwhelming success in the box office both domestically and internationally. The film ended up grossing US$55 million in America, and US$48 million in other countries, totaling over US$103 million worldwide. This was over US$100 million profit, over 80 times the production budget.[2] This green-lit the sequel Saw II, and later the rest of the Saw franchise based on the yearly success of the previous installment. Since its inception, Saw has become the highest grossing horror franchise of all time worldwide in unadjusted dollars. In the United States only, Saw is the second highest grossing horror franchise, behind only the Friday the 13th films by a margin of US$10 million.[3]

On a Saturday night in the winter of 2012, W.P., a freshman at Princeton, was alone in his dorm room and couldn't stop crying. He'd just had a conversation with his girlfriend that made him feel distant from her, and from everyone. He called his mom and a few friends, but no one could talk. He picked up an old bottle of Trazodone, an antidepressant that he'd stopped taking a few weeks earlier, and swallowed twenty pills. Then he considered how upset his mother would be if he died. “I thought about how important I am to her,” he said. “It would be really unfair for me to do that to her. It's not the way I'd want her to be treated.”
He tried to vomit, and when that failed he walked to the student health center and reported that he'd tried to commit suicide. Drowsy but communicative, he was transported by ambulance to the University Medical Center of Princeton, where he was closely monitored. By the next morning, he was feeling physically fine. His parents drove three hours to visit him at the hospital, and his friends brought him his homework. “The patient reports that he feels better today,” a psychiatrist wrote. “He felt that he knows now that he is supported and people do care.” W.P. told the psychiatrist that he had acted impulsively. “I could be so petty,” he said. “It was a very selfish thing to do.”
After three days in the hospital, W.P. was preparing to leave when his mother was informed, through a phone call from Princeton's director of student life, that W.P. was no longer allowed to attend classes or return to his dorm. At a meeting the next day, two university administrators, who had reviewed some of W.P.'s medical records, expressed concern about the fact that he had checked himself out of the hospital a day early, against the hospital's recommendation. They noted that this was his third suicide attempt in three years. (The previous two times he had been home with his parents, and, he said, the suicide attempts were pleas for attention.) The administrators urged him to voluntarily withdraw from the university for a year, so that he could get intensive psychiatric treatment. They explained that in cases where students pose a threat to themselves this was “always the outcome.” They told him that if he didn't take a leave of absence he would be involuntarily withdrawn, which would be reflected on his transcript. They also instructed him that he was not permitted on campus.
W.P's mother, accompanied by two security guards, collected his clothes and books from his dorm room, and he and his mother moved to a hotel. W.P. enrolled in a partial-hospitalization program near campus, where he attended group therapy sessions while keeping up with his coursework. Over the course of the next three weeks, he proposed a number of accommodations to alleviate the university's concerns about his mental state—he offered to live off campus or take a reduced course load—but he was told that these conditions would “fundamentally alter the nature of a Princeton education.” W.P. began to feel as if the university was less concerned with protecting his health than with avoiding liability and preserving its own reputation. He wondered if the administrators were afraid that he would “blight the landscape and take away from the purity of the institution—the Orange Bubble, as we call it, where everyone is supposed to be happy and high-functioning,” he said.
In balancing the rights of students against the need for safety and order, many universities require suicidal students to leave campus. At Yale, Brown, George Washington University, Hunter College, Northwestern, and several other schools, students have protested these policies, by initiating litigation, submitting complaints to the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, or writing columns in campus newspapers. W.P. retained a lawyer, Julia Graff, an attorney at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, who said that she gets calls every month from students who were asked to withdraw after their universities became aware of their mental disorders. “Universities don't seem to understand that mental-health disabilities are chronic illnesses, and it is not uncommon to have to be briefly hospitalized now and again,” she told me. “It doesn't mean that you are not competent to be a student.”
Two weeks after being banned from his classes, W.P. appealed Princeton's decision. In a long letter, he noted that the university prides itself on its diverse student body—he pointed out that his residential college called itself “a place where individuals could be accepted for who they are”—and students with mental disabilities, he wrote, contributed to that diversity. “Who I am is someone who is struggling with depression, someone who is striving to achieve a well-rounded, useful education, someone trying to develop his values and find a place in the world,” he wrote.
W.P.'s private psychiatrist, to whom he'd been referred by Princeton's health center, submitted a letter that stated that W.P. did not pose a threat to himself. “An important aspect of W.P.'s recovery is a sense of purpose,” the psychiatrist wrote. “Requiring a leave of absence and excluding him from the university community at this time could be detrimental to his health and well-being.”
The appeal was denied. On March 26th, the vice-president of campus life told W.P. in a letter that his enrollment would pose an “unacceptably high risk of substantial harm to your health and safety that cannot be mitigated by any reasonable modifications.” W.P. withdrew from school and left New Jersey. Later, he filed a federal lawsuit accusing Princeton of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Fair Housing Act Amendments. The lawsuit asserts, among other things, that the university refused to offer him accommodations for his disability and that it imposed conditions on him that were “more onerous and intrusive” than those placed on students with physical illnesses.
Last month, Princeton filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which it called “patently meritless.” According to the motion, “the core of this dispute can be simply stated: Princeton University refused to gamble with W.P.'s life.” The university is also opposing W.P.'s use of a pseudonym in the lawsuit. In a memorandum filed three weeks ago, the university argued that W.P. wants to “hurl his accusations from beneath a cloak of anonymity.”
During his year off, W.P. slept on a friend's couch near his home town. He got a retail job and an internship working for a politician, and took classes at a nearby university. According to his lawsuit, he “experienced ongoing stress and embarrassment occasioned by his presence at home, rather than at school, and the questions that this situation generated on an almost daily basis.… His self-esteem had been demolished.” He adhered closely to the conditions that Princeton required for reënrollment: weekly therapy sessions and compliance with prescribed medications. In November of 2013, Princeton sent W.P.'s psychiatrist a questionnaire that asked whether W.P. had any motivational problems, interpersonal difficulties, obsessions, or compulsions; inquired about his medication compliance; and requested an estimation of his risk of relapse. The psychiatrist responded that W.P.'s mood had stabilized, and that he was “eager to do well in school and put the past behind him.”
When W.P. finally returned to campus, at the beginning of the 2013 spring semester, he had a smaller circle of friends than he'd imagined, and fewer people remembered him than he'd hoped. Among administrators, he felt “a little hunted,” but he said that his professors and other students were welcoming; they didn't press him for details about why he'd been absent for a year. Now he has trouble even locating the reasons that he attempted suicide, an event he refers to as “the incident” or “the thing.” He recalls that he was upset about an eighty-dollar charge for a key he'd forgotten to return, but he doesn't remember exactly why this setback led him to the conclusion that there was no more reason to live. His year away was a “growing experience, but not because Princeton made it so,” he said. “I had no perspective on how time does move on.”
Microsoft, Google and Netflix want to add DRM-hooks to W3C HTML5 standard
A proposed anti-copying extension for the W3C's standard for HTML5 has been submitted by representatives of Google, Microsoft and Netflix. The authors take pains to note that this isn't "DRM" -- because it doesn't attempt to hide keys and other secrets from the user -- but in a mailing list post, they later admitted that this could be "addressed" by running the browser inside a proprietary hardware system that hid everything from the user.
Other WC3 members -- including another prominent Googler, Ian Hickson -- have called for the withdrawal of the proposal. Hickson called it "unethical." I agree, and would add "disingenuous," too, since the proposal disclaims DRM while clearly being intended to form a critical part of a DRM system.
In an era where browsers are increasingly the system of choice for compromising users' security and privacy, it is nothing short of madness to contemplate adding extensions to HTML standards that contemplate designing devices and software to deliberately hide their workings from users, and to prevent users from seeing what they're doing and changing that behavior if it isn't in their interests.
Writing on Ars Technica, Ryan Paul gives a good blow-by-blow look at the way that this extension is being treated in the W3C:
Mozilla's Robert O'Callahan warned that the pressure to provide DRM in browsers might lead to a situation where major browser vendors and content providers attempt to push forward a suboptimal solution without considering the implications for other major stakeholders. Some of the discussion surrounding the Encrypted Media proposal seem to validate his concerns. Mozilla's Chris Pearce commented on the issue in a message on the W3C HTML mailing list and asked for additional details to shed light on whether the intended content protection scheme could be supported in an open source application. "Can you highlight how robust content protection can be implemented in an open source webrowser?" he asked. "How do you guard against an open source web browser simply being patched to write the frames/samples to disk to enable (presumably illegal) redistribution of the protected content?" Netflix's Mark Watson responded to the message and acknowledged that strong copy protection can't be implemented in an open source Web browser. He deflected the issue by saying that copy protection mechanisms can be implemented in hardware, and that such hardware can be used by open source browsers.

A student club from the University of Washington has not only used 3D printing to build a boat – it's taken the boat to second place in the university's annual Milk Carton Derby at Seattle's Green Lake.
Even better than that: the 3D printer had to be set up to use HDPE – milk carton plastic – to print the boat, a material which mechanical engineering professor Mark Ganter says is “horrible … it shrinks, it curls, it doesn't want to stick to itself”.
The craft was classified as an unofficial entry in the adult open category, where it finished second.

According to this outline at the University of Washington, the task included hacking a large plasma cutter to take a home-made extruder, and worked out how to deal with 2 percent shrinkage of the roughly 250 milk jugs used to produce a 40-pound (18 kg) boat that can carry a 150-pound (68 kg) person.
The “hacked” plasma cutter became a rig that carried the print head around the fabrication area to deposit the HDPE (picture) that created the boat.

Froylán Martínez's bare feet pounded the concrete court without a sound as he steamed past his opponents, but the spectacular show of speed ended with a disappointing shot at the hoop high above his head. Undeterred, the diminutive 10-year-old – a rising star of Mexican indigenous basketball spun to pursue the ball, and keep chasing his dream.
"I want to play in the NBA," Froylán said after the game, which launched trials for an internationally successful team drawn from the isolated Triqui indigenous people in southern Mexico. "I'm fast but I need to work on my shots."
When a former professional basketball player set out to find fresh talent here four years ago, the Triqui region was primarily known for its inter-clan feuds, political violence and underage brides. Now the Mexican Academy of Indigenous Basketball, and its remarkable team, have become a symbol of hope forged in adversity.
"This is about noticing the talent of indigenous people who have been forgotten by their own country," said Sergio Zúñiga, who now hopes to replicate the experiment in indigenous communities across the country. "If we could build all this out of nothing, the future of Mexico can change too."
Zúñiga first presented his plan to the leaders of the fiercely independent Triqui people, one of Mexico's smaller indigenous groups with a population of around 24,000, concentrated in Oaxaca state. In this harsh region, basketball has long been the only sport practiced with any regularity, because there is not enough flat land to play football.
But Zúñiga's proposal was initially met with suspicion. It didn't help that the coach made his pitch a week after two human rights activists were killed while investigating the earlier deaths of two community radio announcers.
"They thought I was a spy, they thought I wanted to steal the kids and sell them," Zúñiga said. "It was very complicated at first, but little by little the impact became clear."
With a seriousness and persistence rarely seen in Mexican sporting projects, Zúñiga slowly put together the team. Initially they played without shoes, because their parents could not afford them. But what they lacked in footwear and stature, they made up for in speed, resilience and determination, and soon their performances in Mexican tournaments were grabbing the attention of the basketball cognoscente.
This brought in a trickle of donations, which last year allowed Zúñiga to move the 25-member A-team seven hours drive away to a communal house just outside the state capital, so they train after school and at the weekend.
Then, in October, the team won a tournament in Argentina – just after Mexico's footballing elite had become a national embarrassment as it struggled to secure a place in the World Cup.

Largely unknown before they left the country, the Triquis returned home to find they had been catapulted into celebrity. Now they play on a shiny new court built with money from the office of President Enrique Peña Nieto, who jumped at the chance of association with an inspirational good news story far from the drug war violence that tends to dominate news from Mexico.
However, despite its focus on sport the project offers an implicit criticism of Mexico's abandonment of its indigenous population: according to the latest official figures (from 2012), around 80% of indigenous Mexicans live in poverty, compared to a national figure of 46%, and 27% are illiterate– a proportion five times greater than for the general population.
In this part of the state of Oaxaca most families live in one room adobe houses, signs of malnutrition are obvious, and mobile phone reception is a rarity,
Children who join the Triqui team are offered educational opportunities they would otherwise never have, and are encouraged to contribute to the development of their communities if they make it through university. "The basketball is the bait," Zúñiga said.
Team members must keep up their grades, speak Triqui at home, and follow strict discipline that includes penalties of 300 push-ups for displays of aggression on or off the court.
Meanwhile, the stories they tell of visits to Disney World and travelling on planes can seem even more effective propaganda for the project than the trophies they have brought home to a region with an established tradition of migration to the US.
"Maybe one day my son will go to the United States with a passport," mused Alejandro de Jesus, who has made the dangerous journey across the border several times, guided by people smugglers. His nine-year old son now plays for the team. "I want him to have a different life from me."
Local coaches trained by Zúñiga are also pushing to increase their recruitment of girls who, among the Triqui, are regularly forced into marriage, motherhood and domestic servitude from the age of 13.
At the Olympic-style parade of local communities before the recent trials, a group of girls marched behind the banner of El Rastrojo. Aged between 10 and 13, the girls said their mothers had reluctantly given their blessing – along with warnings that too much physical exertion would leave them barren. The warnings only fuelled their enthusiasm.
"We don't want children, they get in the way and you have to look after them," Esperanza said to the general agreement from her friends. As she waited to show off her skills on the mountain-edge court that doubles up as the primary school playground, the 10-year-old said: "I want to travel too. I want to see other places."
After three days of trials, 100 children were selected; later they will be whittled down to 25 reinforcements for the A-team in the city. Now the team is nationally known, the pressure is on to maintain their winning streak.
Meanwhile, a handful of existing members are already being groomed for scholarships abroad. These include Quirino Merino, who played the exhibition game in El Rastrojo in trainers – a sign that the process of "profesionalisation" has already begun.
"I like playing without shoes better," the 10-year-old said. "Shoes feel heavy, they slow you down and they give you blisters, but I'm getting used to them now."

Shovel Knight is joining Nintendo's lineup of collectible NFC figurines, according to UK retailer GAME.
In a post on Twitter, which has since been removed, the retailer confirms prior reports suggesting a Shovel Knight amiibo is in the works. It's worth noting GAME's image of the figure is different than the the fan mockup/Spanish retailer version that surfaced last week.
According to the announcement, the figure will work across multiple games, including future Nintendo products from developer Yacht Club Games.
Additionally, the announcement reveals the amiibo is slated for release on November 27, and will be available for pre-order starting tomorrow.

Back in June, Yacht Club Games announced a retail version of Shovel Knight, which will be coming to North America on October 13 and Europe on October 16. The disc-based version will cost $20 and be available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC (in Europe only), Wii U, and 3DS.

I'm so tired of the “why would anyone choose to be gay when it makes their lives so much harder” argument.
It's not that I don't think that line of thinking hasn't done the LGBTQ community good, because I think it has definitely contributed to positive changes in both the opinions of individuals and the rhetoric of social, political, and ideological discussion. I know people myself who were once quite convinced that “alternative” sexualities were a choice, and whose opinions have since been changed at least partially in response to this argument. And when you look at it in strictly logical terms, it makes sense. Why would anyone shopping around for characteristics that they think might make them trendier or more popular or interesting pick homosexuality?
Imagine you walk into a clothing store to try on a pair of pants. And when you walk out of the dressing room to ask the attendant how they look, a lot of people are staring. About half the store gives you dirty looks, at least two people claim those pants are the work of the devil, a kindly looking old woman tells you the pants are fine but you really shouldn't go parading them around in public, some guy spits out an incredibly offensive word for pants-wearing people as he pulls his girlfriend out the door, and of the people who don't seem to have a problem with it, at least a few are way too into these pants and won't stop making comments about them and how brave and interesting and wonderful you are to be wearing these pants and how they have wanted a friend who wears pants like these for like, their entire lives. It's not a super great experience. Frankly, these pants make you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, or exasperated depending on who's around. And then you choose to take these pants home and wear them every day for the rest of your life.
So that's a pretty drawn-out and questionable analogy, but you get the idea. The “no one would choose this” argument does make sense on some level.
But of course I would never bother creating such a lengthy, possibly inapplicable analogy if I weren't eventually going to contradict the entire thing and come to (what I hope to be) a thought-provoking point. Starting with this:
Isn't there something deeply troubling and truly heartbreaking about turning to your brother, aunt, friend, coworker, daughter, teacher, son, and asking them: “Why on earth would anyone choose to be like you?”
What's so terrible about me? I'm a good friend and an honest person. I think I am reasonably good looking and an excellent listener. I bake one hell of a peach strawberry cobbler! What exactly is it about me that is so detestable that you would ask that?
Now, I certainly don't think anyone is trying to be offensive when they ask this. In fact, I'm fairly sure that they are trying to support me. But you know what they say. The road to homophobia is paved with good intentions.*
Yes, my sexuality has made my life more difficult in many ways. Hiding who you are from people you love for fear they might reject you is awful, and rejecting yourself for the majority of your life is even worse. For me, there was nothing more nerve racking than coming out to my parents. Nothing more uncomfortable than evading questions about girlfriends, and nothing more terrifying than a group of men screaming violent slurs from passing car windows. I could still be fired in 29 American states for my sexuality. LGBTQ young people are more likely to suffer from depression and homelessness, and up to four times as likely to attempt suicide as our heterosexual peers.
That's tough stuff. You might wonder who would ever choose that. But you know who else has life harder than others? Women. 1 in 6 American women will experience rape in her lifetime. Who else? People of color. In 2006, 1 in 14 black men were imprisoned, as opposed to 1 in 106 white men. Those statistics sound difficult. But when was the last time you went up to an African American and asked, “Now why would anyone choose to be black?”
You wouldn't do that because it's offensive and ignorant. It's assuming that because an integral part of someone's identity makes their life more difficult, no one would ever want to share that with them. It implies that there is something wrong with the way they are. No person of color chose their ancestry. No woman chose her chromosomes. And just because this part of them makes certain aspects of their life more difficult does not mean they wish they were any other way. It does not mean that they are not proud of who they are.
In my female friends, there is a righteous anger for the struggle of women that I will never be able to fully tap in to. That nod between two black strangers at a predominantly white party is heavy with historical implications that I could never wholly appreciate. There is a strength and a unity in all marginalized groups that those in the powerful majority—no matter how much more likely to get high-paying jobs or be taken seriously in our society—will never be able to experience. And that push to thrive in adversity makes them stronger.
Race, gender, and sexuality are not a pair of pants that we can change at will. We are who we are and maybe that means life is harder. But I know that my experiences as a gay man have strengthened me in unique ways, and I am better able to empathize with other minority movements spurred by strong individuals tired of their weak position in this world. The constant fight for equality is a fight I am glad to be a part of, and as a white (well, sort of white), middle-class male I don't think I would have ever known what that was like if I were not part of a discriminated-against group.
I used to wish I were a woman-loving, lady-charming heterosexual. I used to wish I was someone other than who I am. And even after I learned to love myself, I used to calmly explain to others, “Why would I have chosen this? Who would choose something that makes their life so much more difficult?” But I have since realized that there is nothing wrong with being thankful for the hand you were dealt, even if that means the rules aren't in your favor. And I'm glad that who I am gives me the opportunity to push back when I am pushed down.
I didn't choose to be gay. But if I could have, I would have.

Chong, a prominent member of an all-party, non-partisan "climate caucus," rose in the House Monday to respond to the fifth assessment report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report concludes that, if left unchecked, climate change "will increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems."
Without "substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions," the report warns the planet could be at risk of flooding, food shortages, extreme weather, and the mass extinction of animals and plants.
"This most recent report concludes that the warming of the planet due to emissions is 'clear' and 'unequivocal,'" Chong said. "The report also concludes that without urgent action to reduce emissions, by the end of this century there is a high risk of severe, widespread, and irreversible damage due to extreme heat waves, more intense weather events, mass extinctions, coastal flooding, and crop failures."
Chong said scientists have done their work, now politicians must do theirs.
"As a Conservative, I believe that we have a moral obligation to conserve our environment, so I call upon this government to meet its commitment to reduce emissions and I call on all governments meeting next month in Lima, Peru, and next year in Paris, France, to work together toward a new global treaty to reduce emissions," he said.
Green Party Leader Elizabeth May took to Twitter to laud Chong's speech.
Wow! Strong call for climate action from @MichaelChongMP in House today. Cites #IPCC and calls on Harper to act. #cdnpoli #climate #GPC — Elizabeth May MP (@ElizabethMay) November 3, 2014
In an address to the House of Commons just hours earlier, French President Francois Hollande also referenced the UN report and warned a "lack of action will lead to a disaster."
Hollande said he hoped that as Canada continues to develop its energy sector in the western provinces that it "will be fully committed in this fight against global warming."
At a joint press conference with Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Hollande urged Canada to play an active role in international climate change meetings — like the one to be held in Lima, Peru next month — in advance of a summit he will host in Paris in December 2015.
Under the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, which the Harper government signed in lieu of participating in the Kyoto Protocol, Canada committed to cut greenhouse gas emissions 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. However, the environment commissioner announced last month Canada is all but certain to miss that target.
In question period on Monday, May said Hollande received a standing ovation in the House when he referenced a European commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030.
"We stood as one and applauded," she said. "Is the government, which so far in question period has offered the usual nonsense about how we are on track, going to accept the challenge?"
Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canada emits less than two per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and the federal government has taken action on climate change while protecting the economy.
"Everyone has to do their fair share and we are seeking an agreement in Paris that would include all emitters and all economies," Aglukkaq said.

The Delhi state law minister, , it turns out lied about his qualifications. Two universities, one in Bihar and one in Uttar Pradesh have attested in Delhi High Court that they have not awarded him the degrees he claims to have from them. Not surprisingly the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party want him kicked out. Tomar is not the first politician to lie about his degrees. But in the cut and thrust of politics in India, cultivated amnesia is the chief qualification.
Sonia Gandhi's qualifications were at issue in the early 2000s, because her election affidavit had claimed that the language school she attended in the town of Cambridge was part of the University of Cambridge. It was not. Subramanian Swamy pursued this case to the Supreme Court, in the expectation that it would lead to her election being overturned, but it was dropped for being a “stale issue”.
The BJP's Human Resources Development Minister minister, Smriti Z Irani twice lied about her qualifications in election affidavits. Questioned about these claims on television she lied again: “In that kitty where people call me anpadh, I do have a degree from Yale as well… which I can bring out and show how Yale celebrated my leadership capacity.' A Metropolitan Magistrates court in Delhi is set to hear a complaint against her on Thursday.
No bar to entry
The Indian parliament has no educational qualification requirement for entry. Winning a free and fair election is all that is required to enter parliament. The Election Commission, however, can scrap an election if a candidate is found to have filed a false affidavit. However, the commission has no mechanism to check the veracity of affidavits and recently, inundated with complaints, has told complainants to go to court directly.
The need to invent or inflate educational qualifications, for a job that does not require any, reflects an anxiety about capabilities. Gandhi's many detractors asked what her qualifications were to lead a political party apart from being the foreign widow of former prime minister. One might conjecture that claiming a connection to one of the world's top universities was a response to this. But it was a lie and a lie that revealed capability anxiety. Irani's lie it would appear may stem from the same cause. For despite her success as a TV actor and the fact that she entered politics out of choice and made a mark in her party prior to her election, she felt the lack of formal higher education so keenly that she repeatedly lied about it.
Stark paradoxes
Irani's and Tomar's particular difficulty is that they each hold a cabinet portfolio that draws attention to their lies. Tomar was made Delhi's law minister in the new Aam Admi Party government. He claimed to be a qualified lawyer. In the shallow pool of talent in the AAP his familiarity with the law may have had something to do with his getting the job. But, in truth, he appears to have little regard for the law and could be before the courts for misrepresentation or fraud.
Irani, charged with responsibility for the country's education, has shown a callous disregard for what a formal education entails. By claiming to have earned a Yale University degree in six days, in mitigation of her earlier lies about her qualifications, Irani seemed to suggest that everyone who spends anything longer than that at university is a fiendishly stupid time-waster. It is not for her lack of formal qualifications but because of her persistent lies and supporting bluster that questions continue to be raised about her abilities.
Tomar's and Irani's lies will also eventually be declared a “stale issue”. Just as opposition protests about Irani's lies died down, so the demands for Tomar's head will also end. The media too will move. For, like politicians, on matters of political morality and people in high office, we are all cultivated amnesiacs.
Jeremy Roenick was on WIP on Monday, and he told the story of when Craig Berube punched him in the face in the Flyers locker room. It all started at some point between 1990 and 1993, when Chief was a tough guy with the Flyers and Roenick was a young star with the Blackhawks, and it ended a decade later when both were in Philadelphia.
Here's the story, as told by Roenick:
***
Back when I played for the Hawks, I ran Ron Hextall in the crease and Holmgren wasn't very happy with me. Sent Berube out to teach me a lesson.
So he chased me around for a period and he finally caught me in the third period and he challenged me to a fight, kind of grabbed me.
When a superstar gets grabbed back then, everybody jumps in so it became a five-on-five melee. The referee grabs Craig's arms and kind of has him in an arm lock but my right arm is totally free. So I had this choice to make. Do I hit him -- you know, defenseless guy -- or do I not?
Well, being a young guy and this guys much bigger than me, I chose to slug him, and I spin him so hard.
For two or three years, every time we played the Flyers, every time I would jump on the ice, Craig would stand up on the bench and start yelling at one of his players to get off the ice because he wanted to get on the ice to chase me around. He would jump on the ice and chase me around and I would skate to the bench, and he would skate right to the bench and say "JR, I'm gonna f'n catch you, I'm gonna beat the tar out of you, I'm gonna get you one of these days." He did it for like two or three years.
So fast forward to when I'm in Philly and they hire Chief to a minor league contract where he's gonna be player/coach. And the Phantoms locker room and the Flyers locker room, they're connected together. Chief obviously feels very comfortable because he's been part of the organization for a long time.
So he comes into the Flyers locker room where I'm getting ready and was just hangin out in the locker room and I go "Hey, Chief, what's goin' on?" and he goes "Hey JR, what's goin on-- BOOM." Just slugs me. Just cracks me. And I kinda went down on one knee and I get up and he goes "I told ya I'd get ya."
And believe it or not, we played golf later that day. With me, Boosh, Tocc and Chief.

In his bizarre quest to undo everything associated with his predecessor, Barack Obama, United States President Donald Trump has now ‘decertified' the nuclear agreement with Iran. He claims that Iran is not in compliance with the terms of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed in 2015). This belief is not supported by the United Nations, the European Union, France, Germany, Britain, China or Russia, all of which are party to the agreement. Perhaps most incredible is that U.S. government officials believe that Iran is in compliance, and have tried in vain to persuade Trump to certify it, as he has twice since assuming the office of president. But no, he has ‘decertified', much to the dismay of the international community, and now the entire situation goes to an unwilling and incompetent Congress, to decide what to do. If Congress decides to re-impose sanctions while Iran is in compliance, then the U.S. will be the party to violate the agreement, not Iran.
The message this sends to the international community is clear: the U.S. cannot be trusted to keep its word. This, of course, is nothing new; the U.S. routinely declares its non-involvement in foreign governments as it works covertly to destabilize them (see Syria and Venezuela today; the historical list is too long to include herein). But violating the terms of the JCPOA is a more blatant example, which shows the lengths to which U.S. hypocrisy and lack of integrity extend.
But Trump is not wholly without support in this area. None other than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposed the agreement from the start, and who has been saying for decades that Iran is ‘months' away from having nuclear weapons, weighed in on the U.S. president's decision to decertify. Incredibly, he said this: “Because remember we cannot allow Iran, the world's foremost terrorist regime, that hangs gays, kills protesters, jails journalists, and foments aggression throughout the region and the world. We cannot allow this rogue regime 30 times the size of North Korea's economy to have a nuclear arsenal. It's a very brave decision, and I think it's the right decision for the world”.
The hypocrisy within these few words is beyond astounding.
We will look at some of the most appalling components of this statement.
1. “Iran, the world's foremost terrorist regime”. It is no wonder that the U.S. and Israel are so closely aligned; their leaders are always talking about their ‘shared values', of which there are many: violence, contempt for international law; quest for power; repression of human rights, etc.
The U.S. is currently bombing at least seven countries, mostly at the behest of Israel. It not only supports the barbaric Israeli occupation of Palestine, it actually finances it, allowing Israel to arrest, detain, torture and kill innocent Palestinian men, women and children, with nearly complete impunity.
The U.S. has been at war for 220 of its bloody 241-year existence; Iran has not invaded another nation since 1798.
The U.S., until very recently, supported anti-government rebels in Syria, and is deeply involved in the civil unrest in Venezuela. It arms and trains terrorists around the world, and operates one of the world's most notorious torture chambers at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Additionally, it kidnaps people, including U.S. citizens, and sends them to so-called ‘rendition' sites around the world, where they are tortured.
Israel has been at war since its criminal inception in 1947-1948, during which time it has killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians. It disdains international law; the United Nations has criticized Israel for violations of international law more than it has for all other nations combined.
Israeli settlers, living illegally on Palestinian land, routinely enter the homes of Palestinians and evict them, taking over the homes themselves. The government destroys Palestinian homes to make room for more housing that is only for Israelis: Arabs are not eligible to live in them.
For Israel to accuse the peaceful nation of Iran of being “the world's foremost terrorist regime” is the height of hypocrisy, and an insult to every thinking person on the planet. That designation belongs to the United States, with Israel in second place.
2. Iran, Netanyahu says, “kills protesters” and “jails journalists”. In the West Bank, it is not infrequent for IDF (Israeli Defense Forces; read: terrorists) soldiers to kill peaceful, unarmed protesters opposing the criminal, brutal and illegal occupation of Palestine. During Israel's periodic carpet-bombing of the Gaza Strip, press vehicles and offices are targeted, along with churches, mosques, residential centers and United Nations refugee centers.
3. Iran, according to Netanyahu, “foments aggression throughout the region and the world”. There is no question that Iran has assisted the democratically-elected government of Syria in its struggle against rebel groups trained and armed by the United States and Britain, and which have the full support of Israel. This is not aggression. Iran is allied with Syria, so providing that assistance is no different than what any nation would do when one of its allies is threatened. Supporting such ‘rebel' groups, as Israel does, is ‘fomenting aggression'.
Unlike Israel, Iran does not steal land belonging to another country. It does not encourage the U.S., the most powerful country on the planet, to bomb its ‘enemies' which in no way threaten its security. And unlike the United States, Israel's financier, Iran does not covertly destabilize foreign governments.
What Iran does that Israel finds so objectionable is to have increasing influence in the Middle East, a region that Netanyahu wants for himself alone. And as long as Israeli lobbies in the U.S. continue to fund U.S. elected officials, the U.S. will continue to dance to Netanyahu's discordant tune.
4. “We cannot allow this rogue regime 30 times the size of North Korea's economy to have a nuclear arsenal.” Yet, for some reason, the rogue regime of Israel is allowed to have a nuclear arsenal. Iran's leaders have repeatedly stated that they have no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons; they point to the fact that Iran, unlike Israel, is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Those leaders have stated that, even if the U.S. withdraws from the JCPOA, that nation will not develop nuclear weapons, because it made that commitment when signing the NPT.
5. “It's a very brave decision, and I think it's the right decision for the world”. The Prime Minister seems to be standing almost alone with this thought; only Israel and Saudi Arabia have endorsed Trump's illogical and dangerous move.
Trump, along with the clown-like Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, proclaims that Iran has violated the ‘spirit' of the law. He points to what he perceives are Iran's other nefarious activities, such as testing long-range missiles. He and Haley seem to overlook the fact that any nation has the right and responsibility to defend its citizens from foreign aggression. And with the U.S. behaving aggressively towards Iran, that country is only fulfilling its responsibility to its people. Doing so, as long as it doesn't involve the development of nuclear weapons, does not violate the terms of the JCPOA, as all other parties to the agreement attest.
What happens next remains to be seen; the best case scenario is that the U.S. Congress is so disorganized and dysfunctional that it will not act on renewing sanctions, and will simply maintain the status quo. Trump can decertify all he wants to; as long as sanctions aren't re-imposed on Iran, in all likelihood the agreement will stand. But should Congress re-impose the sanctions, or if Trump does so by Executive Order, the U.S. will have violated the agreement, rendering it null and void. He will not have made any new friends for the U.S; certainly, Israel's leaders will be pleased, but it's highly likely that the other parties to the agreement will grow closer to Iran, and more distant from the U.S.
It is unlikely that Trump could do more to alienate the U.S., compromise its security, and cause more international hostility to it if he tried.

Glima Glima wrestling Focus Grappling Hardness Full-contact Country of origin Iceland
Glima is a type of folk wrestling practised mainly in Iceland and Scandinavia. Players grip their opponent by the waist and attempt to throw them to the ground using technique rather than force.
History of glima in Iceland [ edit ]
The original Norwegian settlers in Iceland took wrestling with them, and these combat systems have been used by the populace according to the Jónsbók law book from 1325. A modern competition was first held in Iceland in 1888 and has been held almost every year since.[1] In 1905 the belt was introduced so that the wrestlers could have a better grip on each other. Before that they held on each other's trousers. In 1906 the first competition for the Belt of Grettir was held where the winners are named The Glima King. In the 1912 Summer Olympics there was a demonstration of glima.[2]
Variants [ edit ]
Trouser-grip wrestling [ edit ]
The trouser-grip (brókartök) version is by far the most widespread in Iceland and Sweden, this version is Iceland's national sport. It favours technique over strength. The wrestlers wear a special belt around the waist and additional belts on the lower thighs of each leg, which connect to the main belt. A fixed grip is then taken with one hand in the belt and the other in the trousers at thigh height. From this position the glima-wrestler attempts to trip and throw his opponent. In this style of glima, a thrown wrestler may attempt to land on his feet and hands and if he succeeds in doing so he has not lost the fall. The winning condition in this type of glima is to make the opponent touch the ground with an area of the body between the elbow and the knee.
Two glima belts.
There are four points that differentiate it from other forms of wrestling:
The opponents must always stand erect.
The opponents step clockwise around each other (looks similar to a waltz). This is to create opportunities for offence and defence, and to prevent a stalemate.
It is not permitted to fall down on your opponent or to push him down in a forceful manner, as it is not considered sportsman-like.
The opponents are supposed to look across each other's shoulders as much as possible because it is considered proper to wrestle by touch and feel rather than sight.
The core of the system are eight main techniques, which form the basic training for approximately 50 ways to execute a throw or takedown.
Surrounding glima is a code of honour called drengskapur that calls for fairness, respect for and caring about the security of one's training partners.
The word glíma is the Icelandic term for "wrestling" in general. The same word has also a wider meaning of "struggle".
Glima differs from other ethnic grips in three ways:
Upright position – Pursuers shall remain upright. The positioning in many of the ethnic grips sports often resembles a setsquare but in glima that is called ousting and is banned.
– Pursuers shall remain upright. The positioning in many of the ethnic grips sports often resembles a setsquare but in glima that is called ousting and is banned. Stepping – Glima involves steps, which involves contestants stepping forth and back like they are dancing in a clockwise motion. Stígandi is one of the characteristics of glima and designed to avoid a standstill and create opportunities for offence and attack.
– Glima involves steps, which involves contestants stepping forth and back like they are dancing in a clockwise motion. Stígandi is one of the characteristics of glima and designed to avoid a standstill and create opportunities for offence and attack. A ban on knocking over – It is forbidden to push your opponent down with force. That is considered to be unsportsmanlike and in opposition to the nature of glima as a sport for honorable sportsmen and women. Opponents should be conquered by using a well implemented grip that makes the opponent fall gracefully to the ground without any further action.
Backhold wrestling [ edit ]
Backhold wrestling (hryggspenna), is more similar to other styles of wrestling and is considered to be more a test of strength than of technique. In backhold wrestling the opponents take hold of each other's upper body; whoever touches the ground with any part of the body except the feet has lost.
Loose-grip wrestling [ edit ]
In loose-grip wrestling (lausatök), the contestants may use the holds they wish.
It is much more aggressive and differs in many ways from other styles of Icelandic wrestling. Loose-grip wrestling comes in two forms: A version for self-defence and a version for friendly competition. In either all kinds of wrestling techniques are allowed but in the friendly version they are still taught to be executed in a way so they won't cause the opponent injury. In such a friendly match the winner is considered the one who is standing tall while the other is lying on the ground. This means that if both the opponents fall to the ground together the match will continue on the ground by the use of techniques to keep the other down while getting up.
Even more divergent from other forms of Icelandic wrestling is loose-grip wrestling when trained purely for self-defence. In such training the harmful and hurtful techniques or ways of executing the techniques, that are not accepted in other forms of Icelandic wrestling, are explored in as free and creative a way as possible while not injuring one's training-partners.
The loose-grip version is by far the most widespread in Norway and there are regular competitions in this form of glima such as the Norwegian Glima Championship.
So, one of the fringe benefits of my job as a DJ is having my days relatively free. I obviously still have Stuff To Do, but the deadlines are often quite nebulous and regularly have to be self-imposed. As such, when I heard earlier this week that legendary LA Burger chain In-N-Out Burger were coming to London for a 4-hour pop-up, I was pretty sure that I would be there to check it out.
In classic style I managed to accidentally get a little drunk at the gig I had the night before, but mercifully, the texts I sent to various friends looking for the next pitstop got negative responses, and no further drinking, dancing or debauchery took place. Although I did get my ass handed to me by my flatmate when I tried to play him on the new FIFA 17 demo before bed.
The plus side of this poor planning was that I was goddamned starving on Wednesday morning. Coffee was purchased from my favourite spot (Pavilion Cafe, by the lake in Victoria Park), and then my burger buddy for the day arrived (the wonderful Ben Gomori of Turned On Podcast, who's made an appearance in my Mixtape Monday series). Off we trotted, heading westwards to Swiss Cottage, where the pop-up was taking place.
When we popped back above ground and wandered down towards the venue, we were met with a substantial, but not intimidating, queue. We took our place at the back of the line after stocking up on the essentials for a potentially long wait, and settled in. Arrival time was 10.15am or thereabouts, and the pop-up was scheduled for 11am-3pm. The venue itself seemed to be fairly large inside from what we could see, although strangely little effort had been made to transform the front-end, just one banner in the window, and various In-N-Out staff members in their distinctive uniform milling about, and then a counter inside that looked like some effort had gone on making it pretty close to how they presumably are stateside.
The queue grew steadily as we waited patiently. Various baffled passers-by took photos and asked questions, numerous reporters and journalists came by to ask questions or livestream the thronging crowd of knobheads waiting hours in line for “fast” food.
I made my first appearance within Vice and marked it with a truly awful pun. Getty interviewed me on video, I have no idea if that was used, and frankly I hope I never find out [Edit – thanks to u/RichardJohn over on Reddit for finding this, turns out they not only used me, but I was the only interviewee used! http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/license/609839490].
Wristbands were handed out, enabling people to chip off and come back at their allotted hourly slot – I was given gold, the 12-1 slot. The burger tab on these wristbands made it pretty obvious that we could only order one burger each, a mortifying realisation after having skipped breakfast.
So far, I've said an awful lot without getting to the point. Well, here we go. After 2 or so hours of waiting, we approached the front of the line, and were greeted warmly by Eric, a genuine American fella. He was fantastic, and superbly dealt with the multiple late-comers who tried to blag their way in to get a shirt without waiting in line like the rest of us losers.
This isn't Eric Neither is this
In we went, and order we did. Disappointingly, the only side available was crisps. I want to thank my friends on Facebook for asking me why a mere 91838172581 times. Apparently it was something to do with not being able to ship the fries over or get them right in the UK or something, but whatever it was, it was very disappointing to have ready salted crisps as the accompaniment to a burger you've queued several hours to sample. The prices were cheap as chips, ironically enough, £3 for a double double (two beef patties, two slices of cheese) which I had “animal style” (basically with a quite sweet sauce with grilled onions), a diet coke, and those bloody crisps. I was given a key-ring and a sticker, and decided to fork out £3 for one of their t-shirts, so the whole lot clocked in at a very reasonable £8! So clearly, this wasn't an exercise in making money…
So down we sat with our drinks and goodies, and waited for the food to come to our table. One thing I was struck by was just how many empty seats there were given how slow the queue had been moving. They were clearly managing the numbers very closely to avoid any snafus with the service I guess. The food took maybe 5 minutes or so to arrive, with Ben's being the first to land.
I have to say, the burgers looked excellent when they arrived at the table.
And now we get to the important stuff. The burger – yes, it was good. If I had to try and describe it in a very simple way – it's like the best possible Big Mac you could make. Does it get a place in my top 10. Nope. Was it worth waiting 2-3 hours for? Not really, if I'm brutally honest.
But it was very good. I would happily eat these on the go at the right price, the sauce, the beefburgers, the cheese and the bun were all lovely and complemented each other well. The salad – well, the lettuce was fine, but the tomato was almost ice cold. It wasn't a huge issue, but it definitely detracted from the burger in the final judgement. The animal sauce was really enjoyable – I may well have a crack at making something like that at home, having discovered various websites who think they have the recipe worked out.
I'm glad I made the decision to check it out, as I've never previously really “got” this type of burger – I prefer thicker patties with them nicely pink in the middle. These thinner patties make for a totally different mouth-feel than the “gourmet” style big burgers that dominate London's burger restaurants – often they are overdone to the point of being unpalatable meat-biscuits, but as you can see in the photo above, these are done to perfection, allowing them to remain moist and juicy, something which the melted American cheese and Animal Sauce only serves to amplify. Even as I write this out now, I'm starting to crave another one, so maybe they did make more of an impression on me than I realised – or maybe It's just because I skipped breakfast again. The crisps/fries debacle… the less said the better, I don't really understand how they can go to all the effort of this and not be able to put a proper side on the menu. And thank you to my friends for hammering that point home, relentlessly.
In truth, it's a little unfair of me to compare In-N-Out to the top-end London “gourmet” burger places – its niche is as a really good, but really cheap, burger. A kick-ass McDonald's. Five Guys occupies this niche in the USA too, yet is inexplicably (and totally unjustifiably) priced as a premium burger in the UK. £3 for a Double Double, animal style… now that's phenomenal value. If they opened up over here permanently, with prices in that ballpark, they would absolutely clean up, and rightly so. If they were a tenner… just don't bother, please. But seeing as the last pop-up was in 2012 (4-year cycle, this year in a Brazilian restaurant… I'm guessing that in 2020 they will take over a sushi restaurant…), It's reasonable to guess that they are in no rush to head over to the UK – after all, they are still limited to relatively few states in the USA, which in itself probably plays its part in creating the aura that creates such daft queues as the one I was part of yesterday.

The NBA is no stranger to controversy. This season we've seen players stand up against the country's newest administration by responding vocally and emphatically in the media. Before the year even began we saw numerous players and teams show their unity in National Anthem demonstrations designed to bring awareness to social justice. LeBron James, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony even took to the national stage at the ESPY's to promote social change.
But there's one topic that, despite surfacing more this year than seasons past, still remains in the background — and still remains banned as far as the Association is concerned.
Marijuana.
There's a clear shift underway in the United States in regard to the legalization of cannabis. With every year that passes, more states are legalizing marijuana for medical and/or recreational use.
Sports leagues aren't too far behind. Currently, the NFL is researching medical marijuana options in comparison to their current medical protocol, which heavily consists of painkillers like Toradol and Cortisone.
This research began after ESPN published a confidential NFL player's survey that reported some shocking insights:
59 percent of those surveyed said that they worried about the longterm effects of painkillers.
46 percent is the average number for those thought to take painkillers on a regular daily basis.
42 percent believe that marijuana is best for recovery and pain control. 32 percent said painkillers. 27 percent said neither.
While these painkillers aren't discussed as often in the NBA, a less physical league, the injury factor is still very much there. Torn ligaments, muscle strains, and ankles sprains are just a few of the common, yet potentially serious, injuries that occur in basketball.
Could medical marijuana make its way into the NBA sooner rather than later? What kind of benefits could it offer athletes?
In order to learn more on the subject, Oregon Sports News chatted with former NBA player Antonio Harvey, who is now fully involved in the cannabis business.
Check out Part 1 of our discussion with Harvey, where he talks about his new career!
Oregon Sports News (OSN): Steve Kerr mentioned this season he'd used marijuana to help with back problems and that the NBA should look into the substance's medicinal purposes. He said that “athletes everywhere are prescribed Vicodin like it's vitamin C, like it's no big deal.” What are your thoughts on all of that?
Antonio Harvey (AH): Absolutely! The NFL is already doing it. And it's been proven that marijuana is helpful where other things simply are not. What's helpful, and that people need to understand is that there are so many facets of the plant that are just misunderstood. You know, when people talk about marijuana, the first thing that comes to mind is getting high. And I understand that because that's been, in modern society, that's been the primary use. Marijuana, there are two components: There's a THC, which is what gets you high. And there's a CBD, which is a natural pain reliever. And I think that's, that's what needs to be researched is this cannabinoid. And you can actually buy just the cannabinoid. There are plants that have been grown that only produce CBD, the secondary cannabinoid that fights all of these inflammatory things. I think that that's the information that has to become more prevalent, needs to be talked about more, is that you don't have to get high when you smoke marijuana, you can smoke and only get the medical effects if that's what you're after.
OSN: Adam Silver, a couple years ago, talked about how the main focus for drug testing in the NBA is for HGH. And that's not to say that they're not against marijuana use, but it's something that he mentioned that could be collectively bargained with the player's association. Would you like to see the use of medical marijuana in the NBA?
AH: Yes, I — I want to be clear, though; it's not just the NBA.
OSN: It's all over.
AH: Yes, I want to see the use of medical marijuana all over because I know what it does. I feel better every day now than I ever did, and I'm not a heavy smoker, but I use CBD every night before I go to bed. And I wake up feeling better than I ever have. And so I'm a proponent now. And I do believe that the professional sports leagues … they'll catch on. And the reality is, when I played they didn't even test for marijuana. It wasn't on the schedule for testing. And then it became, it got to the point where people were abusing it, and the league had to test for it. But people are going to see it go back the other way real soon.
OSN: Well, going into that, back in 1997 there was a league-wide survey that revealed that about 70 percent of the NBA's players admitted to smoking marijuana. Jay Williams, a former player and current college basketball analyst, estimated that 80 percent of today's players smoke in the NBA. What do you think about that?
AH: I don't think it's that high. I don't think it's that high because testing is so much more stringent and it's actually on the banned substance list, and the test is random. I think that was more of a provocative statement than anything else. But the truth of the matter is there are guys that smoke. A lot of guys smoke in the offseason. But I don't think it's 80 percent. It's probably 30 percent. I'd say it's probably the opposite of what Jay was saying.
OSN: What benefits do you think marijuana could offer athletes? Is it purely medical, or is there more to it?
AH: Oh, I think there's a lot more to it. My personal belief, and I'm waiting on the science to kind of come in and back it up, but my true belief is marijuana helps in two ways. One, it relieves the body of stress. And stress is a killer. But when you smoke marijuana and your stress levels come down, your body is able to heal better; that's the THC side. Then you factor in the CBD side of it, which is a true anti-inflammatory, and you're actually helping the body in two different ways. That's my personal opinion, that's how it helps me. When I smoke I relax and I allow the cannabinoids to impact my body that much further. I do know that stress create antihistamines, I believe they're called, and it really has a negative impact on the body. So again, when I look at this, for example a cancer patient; it's been shown that cannabis has positive effects in fighting cancer. Not to every patient, certainly not, but some people do see positive effects. It's my belief that part of that is the destressing of the body. All of a sudden, your immune system is that much stronger. We've all seen it; when you're really stressed, you're going to get a cold. You're going to get a cold because your immune system is compromised because of the stress. So, the relief of stress, you take an anti-inflammatory, and all of a sudden your body is implementing twice the fight it was before. And that's just my personal opinion like I said, I'm waiting on science to back that up.
***
The NBA isn't going to change its policies overnight, but with more and more prominent figures speaking out on it, it's not difficult to picture a league where medical marijuana not only exists, but is a preferred method of pain relief and injury recovery.
At the very least, it seems like this discussion isn't going away anytime soon.
A Russian weather satellite and nearly 20 micro-satellites from various nations, including Canada, failed to enter their designated orbits Tuesday following the launch from Russia's new cosmodrome, another blow to the nation's space program.
The Roscosmos space agency said it has failed to establish communications with the Meteor M 2-1 satellite that was launched atop a Soyuz-2 booster rocket Tuesday from Russia's new Vostochny launch pad in the Far East. The agency says it's trying to determine what happened.
Russian news agencies reported the likely cause was the failure of the booster's final stage, the Fregat, possibly caused by a software flaw.
The booster also carried 18 micro satellites built in Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States.
The rocket carrying the satellites had been programmed with bearings for take-off from a different cosmodrome — Baikonur — rather than the Vostochny cosmodrome that it actually launched from. (Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters)
Among them was the LEO Vantage 2 satellite from Ottawa-based Telesat. The satellite was built by Space Systems Loral in Palo Alto, Calif., and the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies Space Flight Laboratory.
Following the launch mishap Tuesday, Telesat confirmed the loss of the satellite, but said in a statement that its plans "remain on track."
It added that a second LEO test satellite will be launched in coming weeks aboard the Indian Space Research Organisation's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle from ISRO's Sriharikota launch site. ISRO says its next PSLV launch is scheduled for the second half of December.
It's the first test satellite of a constellation of 120 that Telesat aims to have running in 2021, providing "fiber-like broadband" worldwide to commercial and government markets, the company said in a release earlier this month. And its launch was described as a "key step" in reaching the company's goal.
The company planned to use the test satellite to ensure its motion could be properly tracked from ground stations and it could be pointed the right way to send and receive signals from Earth. It also planned to test the speed and quality of the satellite's broadband communications, and had hoped to open testing to customers in 2018.
Soyuz was carrying 19 satellites from various countries including Canada 1:57
Satellites stranded?
It wasn't immediately clear if the Meteor and other satellites fell into the ocean or were stranded in low orbit.
The glitch follows other failed launches in recent years that tarnished the reputation of Russian space industries. Some of the glitches were traced to manufacturing flaws.
Asked about the failed launch, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov refrained from immediate comment, saying that the Kremlin was expecting space officials' report on the situation.
The failed launch is the second since the Vostochny cosmodrome made its debut in April 2016.

(Kirill Kudryavtsev/Pool/Reuters)
Russia spent billions of dollars to build the new launch pad as a possible alternative to the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan that Moscow has leased from its former Soviet neighbour.
Some observers have disputed the feasibility of the expensive new facility, given the fact that Russia plans to continue using Baikonur for most of its launches. Construction work at Vostochny has been dogged by scandals involving protests by unpaid workers and the arrests of officials accused of embezzlement.
I was a huge “LOST” fan. I loved “Dexter”. “Homeland” is incredible. But “Breaking Bad” is the greatest television show. Ever.
I am such a big fan of the show, that I designed a set of three posters to celebrate the Emmy-winning series. And now, I am very excited to announce that these prints are official “Breaking Bad” merchandise and will be exclusively available on the BreakingBadStore.com starting tomorrow (Tuesday September 24th) at 10AM PST/1PM EST.
The poster series illustrates the transformation of Bryan Cranston's character, Walter White, over the course of the highly-acclaimed series.
Mr. White
This first print depicts the Walter White we met in the first season of “Breaking Bad” – the pitiful chemistry teacher, wearing only a green rubber apron and white cotton briefs, frantically cooking meth in the Albuquerque desert.
Heisenberg
The second print portrays Walter White as the crystal meth kingpin, “Heisenberg”. Rising to power and descending into chaos, Walter is encircled by the super-lab and a small, pesky intruder.
The final print represents the final incarnation of Walter White: Mr. Lambert. Armed and dangerous, bearded and beleaguered, Mr. Lambert has nothing left to lose!
The collector's edition prints will be available as individual 18″x24″ posters, or as a set of 3 11″x14″ smaller prints. Each piece is a 2-color, hand-pulled silkscreen print on 100lb French Pop-Tone Paper and every poster is hand signed and numbered. There is also a Heisenberg variant on hazmat yellow, which will only be available in the 18″x24″ size.
All of the posters will be exclusively available on the BreakingBadStore.com starting tomorrow (Tuesday, September 24th) at 10AM PST/1PM EST.
The Breaking Bad series finale airs Sun., Sept. 29 at 9 p.m. ET on AMC.
Developers revealed new renderings of the proposed 17-story 855 W. Adams project Wednesday night. View Full Caption FitzGerald Associates Architects
WEST LOOP — Developers pitched a new 17-story mixed-use building near Mary Bartelme Park in the West Loop Wednesday night, but neighbors aren't on board with the plan.
In the vote by a show of hands Wednesday night, a majority of the 75 neighbors present signaled opposition to the 855 W. Adams project. Crayton Advisors and White Oak Realty Partners want to develop the building with 258 apartments at West Adams and South Peoria streets in the booming neighborhood.
The 855 W. Adams project, which would top out at 185 feet, would include 13,500 square feet of retail space, 179 parking spaces and 258 bicycle parking spaces, and a rooftop pool, according to plans. An existing office building on Jackson would remain.
The brick and glass-clad building would include a mix of studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom units, said John Abell, Crayton Advisors managing partner.

Paul Gavin, who said he has lived in the West Loop since 2009, believes the tower would "completely destroy the look of the neighborhood."
"We're not Lincoln Park. We're not Lakeview. We're not the South Loop. That's what's made the West Loop great — the buildings, seven, eight stories, brick facades, 1920s, 1930s. And now they come in with this," Gavin said, eliciting applause from the audience.
"Developers are getting way too greedy in this area and they are trying to take every penny out of the West Loop real estate boom, and it's our job as residents to say no to it," Gavin said.
Another neighbor who has lived at 203 S. Sangamon St. in the West Loop since 1999 said until recently developers didn't attempt to build taller than 10 to 12 stories in the neighborhood.
"My real problem is with the height," he said. "In fact, I'm disappointed with the alderman, because he knows that's a major issue."
Ald. Danny Solis (25th) or a representative from Solis' office were not present at the Wednesday night meeting.
Last September, leaders of another group, Neighbors of West Loop, said the project was too tall and dense for the site. That neighborhood group urged the developer to consider nearby 850 W. Adams, a 90-foot-tall building that is "a more reasonable comparison for height," the committee wrote.
But Patrick FitzGerald, the project's architect whose firm FitzGerald Associates Architects has been located in the West Loop since 2000, said height "is a relative issue" in the West Loop. He can remember when proposals for the eight-story 1000 W. Adams completed in 2001, and nine-story 111 S. Morgan completed in 2002, taller than the neighboring six-story warehouses, were regarded as "dramatic increases" in height at the time.
The areas surrounding the Loop are growing as people want to live closer to work, FitzGerald said, creativing more demand for new housing.
"I think we have to adjust to the fact that there were height limits that were lower in the past, but that's evolved. And that hasn't evolved strictly because of developers, that's also city policy," FitzGerald said.
The 855 W. Adams site is about a block from a proposed 17-story, 586-apartment project at the blocklong H2O site at 845 W. Madison St. In February, 27th Ward Ald. Walter Burnett Jr. said he is likely to support the latest H2O plan, but the zoning change has yet to be formally approved by the City Council.
In 2015, neighbors worked tirelessly to oppose the nearby 111 S. Peoria St. project that borders the park. Despite their efforts, the scaled-back residential building was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in March 2016, and the building, now called Illume, is under construction.
The 855 W. Adams project is one of many proposed for the area that has seen a huge influx of new residential buildings, hotels and office developments, including the new McDonald's headquarters on Randolph and the 12-story McDonald's "Vendor Village" at Lake and Carpenter streets.
The developer is requesting a zoning change from DS-3 to a DX-7 Planned Development. If approved, the developer plans to contribute $1.076 million to the Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus fund, a city program that allows developers to build bigger and taller projects in an expanded Downtown area to support commercial projects in blighted neighborhoods.
The U.S. Senate shortly faces a choice between two views of chemical regulation—one backed by industry, the other with stronger consumer protections.
The first, with heavy support from the chemical industry, got its first hearing Wednesday before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, co-sponsored by Sen. David Vitter (R-Louisiana) and Sen. Tom Udall (D-New Mexico), is touted as a “common-sense” update to the current regulatory legislation. However, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) called the proposal “actually worse than the existing Toxic Substances Control Act.” The organization cites the failure to specifically address asbestos, deadlines for chemical review pushed far into the future, not allowing states to set tougher standards for chemical safety, and several other issues. In addition EWG says the bill would actually weaken the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to intercept imported unsafe chemicals.
The chemical industry has made sure those who co-sponsored the Lautenberg bill are well taken care of financially. Vitter received $14,000 from the industry in the 2014 election cycle, topping off the nearly $60,000 the industry has handed him during the past six years. He also received a $150,000 donation from the American Chemistry Council to the super PAC supporting his Louisiana gubernatorial bid, according to Maplight. The industry donated $15,000 to Udall during the 2014 cycle and sponsored a television commercial in support of his leadership.
Additionally, during that same election cycle, all 17 senators who sponsored or co-sponsored the Vitter-Udall bill were among the current members of the Senate who received more than $1 million in donations from the nation's top 10 chemical companies. The total amount spent by those organizations on lobbying during that period was more than $76 million, Maplight reported. The industry's spending on lobbying immediately after the legislation was introduced hit a record high for those companies. More than $4 million was spent by the Chemistry Council alone to pay for TV and radio ads supporting the campaigns of those in Congress who backed the bill.
“I've been around the Senate for a long time, but I have never before seen so much heavy-handed, big-spending lobbying on any issue,” Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-California) told The New York Times. “To me it looks like the chemical industry itself is writing this bill.”
Boxer even tracked the bill's origins to the industry's lobbying arm. “Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I do not believe that a regulated industry should be so intimately involved in writing a bill that regulates them,” she added.
In response to what she viewed as deficiencies in the Lautenberg bill, Boxer and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts) have introduced the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act. That legislation, named for two victims of chemical pollution, would go much farther in protecting Americans from chemical dangers. It would require faster review of chemicals, specifically address the threat from asbestos, allow states to impose more restrictions and enforce a stricter standard of what is hazardous.
“This legislation will preserve vital protections like a state's ability to clamp down on dangerous chemicals, while ensuring that known chemical threats to public health are acted on quickly,” Markey said in a statement. “This bill will help ensure that communities are protected from chemical spills and clusters of disease that are related to toxic exposures.”
There's currently no timetable for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, run by Sen. James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), to take up Boxer and Markey's bill.

After North Korea collapses, the biggest threat to South Korea may be the potential insurgents who rise from the ashes of the Kim regime.
If Kim Jong-un and his inner circle are eliminated, most North Korean elites will not take chances or leave themselves vulnerable to the whims of U.S. and South Korean leaders. They can never be completely sure that their security and freedom will be upheld by surrendering and cooperating with the U.S. or South Korea (ROK). Especially, if they are complicit in crimes against humanity. As a result, some elites could rationalize organized resistance against a ROK-US absorption of the entire Korean peninsula.
If South Korea fails to draw a significant number of North Korean elites to their side, then it will likely face a plethora of challenges from an asymmetric force that seeks to delegitimize South Korean governance.
The Major Problems
Insurgencies are conflicts that aim to gain the influence and legitimacy of populations away from sovereign authorities. Both insurgent and counterinsurgent forces aim to shift perceptions to their own advantage. The reunified government, bearing more responsibilities to its civilian constituents, would have to manage both North Korean and South Korean perceptions. Under the reunified Korean government, a certain number of North Korean elites will have to be in power in order to maintain the public order with their familiarity with the local infrastructures. The reunified Korean government would have to ensure that the actions of North Korean officials remaining in power do not compromise positive perceptions about the legitimate government.
The conduct of North Korean leaders under a South Korean-led government is something that no one can predict. It is paramount that the government establishes institutional mechanisms, training, and assimilation for North Korean local leaders to minimize the risk of abuse and scandal. The legitimacy and trust in the reunified government would be in jeopardy if local leaders abuse their powers and do not conduct themselves appropriately. Local leaders must also not allow insurgent organizations to grow or use excessive force in containing them. They have to be reminded that they live in different parameters from the North Korean system of internal security.
Although economic development and humanitarian aid can positively influence North Koreans, those tools can be double-edged swords that allow North Koreans to overestimate the capabilities of the government. If they perceive themselves as second-class citizens who cannot reap the full riches of a globalizing society, then they may be inclined to follow other authorities that are more legitimate in their eyes. This inclination would further be exacerbated if North Koreans complicit in committing injustices against their peers benefit from the unified regime. The reunified government would have to minimize the threat of grievances and propagate clear messages of its goals and accomplishments.
What a North Korean Insurgency Might Look Like
The Kim family over the decades purposefully maintained restraints on military officers to keep them from consolidating too much power. Under the songbun system, society and government entities are divided up in order to ensure that they inevitably focus on loyalty to Kim Il-sung and his descendants. In the absence of this system, structures within North Korean insurgencies would form from the networks and norms already existing in the country.
According to Paul Staniland, there are four types of insurgent groups identified according to their central and local processes of control: integrated, vanguard, parochial, and fragmented. Integrated organization has a robust unity in leadership and local compliancy, vanguard organizations have strong central unity but weak local control, parochial groups have weak central unity but strong local control, and fragmented organizations have neither good central nor local levels of control. In the absence of the central DPRK government, North Korean elite-led insurgencies would most likely form parochial groups that have centralized local groups.
The Kim regime has likely eliminated the possibility of integrated insurgencies because they are the most potent threats to the state. As a result, mechanisms for interagency competition and conflicting interests within the government and military reduce the likelihood of coherency and unity without North Korea's top leaders in an insurgent scenario. Elites, however, may exploit preexisting mechanisms used for bribing, intelligence sharing, policing, and blackmailing that would allow control over local authorities. This organizational structure would mitigate losses from counterinsurgent decapitation strategies, but it would be vulnerable to divide-and-control strategies.
Although nationalism infused with the worship of Kim Il-sung may motivate some insurgents, shared norms and expectations among North Koreans would not likely overcome the level of distrust among themselves. As a result, these groups may be structured based on economic endowments, rather than social ones, especially if they already have easy access to foreign money-making networks, rare earth minerals (REEs), narcotics, and CBRN (chemical, biological, radioactive, nuclear) materials. Given these resources, stakes in the productivity and cooperation of the civilian population would be relatively small and North Korean insurgents may be more short-term-oriented rather than long-term-oriented.
If North Korean insurgents are more interested in short-term goals of survival, then they may rush to recruit large numbers of people. Given such an influx of untrusted group members, the sub-organizations within insurgent groups will likely be centralized because they would not want to risk giving up real authority to the hands of their agents. Sub-organizational centralization would limit major decision-making to a few authorities who carry out a coherent strategy, but this strategy may come into conflict with the strategy of the main insurgent organizations. A fast, broad recruitment process, however, would put less effort in screening recruits; thus, the pool of insurgents may be characterized by declining discipline, desperation for basic necessities, and abuse of status. If that is the case, North Korean organizations may lean towards the more violent spectrum of insurgencies against civilians, perhaps looking like the Shining Path's Comite Regional del Alto Huallaga (CRH) in Peru, a regional committee in the Upper Huallaga Valley that prioritized military training and control of coca production and trafficking. Depending on their calculus of survival, North Korean insurgents, like the centralized Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka, may even use children like the million-strong middle school Red Youth Guards for suicide attacks in order to destabilize the logistics of counterinsurgent forward deployments.
The insurgent strategy of survival would likely involve concentrating forces in central provinces close to Pyongyang and the northeastern region close to the Rason and North Hamgyong provinces. Those regions would not only be in close proximity to resource-rich regions like Jongju and the Macheonryeong mountain range, but they would also be near domestic and international borders. Such locations would help them avoid pressure from government forces and complicate reactions and coordination among different authorities. Presuming that the current borders in North Korea stay the same, it would be no surprise if the North Koreans mirror this strategy by setting up bases of operation in regions near domestic borders like the South Hamgyong-South Pyongan-North Hwanghae-Kangwon region and South-Pyonghang-Pyongyang-North-Hwanghae regions and international borders with China and Russia.
Countering North Korean insurgencies will be a daunting task for the reunified Korean government that will likely span years, if not decades. In order to undermine the legitimacy and efficacy of these groups, the South Korean-led counterinsurgents would have to balance expectations and utilize their own networks with regional great powers to disrupt and fragment insurgent ties among leaders and the local populace. They would also need the cooperation of regional actors like China and Russia to restrict logistical channels that support these insurgents.

A federal lawsuit filed Monday in New York accuses Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of repeatedly raping a 13-year-old girl more than 20 years ago, at several Upper East Side parties hosted by convicted sex offender and notorious billionaire investor Jeffrey Epstein.
The suit, first reported by the Real Deal, accuses Trump and Epstein of luring the anonymous plaintiff and other young women to four parties at Epstein's so-called Wexner Mansion at 9 East 71st Street. Epstein allegedly lured the plaintiff, identified in the suit only as Jane Doe, with promises of a modeling career and cash.
Another anonymous woman, identified in additional testimony as Tiffany Doe, corroborates Jane's allegations, testifying that she met Epstein at Port Authority, where he hired her to recruit other young girls for his parties.
Trump had known Epstein for seven years in 1994 when he attended the parties at Wexner, according to the suit. He also allegedly knew that the plaintiff was 13 years old.
Jeffrey Epstein filed a similar suit in California in April, under the name Katie Johnson, also accusing Trump and Epstein of rape. That suit was dismissed on the grounds of improper paperworkthe address affiliated with her name was found to be abandoned. Today's suit confirms that the plaintiffs are one and the same.
Monday's complaint details extremely violent and horrific alleged encounters between Trump and Doe. In what Doe's attorneys describe as a "savage sexual attack," Trump allegedly tied her to a bed and exposed himself before raping her. When she pleaded that he stop, Trump allegedly "responded... by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted," according to the suit.
Afterwards, Trump allegedly threatened the plaintiff, saying that her family would be "physically harmed if not killed" if she were to speak about the abuses. Epstein allegedly proceeded to rape Doe twice more, attempted to strike her, and screamed that he, rather than Trump, should have taken her virginity. Epstein also allegedly reiterated threats to Doe's family.
Doe remained silent for many years, according to court papers, because she had no reason to believe that the threats against her and her family had been lifted. The constant media spotlight on Trump, taxing her emotionally and mentally since last summer, apparently pushed her to come forward. Monday's civil complaint makes the case that New York's statute of limitationsfive years for civil rape casesshould be waived, because the plaintiff was denied her "freedom of will" to speak.
Doe demands $75,000 in damages, according to the complaint, as well as attorneys fees and an order of protection against Trump and "such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper."
Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Doe's allegations, but the candidate denied the claims in the California suit this Spring. “The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated,” he told Radar.
Epstein served 13 months in prison in the early aughts for soliciting a minor for prostitution.

Wunder was charged with criminal trespassing. His attorney, Mark C. Collins, pleaded not guilty on his behalf in Franklin County Municipal Court. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for Oct. 16.
Criminal trespassing is a fourth-degree misdemeanor punishable by no more than 30 days in jail.
Jeff Harrison, senior vice president for education at the Evans Scholars Foundation, said yesterday that Wunder has been suspended from all activities involving the program. He was asked to move out of the Evans Scholars house on E. 16th Avenue but has not had his scholarship taken away, Harrison said.
Wunder, a fourth-year student in a five-year mechanical-engineering program, remains enrolled at Ohio State.
�We�re doing an internal review and gathering as much information as we can before we make a final determination on his scholarship,� Harrison said.
Evans Scholars have a code of conduct they must follow, Harrison said. He didn�t specify what part of that code Wunder might have broken.
Scholars are required to have a strong caddie record and excellent academics and to demonstrate financial need, according to the organization�s website. They also must be �outstanding in character, integrity and leadership.�
�Anthony is a very nice young man,� Harrison said. �We�re very disappointed in the incident, and he knows he made a very big mistake.�

NEW DELHI: Will Finance Minister Arun Jaitley fall ill tomorrow?This was an intriguing question posed by senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Tuesday in the Rajya Sabha after a discussion on biometric identification Aadhaar , listed for Wednesday, was put off.Ramesh said members had two days back got an official notice from the Rajya Sabha secretariat on a discussion being listed on Aadhaar on Wednesday.However, this morning another notice came saying the discussion has been postponed.When he inquired the reasons for postponement, "I was informed that the finance minister is unwell" and will not be available to reply to the discussion on Wednesday.He, however said Jaitley, who was sitting in the House, looked hail and hearty and sought to know why was the debate postponed."Will he be unwell tomorrow," Ramesh asked much to the amusement of the members.Jaitley, who had on Monday taken ill and not attended Parliament, did not respond to Ramesh.Finance minister had returned home soon after the Cabinet meeting on Monday morning cleared four legislations for Goods and Service Tax (GST) implementation. He was to reply to discussion on Budget in Rajya Sabha on Monday but that did not take place.He was, however, present in the House since morning.Minister of state for parliamentary affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi got to up say something but sat down without saying anything.
When western countries are criticised for legitimising Egypt's oppressive rule, excuses are offered in return. One response is that Egypt does not heed their concerns regarding the dire human rights conditions. “We've tried telling them, but they don't listen,” is a common way of phrasing it. As to why business deals proceed smoothly despite Egypt's record breaking rights violations, the response is that the west cannot fix Egypt's problems or put an end to the repression.
It is true: Egypt's main problems are essentially an internal matter that cannot be solved by the west. Indeed, solutions should not be requested or expected from western countries. Yet the rhetoric is faulty and aims to absolve countries supporting present day Egypt of their actions.
Countries like the US, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, France, and indeed the entire EU have not been keen on condemning Egypt's practices recently. In the past, they would in private meetings and occasionally in public statements, but now bringing up the topic has become rare. Continued business agreements further embolden and empower the Egyptian regime. Even if no change comes about through western countries adhering to their proclaimed moral standards, the west's perceived ineffectiveness of even trying is not a valid excuse. It contributes negatively to the deterring rights conditions in Egypt.
Ongoing arms deals, energy contracts, and numerous other forms of trade are viewed as an opportunity to become ‘friends' with Egypt. Theoretically, this would allow these partners to have more influence on how Egypt acts. Surely they would not refuse advice or requests from friends?
This notion, despite its popularity, has proven unrealistic. The US has been closer to Egypt's regime than most other western countries, yet has also complained that their ‘friends' do not listen to them. So much so that they have dropped the façade and do not ever bother condemning Egypt's atrocities anymore. In fact, the Obama administration proposed waiving the human rights conditions on aid to Egypt.
France had a similar revealing encounter. François Hollande visited Egypt personally to solidify business and arms deals, further legitimising President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi's rule. In late May, a French journalist was denied entry to Egypt, embarrassingly at the same time when French members of parliament, headed by Philippe Folliot, were visiting Egypt. Try as they might with their ‘friends', the matter has not yet been cleared. Rémy Pigaglio was detained for thirty hours before being forced to leave Egypt, despite having arrived with a valid visa and press accreditation, while French MPs' pleas for more information and demands in favour of Pigaglio fell on deaf ears.
The violations of rights and democratic values are countless. One blatant example is the attack on press freedom, with an unprecedented storming of the Press Syndicate and the detention of the head of the Press Syndicate, Yehia Qallash, along with several other board members. Similarly, death sentences without a fair trial, arbitrary pre-trial detentions that can last for years, the invasion of privacy as police allow themselves to browse people's personal phones without a warrant, torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings are all on the rise and seem to raise no eyebrows.
In response to the undeniable documentation of these attacks on basic human values, numerous diplomats have claimed that Egypt is helping to fight terrorism. This is problematic for many reasons. Accepting rights violations carried out by a state in order to fight terrorism is not an acceptable stance and it defeats the purpose. Can we accept the murder of Giulio Regeni, in which security services are implicated, simply because Egypt is fighting terrorism? One of terrorism's aims is to deprive people of their basic rights, and that is exactly what rights violations are all about.
But even if we accept the problematic notion that these violations can be tolerated because of the fight against terrorism, it is not accurate to assess that Egypt is successful at it. Since Al-Sisi asked the masses to commission him to fight terror on 26 July 2013, the numbers of extremist militants in Sinai have been on the rise. It is estimated that the numbers increased from the tens to the hundreds. Young people, and particularly residents of North Sinai, are being forcibly disappeared. This is being carried randomly and often without any associations to terrorism and a great many have the potential of being radicalised due to the injustices they face.
Indeed, the biggest hole in that elaborate theory is the persistent and deliberate crackdown on secular democratic peaceful voices coupled with underhanded deals with religious extremists. Sustaining Al-Sisi's rule does not help avert a Syria or Islamic State scenario. Locking up peaceful activists does nothing but contribute to the rise of extremist opposition. Banning rights defenders from travel with the threat of asset seizure does not make sense. The fight on terror is never won when the same terror tactics are exercised by others who are slightly more likeable.
Diplomats who have met Al-Sisi are reported to have found him ‘likeable'. He has been able to cater to what they want to hear, irrespective of the facts on the ground. It is easy to believe that the judiciary is beyond control, that he is trying to fight corruption and that police reform is a work in progress when it is not contrasted by the stark reality of politicised sentencing, police impunity, and the sacking of and investigation into Egypt's top auditor Hesham Geneina for exposing corruption of state bodies.
It may be the duty of representatives from these countries to do what's best for their people, but it is also a moral duty to point out moral and logical inconsistencies. Even token gestures of bringing up rights or condemning violations of democratic values have all but disappeared. More recently we have seen British ambassador to Egypt John Casson criticised for failing to mention human rights as an option on the agenda of British MPs visiting Egypt. Similarly, Gerard Steegh, the Dutch ambassador to Egypt has stressed that Egypt made progress in its transition to democracy despite human rights violations on the rise at an all-time high.
In some ways, facts became less consequential as the moral question became needlessly compounded. More and more these facts need to be evaded through a series of ‘practical' concerns. The US and Europe are not responsible for what the Egyptian regime does, and likewise Egypt is not oppressive simply because of international support. Yet, it is important to realise that western empowerment has a role to play and it hinders Egypt's struggle for democracy and a true stability built on justice.
Western countries that currently support the Egyptian regime will most certainly condemn it when it shows signs of change, just like they did with Mubarak. It is these western countries, not Egyptian officials, who have claimed they support democratic values. The least they can do is live up to their own rhetoric minus the excuses. Until the rhetoric matches actions, the war on democratic values by Egypt and its western allies continues. Meanwhile, excuses offered come off as nothing but propaganda.

Led by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (Air District), in partnership with a number of the region's municipal governments and transit agencies, the "main goal of the pilot is to evaluate bike sharing's potential to effectively reduce vehicle traffic and improve local air quality," says a press release announcing the program's expected August launch date.
"The Bay Area's pilot will be the first regional program in the country — a detail that created complications and delayed the program, originally expected to begin in 2012," explains Schremmer. "Structured around Caltrain, it will put an estimated 50 locations in downtown San Francisco and about two dozen more near Caltrain stations in Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View and San Jose. BAAQMD is seeking sponsorships to expand the system. Meanwhile, SF Supervisor Scott Wiener is lobbying to extend the dowtown San Francisco part of the pilot across the city."
"Though it's focused on Caltrain stations, the program's concentration of downtown SF locations could also make it useful to BART riders," she adds, "who are not yet allowed to bring bicycles on trains during rush hour."
The mission of the Chita Rivera Awards is to celebrate dance and choreographic excellence. In a season of most excellent dancing on Broadway, it was both a surprise and an honour for the ensemble of Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 to be nominated for a Chita Rivera Award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Broadway Show. I personally never know what to say when someone asks me what I do. Do I say "dancer?" Do I say "performer?" Do I have the audacity to say "I sing, dance and act?" I say "actor" most times because that's what I feel we are all doing through our different skills; acting through song or dance or both and, in the case of The Great Comet, while also playing an instrument. Though I am unsure of what to say when asked what I do, the box that I've been put in on Broadway is as a swing and dance captain, having been a swing and part of the dance captain teams of two Broadway shows. These responsibilities are generally filled by those who would call themselves dancers. So, I guess that makes me a "dancer?"
I joined the company of The Great Comet as a swing and eventually took on an Assistant Dance Captain responsibility. I found myself working in an ensemble of people who call themselves "singers" and "musicians," and not at all "dancers." The magical thing about the work of Choreographer, Sam Pinkleton, his associate, Chloe Treat, and his assistant, Flannery Gregg, is that it is all encompassing. You don't have to have trained in ballet since the age of 7 to walk into their studio and be considered a "dancer." First and foremost, you need to be authentic in your spirit; you need to move with true joy and love. The movement, whatever it looks like, has to come from an honest place, for many reasons, one of them being that you are so close to audience members that you are breathing, sweating, and sometimes pulsating on them (if they are lucky). If you are not opening your heart honestly to them, they will know. As an assistant dance captain, one of the things I found challenging was to allow for each individual's authenticity to shine through while making sure it stayed of the world that Sam, Chloe, and Flannery created. We had a full range of mixed abilities within the ensemble, but each member of it rose to Sam's request: dance so hard that it makes you want to vomit. I watched amazing featured dancers wow the audience with their strength and skill. I watched roving musicians (ensemble members who play instruments) do every bit of choreography while playing an instrument. As a trained dancer, I take for granted the knowledge that I have to maintain my health and body to do a long run of a dance show. Many members of the ensemble had never danced in the way that was required of the show and they spent weeks, even months, figuring out how to maintain the high level of energy and movement over eight shows a week without risking injury or fatigue. (Someone joked tonight before the awards started that if it was still called the ASTAIRE Awards, we'd win....because of the STAIRS.)
The ensemble of The Great Comet did not execute the difficult partnering the way they do at Bandstand (so effortlessly!). We did not dance with technical precision the way they do in Cats. But we danced with our hearts open wide as an invitation for every person watching the show to come join our party. We dared to move in ways that might be considered "weird" or "strange." We are unashamedly ourselves, whether we have female armpit hair, a unique ethnic heritage, or we are queer. In being ourselves, we encouraged all who joined our party to be brave in their uniqueness. The ensemble of The Great Comet pushed the boundaries on what an ensemble is because we were encouraged to break theatrical barriers by the dance team, director Rachel Chavkin, and Writer Dave Malloy. Winning the Chita Rivera Award for Outstanding Ensemble of a Broadway show means that the community of dancers and choreographers whom I admire and respect stand with us in our diversity and weirdness in movement choices. As an Assistant Dance Captain, I am the proudest. As an ensemble member, I am honoured to be in the company of my colleagues. As a dancer, I give so much thanks to those who recognize the ensemble of The Great Comet as the high kicking, viola playing, accordion dueling, clarinet blowing, barrel turning, bellies-full-of whisky storytellers we so loved being eight shows a week.

What I Learned About Design While Picking a Barrel of Bourbon
Beth Schwindt Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 15, 2015
One of the best things about being a designer is that I see design expressed everywhere. I doodle service blueprints when I'm on hold with Comcast. I get excited when a favorite app developer makes a clever design fix that adds delight. However, I was not expecting to learn anything about design when I recently went along with a group who was purchasing a private barrel of bourbon from Wild Turkey. What I got was a great portrait of how craft. Master distillers don't call themselves designers, but they tackle the hurdles, uncertainty, and elements of chance and taste like the best practitioners in the business.
Garbage in, garbage out.
With bourbon — the quality of the ingredients matter. The corn, rye, wheat, and malted barley are meticulously sourced and tested before they are made into mash, which is then distilled and aged to become bourbon. Experts agree that if the mash is bad, the bourbon is going to be bad, no matter what you do to it.
Design projects work the same way. Our mash bill is comprised of good data, research, insights, and goals. I had a project recently where the team was tasked with solving “poverty” in twelve weeks (bad goal), and given two weeks to research the causes of poverty (bad data set). We dumped a lot of random data into our frameworks and spent the remainder of the project trying to rescue, recut, and realign the pieces. Good design projects have far more “aha” moments than “oh, fuck. we need to re-do this” ones. While all good projects have their own challenges, the pieces slowly distil into something better rather than constantly falling apart.
Even with constraints, there's tremendous variation.
Let's say you are a master distiller and get the perfect mash into every barrel of bourbon. You've used the universal ingredient of Kentucky limestone water, and the required new charred-oak barrels. You still may not get great bourbon.
Despite strict constraints, there's huge variation — distillate from the same batch stored in barrels made by the same cooper, stored next to each other in a rick house, the barrel warehouse, might still be wildly different.
Design, like bourbon, has tomes of best practices, but using them doesn't guarantee results. Think about all the designs Steve Jobs and Johnnie Ives produced for Apple. Some years featured great iPhones and uninspired iPods. Great leadership, teams, and vision do not always make great art with every batch. We don't know how something is really going to turn out until we experience it.
Time and timing does weird (and occasionally miraculous things).
Bourbon aficionados will talk about the importance of where a barrel of bourbon was stored in the rick house. There's one bourbon producer that believes aging bourbon on lower floors produces the best results, so all of its rick houses are built low. When asked about the validity of this, master distiller Eddie Russell dismissed the theory but admitted he likes to look for good barrels of bourbon on the middle floors of his five-story rick houses. But, in reality, you can't predict what the bourbon is going to be until you taste it after years of aging.
With design, we do this, too. We like to look back, see what worked, who made it and why it was magic. A lot of times, I think this is superstition, like wearing lucky socks. No batch of bourbon is ever going to turn out a 100% perfect set of barrels, and no designer is going to turn out 100% great ideas. We both work with live ingredients and timing. People's tastes, the economy, and the world change just like the weather and time that age bourbon. This is why designers need to be okay with failure and know our outcomes aren't completely under are our control.
We're all in the relationship business.
Eddie Russell is great at making bourbon. Picking a barrel with Eddie was what I imagine it would be like going to work with him — lots of straightforward knowledge and laid back appreciation of craft. The four-minute ride from the Wild Turkey tasting room to Eddie's rick house illustrated two different worlds. The tasting room is filled with cleverness (#GiveEmTheBird), great merchandise and Wild Turkey branding. The rick house was soaked with over a hundred years with of bourbon, dirty, and a full Technicolor picture of Wild Turkey craft. While my bourbon connoisseur companions preferred the dirt, they appreciated the tasting room along with the tourists on the Bourbon Trail.
Seeing the brand and culture, product, and history it was a great lesson in how to build UX that was clever, fun and authentic. As a designer, thinking about how we balance preserving the story and the truth while telling it to the audience we happen to have is always a challenge. I loved being in the rick house, but I almost took home a pair of “give ‘em the bird” messaged gloves because they made me laugh. Brands can have dimension. As designers, we are definitely in the relationship business, no matter what type of designer we think we are. We connect people. Shaking hands and building products for lots of audiences is always going to be part of the gig — — just like it is for the master distiller.
The best clients like to be surprised and challenged.
Listening to Eddie talk about barrel buying clients, he articulated that the best customers don't want something usual and predictable. They want something that is both great and challenges their definition of great Wild Turkey bourbon.
In design, it is easy to deliver a client exactly what they ask for. I tasted bourbon that was predictably great Wild Turkey Bourbon and I've delivered clients exactly what they told me they wanted. Everyone was happy, the job was done, but none of us grew our knowledge or found new delight. When I am lucky enough to have clients who allow room for the unexpected — — we all grow together and grow our respective crafts.
If ever a team needed a dose of military-like leadership and guidance, it is American Samoa. Once statistically the world's worst international team, the remote Polynesian nation are on a clear upward tangent, and Ramin Ott has played a significant role in that development.
American Samoa's class of 2015 are a partly disparate group hailing from a variety of locations, with limited time to build cohesion or team unity. Yet, under the captaincy of team veteran Ott - a sergeant in the US Army who has served in Afghanistan - the team head into the Friday's final matchday of OFC Stage 1 FIFA World Cup Russia 2018™ qualifying within sight of a goal that was once unthinkable: progress to the next stage of the competition.
This, after all, was a nation that had never won an international game until four years ago. The team went without a victory for well over a decade, in a period which included an infamous world record 31-0 defeat. And the 29-year-old Ott is one of the few long-serving players whose career has straddled the period, which saw the team move from also-rans to genuine regional competitors.
Ott was raised in the capital Pago Pago and moved to the USA in his early 20s. He decided to join the US military five years ago and has risen to the rank of sergeant, where his leadership qualities were quickly recognised, resulting in an arduous nine-month stint in Afghanistan.
Now stationed in Hawaii after nearly a decade living and playing in different parts of the US, Ott says his military experience has been beneficial for international football. “My leadership skills I try to carry over to the game,” Ott told FIFA.com from the Tonga capital of Nuku'alofa. “Everything in the military is attention to detail. I tell the boys like it is if their attitude is poor. They like how straightforward I am.
“Yesterday it showed, when the soldier in me came out,” says Ott of Wednesday's win over Tonga. “I grew up with toughness, and all the experience I have gained over the years came out. I can't be soft, and I can't see the boys seeing me being soft. I told them yesterday when we went behind, ‘It's not done yet, just keep playing.' And we came back after conceding that goal.”
*Keeping it in the family
*For decades to come, the history of football in American Samoa will be synonymous with the name Ott. He scored in the team's first World Cup win in 2011, and even netted when the nation claimed their first point at youth level a decade ago. Now he has bagged the winner in American Samoa's second World Cup win.
Ramin's older brother Diamond was also set to have been in Tonga, participating in the first stage of qualifying, had he not received a fifth overseas deployment with the US Army. Four years ago, Diamond was the width of the post away from securing progress to the second round, only for his potential match-winner to hit the woodwork in the dying moments against Samoa. The Ott family are also known in the American Samoa football fraternity for running the well-recognised Black Roses club.
Now, following his winner against Tonga on Wednesday, Ott has joined an elite group of players globally who can lay claim to scoring in three successive World Cup campaigns. The goal also saw him become American Samoa's leading goalscorer with three. A modest tally undoubtedly, but this, after all, is a nation which had only scored four World Cup goals until this week.
American Samoa opened the week with a tense 3-2 defeat against rivals Samoa, but Wednesday's result means they could progress to the next stage with victory over Cook Islands on Friday. And Ott says the current crop, which includes a chunk of US-based players, boast a skill-set never seen before in the national team.
“From the 2011 team I would bring their physicality to this team, we were very physical then,” says Ott with emphasis. “Now we know how to play the ball, and create.”
When Ott started his World Cup journey, he saw his American Samoa side concede a whopping 38 goals in four matches. The development in just two World Cup cycles has been astounding. “No, not at all,” said Ott when asked if he ever imagined American Samoa reaching the level it has.
And Ott says the 2011 impact of former USA youth coach Thomas Rongen - whose highly disciplined approach featured prominently in the American Samoa focussed documentary Next Goal Wins - was instrumental in changing the team's mindset.
“Thomas Rongen's main thing was mentally preparing us so that every game we are thinking we are going to win. Normally we would think, ‘Oh, we are going into this tournament to play, lose and come back.' But he changed that. That was a very positive thing for us.
“We are starting to be threats in these qualifiers, so we are slowly coming up. For the future, we are heading upwards now. I hope we now play more games, and stay together.”

The U S is still stuck in a fiscal deadlock and no one is sure how it will end. However,Obama and House Republicans are in talks, an initial step that may prepare the path to end the standoff. Meanwhile, we bring you the last interaction of the Quick Chat series that featured the views and insights of entrepreneurs and start-up specialists. Today's chat is with, the founder and CEO of, an Indian start-up gone global.Here is one start-up that started as a blog, teaching people online for free. But in about 4 years, Bangalore-headquartered Simplilearn has become one of the biggest global players, offering 80-plus online certification courses across 11 categories and training 4,000 young professionals a month. The company was set up by former InfosysKrishna Kumar (he had earlier co-founded, which was acquired by a public listed company) back in 2009 and within 1 year, it was earning $100,000 a month. Simplilearn has also raised $10 million in a recent Series Bfromand existing investor(former).The US operations of this start-up happen to be huge – around 70% of its revenues come from the, with 15% from India and the remaining from Europe and Australia. So how does Kumar view the ongoingfrom the perspective of an Indian start-up?There's no immediate threat, he feels, but it will definitely affect the business in case there is a spending cut on training. But the shutdown also proves that policy paralysis can happen anywhere in the world and there is a chance now that the home turf would get more VC traction if the impasse continues. Here are the excerpts from our chat.Currently, the situation seems temporary and for this reason, we have not seen any impact. However, if the situation escalates and the shutdown is prolonged, we will definitely see effects. Once a negative sentiment settles in, there can be massive consequences.We are an individual re-skilling business that provides certification training courses to professionals. Because it's a consumer product focused on training, the shutdown has the potential to affect us if the country reduces its spending on training.In my opinion, I can't relate the shutdown to funding. Funding is a long-drawn process. Generally, cross-border funding takes places at the early stage of funding, not during the seed stage. So if there is any impact, it will be in the early stages.Yes, I think this is possible. The shutdown is a true testament to the fact that policy paralysis not only happens in India, but in the US as well. The longer it goes on, the greater the chance of VCs looking to India and other emerging markets.When you have a start-up, you do everything you can to survive. Frankly, as long as there are buyers in the US, start-ups will continue to focus their efforts on the US. Moreover, I think such factors impact larger organisations much more, rather than start-ups. In my opinion, private companies (start-ups) will not feel the heat as much.
Heavily armed robbers have stepped up their diabolic activities in Bo City, attacking several communities, wounding several people and looting several houses, a situation which has sent shock shivers right across the city where the Police officers have been put on red alert.
During an emergency press conference convened past Wednesday by the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Mustapha Kamara, to map out ways to nip the ugly development in the bud, all stakeholders that attended including the civil society lamented that the spate of armed robbery has become very alarming to the point that most residents of the city now spend sleepless nights for fear of the roving robbers who keep causing mayhem almost every night especially around the outskirts of the city.
AIG Kamara informed journalists, civil society and other stakeholders that from the 1st to the 7th February, 2015, there had been eight reported cases of armed robbery during which many people were wounded by machetes and other poisonous weapons wielded by the robbers, who now go house to house at night breaking into the dwellings of people and carting away huge sums of money and properties worth millions of Leones after inflicting injuries on their victims.

The AIG reported that on the 6th February, 2016, heavily armed robbers attacked one Sam Turay of Block 3, Old Railway Quarters and robbed him his mobile phone after wounding him on the neck, furthering that on the 6th February, robbers armed to the teeth raided the house of one Mrs Kadiatu Koroma at Simbaru 2 Section around Towama and robbed her five million Leones, beat her mercilessly and cut off her fingers after wounding her on her foot and forehead.
On the same night, the AIG went on, one Bobor Morsima of New York Section was attacked by armed robbers who robbed his mobile phone and wounded him severely, adding that on that same night, a lady called Hassanatu at Mattru Road was attacked by armed thieves who stole her computer and one million Leones while Ibrahim Barrie of 48 Mattru Road was also attacked, robbed and wounded.

AIG Kamara expressed disappointment over the fact that most of the perpetrators of the robbery are yet to be apprehended but said they have issued medical forms to all the victims who reported to the Police.
He noted that logistics constraints have been hampering their efforts to swiftly respond to crime but that frantic efforts are being made to address the problem, noting that the Police alone cannot combat crime unless they get overwhelming support from the various communities in the city.
