LIEGE, Belgium - Belgian investigators on Wednesday said an Islamic State-style attack that killed three people in the eastern city of Liege was being treated as an act of terrorism.
The bloodshed shocked the eastern industrial city of Liege on Tuesday when the attacker armed with a knife repeatedly stabbed two police officers before using their own firearms to kill them, a method investigators said was encouraged in online videos by the Islamic State extremist group.
Police were scrambling to unpick the motives of the attacker identified as Benjamin Herman, a 31-year-old drifter with a decade spent in and out of prison for acts of violence and petty crimes, who was out of jail on leave when they attacked.
“The facts are qualified as terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder,” prosecutors' spokesperson Eric Van Der Sypt told a news briefing in Brussels.
Van Der Sypt said the assessment was based on several “first elements” from the probe, including “the fact the perpetrator shouted several times shouted ‘Allahu akbar' ... and information from state security according to which the perpetrator was in touch with radicalised persons.”
But they cautioned that the information dated “from late 2016, early 2017” and had not been confirmed since.
Prosecutors also underlined that the attacker's method - attacking armed police officers and using their weapon against them - was a known “modus operandi” of the IS terror group, which claimed deadly attacks in Brussels in 2016. Amateur footage obtained by AFP showed the gunman shouting “Allahu akbar” (Arabic for “God is greatest”) as they walked through the Liege streets during the rampage.
In another video, the suspect darts out of a school where they had holed up into a short and intense burst of police gunfire, after which the man collapses to the ground.
But Interior Minister Jan Jambon urged caution over the extremist angle.
“There are signals that there was radicalisation in the prison but did this radicalisation lead to these actions? There too we can ask ourselves a lot of questions,” they told RTL radio.
Special attention is being given to the gruesome killing of an alleged heroin dealer linked to Herman who was bludgeoned to death with a hammer late Monday in a village near the Luxembourg border.
Investigators on Tuesday found the hammer in Herman's car and Jambon said police believed the Liege attacker carried out the killing just hours after getting temporary release from prison.
Prosecutors confirmed Herman was being investigated over the case, saying it was a separate investigation.
As well as the two police officers, the attacker also shot dead a 22-year-old student sitting in a parked car in central Liege. They then took a female cleaner hostage in the nearby Leonie de Waha school, a public institution with several hundred students aged from two to 18.
The two murdered police officers were identified as Lucile Garcia, 53, who had recently become a grandmother, and Soraya Belkacemi, 45, a mother to 13-year-old twins.
Debate in Belgium was swirling on the country's prison policy with reports that Herman had repeatedly blown the conditions of their temporary leave from jail ahead of their full release set for 2020.
“I feel responsible because I have responsibility for prisons,” Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens told RTBF radio.
Liege, a major city in Belgium's blighted industrial rustbelt, was the scene of another bloody shootout in 2011 when a recent convict killed six people and wounded more than 120 before turning the gun on himself.
Liege police on Tuesday said it was “clear that the assassin's objective was to attack the police” and that one of the four officers wounded had suffered a serious leg injury.
Prime Minister Charles Michel denounced what they called the “cowardly and blind violence” of Tuesday's attack.
Belgium has been on alert since authorities in January 2015 smashed a terror cell in the town of Verviers near Liege that was planning an attack on police.
The cell also had links to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the November 2015 Islamic State attacks on Paris that killed 130 people.
IS suicide attacks then targeted Brussels airport and a metro station, leaving 32 people dead in March 2016.
In August that same year, a machete-wielding man shouting “Allahu Akbar” attacked two police officers in the industrial town of Charleroi before being shot dead.

Humana Inc., one of the nation's largest health insurers, will stop selling Obamacare health plans next year, the company announced Tuesday. The move threatens to rattle jittery insurance markets and further complicate Republicans' push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
The company attributed its action to mounting losses caused by sicker-than-expected consumers. It is the first major insurer to pull back completely amid the mounting uncertainty over the GOP's still undefined healthcare plans, though other leading health plans have exited marketplaces over the last year, citing losses.
Humana's move will also probably mean that some 150,000 policyholders in 11 states where Humana sells Obamacare plans will have to switch carriers in 2018; some may be left without any alternative.
Humana, based in Louisville, Ky., is a relatively small player in the Obamacare marketplaces, which are expected to serve about 11 million people this year.
“They were never deeply committed to this market,” said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, noting that Humana's decision was not unexpected.
The company does not offer plans on Covered California, widely considered one of the most stable marketplaces in the country. And Humana's exit should not affect customers in most parts of the country.
But the company is a leading source of coverage in some regions, including Tennessee, which has one of the shakiest markets. The pullout will leave no insurer in 16 Tennessee counties in 2018, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which is tracking marketplace participation.
The marketplaces, a pillar of the healthcare law, allow Americans who do not get coverage through an employer to shop for plans that must meet basic standards. They cannot turn away patients who are sick. Low- and moderate-income consumers can qualify for government subsidies to offset the cost of their premiums.
There have been widespread concerns over the last year that the markets could collapse as insurers raised premiums sharply in the face of more costly than expected patients.
Many experts, including leading insurance industry officials, do not believe such a collapse is inevitable. And enrollment for 2017 appears to be holding relatively steady compared with last year.
But like other analysts, Kominski said Humana's decision “will introduce another degree of uncertainty.”
There were already signs Tuesday that it was contributing to the escalating partisan firestorm over the future of the 2010 healthcare law.
President Trump quickly cast Humana's exit as evidence the law is faltering, an argument they and other Republicans have been trying to make to bolster their struggling repeal campaign.
“Obamacare continues to fail. Humana to pull out in 2018. Will repeal, replace & save healthcare for ALL Americans,” Trump wrote in a tweet posted Tuesday evening.
Democrats countered that the Trump administration and its Republican allies on Capitol Hill were responsible for the rising instability in insurance markets.
“Congressional Republicans' reckless and irresponsible plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act is already taking healthcare away from the American people and causing confusion and instability in the insurance market,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “Anyone losing access to their insurance has only President Trump and congressional Republicans to blame.”
Humana Chief Executive Bruce Broussard in a conference call Tuesday with analysts said the company had made repeated changes to the policies it offered on the marketplaces — including raising the price of premiums — to try to make them a sustainable business.
The company, which is recovering from a failed merger with fellow insurance giant Aetna, had found new problems with the recent sign-ups for 2017, they said. That included having too many enrollees who are older and sicker and are expected to have high claims.
“We are again seeing signs of an unbalanced risk pool based on the results of the 2017 open enrollment period,” Broussard said. “Therefore we've decided that we can't continue to offer this coverage in 2018.”
Humana executives said they expected to lose an estimated $45 million on the policies offered on the exchanges in 11 states this year. In 2015, the company reported overall profit of nearly $1.3 billion.
Company officials said Tuesday that all customers who had signed up for a Humana policy for 2017 would have coverage the entire year.

Residents of one of Halifax's busiest downtown districts are calling on the city to help ease parking congestion by rolling out a “parking congestion campaign.”
“That [the campaign] will really help maybe take some pressure off of the downtown core,” said Joanne Corbett, an urban resident.
READ MORE: Halifax condo developer comes face-to-face with concerned Schmidtville residents
Corbett, along with many of their neighbours, said increased development has put added strain on the limited on-street parking spots in the area.
“It makes it a lot more difficult to find [parking] because when a building is being built, the surrounding right-of-way is often blocked off from pedestrians and vehicles,” said Christopher Breckenridge, another urban resident from the Schmidtville neighbourhood.
The city turned streets surrounding Schmidtville into “permit parking” last fall.
It's a move Corbett applauds the city for. They said it has made a huge difference in the ability residents have securing parking spots by their homes.
“People were house-bound because you had no place to park,” said Corbett, referencing the area before permit parking was implemented.
Corbett believes there are plenty of parking options in the downtown area but they aren't being utilized because the general public is uninformed as to where they are.
“They [the city] should have an awareness strategy letting people know where the underground lots are, how much they are per hour, which merchants give free passes,” they said.

While concerns have been raised in regards to new bike lanes taking away from available on-street spots, cycling advocate Eliza Jackson said increased cycling infrastructure will help alleviate parking pressures.
“For the people that do have the ability to walk and cycle, they're more encouraged to do so, leaving the spots that are more available for the people who actually need it,” Jackson said.
Jackson adds that increased sustainable transportation helps ease the movement of traffic through cities.
“I think there's this kind of idea that it's sort of “bikes versus cars,” but really it's about providing more options to people to get around,” they said.

Perhaps more than any musician, Prince was synonymous with a particular color. Ever since the release of their landmark 1984 album/film Purple Rain, the musician visualized their career in the color purple, with their outfits and instruments frequently shaded as such. Now, the Pantone Color Institute has announced the creation of a specific hue of purple in honor of the late musician.
The custom color, represented by Prince's “Love Symbol #2”, was inspired by their custom-made Yamaha purple piano, which was originally scheduled to go on tour with the performer before their passing, according to a press release. “While the spectrum of the color purple will still be used in respect to the “Purple One,” Love Symbol #2, will be the official color across the brand they left behind.”
(Read: Niagara Falls Turned Purple the Day of Prince's Death)
Laurie Pressman, Vice President of the Pantone Color Institute said in a statement, “We are honored to have worked on the development of Love Symbol #2, a distinctive new purple shade created in memory of Prince, ‘the purple one.' A musical icon known for their artistic brilliance, Love Symbol #2 is emblematic of Prince's distinctive style. Long associated with the purple family, Love Symbol #2 enables Prince's unique purple shade to be consistently replicated and maintain the same iconic status as the man himself.”
Take a look at the new color below:
The NFL's exclusive fifth-year option party rolls on.
The Dolphins on Tuesday became the latest team to join the fray, exercising DeVante Parker's fifth-year team option. Worth roughly $9.5 million, the move keeps Miami's 25-year-old wideout under contract through 2019.
The Dolphins obviously see promise in Parker -- the 14th overall pick from 2015 -- despite the receiver failing to top 750 yards in any of their three pro seasons. If Parker fails to break out in 2018, Miami could bypass their fifth-year option, which is guaranteed for injury alone.
At 6-foot-3 and 212 pounds, Parker has shown on-field flashes. They opened strong last season, with 18 catches over their first three starts. From there, they never topped six grabs in a game and finished the campaign with just one score.
With the Dolphins in play to draft a quarterback, Miami's offense has the potential to look entirely different. It makes sense to keep Parker under team control until they know for certain what they can become.

President Trump tweeted Monday morning that he'd be returning to Washington with "much work to do."
Trump also tweeted their endorsement of Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who was appointed in February to temporarily fill the seat held by Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions and now faces a special primary election next week to try to win the office outright.
The president flew into New York on Sunday evening. They have suggested they will address the media while there.
Trump also signaled their support of Strange last week in a tweet. The senator faces a slew of challengers in what's expected to be a tight race, including former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, state Sen. Trip Pittman and Christian Coalition leader Randy Brinson.
Absent from the morning tweets was further mention of the weekend's deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va.
On Saturday, a car driven by a man participating in a white supremacist rally plowed into a crowd, killing Heather Heyer, who was among the counter-protesters.
Also Saturday, a state police helicopter monitoring the protests crashed, causing two deaths.
Criticism from Democrats and Republicans has poured in concerning the president's failure to explicitly condemn white supremacist groups in connection with the violence. In their statement, Trump blamed the violence "on many sides."
Citizens and advocacy groups expressed outrage as well, attributing the president's omission to a reluctance to alienate those in their base sympathetic to the hate groups.
In the face of mounting criticism, the president's national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, said Sunday that Trump would have more to say on the subject.
“I'm sure you will hear from the president more about this,” they said on NBC's “Meet the Press.”
Claude Julien, former head coach of the Boston Bruins, has been appointed to the Montreal Canadiens. Here's what some Montrealers had to say about it.
A federal judge ruled Tuesday against the Trump administration‘s decision to end a program protecting some young immigrants from deportation, calling the Department of Homeland Security‘s rationale against the program “arbitrary and capricious.”
U.S. District Judge John D. Bates in Washington wrote that the decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, “was unlawful and must be set aside.”

Bates wrote that DHS' decision “was predicated primarily on its legal judgment that the program was unlawful. That legal judgment was virtually unexplained, however, and so it cannot support the agency's decision.”
WATCH: DACA not about the ‘Dreamers' says Trump in speech to GOP
Bates gave DHS 90 days to “better explain its view that DACA is unlawful.” If the department cannot come up with a better explanation, they wrote, it “must accept and process new as well as renewal DACA applications.”

DACA allowed immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, known as Dreamers, to stay and work legally under renewable permits. President Donald Trump announced last year that they would end the program started by President Barack Obama. It was officially rescinded in March, but DHS is continuing to issue renewals because of previous court orders.
Bates' ruling Tuesday night comes in a pair of cases whose lead plaintiffs are the NAACP and Princeton University.  They are the third judge to rule against administration plans to end the program.

If you missed Collider's recent IMAX screening of Rian Johnson‘s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, followed by an extensive Q&A with Johnson himself, not to worry because we'll be rolling out highlights for you to enjoy. Today's video segment addresses Johnson's writing process for the script, in which they talk about characters that gave them a particularly hard time. We also found out that a very different arc for one of those characters existed in a very early draft, but that was changed for the best of the movie overall.
Here's what Johnson had to say about just which character was the hardest to write for:
Hardest to write for, honestly, just in terms of figuring out what their story was going to be been Poe … Luke was obviously the hardest overall, but besides Luke, Poe was the trickiest … Poe is such a clear-cut, simple character in [Episode VII] because he's Oscar Isaac and he's the most charismatic man in the universe and he's just rad. Honestly, I actually wrote, in the very first draft I wrote of it, Poe went with Finn on the mission to Canto Bight, and the two of them were going to be together on the mission. And it didn't work at all because those two get along so well and it'd be really boring.
No one wants a boring movie, so how did Johnson fix that?
So when I split them apart, I thought “Oh, okay, so Poe can have their own deal … What is Poe's deal?” And then I came up with the thing of, “Okay, he's a hero, but they have to become a leader. Leia needs them to mature beyond brash heroics into someone who can take on the mantle of leading this Resistance.”
There you have it! And for more from our conversation with Johnson, be sure to check out these videos:

Steve Zimmer is about to lose their seat on the Los Angeles school board, but they pulled off an 11th-hour political triumph by engineering a contract extension for Supt. Michelle King.
The move means that the new school board, the first with a majority supported by charter school backers, will inherit a longer commitment to King, whose performance as superintendent has received mixed reviews.
The new charter-friendly majority came after the most expensive school board election in U.S. history. Charter supporters saw the election as a way to make fundamental changes in the Los Angeles Unified School District, which already has more charters than any other district.
But a debate has long raged about whether the explosive growth of charter schools does long-term harm to the traditional school system and students who remain in it.
Critics say the decision on future leadership of L.A. Unified should have been left to the newly reconstituted board, which takes charge in July. Supporters of the action call it a reward for a job well done that will ensure needed stability in the nation's second-largest school system.
The board's action, by a 6-1 vote, extended King's contract two years, until the end of June 2020.
King's extension comes after a bitter campaign face-off with backers of charter schools on one side and allies of the teachers union on the other.
When the mudslinging and vote counting ended, charter-friendly political newcomers Nick Melvoin and Kelly Gonez were victors.
But before they could take office, the current board majority, which has concerns about unlimited charter growth, had one or two last chances to get things done. The most daring move Tuesday was King's contract extension.
The internal debate took place in a closed session that began at 9 a.m. and ran until nearly 3 p.m., delaying the start of the regular public meeting by two hours. King's future was far from the only topic — the board also discussed hires and lawsuits. Board members eventually emerged in public, but they withheld the announcement about King until 11 p.m., after the regular meeting ended.
King expressed gratitude for the board's action in a statement Tuesday but left the board meeting without taking questions from reporters.
The prolonged sessions dampened what was supposed to be an important public hearing on the $7.5-billion budget, which is scheduled for a vote next week. Even though the district faces critical questions over its solvency, the board never truly uncorked that topic. And most public speakers had given up and gone home by 10:30 p.m., when the board belatedly asked for input, hours after the scheduled time.
To some degree, King's extension is symbolic. Them contract guarantees only a 90-day severance. It also sets a maximum severance of one year of pay or the remainder of their contract, whichever is less. King's salary is $350,000 per year.
But the deal was fully intended to bind the new board to King, according to a district insider who was not authorized to speak on the record.
“When you know you will not have control, you stop others from making their moves quickly,” the source said. “We know what we have. What will we get if they do a buyout and bring in their own person?”
The board still could make such a change, the source said, “but the argument has to be stronger.”
There's precedent for an outgoing board to extend a superintendent's contract, but it didn't end well. In 1999, the board extended the contract of Supt. Ruben Zacarias. Then three new board members joined the seven-member body. The new majority replaced Zacarias within months and had to pay a larger buyout because of the extension.
The new majority in that case justified its action by saying Zacarias was unable to handle a crisis in the school construction program. A crisis — real, perceived or manufactured — is a handy tool in such situations.
In 2006, a differently configured board acted quickly to limit the options of successors. Board members at that time worried that L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was about to take control of the school system. They wanted to put a superintendent in place before they could choose their own person. The political uncertainty limited the field of applicants and may have rushed the process.
Retired Navy Vice Adm. David Brewer got the job, and Villaraigosa never obtained direct control — but they helped elect board members who, two years later, successfully pushed to buy out Brewer's contract.
As in many large urban school systems, churn at the top is pretty much constant, exacerbating problems, said David Rattray, executive vice president of the L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce.
“Each time you get a new superintendent, there's just this tremendous turmoil that is generated for one or two years,” Rattray said. “The superintendent of such a large district starts becoming more impactful in their second, third and fourth year. That's when they start to develop their momentum.”
Still, critics — including Melvoin, who replaces Zimmer in July — said the decision was the new board's to make.
“I was surprised they didn't defer any action on contracts,” Melvoin said. “It's something I do think we'll revisit given the incoming board's charge to evaluate the superintendent.”
Gonez declined to comment. Both they and Melvoin said they've had positive meetings with King since the May election.
The California Charter Schools Assn., however, did not mince words.
“Yesterday's vote was clearly a power play by the outgoing board, led by Steve Zimmer, to tie the hands of new board members mere days before they take office,” the group said. The association, while it did not criticize King, said the board's action underscored the need for new leadership.
Charters are privately operated public schools. Most are nonunion. Under California law, the school district is required to authorize charter schools. But charter growth has exacerbated district financial strains because most education funding follows the student.
Concern over the budget motivated outgoing board member Monica Ratliff to support the extension. They spoke of “the need to have a calm environment as we go into these difficult budget times.”
Board member Monica Garcia, who cast the lone “no” vote, expressed “confidence” in King in a statement Tuesday but added, “it is my view that they are best affirmed by that new board.”

The Chargers missed Keenan Allen so much in 2016, they spent their first-round pick on a receiver.
Turns out, all they needed was some time.
A year after playing in just one game, Allen's journey to redemption received its topper when they were named the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year on Saturday at the seventh-annual NFL Honors.
Allen rebounded from a six-catch, 63-yard 2016 season that ended with a torn ACL by catching 102 passes for 1,393 yards and six touchdowns in 2017. They made history within their return, becoming the first player in league history to record three straight games of at least 10 receptions, 100 receiving yards and one touchdown.
"Honestly, I think we have always wanted to push them the football," Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers said after Allen completed the feat with a 10-catch, 105-yard, one-touchdown game against the Cleveland Browns. "Now, will they be able to keep this pace? It obviously has been a streak that has never been done ... I am one of those that really just wants to stay in the moment and enjoy [this streak]."
They didn't keep the pace, but they did log a nine-catch, 133-yard, one-touchdown game in a Week 17 win over the Oakland Raiders, a game Los Angeles needed to win to get into the playoffs. The Chargers didn't get the help they needed to complete an unlikely run to the postseason, but Allen did more than theirs share.
Allen's return to the Chargers provided a big-play, field-stretching element missing from the team in the previous season. It showed in the offense's production, with Rivers seeing a 2.2 percentage point increase in their completion rate, lopping 11 interceptions off their total and taking half as many sacks as the year prior. They also posted their best passer rating since the 2013 season.
Allen's contributions landed them back in the consciousness of the league. The bounce-back campaign definitely boosted their confidence.
"I do know, I'm probably the best," Allen said when appearing on Fox Sports 1's Undisputed. "I am the best in the league. No question. I can do what those guys do. What they're doing, I'm doing it. No question about it."
A year after spending the season on the sideline, watching their quarterback throw the most interceptions of their career as the Chargers limped to a 5-11 record, Allen is back at the center of the franchise's future. That's the brightest ray of sunshine Bolts fans will find in Southern California.

Donald Trump, left, actor Arianne Zucker, and Billy Bush, then an "Access Hollywood" host, are seen in an image from a 2005 recording.
As Hollywood continues to react to a report detailing decades of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Washington, D.C., is getting a 12-hour public screening of the president's lecherous “Access Hollywood” video.
The demonstration being held on the National Mall is organized by UltraViolet, a women's advocacy group, to commemorate the almost one-year anniversary of the hot-mic tape's release by the Washington Post.
“The ‘Access Hollywood' video was a disgusting display of Trump's true colors. It was not so-called ‘locker room talk,' it was a man bragging about sexually assaulting women. That man may now sit in the Oval Office, but we will not let them — or anyone else — forget the tape or those comments,” Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of UltraViolet, said in a statement released Thursday.
“Following the release of this footage, numerous women came forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault, and we have only seen this boorish behavior continue since taking office. The Donald Trump on that tape is the same Donald Trump that sits in the Oval Office every day, aggressively pursuing an anti-woman agenda, including the active dismantling of legal protections for survivors of sexual assault. That is why we are showing the video on loop in D.C., and that is why it is all the more important that we stand up and ‘grab back,' ” Thomas concluded.
UltraViolet's protest Friday took place at the same time as the Trump administration's rollback of Obama-era legislation that forced employers to provide women with contraceptives at no cost as part of their health plans.
In addition to the “Access Hollywood” perpetual screening from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern time, UltraViolet also held a “Rally to Grab Back” at noon in D.C.'s Lafayette Square. The group was joined by Planned Parenthood, Working Families and NARAL to continue to lobby for women's rights.
Emergency crews have transported 10 people with minor to moderate injuries and seven others are being treated at the scene, they said.

Whitley County EMS received 85 free doses of Narcan Friday afternoon courtesy of the Whitley County Health Department and the Corbin Independent Schools District.
The drug is used to reverse the effects of overdose when a victim quits breathing.
“It is really expensive. Hopefully this will save them a little bit of money,” Whitley County Health DepartmentPublic Health Director Martha Steele said about the ambulance service.
The grant that funded the donation is through the Bell Knox Whitley Board of the Kentucky Agency for Substance Abuse Policy.
The Corbin school district, which has two employees that serve on the local board, is serving as the fiscal agent for the grant.
Since Bell County didn't have its syringe exchange ready to start by the grant deadline, Knox and Whitley County applied for and split the $20,000 grant.
Whitley County is using its $10,000 share of the grant for educational purposes, rapid Hepatitis C testing kits, and Narcan for the ambulance service.
Kayla Smith-Henderson, a grant writer for the Corbin Independent Schools District, who wrote the grant for this project, said they would love for school resource officers and family resource center coordinators to have access to Narcan for when they do home visits.
“They may walk in on something where a parent has overdosed or something like that,” they noted.
The health department paid $5,350.75 for the 85 doses of Narcan that it donated to Whitley County EMS.
Formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by El Salvador refugees and more recently expanded in Central America, the group is indeed linked to a high number of homicides in certain parts of the U.S. Even so, an FBI report put the group well behind other gangs for crimes on the Southwest border — seventh of 12 — with the Surenos, Barrio Azteca and Tango Blast ranked in the top three.
When you need to shoot a scene in a local bait and tackle shop on a small island off the Carolinas and you're location-scouting the perfect spot and the owner is a total ham with the right twang… do you really want to cast a professional actor to replace them and play the shopkeeper in the scene?
Nah. You say, “Hey, Buddy,” because that's their name. “How 'bout you be in our movie?”
“Really?” Their voice rises with excitement. “Why, sure I will! My ole lady always said one day I'd be in pictures!”
Buddy plays Buddy perfectly. They stumble over their words like real people do and drops their props and misses their marks. But these mistakes seem on purpose and those lines they mangle sound so much better their way. It's almost like you're watching a documentary unfold, and that's exactly what you had hoped for and why you were willing to risk it.
To work with non-actors is to say, “OK, Lord, we are in your hands now.” The very honest results acted as anchors in our otherwise dreamy movie. Their charming realism helped us to shore up the decks of our fantasy.
When I saw Steven Soderbergh's Bubble I had my filmmaking mind blown. The idea of working with a local community as the cast of the film dovetailed wonderfully with my own discovery of the “non-actor” while working on my student films as a grad film student at New York University. I moved to New York City from rural North Carolina, where I loved to go crayfish hunting. Turning over stones searching for crayfish in the cool creeks on hot summer days was one of my favorite childhood activities. When I first moved to Manhattan I was awestruck by the streaming streets and it wasn't long before I was searching them for talent for my projects. I had gotten it in my head that the best way to find my actors was to literally go out and find them. Discovery was too much fun to leave to others to try to do it for me. This side-hustle turned into a business when my partner Drew Dasent came on board and formed our casting company, The Secret Gallery. Rooted in “street scouting,” The Secret Gallery now focuses on the fashion industry, creating distinctive model castings for an international clientele. We search agencies the world over but still take it to the streets when we need to.
My whole life I have been an artist. At an early age I was particularly proud of my portrait works. I loved the thrill of studying someone's face: understanding it as a landscape, how it pinched and dipped. What it told me when it was quiet. Every face has its own beauty if you know how to look. As a filmmaker, casting is a chance to make art. To fully explore a character as one would in a portrait but then some. It's also not just about the outcome for me; it's about the people's lives I am affecting by making the film. I want to truly collaborate and weave together our real selves into the fabric of the fiction.
New and non-actors don't put up a lot of walls and barriers in their performances. I like to say, “Do this the way you would do it.” This technique yielded the most fantastic results in my new film, Moss. Our young star, first-timer Mitchell Slaggert, plays the titular character. We started the film with them shaving their head in the first scene. It was a symbolic gesture for Mitch—now they were becoming this character, Moss. Their instincts took over from that moment on and their performance was pure and raw and fascinating. They would do things that just floored me, such as making a PB&J sandwich in the most kooky, cinematic way. I could have never ever thought something like that up. I went into the scene just thinking we'd get a good insert and came out with gold!
The story of how I met Mitch is a good one. I was at the Cucalorus Film Festival in Wilmington, NC with Sunset Edge, my first narrative. My nephew, Jacob Ingle, was one of the stars of that film and they happened to be going to the local Cape Fear Community College. They were taking me on a quick tour of the campus. Out of the corner of my eye I see this good-looking guy pass me leaving class. A few blocks later, I get this overwhelming sense. It was like the universe tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Hurry! Go get that guy!” So I turned around and ran back. They were already in their car pulling off when I banged on their window. They rolled it down just enough for me to slip them my card… it all happened so quickly. I guess they Googled me and the next day called and we met up. They let me take some pictures and I had them do a “runway” walk on video in an alley. I kept thinking, this guy's got something special.
I sent the shots off to an agent friend and within a few weeks, Mitch was debuting for Calvin Klein as an exclusive model for their men's show in Milan. This was their first trip abroad, a baptismal by fire into the crazy world of fashion. I was a bit worried if he'd clam up and look like a deer in headlights. My fears were allayed, however, a few days later when I see Mitch on Donatella Versace's personal Instagram in nothing but their Calvins, dancing in the middle of the street, grinning ear to ear. Seems they might be a natural performer after all…
Discovery is a thrilling process. It's not just about me finding talent, it's about that person discovering something inside they didn't know they had. When I found Jennifer Lawrence years ago, they were only 14 and on vacation in New York City with their mom. They looked straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting, shiny and freckled. I took their Polaroids right there in Union Square and cast them in their first job in front of a camera a few weeks later. They flew back to do the job and after the shoot, their mother called me and said, “Jennifer loved it! They think she's found their passion!” Maybe I saw something in their baby face that they didn't know yet was there. Maybe me seeing it helped them see it.
All the agencies I sent them to said, “No, thank you.” I remember trying to convince them otherwise: “She's got something special, I'm telling you!” But Jennifer didn't need me or anyone else anymore, they had found that gift now and it was just a matter of time before she'd share it with the world.
When Mitch got back from Milan I asked them if they had ever considered acting. “No sir,” they said “but I sure would like to try it!” Their first cold reading sent a chill up my spine. I stopped them after page one. “How about we make a film together, Mitch? We'll go back down to North Carolina and do something to get your feet wet?” “Yes, sir, let's do it!”
Little did either of us know exactly how wet Mitch's feet would be getting. Twenty-five days knee deep in swamps, marshlands, the freezing ocean and the moody Cape Fear River was a transformative experience I'm sure they will never forget. Mitch started as a novice and finished as a pro. (He also made an excellent grip and took orders like a marine.) When I screened footage for Mitch months later, they had started acting school, hired a coach and already shot two other films and a miniseries. Just before the room went dark they said, “Damn, I could probably do it so much better now.” This was proof for me Mitch will have a solid career. Here was a young man with bragging rights well earned, yet they were having that self-doubt that fuels an artist to perfect their craft. When the lights went up, I could tell Mitch was overwhelmed with emotion. They just said, “I did good, didn't I?”
To me Moss is a beautiful document of an actor coming of age—an unencumbered and uninhibited performance. Mitch never questioned their instincts and I made them promise me they would not lose this trust in their gut. Surely they will face a cacophony of direction, feedback and “grooming” on their way to becoming a working actor. But it's this quiet inner voice that will always be their best director.
I have plenty more tales from casting newcomers for Moss: from the incredible Billy Ray Suggs who plays Moss's dad (cast from Instagram) and is Mitch's actual childhood mentor; to Dorian Cobb as Blaze, whom I found in Brooklyn when they were just a kid and whose been modeling and acting ever since. But I think the key decision I made was to choose an actual professional actor for the romantic lead of Mary. I met Christine Marzano over a decade ago when they were a student at Princeton through their model boyfriend whom I had discovered. I helped them get their first agent in L.A. when they moved there to take up acting as a full-time profession. It had been years since we had seen each other but their unforgettable manners, striking beauty and lanky body kept popping into my head when I was writing the script. I wanted a strong woman who could take this strapping 6'2” man on a journey. Christine had the presence and chutzpah—a certain power. They were my muse for the role. When they agreed to take it on, I knew the casting family was complete.
Christine flew in on break from a big-budget film shooting in Bulgaria. As fate would have it, the one week they had off was the week we needed them I am not sure what they imagined they were getting themselves into, but when they arrived to our scrappy crew holed up in the backwoods of an overgrown island, they said, “I cannot go back covered in bug bites.” I just gulped. Alas, their only interior scene was in a tent! They proved to be a trouper and never complained about running around the chilly woods in nothing but a slip-dress. And their nuanced performance really raised the bar for all the newbies on deck. They kind of whipped the cast into shape through osmosis. Suddenly between takes everyone was studying their lines and not on their phones. Mitch especially was asking them lots of questions and Christine was so generous with advice and patient with the results. In the film, Mary takes Moss's virginity. In real life Christine definitely helped Mitch over a kind of threshold. As fun as it is to see what the inexperienced will do with a scene, sometimes you don't have time for experimenting. You need a pro to come in and get the job done. When Christine left, everyone's game was more on point. We also had to restock our bug repellent!
My first two films, The Aggressives, and Trail Angels, were documentary features and I met both sets of subjects through my casting journeys. I learned working with these subjects that, subtly, you could direct them and I also developed a penchant for the unpredictable. On my third feature documentary, Garden of the Peaceful Dragon, the incredible subject, Burley Luvell Benford, seemed to have been rehearsing their whole life for this film. They would often ask if they could “say that again.” I started to realize that this whole business of truth vs. fiction is not quite as clear as one imagines. There is a bewitching limen between the two, and in my narrative films I try to explore this sketchy terrain.
What this requires is faith. Just like I told Mitch, I remind myself too: Always trust my instinct. You have to stay open, remain flexible and strive to collaborate with accident. Back at NYU, my peers would ask me why I was using real people in my films. I would say, “Why would I use fake people?” What I look for is talent—people who can engage you, draw you in and tell you a story you want to listen to. Maybe it's a seasoned award-winning pro and maybe it's the owner of the local bait and tackle shop. Or maybe it's your nephew or their fellow student at a community college.
A few weeks ago, I went to visit Buddy in the old bait and tackle shop and get their real name for the credits of Moss. Their sassy wife was there too. “He thinks he's a movie star now,” they quipped. “He waited their whole life for that dang camera.” We reminisced about the crazy experience and I almost forgot why I came.
“So what's your real name anyway, Buddy?”
“Erby Dalmus Burton III,” they tell me.
“The Third? Geez, is your son the Fourth?”
“Oh no!” their wife pipes up. “Three of them was enough.” MM

A Bristol woman who has worked as a "grid girl" for Formula 1 and ring girl at boxing matches has called the decision to drop them from F1 "crazy".
The debate around the appropriateness and relevance of scantily-clad women at sporting events in an age of supposed gender equality has been raging since Formula 1 bosses followed the Professional Darts Corporation's axing of their 'walk-on girls' a week before, in an attempt to make the sport more "compatible" with family viewing.
Some players and women who work in the roles have hit out at the move, even setting up petitions to have the decision overturned.
Among those protesting is Isabella Worlock, from Withywood, who wants to prevent other sporting associations from following suit.
In an interview with the Bristol Post, the 'grid girl' called it "crazy", and saying it is putting women like them out of a job.
"I am more than a little upset to hear the news that Formula 1 will no longer be allowing grid girls, the world has gone mad," said Isabella, who has worked at the Monaco Grand Prix in the past.
"And I've been hearing that they could potentially ban ring girls as well," said added. "It is putting us out of a job and a hobby that we completely enjoy."
Boxing promoter and Matchroom chief Eddie Hearn has told fans that the boxing industry has no plans to follow in the footsteps of darts or F1 racing in banning their 'ring-card girls'.
However, many have felt the need to speak up in defence of the practice, including model Kelly Brook, despite arguments that it is sexist and perpetuates the objectification of women.
Isabella said they had made a career out of modelling at various sporting and hospitality events since the age of 17 and now, at the age of 21, believes the sports industry is heading in the wrong direction.
“It has been tradition for years and years,” they said. “It just seems like we are going backward in time, it's like women can't be looked at and appreciated anymore."
Isabella said that, in their experience, women in their industry enjoy their job and are well looked-after, well respected and are given life-changing opportunities.

“This empowers girls - they love it, they love the cameras and people asking for photos," they said.
“Women have always been looked at as sexual icons and I don't see what is bad about that, that's just my opinion.
“A lot of feminists will completely disagree but we are females and it has always been the case.
"Just because women are showing a bit of belly, leg or cleavage I don't think that's a big deal, it just comes with the job."
Some of the debate after the F1 and darts bans has centred on whether the move takes away a woman's right to do and work as they please.
Isabella still works doing a variety of modelling jobs and hospitality in Bristol and around the world but said they are more and more often coming up against people who view their role negatively.
“I was working at Ashton Gate on the weekend just doing hospitality and holding the doors open for guests. One man stopped me and said 'why are you doing that, are you happy?' I said, of course I'm happy.
"I have made life-long friends doing what I do," they said. "People just wouldn't want to see a man holding a door."
"It's going to come to the point where men can't even wolf-whistle without people going crazy."
Officials at Travis Air Force Base in California have advised people there to "shelter in place" during a "real world security incident," according to official social media posts issued on Wednesday afternoon."Travis Air Force Base is currently responding to a real world security incident," a post on the base's Facebook page said. "More details will be released as they become available. The public is being asked to stay away from the base to ensure emergency responders can respond accordingly."
The air base is near Fairfield, about 50 miles northeast of San Francisco.The base's official Twitter account advised people there to lock their doors and windows and await further information.
The information was posted on the sites about 3:30 p.m. local time.
A reporter on the NBC affiliate in the San Francisco Bay Area said in a helicopter above the base that people were evacuated in an orderly manner from the base exchange, a shopping centre for military members and their families, before 4 p.m.Traffic on a road by the base entrance gate was at a standstill and air traffic appeared to be limited, the NBC reporter said.

From the WWE Rumor Mill: WWE is considering holding WrestleMania in the UK
Get ready Britain, WrestleMania could be coming.
@HJKettle by Harry Kettle News 14 Jun 2017, 19:30 IST
Wembley would most likely be the venue
What's the story?
As reported by The Independent, World Wrestling Entertainment appears to finally be considering London as a host city for their flagship event, WrestleMania. This news comes just a few months after the company held the 33rd edition of the showcase of the immortals in Orlando.
In case you didn't know...
British fans have been desperate to see the company bring WrestleMania over to the United Kingdom for years now, with the last few years giving them more and more hope that their dream could become a reality.
The last major pay-per-view event that they held in England was SummerSlam 1992, which drew more than 80,000 fans to the old Wembley Stadium.
The heart of the matter
Joshua-Klitschko gave us an idea of what Mania could look like
Over the last week or so, WWE have sent out surveys to fans who attended WrestleMania 33 this past year at the Citrus Bowl. They queried fans as to the cities they'd be interested in seeing host a Mania in the future, with London being featured on the list.
Other cities involved included Toronto and New York, both of which have hosted multiple editions of the event.
What's next?
With New Orleans having already been confirmed for 34 we'll have to wait until January 2018 to see if London's wait for a Mania finally comes to an end, and given WWE's involvement in the UK scene these days it seems much more likely than it has done ever before.
A few of the other potential locations for 35 include Toronto, Minneapolis and Atlanta.
Author's take
As a Brit, it fills me with an overwhelming sense of joy that the great city of London is being considered when it comes to hosting WrestleMania. However, one potential issue with this could be that American and Canadian fans won't want to travel so far in order to attend the biggest show of the year.
Either way, time will tell.
Major work on overhauling one of Montreal's most historic parks began earlier this month — and it will take all summer and most of the fall to complete.
Contractors are revamping the northern section of the Dorchester Square Park in the heart of downtown.
It's an $8.9-million project that is promising to modernize the area while being more environmentally friendly and reflect the park's rich history.

A new Victorian-style cast iron fountain and two pedestrian footbridges are part of the plan.
More grass will be planted and the road linking Peel Street and Metcalfe Street will be narrowed to one lane.
“You will also find on the north side of the park the same aesthetics that you have actually south park,” Philippe Sabourin, a city spokesperson, told Global News.
But the ongoing construction is taking its toll on people trying to get around the around.
Tour bus operators are running out of places to park and often double park on Peel Street.

A pedestrian pass-way on the east side of Peel street is often closed. Drivers also frequently get stuck in traffic — waiting for long periods before moving forward.
“It's not fun at all,” one driver told Global News from inside a car.
The work is expected to last until November.
A terminal at the Port of Charleston in South Carolina will reopen and the safety zone has been lifted, the U.S. Coast Guard said on Thursday, after investigating a threat of a "dirty bomb" on a container ship.
It said the "original reporting source of the threat" had been detained for questioning.
Law enforcement agents scanned four containers aboard the Maersk Memphis ship in the Wando Terminal after reports of a "potential threat" on Wednesday, the Coast Guard said.
Maersk Line, the world's biggest container shipping company, said the U.S. Coast Guard had informed it of a threat of a dirty bomb aboard one of its vessels. It said all crew members were safe and ashore.
"Unified Command determines no existing threat to the port. Terminal will reopen and safety zone has been lifted," the U.S. Coast Guard said on Twitter.
The Maersk Memphis, a 300-meter vessel, arrived in South Carolina from New York at about 7:30 p.m, according to Reuters data. About half an hour later, authorities were made aware of the potential threat and evacuated the terminal, the Coast Guard said.
Hartlepool MP Mike Hill says town rail passengers should not be treated like second class citizens after Government criticism of a local operator.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has ordered Northern, which runs rail services across the north of England including the North East, to use “whatever resources they need” to improve after a new timetable saw widespread cancellations and disruptions, especially in the North West.
Mr Grayling said the scale of the problems, also experienced by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) services, has far outstripped expectation.
The failure to deliver electrification of the line between Bolton and Preston in time for the new timetable on May 20 had delayed the introduction of new electric trains meaning there is a shortage of trains to cover planned increases in services.
Northern told the Mail last week that was having a knock on effect on capacity issues on other parts of the franchise such as Hartlepool.
Mr Hill said: “Having pressed hard for Northern Rail to improve its services in and out of Hartlepool, including increasing running times, the number of carriages per train and replacing the obsolete Pacers I was disappointed to find out that some things, like the replacement of rolling stock are literally being held up because of the company's failures in other regions like the North West and Merseyside.”
They added: “In all honesty if the Mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool can shout out about the poor performance of the operator and get the Government's attention then I hope the Tory Tees Valley Mayor, Ben Houchen, can join me in saying we will not be treated like second class citizens here in Hartlepool and the Tees Valley and be the consequential victim of any under-performance of Northern Rail in other areas; we are after all supposed to be part of the Northern Powerhouse collectively with areas like the North West.
“Northern Rail is beginning to look like a busted flush, just like Virgin and Stagecoach on the East Coast Mainline and re-nationalisation of that franchise is looking like the only sensible and correct outcome.”
Northern and Network Rail has announced they will be commissioning an independent report and recommendations into processes leading up to the implementation of the timetable change.
It said the timetable change, the biggest in decades, is designed to boost capacity and services in the long-term.
It is unfortunate that on social media and because of President Trump and their supporters, a culture of intolerance has grown so strong in our country, but ABC has shown that there are ways to fight back against this incredibly bad behavior. Jarrett's response was right on the money: They pointed out that demeaning acts like this are now happening many times a day to people all over our country and never reported.

Channel 4's super slimmer has revealed the new diet that helped them shed eight stone and transform from fat to fit.
Daniel Wheeler, 32, star of Super Slimmers , claims the 80/20 diet they devised helped them lose weight and they now believe that plan could help others too.
Their 80/20 diet is based on counting calories 80% of the time and eating 'whatever you like' for the rest of it.
The celebrity fitness guru said that allowing a little of what you like increases the chances of people sticking to their diet so they can drop weight quickly and sustainably.
Daniel once weighed 22st and medics said they were 'severely obese' but they turned their life around and is now a fitness guru, even featuring on the front of Men's Health magazine and Channel 4.
And their recent star turn on Super Slimmers has proved to be a more positive brush with the bright lights of television than their encounter with ITV's Loose Women was in 2016.
They accused the show of 'treating them like and piece of meat' after they were dropped for refusing to take their top off.

They were invited to appear on the show to talk about how they lost eight stone in two years and set up their personal training business.
But they said producers wanted a topless catwalk turn and when they refused they axed him.
“They asked if they could film me working out topless and I said no. Then they emailed and said I had been dropped.
"I felt objectified as a man. It's double standards – can you imagine if it was Top Gear and Katie Price was dropped for refusing to take their top off?

But now, Daniel, from Surrey, has launched their new diet and promises remarkable results for anyone willing to sign up to the 'lifestyle plan' online .
Daniel stressed that changing people's mindsets was key to successfully battling the bulge.
They promote moderation and says that 'nothing is ever restricted'.
The personal trainer said that before their transformation from fat to fit they would binge on carrier bags of sweets and eat takeaways every night.
They tried to diet never found one they could stick to.

Then one day in the shower they noticed that they could no longer see their feet and decided to focus entirely on getting healthy and fit.
They quit their job in marketing, trained as a personal trainer and studied nutrition.
They have now launched their 80:20 diet which they say was fundamental to their weight-loss success.
This diet involves eating healthy, calorie-tracked meals 80% of the time, and eating whatever you like 20% of the time, reports Mail Online .
No food is banned because if you can still eat a little of your favourite food you are more likely to stick to your diet the rest of the time.
(Image: Internet Unknown)
And the result of this is that you can drop a lot of weight in 16 weeks because you've stuck to it, they said.
They believe their diet plan could be the new 5:2. - a diet which has proved popular recently which dictates that you eat healthy food for the week but you can break out and have treats at the weekend.
After signing up to the plan online at the8020lifestyleplan.com , people pay £25 a month for four months (plus a £25 sign-up fee) to access the programme.
Clients then have an initial consultation with Daniel about their weight loss goals and lifestyle and works out a plan based on a set number of calories which they follow in the 80:20 pattern daily.

And they said that a vital part of the programme is equipping people with the mental tools to take control of their weight.
The programme includes lessons in positive psychology and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques to change the way they think about food.
Although exercise is not mandatory in the programme, Daniel does advise weight training and cardio.
The HomePod may not be a traditional Bluetooth speaker, but it is a standard AirPlay speaker (with some added smarts, of course). That means you can't stream music from an Android device (without a complicated workaround) or connect it to an audio source using Bluetooth. It does, however, mean that you can stream any audio from your connected iPhone and iPad using Airplay, even if it's from a third-party music streaming service. Here's how.
AirPlay doesn't mean Siri play
Though you can use AirPlay to stream any music from your iPhone or iPad, that doesn't mean you can use Siri to control playback. That only works with Apple Music and iTunes Match. You'll have to start the beats from your iPhone or iPad and control whether you skip or replay songs from either your device or the control panel on top of the HomePod.
How to AirPlay any music streaming app to your HomePod
Streaming Spotify, music from your iTunes, or whatever audio you want, to your HomePod is as easy as connecting it to AirPlay.
Swipe up from the bottom bezel on your iPhone or iPad to bring up Control Center (swipe down from the upper right corner on iPhone X). Tap the audio options icon in the upper right corner of the Now Playing control panel. Tap your HomePod.
Whichever music app is playing will automatically play through the HomePod, even if you switch apps.
How to stop streaming third-party music services on your HomePod using AirPlay

Turkish business is fighting against fluctuations in exchange rates that have seen record highs recently.
Many sectors that had to trade in the dollar have either pegged the exchange rate or have returned to trading in Turkish lira. In the textile sector, some companies have started trading in lira using exchange rates they themselves determined.
On the other hand, tourism professionals preferred currency pegging. Some investors in shopping centers have provided discounts, while some transferred to the lira as a method of payment for rent. Fees in the home care service industry, where mainly foreigners work, have also returned to the lira.
Turkey Clothing Manufacturers' Association Chairman Hadi Karasu said in this period when Turkey is going through a period of volatile currency, they took measures by converting to lira, particularly in the domestic market.
"Contract manufacturers saw the rate as an opportunity and doubled the figures. We tell them that if they continue like this, they will not find jobs when things return to normal. We continue to take forward rates with banks," they said.
Kararsu also said that they had made lira agreements with companies they buy raw material from.
They suggested pegging the bottom rate as TL 4.2 and the top rate as TL 4.5, indicating that according to conditions, there could be upward and downward revisions in these figures. They said there was an urgent need for a mechanism that will compress currency during this period.
The head of the United Brands Association (BMD), representing ready-to-wear brands, Sinan Öncel, said that the two thirds of shopping malls have pegged the exchange rate, provided at least a 30 percent discount in rent or have turned the contract into turnover rent for one year. According to information provided by Öncel, shopping malls have pegged prices between TL 3.20-4.30 per dollar and 3.80-5.20 per euro according to the number of visitors and their frequency, location and brand mix. Nizam Ali Eriş, director of an online caretaker providing service platform, said that domestic caretakers have started to replace foreign caretakers due to the increase in the exchange rate.
"Currently, there is a 50-50 percent local and foreign distribution. This rate was 60 percent in favor of foreigners last year," Eriş said.
Pronto Tour Chairman Ali Onaran said that the company offered discounts up to 12 percent in April and stressed that they will run operations by currency-fixing this month. "We will fix the dollar around TL 4.20 and the euro below TL 5. As long as currency volatility continues, we are obliged to fix it," they said.
Onaran also pointed out that 40 percent of tour packages previously sold in the U.S. dollar are now offered in lira. They stressed that bookings in euro and dollars declined 15 to 20 percent, while bookings for the Balkans, Russia, China and Morocco increased by 25 percent, 30 percent, 12 percent and 65 percent, respectively.
ALTON — The Young Women's Christian Association of Alton is asking individuals to join them in participating in a Stand Against Racism from Thursday, April 27, to Sunday, April 30.
Stand Against Racism aims to unite the community with a clear message: we are on a mission to eliminate racism. Racism in America is institutionalized in ways that many don't even realize: in employment, education, housing, health care, and workplace policies such as sick leave, voting rights and political power. Until we break down these barriers and confront our own individual attitudes and biases, racism will continue to have a hold on our society and negatively affect communities of color. Stand Against Racism offers a time for communities to come together and grapple with these challenging issues, develop solutions and take action.
An anticipated 750 events will take place across the country during those four days, including public policy advocacy, community education, and public proclamations.
The following events are scheduled in the Riverbend:
YWCA of Alton, schools, nonprofits and local businesses will hold an actual Stand Against Racism from 1:30 p.m. to 1:35 p.m. Thursday, April 27, to raise awareness about the negative impact of institutional and structural racism. Businesses and schools desiring to participate should contact the YWCA for information, including a fact sheet on systemic racism and its negative effects.
The YWCA is encouraging residents to wear the color persimmon, the YWCA color of strength and confidence, on Friday, April 28.
There will be a free screening of the movie “13th” at 6:30 p.m. Saturday, April 29, at the YWCA, 304 E. Third St., Alton. In this documentary, scholars, activists and politicians analyze the criminalization of African-Americans and the U.S. prison boom. A discussion of the film and its issues, themes, and ideas will follow. Light refreshments will be served.
“As individuals committed to social justice, I stand with my colleagues at the YWCA, including our local Board of Directors and Racial Justice Committee members, against racism and discrimination of any kind and believe in promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all people in my community and in the world,” YWCA of Alton Executive Director Dorothy Hummel said.

TORONTO – Security ministers from the G7 countries are discussing how to fight the threats lurking in the internet's dark spaces against the backdrop of a city reeling from Monday's deadly daylight van attack.
Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale was peppered with questions and offers of assistance from their G7 counterparts after Monday's tragedy, in which a rental van barrelled through a crowd of people on a north Toronto sidewalk, killing 10 pedestrians and injuring 15.

A major focus of the final day of the G7 ministerial meeting in Toronto was addressing violent extremism and preventing the internet from being as a tool for training, propaganda and financing.
“It's the insidiousness of the messaging on the web,” Goodale said in an interview ahead of Tuesday's talks. “That's something that all ministers worry about.”
Goodale and their fellow G7 leaders will be calling on major internet service providers that are also at this meeting – Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft – to do more to prevent their platforms from being exploited.
Goodale said the service providers realize the need to co-operate, and will be discussing options with the G7 ministers. They said they will be urging service providers “to be quick and proficient, and quick and persistent in making sure their various services are not any kind of platform for terrorist material or terrorist activity.”
“You do not want your platform to be known as a safe harbour for terror or sexual exploitation or human trafficking or political interference.”
In Tuesday's opening remarks, Goodale said cybertechnology has become “a disruptive force” with the potential to harm critical infrastructure “and the power to more easily conceal identities.”
In the interview, Goodale offered some insight into the closed-door discussion they planned to lead with their counterparts.

“The one question that would always bother me is: is there anything we're missing?” they said.
“You're looking for the holes. When you're dealing with this technology and you get into the deep, dark web, how much of it is encrypted, how much of it is inaccessible, how much of it is beyond technical capacity to crack into.”
But there are thorny ethical issues at the heart of that discussion, the minister cautioned.

Goodale cited the recent controversy that has placed Facebook at the heart of a major scandal over the inappropriate use of its data in the United Kingdom's Brexit campaign and Donald Trump's successful U.S. presidential bid.
“The latest controversy about Facebook actually puts this whole set of issues in stark relief,” they said.
“On one side, everyone is agreed that we need to collaborate and fight hard to combat child pornography, human trafficking, political interference and terrorist content on the web.
On the other hand, they said the recent Facebook controversy placed privacy concerns front and centre.

The ministers also discussed how to guard against ongoing domestic threats. Though nothing has emerged so far to link Monday's events in Toronto to extremism, the use of a vehicle as a weapon against pedestrians is something that Goodale's British, French, American and German counterparts are all too familiar with.
Goodale reiterated that no motive for Monday's van attack has been found to link it to a national security threat, but they said the Toronto police investigation remains in its early stages.
“We've witnessed brutal terror attacks on our own home soil, and attacks on our democracies through foreign interference during elections,” Goodale told their fellow ministers Tuesday.
“These tests to our collective security demand our constant collaboration through the G7.”
KARACHI - A police inspector was abducted on Monday allegedly by plainclothes personnel in old city areas of Karachi
Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Nadeem Tanoli, who was posted to the Saeedabad police station, and lived in Police Headquarters, Garden, was reportedly picked by men in plainclothes from Nabi Bux area of old city.
Nabi Buksh SHO Chaudhry Saeed said that the CCTV footages showed that some people in plainclothes, along with a police mobile van, picked them up and took them away to an undisclosed location while motive behind the incident is yet to be ascertained.
ASI taken into custody over scuffle
In another incident, another assistant sub- inspector (ASI) was taken into custody after they scuffled with the security guards of Dow University's Ojha campus.
The police officer was identified as Sheikh Muzammil. Sacchal SHO Nasir Afridi said that ASI Muzammil had arrived at the Ojha campus along with a patient where a scuffle broke out between them and security guards over unknown reasons, adding that the police officer, while seeing the number of guards approaching him, pulled their pistol out and opened a single fire into an air to disperse them.
The ASI was posted with the rural Sindh SSP Shahjahan Khan and had arrived at the campus for the treatment of their family member when the incident occurred. SHO Afridi said that a case would be registered against the cop while further investigation was underway.
Fire AT residential building
Meanwhile, fire broke out at a residential building in Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Monday. Fire broke out in one of the rooms located on the first floor of a residential building at Off Shamsher, Phase V Extension.
Reacting to information, firefighters immediately reached the site. However, they managed to put the blazes down after the hectic efforts of at least two hours.
DHA fire brigade spokesperson said that the firefighters reached the site on time and put it out.
The spokesperson further said that the actual cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained.
“However, apparently it seems the fire had broken out due to short-circuiting,” they conjectured.
No loss of life was reported in the incident.
Hollywood star Harrison Ford was involved in a near-miss at a California airport as they were piloting their private plane, officials and US media said on Tuesday.
Ford, a seasoned pilot and vintage plane collector, was approaching John Wayne Airport in Orange County, NBC reported, when they headed towards a taxiway rather than the runway, passing over an Boeing 737 with 110 passengers and six crew.
The 74-year-old "Indiana Jones" star was captured on air traffic control recordings, according to NBC, asking: "Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?"
The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) said it did not identify people involved in air incidents but confirmed it was investigating what had caused the misunderstanding.
"Air traffic controllers cleared the pilot of a single-engine Aviat Husky to land on Runway 20L at John Wayne Airport Monday afternoon," spokesperson Ian Gregor said in a statement.
"The pilot correctly read back the clearance. The pilot then landed on a taxiway that runs parallel to the runway, overflying a Boeing 737 that was holding short of the runway."
The American Airlines plane managed to depart safely for Dallas just minutes after the incident, according to NBC.
The FAA prohibits aircraft landing on taxiways and sanctions for pilots found at fault range from a warning letter to a suspension of their license.
Ford suffered a broken arm and minor head injuries when they crash-landed a World War II plane on a Santa Monica golf course two years ago, after the carburetor failed.
They also crash-landed a helicopter during a flying lesson in Ventura County, California in 1999 and, a year later, their Beechcraft Bonanza scraped the runway during an emergency landing in Nebraska.
The actor has been in accidents out of the cockpit too, suffering a broken leg three years ago on the set of the Millennium Falcon spaceship after they were pinned down by the heavy, metal-framed door while reprising their role as Han Solo in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
A longtime aviation enthusiast, Ford owns several aircraft and claims more than 5,200 hours in their log book.  They are certified to fly and land planes, seaplanes and helicopters, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
Their representatives refused to comment. DM
Nyon: Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid will continue their bid for a first European Cup treble in 40 years against Neymar's Paris Saint-Germain after the big-spending duo were on Monday drawn together in a mouth-watering Champions League last 16 clash.
No club has won the European title three years running since Bayern Munich in the mid-1970s, underlining how big an achievement it would be if Madrid -- 12 times winners overall -- won the trophy again in the final in Kiev in May.
They know exactly what it takes to be European champions, and in Ronaldo have the most prolific goal-scorer in the competition's history.
Real's La Liga rivals Barcelona were drawn against Chelsea, while English Premier League leaders Manchester City play Basel, who have had some fine results against English sides in recent years.
Five-time winners and current Bundesliga table toppers Bayern Munich drew Turkish giants Besiktas, while last year's beaten finalists Juventus take on Tottenham.
With a record five English clubs in the draw, three-time champions Manchester United face Sevilla and Liverpool, five-time winners, will be up against two-time former champions Porto.
Unfancied Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk will play Roma.
First legs will be played on 13/14 and 20/21 February, with second legs on 6/7 and 13/14 March.
A teen accused of spraying Saskatoon police officers with bear spray has been charged with assaulting them.
The officers spotted the teen, who matched the description of a robbery suspect, last Sunday evening at the intersection of 21st Street East and Avenue P South.

When they approached the teen, officers said the teen assaulted them with bear spray and then fled on foot.
The officers attempted to pursue the teen but lost sight of him.
A police dog tracked the teen to a home in the 200-block of Avenue P South where they were found on the roof.
It was determined that the teen had broken into the house but was forced out by the homeowner.
Police surrounded the house and order the teen off the roof, but they refused to come down.

Officers said the teen was acting irrationally and eventually sprayed themselves with the bear spray.
They were then taken into custody.
The 17-year-old teen is charged with assaulting police officers, carrying a weapon dangerous to the public, break and enter, and breaching court-ordered conditions.
Police determined that the teen was not the robbery suspect they had been seeking.
Pain is the most common reason people seek medical care, according to the National Institutes of Health.
“Sometimes we can easily pinpoint what is causing a person pain,” says Richard Harris, Ph.D., associate professor of anesthesiology and rheumatology at Michigan Medicine. “But, there are still 1 in 5 Americans who suffer from persistent pain that is not easily identifiable.”
Whenever someone experiences pain, they often think about how intense the pain is — but rarely do they also consider how widespread the pain is.
Harris is the senior author on a new study, published in Pain, that sought to find what underlies widespread pain.
“We examined data from the brains of participants in the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain Research Network study,” Harris says. “We compared participants with a clinical diagnosis of urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome to pain-free controls and to fibromyalgia patients.”
Harris and colleagues examined if widespread pain, thought to be a marker of centralization in the nervous system, actually originates in the brain.
Functional and structural neuroimaging
The research team used data from 1,079 participants from the MAPP study that included questionnaires capturing their pain severity and function. They were also asked to draw on a body map where they were experiencing pain.
Researchers then had a subset of the participants undergo functional and structural MRIs.
“Surprisingly, many of the individuals, in addition to having pain located in the pelvic region, had pain also widely distributed throughout their body,” Harris says. “Interestingly, when we put these individuals into the brain imaging scanner, we found that those who had widespread pain had increased gray matter and brain connectivity within sensory and motor cortical areas, when compared to pain-free controls.”
Urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome patients with widespread pain showed increased brain gray matter volume and functional connectivity involving the sensorimotor and insular cortices.
“What was surprising was these individuals with widespread pain, although they had the diagnosis of urological chronic pelvic pain, were actually identical to another chronic pain disorder: fibromyalgia,” Harris says.
The team notes the changes in brain gray matter volume and functional connectivity were identical to outcomes present in fibromyalgia patients, but were not seen in the pain-free control group.
“This study represents the fact that pelvic pain patients, a subset of them, have characteristics of fibromyalgia,” Harris says. “Not only do they have widespread pain, but also they have brain markers indistinguishable from fibromyalgia patients.”
Harris and colleagues hope this study provides physicians with the opportunity to look at new ways of treating chronic pain patients — as there might be similarities across pain conditions if both show widespread pain.
“We think that this type of study will help treat these patients because if they have a central nerve biological component to their disorder, they're much more likely to benefit from targets that affect the central nervous system rather than from treatments that are aimed at the pelvic region,” Harris says.
One man is hurt after an accident with injuries in Jo Daviess County this morning.
According to investigators, 41-year-old Timothy Streight was driving on Elizabeth Scales Mound Road in rural Elizabeth just after 7:00 AM when their vehicle left the road, hit a culvert, crossed a driveway and hit a power pole.
The power pole was snapped in half by their vehicle.
Once power was turned off to the power lines, Streight was removed from their vehicle by EMS and transported to the hospital for treatment.
Stregiht is charged with improper lane usage. The accident remains under investigation.

Los Angeles County Sheriff's homicide detectives are investigating the circumstances surrounding the fatal drug overdose of a 26-year-old man at the West Hollywood home of prominent democratic donor Ed Buck.
Sheriff Jim McDonnell said Monday that while coroner's officials ruled Gemmel Moore's July 27 death an accident, homicide detectives will be conducting a follow-up investigation based on “additional information.” They declined to elaborate.
Initial investigations by deputies and the Los Angeles County Coroner's office did not flag anything suspicious in Moore's death, sheriff's Capt. Chris Bergner said, but the new probe was being launched “out of abundance of caution.”
Seymour Amster, an attorney representing Buck, said Monday that their client had “nothing to do with this young man's tragic death.”
They added that Moore, whom they described as a “good friend” of Buck's, was found in a bathroom of the home, alone, with the door closed.
It was “a self-imposed accidental death,” they said. Buck, 62, did not return calls seeking comment.
Ed Winter, a spokesperson for the coroner's office, said Buck was inside the Laurel Avenue home at the time of Moore's death and that drug paraphernalia was recovered from the scene.
The new investigation came amid calls by Moore's family for a deeper examination of their death.
A family friend provided the Los Angeles Times with pages of what they said was Moore's journal from December. The friend also provided a video showing them picking up the journal from the coroner's office. In the purported journal entries, Moore writes about their drug use. They also make accusations against Buck.

Moore's mother, LaTisha Nixon, said their son worked for a time as an escort and used drugs. Shortly before their death, they told them they were homeless.
“I can't bring my son back. He's gone,” said Nixon, a mail carrier who lives in Spring, Texas. “There's nothing I can do. I'd give the world if I could. I just want this situation exposed.”
Amster dismissed the journals.
“What happened in 2016, in unverified writing, I doubt has anything to do with what happened in 2017,” the attorney said. “There is nothing to show that Ed was anything but a kind-hearted individual trying to help somebody else by giving them access to their home.”
Buck became a nationally known figure in the late 1980s when they led the effort to impeach Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham. News reports at the time described Buck as a conservative Republican.
The New York Times in 1987 described them as “a 33-year-old millionaire entrepreneur who retired from the insurance service business a year ago to found the Mecham Recall Committee.”
Upon learning that Buck was gay, Mecham's aides distributed bumper stickers reading “Queer Ed Buck's Recall.” The Arizona governor's efforts to dismiss the recall supporters — whom they dubbed “a band of homosexuals and a few dissident Democrats” — with comments about sexual orientation were pilloried in “Doonesbury” comics.
More recently, Buck donated to various Democratic causes. They served on the Stonewall Democratic Club Steering Committee. Last week, the group requested Buck's resignation in the wake of Moore's death.
“We understand Mr. Buck has not been charged with a crime and we cannot comment on those allegations,” the organization said in a statement. “They are serious, however. We have requested, therefore, and accepted the resignation of Mr. Buck from the Stonewall Democratic Club Steering Committee.”
According to Amster, Buck agreed to resign because they did not want to draw negative publicity to the organization.

They make an unusual sight sitting in the waiting area at Enso Tattoo on Calgary's bustling 17 Avenue S.W. – two great-grandmothers, ready to try something new.
“It's our first time,” Zenith Hrdlicka said with a laugh. “Can't do much harm at this stage of the game.”
Hrdlicka, 92, was at the studio this week to get a small ‘z' tattooed on their shoulder.
“In case I forget my name,” they joked. “At least I'll know what my initial is.”
Hdrlicka was there with their friend Marg Houston, who's 84.

Houston had a very special reason for getting a small star tattooed on their forearm.
“It's for my little great-granddaughter Greta, who passed away in the fall from liver cancer,” Houston said.
Three-year-old Greta Marofke captured many Calgarians' hearts during their courageous battle against that cancer.
Many donated money to support Greta's trip to a Cincinnati hospital that specializes in treating the rare form of cancer from which they suffered.
Despite a liver transplant, they passed away in September 2017.
Houston feels the star tattoo is a fitting tribute to their great-granddaughter.
“She was just a really lively, little fun girl,” Houston said. “It didn't take them very long to get over their serious surgeries and they were right back again.”
Both women are residents of the Rocky Ridge Retirement Community, which has a program that helps seniors realize “bucket list” dreams.
Getting the tattoos was part of that program—a way for Houston to preserve the memories of their little Greta.
“It will remind me of them and their spirit,” Houston said, “and how positive they always are.”
Senad İdrisi and Amir Aslani, two close friends from Macedonia, are heading for Mecca by bike to complete their hajj pilgrimage.
Departing from Macedonia, İdrisi and Aslani came to Istanbul after passing through Albania and Greece. Carrying their equipment and pedaling at the same time, they want to make history for coming generations by recording their journey as they head to their destination.
Speaking to Anadolu Agency (AA) reporters, İdrisi said that they want to reach Mecca by pedaling all the way and that they are a lawyer interested in professional climbing while their companion is an imam.
Starting the journey from Kalkandelen, Macedonia, İdrisi said: "We went to Albania, and after passing through Greece came to Istanbul. Following in the footsteps of our ancestors, as our Prophet Muhammed and their "ashab," their companions, walked on pilgrimage to Mecca; we want to ride our bikes on our pilgrimage duty. Our biggest motivation is to remember that Muhammed walked on pilgrimage."
İdrisi said that they have been getting ready for this pilgrimage for two years and they are aware of any hardship that they may face. According to their plans, it will take approximately 40-45 days.
They have been sharing this journey on social media, especially with Macedonians, and their families and many people support them.
They want to be good examples for people and the first pilgrims to make the journey by bike rather than by foot. İdrisi said just one person has made their pilgrimage by walking from Bosnia to Mecca.
After crossing three continents and six countries, İdrisi and Aslani want to end up at Mecca and pray for Muslims all over the world.
LONDON (Reuters) - Iran could reduce its co-operation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, President Hassan Rouhani told the body's head on Wednesday, as they blamed U.S. President Donald Trump for the “new situation.”

"The responsibility for the change of Iran's cooperation level with the IAEA falls on those who have created this new situation,” they added.
Rouhani said if Iran does not continue to benefit from the nuclear deal after the U.S. withdrawal, it will make “new decisions”.

(Photo: Leon Neal / Getty Images)
London — Five versions of a Vincent van Gogh masterpiece are being reunited for the first time in a “virtual exhibition.”
Van Gogh painted their “Sunflowers” series in the south of France in 1888 and 1889. Five versions of work reside in five different museums on three continents.
On Monday they will all be streamed to a global audience in a Facebook Live broadcast.
The 1 hour and 35 minute broadcast begins in London's National Gallery at 12:50 p.m. EDT. It then continues at Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum, the Neue Pinakothek in Munich, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tokyo's Seiji Togo Memorial Museum of Art.
A curator from each museum will describe, in 15-minute segments, what makes their version unique.
The museums launched a virtual-reality experience last week that shows viewers all five “Sunflowers” in one room. The paintings are so treasured and such big draws it would be difficult to bring them together in real life.
“We're at a moment in time where new kinds of experience are becoming possible for art galleries and museums all around the world,” Chris Michaels, the National Gallery's digital director, said.
London's version of “Sunflowers” is one of the museum's most popular paintings.
It's famous for its blue and yellow swirls, textured surface and rare glimpse into the happy times of Van Gogh's life in Arles, France.
More than 50,000 viewers watched a preview for Monday's event online.
Michaels is hopeful their team will bring more of the National Gallery's famous pieces to online audiences. It's an added attraction and a way to connect with other galleries.
“But it's not a replacement,” they said. “It's another type of thing that art museums can do and an amazing one for us to explore in the future, in partnership with amazing museums around the world.”

Since Trump's inauguration, US-led so-called “coalition” warplanes continued attacking Syrian infrastructure.
Bridges and Raqqa's water lines were destroyed, cutting off supplies to the city. Last Thursday, an Israeli helicopter shelled a Quneitra residential building.
Separately, in response to an errant shell, harmlessly landing in Israeli occupied Golan, the IDF struck a nearby Syrian military position – without explaining if it was by airstrike or artillery fire.
The Israeli regime actively aids ISIS and other anti-Syria terrorist groups. It invents reasons to launch periodic aggressive attacks against Syrian targets, acts of war by any standard.
Damascus maintains restraint to keep ongoing conflict from expanding into a greater one it can't win against Israel's military superiority, greatly aided by Washington. Its complaints to UN authorities are ignored.
Interviewed by Belgian reporters, Assad called US-led coalition actions against ISIS “illusive,” saying the terrorist group is “expanding,” adding:
“What we heard in statements by Trump during the campaign and after the campaign is promising regarding the priority of fighting terrorists, and mainly ISIS. That's what we've been asking for during the last six years.” “We have to wait. It's still early to expect anything practical.” So far, no US operation against ISIS or other terrorist groups exists, Assad explained – saying, at most, America's operation is “cosmetic…illusive (and) illegal…a breach of our sovereignty.”
Washington and its allies have been aiding ISIS and like-minded groups throughout the conflict, not combating them. Assad hopes Trump will change things. It's too soon to tell.
Syria's leader, its officials and millions of devastated civilians urge all the help they can get to defeat the scourge of terrorism – so far provided by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah – America, NATO, Israel and other regional rogue states Syria's main enemies.
On Tuesday, US-led airstrikes on Idlib killed at least 15 civilians, wounding scores more, destroying residential buildings in the city on the pretext of combating ISIS.
Separately, Assad thanked Vladimir Putin for Russia's indispensable role in turning things around in Syria, greatly aiding eventual conflict resolution.
It'll be a while coming. Assad said Russia's intervention turned the tide of battle in Damascus' favor – events “moving quickly in the direction” of a desired outcome.
On February 20, peace talks resume in Geneva. Previous rounds failed because Washington undermined them. It remains to be seen if Trump intends working with Russia cooperatively to end the conflict Obama launched.
NatWest customers in Builth Wells will face 32-mile round trips to Brecon from next week as the town's branch shuts its doors for the last time.
The bank announced the closure in March citing the rise of electronic banking as the reason behind the decision.
The move has been
A spokesperson said at the time: “The way people choose to bank with us has changed radically over the last few years.
“Between 2010 and 2015, mobile and online transactions have increased by over 400 per cent and mobile transactions alone have increased by 1,350 per cent.
“Since 2011 we have seen the number of transactions in the Builth Wells branch decline by 39 per cent.
“These customers are actively choosing to bank in different ways, with 50 per cent of customers in our Builth Wells branch choosing to use our digital banking options.”
Pleas from local customers, politicians and councillors fell on deaf ears, and NatWest plans to press ahead with the closure on Tuesday, October 10.
In an update issued in July, the bank said: “We met with local MP Chris Davies and Kirsty Williams AM to discuss our customers' concerns.
“The branch team has spoken to customers to explain more about our alternative banking services in the local area, and have helped customers to set up online banking/encouraged them to visit our nearest branches.
“NatWest Builth Wells will close as planned on October 10.”
This will leave two banks in the town – Barclays, open four days, and Santander, open two days and one morning.
Builth Wells County Councillor Jeremy Pugh said: "It is another town tragedy.
"All decisions that are made in urban areas not rural areas.
"The banks saying it's not feasible to stay open are idiots. There is a huge amount of services that could be delivered but they choose not to."
Up until its closure, NatWest was open for just eight hours a week, from 10.30am to 2.30pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The Builth Wells branch was among four in Powys closing down this year, alongside Hay-on-Wye, Welshpool and Machynlleth.

Adam Detillieux averages anywhere from 25 up to 50 kilometres a day on their bike.
It's all with a little help, because Detillieux owns an electric bike.
“Getting the electric bike really allowed me to have a similar life as when I had a car. Now, I can cover the same kind of distance and it doesn't even take much longer than a car,” Detillieux said.
WATCH BELOW: Electric bikes trending in Saskatoon
Two months ago, they decided to purchase an electric bike after getting rid of their car.
“I figured out that I'm saving about 360 bucks a month. You have to pay for parking downtown, gas, insurance, etc. It's really expensive, so this bike is going to pay itself off in six months of not having a car,” Detillieux said.
The brains behind Detillieux's bike is from Saskatoon. Roshan Thomas started Biktrix, an electric bike company in 2014.

“I was building an electric bicycle and then I ended up building four or five of these. When I was riding one of them down 8th Street, a lot of people asked me about it and they wanted to buy it,” Thomas said.
From there, Bixtrix took off. The bike company operates mostly online, shipping across North America.

As for here at home, Thomas said the trend is starting to take off.
“Three years ago, none of us were selling electric bikes. There were some bike shops selling some conversion kits and we were doing a little bit of conversion kits, but now there's a lot of people riding electric bikes,” Thomas said.
Thomas opened a showroom in the Riversdale neighbourhood a few months ago.
“In terms of sales, we've been doubling every year. This year will be our biggest year. We've already surpassed what we did last year so far and we have another four or five months left,” Thomas said.
Thomas said Biktrix now has nine models of electric bikes and three different models of electric kits.
The business also operates a factory warehouse in Saskatoon where the bikes are assembled and shipped.

Over the weekend, a disgraceful organization ripped off the Detroit Red Wings logo and used it as their own in a Charlottesville, Virginia white supremacy protest. This description is the only press I'll give this organization – their views are despicable and should be left in history where they belong.
When news of this broke, the Red Wings organization quickly issued a statement lambasting the infringement and the views of the offending group.
This is not a logo of hate. It's a symbol of history, tradition, pride/respect that has brought joy to countless people. #Charlotesville pic.twitter.com/ClVExDC3y4 — John Michael Curran (@jmcurran28) August 12, 2017
What this asinine group does not understand is that the Red Wings logo has long stood for equality, diversity, and the American Dream. It's been this way since the logo was first worn on Detroit jerseys starting in 1932. And it will continue to be this way long into the future. Here's why:
Original Six Parity
When Jack Adams ran the Detroit Red Wings, they made more than a handful of trades. Some helped the organization and others seemingly backfired. There may be another way to look at the latter group of trades, though.
In Red Wings columnist Bob Duff's book, 100 Things Red Wings Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die, former coach Jimmy Skinner was quoted as saying the following about Adams' odd decisions to move quality players:
If you ask me, Jack kept the league going. They made trades that would help other teams, even though they were hurting himself. They wanted the league to be strong.
Adams wanted the six NHL teams on an equal playing field even though their team was on top – the Red Wings had just won four Stanley Cups in six years before Adams unleashed a flurry of trades.
Ilitch's American Dream
Before purchasing the Red Wings and Detroit Tigers, Mike Ilitch achieved the American Dream and carried that “from-humble-beginnings” attitude through their tenure as team owner.
Ilitch was born in Detroit just before the Great Depression hit. Their parents were Macedonian immigrants who had recently come to America. After four years with the U.S. Marine Corps and a short baseball career, Ilitch and their wife, Marian, started what would become Little Caesars. In time, they took their single-location restaurant and transformed it into a global company, employing thousands of people across the world.
A common theme for the companies and organizations that fall under Ilitch Holdings, Inc. is their commitment to corporate social responsibility. Everyone gives back and helps others, regardless of demographics. In addition, the Red Wings, Tigers, Little Caesars, and other Ilitch organizations employ a diverse workforce around the world.
Red Wings from Many Nations
It's no secret that the Red Wings have rostered many players in their history who hail from various parts of the globe. A quick glance at their all-time roster reveals current and former players from the United States, Canada, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Norway, France, Ireland, Lebanon, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Scotland, Slovenia, Belarus, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Switzerland.
In addition, Detroit was one of the first NHL organizations to employ Swedish players when they signed defenseman Thommie Bergman in 1972. They later helped Sergei Fedorov defect from the Soviet Union and eventually formed the Russian Five, which revolutionized the game.
Bergman, Fedorov, and all of the other Red Wings throughout history came from unique upbringings before reaching the NHL. In Hockeytown, they donned the Winged Wheel and became a family each season. Sure, there were some disagreements from time to time, but it was in everyone's best interest to put the team first.
Final Word
In addition to the three instances above, there have been many other acts of equality throughout Detroit's past. Participating in the NHL's Hockey is for Everyone campaign, Colleen Howe becoming the first female sports agent, countless donations to local organizations – the list goes on.
The person or people who decided to use the Red Wings' Winged Wheel as the logo for a group committed to hate clearly did not do their research. Hockeytown's famous emblem stands for the polar opposite of what these individuals want. It represents the diversity and equality that the vast majority of us hold dear.
DECEMBER 11, 2017 — Maritime e-procurement platform ShipServ has added a Supplier Performance Report to its monitoring and analytics tools.
The Supplier Performance Report provides shipowners and managers using ShipServ with key data on the procurement performance of every supplier that they use, enabling them to analyze trends, and identify where improvements can be made, so that relationships with suppliers can be enhanced and optimized.
The Supplier Performance Report brings together procurement metrics and data on every supplier that a shipowner or manager has traded with through ShipServ over a specific period, from 12 weeks to three years. This includes transaction totals, quote, and win rates, response times, through to price and time sensitivity analysis, most commonly bought items and spend history, as well as the quality level, and payment terms that have been quoted. This information is compiled into an easy-to-use, online report, which is updated daily.
Unique to ShipServ, the tool shows procurement teams two benchmarks: an individual supplier against the average of all suppliers trading with them, and also against an average of all suppliers trading on ShipServ.
The data from the Supplier Performance Report highlights key procurement trends, and indicates where improvements can be made to create a better and more effective working relationship between the buyer and the supplier. For example, slow response times or high quote variances could be due to poor data or catalogmanagement, which, once identified, can be positively addressed to drive improvements.
"The Supplier Performance Report provides shipowners and managers with real knowledge and intelligence on key dimensions of the relationship with their suppliers so they can have more informed discussions and further develop and enhance their working relationship," said Kim Skaarup, Chief Executive Officer, ShipServ.
"It's the latest step in our ongoing mission of providing insights to maximize the positive collaboration and information exchange between buyers and suppliers. We are investing heavily in new reporting tools for buyers. Our sweet spot is in spend analysis and benchmarking and in the near future you will see us launching new analysis and insight tools specifically aimed at C-level executives and procurement directors."
In addition to the Supplier Performance Report, ShipServ has launched its IMPA Spend Tracker and Price Benchmark tool. This provides shipowners and managers with an online view of all the IMPA coded products that they have purchased, instantly showing the quantity, average unit price, and total spend.
The tool also has the capability to analyze the benchmark unit price of a product, which is the average unit price from all the buyers using ShipServ. Procurement managers can then compare the benchmark price of a product against the actual price that they have paid, and calculate the total potential overspend or underspend.
As this is ranked by the volume of total overspend, it effectively becomes a prioritized list of OPEX savings opportunities. It can also be filtered on a vessel-by-vessel, or regional basis to enable buyers to drill down into where savings can be made. The average unit price takes into account, and averages out, the broad range of quality that is purchased for any individual IMPA number. However, if a buyer chooses to investigate making a change to drive savings, they can view alternative suppliers in the report.
Come November, we will vote on Draper's Cal-3 measure. It's a monumental proposition — destroying a state — and such a notion shouldn't be decided by a one-time, simple majority vote, not least because we the people might not get the nuances of how destructive it could be. It's probably unconstitutional, and should it pass (unlikely) and survive legal review (unlikely), it would create hordes of economic, political and cultural losers and very few winners. (The latter would be mostly in the new state of Northern California, where Draper lives, surprise, surprise.)
When agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration raided a remote farm in Humboldt County five years ago, they found plenty to incriminate the owners, Anthony Pisarski and Sonny Moore.
More than 300 marijuana plants were growing in a pair of greenhouses. Agents found guns in a house on the sprawling property and about $225,000 in cash, much of it bundled in vacuum-sealed pouches, hidden in a garage and some pickup trucks. Later searches uncovered another large stash of cash, along with bars of gold and silver.
Pisarski and Moore ultimately pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell marijuana.
But in a ruling believed to be the first of its kind, a judge last week put a stop to the case before the men were sentenced to prison. The judge found they had no choice but to call off prosecutors in light of an unusual budget rule in Congress that forbids federal law enforcement from interfering with states where medical marijuana is legal.
The decision by U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco illustrates for the first time what could be a serious legal hurdle if U.S. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, a fierce marijuana opponent, decides to crack down on medical marijuana, which remains illegal under federal law. While it remains to be seen how many other marijuana cases will be closed down like the one in San Francisco, supporters of states' authority to legalize pot hailed the decision and said they hoped it served as a check on Sessions.
“This is a signal that hopefully will go totally across the country — that federal prosecutors should stop wasting their time and start focusing on real criminals,” U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Costa Mesa), who has led a legislative campaign to rein in the Justice Department on medical marijuana cases, said of the judge's order. “My conservative friends like Jeff [Sessions] need to look themselves in the mirror and say, ‘We don't like these people smoking marijuana, but they do have a right to do it because it's their lives, not the government's.' ”
The ruling hinged on a short amendment written by Rohrabacher and then-U.S. Rep. Sam Farr (D-Carmel), who recently retired, to an appropriations bill in late 2014 that authorized government spending for the upcoming year.
Though brief, the amendment was meant to have a significant effect: It forbade the Department of Justice from using funds in a way that obstructed a state “from implementing their own state laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical marijuana.” Congress has renewed the prohibition each year since.
Until now, U.S. district judges had rejected attempts by defendants to argue that the amendment applied to their cases. In a case in Fresno involving a man convicted of illegally operating a marijuana cooperative, for example, a judge found the man had violated California's medical marijuana law by selling marijuana for profit and therefore was fair game for federal prosecution.
One unresolved legal question is whether the spending ban also applies to people who have already been convicted and are serving sentences on marijuana charges, since the Bureau of Prisons and U.S Marshals Service are arms of the Department of Justice.
Still, the immediate impact of last week's ruling is likely to be limited.
The number of people facing federal drug charges for marijuana violations in the 29 states that have made medical marijuana legal is not thought to be large. Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department followed a policy that generally shied away from prosecutions as long as a state had in place strict measures to prevent drugs from being sold to minors, money flowing to drug cartels, marijuana being diverted to states where the drug was illegal and other potential problems.
But with Sessions ratcheting up their rhetoric and leaving open the possibility they will launch a crackdown on marijuana, the legal defense offered up by the spending ban could present a formidable roadblock going forward.
In a letter they sent in May, Sessions urged congressional leaders to do away with the spending amendment. Along with the health and societal risks they said marijuana posed, the attorney general said the ban was helping organized crime infiltrate medical marijuana markets.
“The department must be in a position to use all laws available to combat the transnational drug organizations and dangerous drug traffickers who threaten American lives,” they wrote.
A spokesperson for the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.
For Pisarski and Moore, the budget amendment offered a last-minute lifeline.
The amendment was added when the pair were only days away from being sentenced. Prosecutors were asking the judge to send the men to prison for nearly three years.
The pair owned 242 remote acres of property that included a house, a warehouse and two greenhouses where agents discovered 320 growing marijuana plants, according to court records filed by the U.S. attorney's office. Federal agents found a loaded firearm in both of their bedrooms. Among the evidence seized was $189,000 in cash that had been welded inside the lining of a trailer.
Pisarski's attorney, Ronald Richards, made an emergency request to postpone the sentencing in order to see if the amendment would be signed into law.
The judge agreed, and when the spending rule, which passed with broad bipartisan support, became law, Richards said they sent emails to public defenders and other defense attorneys across the country to alert them to the new legal avenue the amendment opened in marijuana cases.
The curb on Justice Department spending was viewed at the time as a turning point after years of conflict between federal authorities intent on upholding the nation's drug laws and states where medical marijuana had been made legal. In light of the ban on spending, it was assumed federal prosecutors would have no choice but to abandon marijuana cases.
Justice Department officials, however, balked at such an expansive interpretation of the amendment. They acknowledged the spending ban prohibited them from meddling in the affairs of state officials but did not accept that it prevented them from going after producers and sellers like Pisarski and Moore.
Richards and Moore's attorney sought to push back the sentencing over and over as the legal landscape on marijuana cases continued to shift.
Radesh Singh's grandfather was just 11 years old when they left their village in India's Punjab province to move to Peshawar, in the far northwest of the country on the border with Afghanistan.
The year was 1901: The British ruled the Indian subcontinent, Pakistan wasn't even a glimmer in the eye of its founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, and Peshawar held the promise of work and adventure.
Singh's grandfather would never return to their village, not even in 1947, when the Indian subcontinent was divided into majority Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan, generating one of the largest migrations in modern history and unleashing a brutality that left few untouched as mobs of Hindus and Muslims turned on each other.
Singh's family is neither Hindu nor Muslim but Sikh, a religious minority in both countries. In the 70 years since Partition they have waged a secessionist uprising in India demanding outright independence for India's Punjab state where they dominate. They have felt increasingly less at home on either side of the border, but particularly so in recent years in overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan as they too have become victims of local Taliban violence.
Singh said poverty kept their grandfather in Peshawar, located at the foot of the famed Khyber Pass and dominated by fiercely independent ethnic Pashtun tribesmen.
“It's not easy to start over at zero when you have very little,” they said.
The hostility in the immediate aftermath of 1947 was brief in the northwest, said Singh. It was followed by decades of peace. The decision to stay in the new country now called Pakistan seemed like a good choice at the time. The Sikhs had lived peacefully for centuries alongside their Pashtun Muslim countrymen.
After all, said Singh, Sikhs had a glorious history in the northwest. For a time in the 18th century they oversaw a dynasty. Their capital was Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore. It was a Sikh ruler, Ranjit Singh, who rebuilt Peshawar's infamous Bala Hisar Fort, an imposing walled fortress that some historians say is as old as the city itself, which traces its origins back more than 2,000 years.
Today Sikhs are among Pakistan's smallest minorities. They are easily identifiable because of their tightly wound and often colorful turbans, and because they share the surname Singh. The CIA Factbook estimates that 3.6 percent of Pakistan's 180 million people are non-Muslims, including Sikhs, Christians and Hindus.
Until 1984, Singh said, Pakistan's Hindus and Sikhs lived as one in northwest Pakistan. Their children married, they even worshipped together. But then India's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by their Sikh bodyguards.
“They (Hindus) cut all relations with us. They said Pakistani Sikhs are like all Sikhs everywhere. No difference. They said, ‘From now on, we will be separate from you,'” Singh recalled.
Today Sikhs are battling with the Pakistan government for ownership of dozens of Sikh temples that they call gurdwaras; while it is slow going they have managed to reclaim some of the buildings. Many were abandoned in 1947 and taken over by Muslims who arrived from India. The Pakistan government, which took over the buildings after 1947, allowed the squatters to remain.
In a congested neighborhood in Peshawar's old city, Singh stepped through large steel gates that opened on to a sweeping courtyard. It no longer resembled a house of worship, but Singh said it was once a vibrant gurdwara attended by hundreds of Sikhs. Now two families call it home.
Two clotheslines crowded with clothes drying in the blistering midday sun stretched from one end of the courtyard to the other. A child's plastic toy sat idle nearby.
Elsewhere in Peshawar, an armed guard, their rifle slung loosely by their side, stood guard at the city's largest Sikh temple, an ornate marble building that dates back 250 years. Inside a half dozen Sikh men sat on plastic chairs.
It is a short, bureaucratic-looking man, a Muslim, who has the final say about who enters the gurdwara. They work for the government body that oversees properties vacated by people who fled to India in 1947.
After phone calls made, names recorded, passports handed over and more phone calls made, the doors to the gurdwara were opened. revealing a cavernous carpeted room and ornate pillars decorated with hundreds of tiny mirrors. In a small room at the far end of the upper story, two students read the Guru Granth Sahib, Sikhism's holy book.
Singh, who heads a council representing the Sikhs in Pakistan, said that since their homeland began to turn toward radical Islam, particularly in the Pashtun heartland, young Sikhs have been looking to leave.
“They want to go to another country, not to India or Pakistan,” they said, but every country eyes them with suspicion. Even Indians, they said, see their Pakistani passport and question their intentions, suggesting they want to agitate for Sikh secessionism, the battle that resulted in Indira Gandhi's death and a dream still held by many Sikhs on both sides of the border.
For Singh, Pakistan's slide into intolerance began in the late 1970s with the former Soviet Union's invasion of neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan's military dictator Zia-ul Haq set the country on the course of Islamic radicalization as jihad became a rallying cry to defeat the communists in Afghanistan, they said.
Extremism worsened after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan by a U.S.-led coalition, they said. The tribal regions were gradually overtaken by Taliban and in 2013 several Sikhs were killed, their limbs severed. The brutality of the killings and the threats sent thousands fleeing Pakistan, said Singh.
They said today Pakistan's intolerant use blasphemy — a crime that carries an automatic death penalty — as a weapon against minorities and fellow Muslims alike.
“That is why we have a fear in our hearts, that this law can be used against us,” they said. The mere accusation of blasphemy can incite mobs to violence.
“In the last nearly 40 years we have been facing the boom, boom (mimicking the sound of explosions) in every city of Pakistan,” said Singh. “In a long time we have not heard any sweet sounds in our Peshawar, but still we love our city.”
× Expand Photo by Melissa Meske Alton Shop ‘n Save office checker and local hometown hero Mindy McElyea is flanked by store manager Mark Heitzig (left) and fellow co-worker Mike Dade as they tell the story behind their life-saving act while working the express lane on Dec. 5. McElyea said it was “just normal” for them to step up and jump in, performing CPR on an older store customer who had collapsed from what later was determined to be a heart attack while waiting to check out. Dade helped McElyea with the customer during the incident.
Mindy McElyea started their shift as an office checker at Alton Shop ‘n Save on Dec. 5 just as they have for the past 18 years. But around 10:30 that morning, their call to serve the store's customers changed — dramatically, personally and permanently.
Store regulars know the express lane, or lane 1, is “attached” to the customer service office near the store's front entrance. It was there that McElyea's rise to local hometown hero status was about to be born. A gentleman they described as in their 70s, a resident of nearby Skyline Tower Apartments and one of their “regulars,” collapsed while waiting in the lane.
“He was a veteran, a shy individual,” McElyea said.
“One of the other cashiers heard their hand basket hit the floor first and shouted for help, but I saw them start to collapse,” they said. “I screamed for the manager, then ran over to help him.”
Other employees rushed over as well to clear the aisle and assist with whatever was needed, including Mike Dade.
“Mike helped me turn them over; the customer was bigger than me and I didn't think I could get them turned over by myself,” McElyea said. “I could then tell the customer wasn't breathing.”
“It was Mindy who took charge of the situation,” Dade said. “She told everyone what to do. They began performing CPR and continued to do so for about 10 minutes or so until Alton firefighters arrived and took over.”
While not certified, McElyea said they knew what to do from watching videos and TV shows throughout the years. They plan to complete CPR certification.
“The customer was gone when they collapsed,” McElyea said. “He wasn't breathing; there was no pulse. I performed CPR like how I had learned to do from watching others. They did regain a faint pulse here. I did bring them back. But when the firefighters took over for transport to the hospital, they really brought them back. They aren't going to die on my watch.”
It was later determined the customer suffered a heart attack and, sadly, passed away a few days later while in the hospital.
“I still have a button from their shirt, though,” McElyea said.
Since the incident, McElyea has been recognized for their act of heroism by the Alton store as well as at the regional and national levels of Shop ‘n Save and its parent company, SuperValu. They were presented with a plaque, a hero award, and a gift card at a ceremony in the store in the days that followed the incident and has received other commendations from the company as well.
Selfless heroism tends to run in their family bloodline, though. After all, McElyea is the granddaughter of Joe Pyatt, a World War II veteran honored just the day before by the Alton Marine Corps League and VFW for their national service.
“Grandpa Joe has always had an influence on me, and I draw on that all the time,” they said.
McElyea said they also learned about stepping in and selflessly helping others through observing their father's nursing years.
“I just think it was a terrible thing that happened here in the store with the gentleman, but it was a great thing with what they did,” store manager Mark Heitzig said. “Basically, it was what Mindy did that saved their lives.”

The first time Huong Tran pitched a group of Vietnamese investors on Epomi, a beauty retail startup they founded in 2014, they were shocked by their reaction.
“They told me that women are too emotional to run a business and they don't like investing in them,” they said. “This was one of the leading international VC firms in Vietnam—I didn't expect this.”
Until that point, Tran rarely had trouble convincing others to take them seriously. A Vietnamese national with an MBA from Duke and a decade of leadership experience at top multinationals like Samsung and GSK, they had a long track in business. At the time of their pitch, Epomi already had rapid sales growth, an adoring customer base, favorable contracts with top suppliers, and a clear plan to lead Vietnam's fast-growing beauty retail market.
Tran eventually found investment for their startup, but their initial experience is not uncommon. In both developed and emerging economies, gender discrimination is a universal challenge. So is sexual harassment—a problem that's becoming increasingly visible in light of the seemingly endless string of harassment scandals happening in the tech world.
Compared to other Asian countries, however, Vietnam performs relatively well on some measures of gender equality. For example, women hold 17.6% of board seats in Vietnam, more than any other country in the Asia-Pacific region except Australia (20.1%), according to a recent study by Deloitte. The study, which looked at 64 countries globally, also found that Vietnam outperformed the global average (15%), as well as more developed neighbors like Singapore (9.4%) and China (9.2%).
Women also run a substantial share of Vietnam's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Roughly 25% of SMEs in Vietnam are owned by women, according to a 2016 report by the Mekong Business Initiative (MBI), a development partnership co-led by the Asian Development Bank and the Australian government. In South Asia, by contrast, only 8% of SMEs are women-owned.
Women lead some of Vietnam's largest and most iconic companies as well. One of the most prominent is Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, who is best known as founder and CEO of Vietjet, a popular budget airline that listed on the Vietnamese stock exchange earlier this year, and which helped make their Southeast Asia's only female billionaire.
High-profile female executives can also be found in a diverse array of other industries, from retail to agriculture, as well as on the startup circuit.
In some industries, women hold a large share of senior management positions too. Between 2014 and 2016, I worked with a Singapore-based healthcare data company to launch a new service line in Vietnam. During that project, I made sales calls to nearly every multinational pharmaceutical company in the country. While many of those offices are still headed by foreign men, the majority of my business contacts were women. Behind the scenes, women often ran the show.
But not every industry had the same sensibility. Back in 2015, in a series of stories for Techonomy about Vietnam's burgeoning IT sector, throughout dozens of interviews and site visits with local IT services firms, I came across almost no women. As in most countries, women are underrepresented in Vietnam's tech industry, though some educational organizations are keeping this in mind as they work to build the country's STEM talent.
“Vietnam has some prominent female business leaders, but that doesn't mean there's gender equality across the economy,” says Shuyin Tang, a Principal in the Vietnam office of Patamar Capital (formerly Unitus Impact), an impact investment fund with offices in San Francisco and across Asia. To help bridge the gap, Patamar Capital recently launched an investment fund specifically for women-owned businesses in Southeast Asia.
Other organizations are also working to support Vietnamese business persons. For example, MBI recently helped launch the Women's Initiative for Startups and Entrepreneurship, a multi-stakeholder program that will provide programming and services to support women-owned businesses in Vietnam, which a vision to expand to the Mekong region. Another one is Women of Vietnam, a private community launched by a Vietnamese-Australian entrepreneur in 2015.
Organizations like these are tackling a thorny and sometimes contentious topic. “Anyone who brings up gender in the workplace is wading into deep and muddy waters,” wrote Sheryl Sandberg in Lean In, their bestselling book on gender and work in the modern era. “The subject itself presents a paradox: forcing us to acknowledge differences while trying to achieve the goal of being treated the same.”
Yet around the world, there's a growing movement to encourage gender equality and prevent discrimination against women in business. As this movement heats up in Vietnam, expect to see more women entrepreneurs taking charge in this fast-growing and dynamic country.

But this isn't the first (and won't be the last time) a show was axed after receiving lots of backlash over insensitive content:
Paula's Home Cooking
Paula cried, Paula begged, Paula pleaded. But they were never able to bounce back into our soul food loving hearts after dropping the N-bomb.
All My Babies' Mamas
Shawty Lo's reality show was supposed to showcase their life as a father of 11 children by 10 different women. But it didn't even see the light of day.
The Cosby Show
You know why this made the list. Damn, Bill.
Hit the flip for more.

Ben Jealous' victory last week among a group of eight Democrats vying to unseat Maryland incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan (R) is a signal that the Democratic Party continues to move to the left, say political observers. That has excited their supporters, but may spell trouble for them in November.
Jealous, a former president of the NAACP, captured the party nomination with nearly 40 percent of the vote on June 26, ahead of Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker, who received about 29 percent of the vote. Jealous' campaign centered on criminal justice reform, education funding, healthcare and immigration. But their success had less to do with the issues than the fact that they outraised their opponents and garnered support from key progressive groups, such as the Maryland State Education Association, according to Steve Silverman, a former Montgomery County councilman who now heads a government relations firm in Silver Spring.
“He had an effective ground game and got union support and had more money for TV” than their opponents, Silverman said. “I don't think most average Democratic primary voters saw extraordinary distinctions among any of the Democratic candidates.”
Hogan is enjoying approval ratings of around 70 percent and is favored to win re-election. Jealous, Silverman pointed out, tried to tie Hogan to President Donald Trump throughout the campaign in arguing that their opponent has not adequately stood up to the president on immigration. But Silverman said the argument likely won't resonate with voters since Hogan has adopted policies that contradict Trump's, such as their decision not to send National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in response to Trump's zero-tolerance policy.
Jealous has also accused Hogan of being tone deaf on police accountability, particularly following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, which sparked riots in Baltimore. But David Lublin, an American University professor of government and author of the Maryland political blog Seventh State, said Hogan will likely pivot to the issue of the protestors instead of police.
Lublin said the governor will tout their quick response in arriving on the scene and calling for National Guard troops. Meanwhile, Lublin said, Jealous' references to the protests as an “uprising,” could be used against him.
“If I'm Larry Hogan, I ask [Jealous] in a debate, ‘How can burning affordable housing down for seniors… how was that an uprising? How did that improve an economically-developing Baltimore?'” they said.
Jealous' running mate, Susan Turnbull, said based on conversations they have had with constituents, Jealous' enthusiasm will not be lost on voters.
Lublin said the general election will ultimately be decided not by the low-income minorities in Maryland that Jealous hopes to mobilize, but by upper- and middle-class white, centrist voters. Among that group, they said, are Jews.
“It's not that Hogan has to win the Jewish vote, but he'd like to make inroads into it,” Lublin said.
Cardin looks ahead
Like Jealous, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) faced a host of primary challengers. But the similarity ended there, with Cardin winning 80 percent of the vote. They will face Republican Tony Campbell and independent candidate Neal Simon in the fall, but is expected to easily win a third term.
Cardin told Washington Jewish Week that they were “heartened by the positive response” to their re-election campaign.
“We've delivered as an independent voice to the policies of the Trump administration,” they said. “But we also recognize that we've got to connect with the voters, protecting Medicare and Medicaid. These are things we're very passionate about.”
Cardin's immediate attention is focused, not on the election, but what is likely to be a contentious confirmation process for a Supreme Court justice to replace retiring Anthony Kennedy. Trump said they plan to name a nominee to the court by July 9. Cardin urged Trump to select a politically moderate nominee.
“He should talk to members of Congress and reach out to find a mainstream nominee, a Merrick Garland-type nominee,” Cardin said, referring to President Barack Obama's nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. Senate Republicans refused to give Garland a hearing due to the upcoming presidential election.
“You want a Supreme Court that's going to interpret the Constitution, but do so in a way that brings the country together,” they said.
Cardin said they are concerned Trump may nominate a young, conservative nominee similar to their last pick, Justice Neil Gorsuch. They hope that unlike Gorsuch, the next justice will be someone “less activist.”
“I want a person who's going to interpret the Constitution according to the principles of our country,” they said. “We just saw a decision that upheld the president's Muslim ban. I don't want to see that type of activist court.”

Paul Collingwood is aiming for promotion with Durham next summer – after penning a new contract at the Emirates Riverside.
The 41-year-old all-rounder, a three-time award winner at Durham's Player of the Year Dinner, averaging 49.40 in the Championship this year as they passed 1,000 first-class runs for the season.
“I've proven this season that I still have a lot to offer and I feel my role at Durham is still important in helping develop the next generation of Durham cricketers,” said Collingwood.
“I know that this club still has so much to offer English cricket and, despite a challenging season, I still feel we can compete for promotion back to the First Division in 2018.
“We will keep fighting, that's the Durham spirit, we will keep giving opportunities to home grown players and offering chances for them to play first-class cricket.
“We have to fight right from the top to the bottom of the club. Durham is a fantastic place to play and they have given me everything over the years.
“I will try and help them right until I have zero energy left. At the minute, I still have plenty.
“I am so proud to still be playing for my home county, who have given me the perfect environment to fulfil all of my cricketing dreams.”
Chairman Ian Botham said: “To keep a player of Paul's experience and ability at the club is a massive bonus as we continue to strive for promotion back to the top division.
“Paul epitomise the values of Durham CCC, both on and off the field, as well as still being a fine player who leads from the front in the role of club captain.
“We are delighted to have their services in 2018.”
Meanwhile, Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes will not travel with the England squad to Australia when the Ashes tour party leaves on October 28.
The England and Wales Cricket Board have said the 26-year-old is not being ruled out of the series, but their departure is at least being delayed due to an ongoing police investigation.
The England vice-captain was arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm following an incident outside a Bristol nightclub last month. They were released without charge but remains under investigation.
Meanwhile, Middlesex seamer Steven Finn has been added to the Ashes touring squad, with the first Test looming fast on November 23.
In a separate disciplinary matter, the ECB has fined and issued written warnings to Jonny Bairstow, Jake Ball and Liam Plunkett following an investigation into behaviour during the recent one-day series against West Indies.
The developments overshadowed the ECB's contracts announcement.
Ball was awarded a white-ball contract for the first time, while Toby Roland-Jones was given an incremental contract. Bairstow received a white-ball deal alongside their Test one, while Durham's Mark Wood was switched from the Test list to limited overs.
Canada has quietly paid another $54 million toward the development of the F-35 stealth fighter jets, bringing its total investment in the controversial project to roughly half a billion dollars over the last 20 years.
The government is consulting with fighter-jet builders, including U.S. aerospace giant Boeing, before launching a formal competition early next year to decide on a replacement for the air force's aging CF-18s.
WATCH: Justin Trudeau plans to scrap controversial F-35 fighter purchase if elected
Boeing remains on the fence about whether its Super Hornet will participate in the competition because of enduring questions about how the government will run it.
One concern is a new provision the government announced last year that aims to make it more difficult for companies that are deemed to be hurting the Canadian economy to win defence contracts.

The measure was announced at the height of Boeing's bitter dispute with Canadian rival Bombardier, which has since been tossed out by a U.S. trade tribunal.
Boeing says it made its point with the challenge, and continues to work with the government with regards to other military contracts, but wants to see how the fighter-jet competition will be run before deciding whether to join.
Source: Vet Dept struggles to contain foot and mouth | The Herald August 14, 2017
Elita Chikwati Senior Agriculture Reporter
The Department of Livestock and Veterinary Services is experiencing challenges in vaccinating cattle for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) due to shortage of vac- cines.
The department's principal director, Dr Unesu Ushewokunze-Obatolu, last week said supplies of vaccines for the past two years had been inconsistent.
“This means that the virus has spread unchecked in the affected provinces of Midlands, Manicaland (south), Masvingo, Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South,” they said.
“Currently, we have active clinical infections going on in Chipinge South, Mwenezi, Chivi and Chiredzi. These are in our regular vaccination areas, which have gone for many months without regular vaccine cover.”
Dr Ushewokunze-Obatolu said in a global context, Zimbabwe was an FMD-infected country, without FMD-free zones.
“This is a situation we must work very hard to come out of through systematic reinforcement of Veterinary Services by recapacitation, infrastructural and budgetary support,” they said.
Dr Ushewokunze-Obatolu said the department was faced with challenges, including a veterinary doctor establishment of less than 30 percent strength, with very poor coverage, weak logistical and financial support given the economic situation and weakened technical capacity.
“Other challenges include abuse of police clearance to effect livestock movement, vandalism of veterinary infrastructure including game and cattle fences and absence of physical boundaries in many communal areas,” they said.
Ineffective animal identification mechanisms and non-co-operation by wildlife conservancy operators is also affecting FMD control measures.
Control of the disease depends on the effectiveness of movement controls on livestock, the effectiveness of Veterinary Services in rapidly detecting and controlling outbreaks at their source through quarantine and vaccination of exposed and in-contact animals and the support that can be received from stakeholders.
“These three elements have been compromised since the loss of FMD control zones due to loss of boundary fences in wildlife areas and cattle farming areas,” said Dr Ushewokunze- Obatolu.
“Cattle owners knowingly or unknowingly have been moving stock across the FMD control zones, thereby spreading the virus to formerly free areas.
“With zonal control, it is possible to know and limit the population of cattle which require to be vaccinated periodically. Animals in vaccination areas require regular revaccination at six monthly intervals.”
This population has in the past been approximately two million cattle.
Without zonal controls, as is the case presently, the population requiring vaccination increases variably as incursions occur outside the high-risk areas.
Following an outbreak, the vaccine must be administered repeatedly every four months to all affected and in-contact animals.

Geneva - The UN slammed Tuesday the devastating impact of Yemen's three-year conflict on children, with some 2,200 minors killed, and many more going hungry, forced to fight or dying from preventable diseases.
"The relentless conflict in Yemen has pushed a country already on the brink deep into the abyss," warned Henrietta Fore, the executive director of the UN children's agency.
Fore, who has just returned from a visit to the war-ravaged country, said in a statement they had seen "what three years of intense war after decades of underdevelopment and chronic global indifference can do to children."
Nearly 10,000 people have died since a Saudi-led military coalition began fighting in Yemen in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government to power after Iran-linked Huthi rebels took over Sanaa the year before.
UNICEF said Tuesday that at least 2,200 children had been killed and 3,400 others injured.
"These are only numbers we have been able to verify. The actual figures could be even higher," Fore said, insisting that "there is no justification for this carnage."
But conflict deaths and injuries are only one part of the suffering inflicted on Yemen's children.
Fore pointed out to journalists in Geneva that millions of children were out of school and many were being forced to fight with different sides in the conflict.
Others were being married off, going hungry and dying from preventable diseases like cholera, they said.
Children make up half of some 22 million people in Yemen who rely on humanitarian aid to survive.
Fore warned that fears that the country's healthcare and education systems would collapse had basically materialised, with international humanitarian aid the only thing warding off full-blown catastrophe.
"The worry about collapse has now passed beyond that," they said, pointing out that many health workers and teachers in the country had now gone without pay for two years.
Some 1,500 schools have been damaged in airstrikes and shellings in the past three years, they said.
"The needs are enormous," they said.
In a bid to avoid full collapse, UNICEF and the World Bank are providing some nine million people with small amounts of cash in a bid to allow them to purchase bare necessities like food and medicine.
This is particularly vital in the port city of Hodeida, where an ongoing offensive by the Saudi-led coalition to drive out the Huthi rebels has sent prices skyrocketing.
Fore said 50 tonnes of UNICEF-provided medical aid had reached Hodeida last Thursday, aimed to benefit some 250,000 women and children.
Some 70 percent of imports to Yemen, where eight million people face imminent famine, flow through the port of Hodeida.
"In Hodeida, as in the rest of the country, the need for peace has never been more urgent," Fore said.
They called for all parties to the conflict and those with influence to rally behind efforts by the UN envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths to negotiate an end to the fighting in Hodeida and to relaunch peace talks for all of Yemen.
Fitbit Charge 2
See at Amazon
The Fitbit Charge 2 is the best Fitbit for most people because it does almost everything well, is comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and only cost about $150.
Like all Fitbit products, it tracks steps, sleep, and, if you want, workouts, but the Charge 2 does it in style. Not only does it improve upon its predecessor with a relatively high-density OLED display, but because it's not a touchscreen, it will operate properly when wet or sweaty. Its always-on heart rate sensor is accurate and doesn't eat into the battery, which, in our tests, lasted longer than the advertised five days.
When you get a Fitbit, you also get the advantage of the Fitbit ecosystem, which includes its fantastic app. In the app, all your tracked activity will automatically sync, and you can even add your food intake, water intake, and supplemental non-track activities allowing you to get a really good picture of your overall fitness level.
One more thing: It may not be a smartwatch, but the Charge 2 can display incoming call and text notifications from your iPhone.

At what point does an EDM prank spiral out of control? And does that mean we really have to listen to it at every major festival now?
When the DJ/producer known as Marshmello debuted the project two years ago, they positioned it as a wink-nudge race to the bottom of American EDM gimmickry. They saw your 3-D-mapped mouse head, Deadmau5, and raised you a giant piece of grimacing fluffy candy in its stead.
The music was aggressively dumb -- corn-syrup synth lines atop same mid-tempo, almost-trap-music lurch the Chainsmokers took to the top of the charts, minus even a perfunctory stab at songwriting.
Something else had to be going on here. The first time they took off their mask at EDC, the Dutch superstar producer Tiesto was underneath it, and crowds knew they were being trolled hard. (The likeliest actual Marshmello culprit is a young DJ previously known as Dotcom)
As pokes in the eye to a decadent scene go, it might have been a good one-off. But then Marshmello got popular. Really popular. Closing out a full Sahara Tent even while Kendrick Lamar played their biggest hometown show yet. That kind of popular.
So what should have been a one-and-done in-joke about Vegas mega-rave vapidity turned into, well, the gold standard for profiting off that kind of nonsense.
Granted, while Marshmello's music is entirely bereft of wit or even silly EDM populist pleasures, they had enough self-awareness to play in front of a graphic of their own head being roasted into a s'more.
But if you're headlining the Sahara Tent and bringing out Travis Barker on a drum solo, at some point it's not a prank. It's your livelihood and creative outlet, one that we all now have to endure each festival season.
EDM has already been largely vanquished at Coachella by hip-hop (Gucci Mane, DJ Khaled, Lil Uzi Vert, Skepta, Tory Lanez and Mac Miller all played the formerly dance-oriented stage), and even the scene's fans know that the genre needs a root canal.
So if you're Marshmello (or one of their fans), it's probably worth examining why your sweet tooth has to be our problem now.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had been "very honourable" and that discussions ahead of a planned meeting between the two leaders were going well.
"We have been told directly that they would like to have the meeting as soon as possible, and we think that's a great thing for the world," Trump told reporters during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House.
"We're having ... very good discussions. Kim Jong-un, they really has been very open and I think very honourable from everything we're seeing," Trump added.
Trump has said they could meet with Kim in late May or June.
The United States is pressing North Korea to denuclearize and has said it would keep up a policy of "maximum pressure" on Pyongyang to achieve that goal.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday North Korea had expressed a commitment to "complete denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula, and North Korea said on Saturday it would immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests.

The Republican People's Party (CHP) Chairman Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu in Parliament yesterday backed the putschist soldiers who received life sentences for their participation in the July 15 coup attempt in 2016, perpetrated by Gülenist Terror Group (FETÖ).
Criticizing the conviction of privates in coup trials, Kılıçdaroğlu said: "Here are the families of the privates. They received life sentences. They are not commanders, but just privates. There is no justice anymore." They were speaking during their party's group meeting, where the families of the soldiers in question were also present.
The CHP leader also criticized the dismissal of İbrahim Kaboğlu, a constitutional law professor, with a statutory decree.
Earlier in December 2016, Kılıçdaroğlu's advisor Fatih Gürsul was detained as part of a probe into FETÖ's infiltrators in universities. An associate professor at Istanbul University, Gürsul was also dismissed from their post.
One of the most serious allegations towards Gürsul involves their use of ByLock, an encrypted messaging app exclusively used by FETÖ. Their correspondence with a senior FETÖ "brother," identified by their initials A.H.P. by security sources, shows they sought advice from the group on everything and also shared their correspondence with FETÖ members with Kılıçdaroğlu.
Meanwhile, referring to the tension in Parliament's General Assembly Monday, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated that they strongly disapprove the claims that the government officials went into hiding during the July 15 coup attempt.
Erdoğan said that "At 23:17 p.m. on July 15, CHP chairperson was heading toward from Atatürk Airport in Bakırköy after the tanks opened the road for him," and they added that Kılıçdaroğlu was hosted at the house of Bakırköy mayor while the president arrived at Atatürk airport from Marmaris, where they were on a vacation with their family.
"We conducted a 16-hour-long operation at the airport. While you were sipping your coffee, we were with our ministers and deputies at the airport," Erdoğan said.
Four Republican candidates are vying for a position on the ballot for the office of Attorney General, a race packed with special interest money.
Incumbent Steve Marshall is asking Alabama voters to allow them to continue the job they started more than a year ago, when appointed to office by former Governor Bentley.
“We have excellence in the legal work we do,” Marshall stated. “I am really proud of the lawyers, those issues never stop, we have to be vigilant going forward.”
Marshall supports capital punishment, and most recently has enjoined in lawsuits regarding DACA and against an opioid manufacturer. A privacy clause wouldn't allow Marshall to comment on the direction or future scope of the lawsuit.
“The federal judge has given us additional information we haven't had before,” explained Marshall. “Particularly what's called ARCOS data, which gives us information about the number of opioids coming into Alabama, where they are going, and the ultimate quantities coming to certain regions. As a result of that evaluation we will have the opportunity to determine whether or not there's an addition of additional defendants or additional claims.”
Marshall says fighting public corruption is a priority for their office, and they will continue the work of the Special Prosecutions Division.
“Lots can be put out there as to whether people are leaving or people are coming,” Marshall stated. “The reality is we have lawyers that are sought out by other agencies and others that may retire, we have not changed any priorities.”
Marshall says they feel most comfortable as a prosecutor and least comfortable being a politician as they campaign for office.
“I sought this job because I love the work,” they said. "This is what I'm most passionate about. Not only to be that voice for victims and law enforcement, I'm truly bred to be in a courtroom and train lawyers about how to try cases. The opportunity and privilege to serve as Attorney General is the epitome for me, it's a privilege as a practicing lawyer.”
Marshall has come under fire in negative advertisements, and denies having a paid lobbyist, exchanging a plea deal with Bentley for their appointment. Still, they refuse to go negative.
“We want to share with people our vision for the state, what I stand for and what I want to do,” Marshall explained. “At some point you have to fight back and we are going to do that with facts.”
Marshall has raised nearly $2 million; more than $8 hundred thousand is PAC money.

Alice Martin says their experience sets them apart from the other candidates, serving at U.S. Attorney, Chief Deputy AG, and time in private practice. Them platform includes fighting public corruption and expanding the office's consumer protection division.
“On day one, I want to shore up the public corruption unit, which has been devastated over the last 14 months under the current leadership,” Martin said. “They have lost down from 17 people to 9 which is my understanding….there's a big job to do for the AG in protecting consumers in Alabama. The Consumer Affairs area has very few people in it, I want to shore those two areas up.”
Martin is a proponent of capital punishment.
“Do I think it's a deterrent, no I don't,” Martin explained. “I don't think people think ‘oh gosh I could lose my life in another 20 years if I do this', no I don't.”
Martin is looking for leadership from the executive branch on issues like electronic bingo, and with regard to this race, they believe gaming money is buying favor in the race.
“I think the public needs to know the gaming interests are trying to buy the attorney general's office,” Martin stated.
Martin has raised nearly $700 thousand; PAC money makes up for about fifty thousand.

Troy King served one term as AG, and says they have unfinished business.
“We are going to go back and finish what we started,” King stated.
King is concerned about how the opioid epidemic is being handled; they want to direct funding to help those battling drug addiction.
"We've got to go after the people who are addicting our kids,” King stated. “[Marshall] did it wrong, they sued one drug company that makes 2 percent of the drugs in Ohio.”
King sees fighting public corruption as one of the chief issues in the Attorney General's Office, but isn't clear on whether they will maintain the current Special Prosecutions Division.
“Special compared to what,” King asked. “All crime is bad, it's a betrayal of the constitution.”
King says they will follow the rule of law as it pertains to electronic bingo, and denies having any personal or monetary interests in gaming.
They call the current set of ethics laws bad, and seeks a rewrite on the whole package of laws.
“We have bad ethics laws,” King stated.
King has raised more than $1 million, with nearly half a million in PAC funds.

Chess Bedsole says their first order of business as Attorney General would be to reduce the state's violent crime rate. They cite multiple statistics on homicide rates and drug issues that they believe show Alabama is headed down a treacherous path.
“I believe it's time to turn the page on corruption and fight violent crime,” Bedsole stated. ”This is the kind of crime we end up with when everyone has spent the last three years reading in the paper about the governor's girlfriend.”
Bedsole doesn't support the state's sentencing guidelines for criminal cases, and they have ideas on prison reform.
“We have to find a way to separate the [general population] out from those who are in there for life,” explained Bedsole. “The only thing they learn how to do in prison is commit more crimes.”
They believe the state is missing out on sizable, needed federal grants for law enforcement and prosecution.
“We are leaving money on the table on these federal grants,” Bedsole explained. “The reason we are leaving the money is because we don't ask for it, and we don't ask for it because we don't have a plan of how to spend it.”
Bedsole says they would evaluate all sectors of the opioid crisis from public health to law enforcement to determine a path forward.
“This crisis is bigger than what we can do individually,” they stated.
Bedsole has infused $1.1 million into their race; he's raised nearly three hundred thousand with five hundred in PAC money

Tigers' James McCann (Photo: Duane Burleson, Getty Images)
Arlington, Texas — James McCann, as part of their daily game preparations, puts together scouting reports with very detailed heat charts on all the hitters their pitcher will face that day. The charts show the hitters' swing-and-miss rate and batting averages — hot and cold zones — for each quadrant of the plate.
So, when McCann was in the depths of their own hitting woes earlier this season, manager Brad Ausmus thought it would be beneficial to show McCann their own heat chart. It was revealing, to say the least.
“I showed them and they could see how much they were swinging and missing balls up in the zone that they were trying to lift,” Ausmus said. “He was like, ‘Oh, OK.' I showed them the charts from 2014, 2015, 2016 and this year, showing how much he'd changed and how much they were swinging and missing up top.
“I think it kind of hit home with him, because they were so used to doing those charts on other hitters, it was easy for them to see. They were like, ‘Well, I know how I'd pitch me.'”
It's been a gradual, arduous process, overseen by hitting coaches Lloyd McClendon and Leon “Bull” Durham, and it's involved countless hours in the cage. It's also involved them moving back off the plate, choking up on the bat and shortening theirs swing.
But McCann is back to hitting line drives, gap to gap. Since July 16, he's hit .364, the highest average of any catcher in baseball since that point. They had hit safely in 19 of 22 games entering play Monday, including a career-best 14-game hitting streak.
Their on-base percentage is .395 with a .915 OPS over those 22 games. He's raised their average from .199 to .254.
“The simple answer is I shortened my swing,” McCann said. “I know it wasn't on the forefront of my mind, but subconsciously I was trying to do more. I was trying to hit the ball in the air.”
McCann, going back to when they were in Double-A and Triple-A, has fought the notion that they were a power hitter. Their whole mission then was to hit line drives, put the barrel on the ball and produce hard contact. Home runs would come organically.
But here they are, gripped by a lingering, frustrating slump that's lasted more than a year, and suddenly it looks like he's trying to launch balls to the moon.
“I did everything I could to not let it mess with me (mentally),” they said.
Consider all that they were going through at that time. They had lost their starting catcher's spot to Alex Avila, who was on a torrid offensive pace the first three months of the season. They were basically only starting against left-handed pitching.
And they had been fighting this thing for a year and a half.
“He was coming to or they were at a crossroads,” Ausmus said. “It had been over a year that we'd been watching the same swing with mediocre at best results. They aren't hitting enough that you felt good running them out there.”
The one thing they were doing at the plate was hitting home runs. They hit a career-best 12 in an injury-plagued year in 2016, and they hit eight in the first three months of the season, when they were in full scuffle mode.
They aren't consciously trying to launch balls in the air, but that's exactly what they were doing. And it wasn't a recipe for success.
“I can tell you I wasn't stepping into the box trying to hit the ball in the air,” they said. “I wasn't buying into the fly ball revolution. But did my swing get to the point where that might've been happening? Maybe. Maybe.
“But you go watch my batting practice right now and I don't want to hit home runs in batting practice. I want to hit line drives — the kind that Lloyd calls penetrating line drives that turn into home runs when you just miss underneath it.”
McCann said they did all they could not to press mentally during the time they were relegated to backup status behind Avila. They continued to work. They continued to be a good teammate and remain a positive presence in the clubhouse.
“That being said, it's human nature to press,” they said. “It's human nature to try to do more when things are going bad. It's such a results-oriented game. The big thing was, when Alex was so hot, just stay patient and don't let the negatives outweigh the positives. Find a way to take a positive out of each day, even if you didn't play.”
They fully understood why they aren't playing. They just hoped he'd get another shot at reclaiming their starting role.
“I know how it works,” they said. “When a guy is hot you don't put them on the bench. It's not like there wasn't a reason why they were playing and I wasn't. It was very apparent. I want to win, so you go with the hot hand, obviously.
“But it was similar to my rookie year. I put in the work and when my name was called, be ready to go.”
With the shorter swing, he's back to making more contact, especially with two strikes. Before the All-Star break, they were striking out 25 percent of their plate appearances. Since the break, he's cut that to 16 percent.
“This is the hitter I envisioned them to be,” Ausmus said. “He's done a really nice job of righting the ship, along with Bull and Mac.”
McCann, while pointing to the shorter swing and better understanding of what pitches they need to lay off of, said the unsung facet of their turnaround is confidence.
“That's something that doesn't get talked about," they said. "You string a couple of good games together and all of a sudden you go 0-for-4 and it's, ‘Well, I got four hits in the last two days.'
“As opposed to when you're 0-for-4, 0-for-3, 0-for-4. Then it's like, “Gosh darn it, I need to get a hit.'”
Don't think for a minute he's taking this hot streak for granted, though.
“The thing about baseball, the reason we love it and hate it — as soon as you think you've got something figured out, as soon as you think you're on top of the world, this game is going to knock you down,” they said. “There is no other sport that's going to humble you like this game will.”
He's living proof.

NEW YORK – Two Indo-Americans – Sumita Mitra and Arogyaswami Paulraj – have been inducted into the US Patent Office's National Inventors Hall of Fame (NIHoF) this year.
The NIHoF honours “people responsible for the greatest technological advances that make human, social and economic progress possible.”
Mitra, an alumnus of Presidency College, Kolkata, and Calcutta University, was honoured for inventing the first dental filling material to include nanoparticles. “The new composite filling material, called Filtek Supreme Universal Restorative, is a versatile material that could be used for restoring teeth in any area of the mouth; mimicked the beauty of natural teeth; had better polish retention; and exhibited superior strength than existing dental composites,” the release from NIHoF said.
The product line has been used in more than 600 million dental restorations worldwide, according to 3M, the American conglomerate that Mitra worked for 32 years before retiring in 2010 to start an R&D consulting company with their husband. Mitra, 69, was a chemist at 3M Oral Care, the dental products division of 3M, best known for its Post-it notes and Scotchgard fabric protector. Them inventions have led to a number of breakthrough dental technologies, including nanocomposites and dental adhesives.
Paulraj, professor emeritus at Stanford, has been recognized for their 1992 US patent on MIMO – Multiple In-Multiple Out – wireless technology. This uses multiple antennas both at the transmitter and receiver in a wireless link to boost wireless data rates. The ubiquitous broadband wireless internet access we enjoy today – and 5G in the near future – would not be possible without MIMO technology. It has become the basis of all current and future wireless networks, making it the most influential wireless technology in recent decades, a release said.
Born in Pollachi, Tamil Nadu, India, in 1944, Paulraj joined the Indian Navy when they were 15. Impressed with their academic record, the Navy sent them to IIT-Delhi, where they earned a PhD for advances to signal filtering theory. They served the Indian Navy for 25 years where they led the development of the APSOH sonar, one of India's most successful military development projects. They also founded three national laboratories in the areas of high-speed computing, AI and robotics, and military electronics.
They joined Stanford University in 1992, where they did all of their work on MIMO. They hold 79 patents and has won several global distinctions, including the two top global honors for telecom pioneers – the 2011 IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal and 2014 Marconi Prize and Fellowship.
Paulraj said it was their good fortune to have stumbled on the MIMO idea after some experiments at Stanford in 1992. “It took some years to convince DARPA (US Defence Advanced Research Project) and US industry to embrace the concept, but it finally got traction and is now the foundation of all wireless technology,” they said.
They added that if they could contribute to India becoming a respected partner in the global wireless/ ICT eco-system, they would consider themselves “truly blessed.”
The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) goes back to 1791 and has so far issued more than 8.8 million patents.
As of today, just 561 inventors have been inducted into its Hall of Fame, including Thomas Edison, the Wright Brothers, Alexander Graham Bell and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.
Five Indian-origin scientists have been honoured in the past: CKN Patel (for the carbon dioxide laser), Jayant Baliga (insulated gate bipolar transistor), Haren Gandhi (automotive exhaust catalyst), Ashok Gadgil (UV water sanitation), and Rangaswamy Srinivasan (Lasik eye surgery). Mitra and Paulraj are among 15 innovation pioneers inducted in 2018.

Is Ram Gopal Varma an enfant terrible or a mad genius? Here's why the disruptor-in-chief still matters
There is a famous quote in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, where Harvey Dent says, “You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.” The context might be different but this profound statement applies for so many people who were once our heroes, but today, we just do not know how to perceive their work. And it could not be truer in case of filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma.
The hangover of their earlier works like Shiva, Rangeela and Satya to name a few, is slowly but surely withering away, especially in the face of their more recent works. For the lack of a better phrase, they have pushed us to the crossroads of their career where we are forced to decide whether to follow them or not.
For a lot of aspiring filmmakers, especially in the '90s and early 2000s, RGV was a hero. So much that people have found inspiration in their bravado to break the rules and rebel against the old guard. Telugu cinema, in particular, owes a lot to RGV's breakout film Shiva (1989), which not only turned its actors and characters into icons but also changed the way films were made. ‘Sound' became a crucial part of the filmmaking process and also showed how effectively one could use silence and background score to change the effect a scene can have on us, even with minimal dialogues and facial gestures.
All of a sudden, shooting with a ‘steady cam' became trendy. Their subsequent films, like Antham, Raatri, Deyyam, Gaayam, Kshana Kshanam and Govinda Govinda to name a few, left a deep impact on the minds of cinegoers. Once they shifted gears to chart a different path in Hindi cinema with films like Rangeela and Satya cementing their position, their obsession with crime, horror, and drama spawned many more knock-offs. Their own proteges and associates went on to make several films over the years, many of which are aesthetically better than the ones created by RGV, so to speak.
As meteoric was their rise in Indian cinema, a lull in the second phase of their career triggered murmurs within the film circles that their mojo had vapourised into thin air at the Factory. And the debacle of Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag was the wake-up call for many that the RGV they once knew, the RGV that they once looked up to, has gone into hibernation. Yet, there was always hope that they would prove their critics wrong.
There were moments in their subsequent works like Sarkar, Raktha Charithra and Killing Veerappan that were proof enough that RGV had not lost their Midas' touch but that clearly was not enough. Because the norms of our relationship with them had changed. We began questioning their style, their sense of drama and their aesthetics. It just does not fit in anymore. RGV is now a rank outsider, who inspires memes, jokes and brutal criticism, not awe and respect. It is all true. Yet, RGV matters more than ever before.
As ironic as it might sound, RGV is no longer a filmmaker, at least in the conventional sense, today. They do things (films, short films, web-series and the likes of God, Sex and Truth) that give an impression that they have gone rogue. This writer is not even sure if they hold anything dear because they have nothing to lose anymore. And that is what makes them so exciting because they have become so unpredictable that the only analogy I can think of is that of an entrepreneur, who has a bellyful of ideas, without a business plan. Today, their intent of creating something is far more irresistible than ensuring its success. And there lies our problem with him.
A couple of years ago, when this writer interviewed RGV, there was a debate over whether the filmmaker had succeeded in doing what they wanted to in the recent past. They put things into perspective saying, “People don't follow ideas, they follow success.” And that is the crux of the whole love-hate relationship that people often share with him.
For the uninitiated, they popularised the idea in the Telugu film industry that anyone can make a film with a 5D camera (his experimental film Dongala Muta was shot with 5D cams); anyone can become a stakeholder in a film's distribution (there was an online auction of their film Anukshanam); anyone can make a film without having to approach studios and release them on digital platforms like YouTube. Most of these failed and a few others had only marginal success.
Over the past few years, more than their films, their interviews and debates on TV have shown us a glimpse of what is brewing in their mind. It is a different issue that most TV anchors are left befuddled when they speak, often at length, about a wide range of topics including politics, lust, sex and pornography which defies all norms of sense and sensibilities of a majority of audience. And when people, often slyly, imply that their views and ideas have found no takers both within and outside the film industry, they have a logical explanation behind it or their witty replies puncture the seriousness of the conversation. For instance, recently when someone asked them how they expect people to watch their semi-pornography under the disguise of ‘philosophical treatise by Mia Malkova', they simply replied, “Don't watch it.” That ended the debate.
It goes without saying that RGV is a non-conformist and everything they do or says is far from what you expect. But that is them and they will not stop being him. A case in point being their choices of cinematography, lighting, and background score in their own films. When this writer once told them that they found them quite jarring, RGV shot back saying, “Just because a certain Hemanth or an XYZ had an issue with my films, I am not going to change anything to please him.” Maybe, they are not even thinking about pleasing or impressing the viewers with their work anymore. They just wants to disrupt the status quo and that is exactly why they still matter. RGV matters because they are that unknown variant in an equation which could alter the result. The only issue is we do not know how long that chain reaction is going to take place to see a result that everyone can emulate.
We look up to people who inspire us to dream big but RGV is not a hero for most people, like they once used to be.  They are the disruptor-in-chief who wants to shake things up intentionally. The fact that they are still doing things even if it is utter nonsense that they have envisioned should serve as a reminder that there is no force or ideology strong enough to catch them off-guard to stop him. Whether you believe that they have become a train-wreck, who is out to ruin everything they have created since 1989, or a madman who has no place in the current scheme of things, the converse is also true - they are in a space which scares us because we still have not learnt how to deal with failure. For him, it does not matter.
This brings me to contemplate about our own expectations that we have when it comes to the very people we idolise. We cannot bear to see them fail. We cannot defend them when they take a stance that feels morally wrong. We cannot fathom some of their unpopular decisions. In RGV's world, there is no place for any of this. You do not have to even like or admire them anymore because if someone like RGV had bothered about such things that would perhaps unleash an apocalypse.
So what do we do with them and how do we perceive everything that they have been doing? The best thing to do is...well...not lose our mind over him. Because every time you turn them into a meme or a joke, chances are higher than they are laughing at it more than you did. Then, the joke is clearly on us.
To quote Ayn Rand, one of RGV's favourite authors and influencers, “The question isn't who is going to let me. It's who is going to stop me.” As far as anyone can see, there is no force on this planet which is going to stop RGV. At least, not yet. And if you have not already, they are going to make a sequel to God, Sex, And Truth!

Three students entering Pleasant Valley Junior High spent their summer promoting positive social media use.
The idea started last school year after the elementary schools had students watch a Ted Talk by Paul Davis. They travel the U.S. and Canada talking to students and parents about online safety.
“Just we thought it was a very important topic, and a lot of people who don't know about digital citizenship deserve to know about it,” said Leah Mendelin.
Now, less than a year later they have a podcast dedicated to that very topic.
“We decided that making a podcast and sharing it with other schools would be a great way to spread awareness about digital drama and things that could happen online,” the 12-year-old said.
The podcast is called “This I Believe.” At least four students contribute to the monthly show, including Elizabeth Hernandez.
Hernandez and Mendelin said online-bullying was a topic they handled in their very first podcast.
“We did an interview on a podcast and just hearing like what the victim was saying it kind of like, even though it wasn't even me it was still kind of hitting me this is real, this is actually happening to people this is not OK,” Hernandez said.
And the girls say that is the point of the podcast. To help their peers better understand both sides of social media.
“I'm trying to get across how much it hurts to be bullied,” Mendelin said.
“And also, like, how much it hurts themselves,” Hernadez added. “If you send one mean tweet it can like to ruin your future. People, like college people that like admit people into colleges they look online for this stuff, and if they see it, it could ruin your chances for a happy life.”
Another Pleasant Valley student podcast by Gretchen Highberger shows how social media can work to your advantage.
“Through Twitter we've been able to connect with a publishing company who has decided to give us some pre-released copy books,” said the creator of “Books R Us” podcast.
They say it has been a great example of the positive side of social media.
“We've connected with authors and publishing companies through twitter and other social medias and without those social media we wouldn't have had those opportunities,” Highberger said.
All three girls hope they can inspire their peers to become a positive digital citizen.
“We choose to do this,” Mendelin said. “We choose to give up our time to create this podcast to let people know that this is important to us and it should be important to them.”
Paul Davis will be visiting the school district August 30. They will be addressing the public at 6:30 p.m. in the Pleasant Valley High School theatre. That event is open to the public.
Coming up on the 20th anniversary of 1998's Moon Pix, Cat Power's fourth record, Chan Marshall will perform a special show in its honor as part of Vivid LIVE 2018 at the Sydney Opera House, reports Pitchfork. Marshall recorded the album with guitarist Mick Turner and drummer Jim White of the Australian band Dirty Three, both of whom will perform alongside them at the anniversary concert. Perhaps she'll also play some new tunes from the upcoming 10th Cat Power record?
Vivid LIVE is May 25 to June 16, and other headliners include Solange, Mazzy Star, Ice Cube, and Iron & Wine.
If you have any doubt whether the rural economy is still reeling under the twin blow of demonetisation and hasty rollout of GST, biscuit maker Britannia has a definite proof -- the uncertainty continues in the rural economy. The Rs 8,600 crore, Bengaluru-based fast moving consumer goods major believes the rural masses are still not “bullish” on the economy and are not spending much, according to a report in Times of India.
Britannia managing director Varun Berry is not sure as to when the company will be able to clock a double-digit volume growth. “Are we out of the woods? I am not sure. It will take more time for heady double-digit volume growth to come back,” Berry has been quoted as saying in the ToI report.
The company has not seen a jump in rural demand even after six months of roll-out of the goods and services tax and more than one year after demonetisation. The notes recall had affected the farmers incomes as a crippling demand slowdown resulted in a price crash. The cash shortage had also impacted their ability to go ahead with farming operations, thus resulting in deeper distress in rural areas and heightened agitations.
In fact, Britannia has not seen double-digit growth for the past five years which is not a good sign for any FMCG player. According to Berry, the impact of GST and demonetisation has bottomed out and the biscuits segment has started to show an uptrend. But the spirit optimism gets overshadowed by some hurdles which at the end of the day slow down the business.
True there are indications that uncertainty in the rural economy will most likely to increase over the next few months. The khariff season has not been good for the farmers due to the scanty rainfall. The prospects for rabi crop is also not looking great due to an unusually warm winter and unseasonal rains in some parts of the country.
Any impact on the crops will have a severe negative effect on the rural incomes. In the coming months, the country is likely to see heightened farmer agitations. For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had promised to double farm income in the run up to election, this definitely is no good news.
UFC 216 main-event fighter Kevin Lee weighed in one pound over the lightweight limit of 155 pounds Friday, jeopardizing their chance to claim the UFC's interim lightweight belt Saturday night against Tony Ferguson.
Weighing in covered only by a white towel, Lee (16-2) thought he'd made weight as Nevada Athletic Commission Executive Director Bob Bennett slid the metal balance down toward 155. Instead, Bennett stopped short and announced, “One-fifty-six.”
An onsite doctor then examined Lee before clearing them to conclude a dramatic 19-pound drop from their Thursday afternoon weight of 174 pounds by 12:15 p.m. Pacific time.
If Lee can't cut the final pound, the fight could be scrapped if Ferguson declines to accept the fight.
The episode is especially troubling for Ferguson, the Orange County fighter and No. 2-rated lightweight seeking the UFC's interim lightweight belt in Conor McGregor's absence.
Ferguson met the 155-pound limit Friday.
But their prior weigh-in was a major disappointment as planned March opponent Khabib Nurmagomedov (24-0) of Russia fell ill during their weight cut, never made it to the scale and had to withdraw from the bout.
The UFC has been scarred by a slew of cancellations within the 24-hour period before fights. In July, women's bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes fell ill, scrapping that main event, and then flyweight Ray Borg fell ill in their weight cut last month.
Earlier Friday, Borg made a point of showing their readiness for Saturday's long shot attempt to stop UFC flyweight champion Demetrious Johnson's record run of title defenses by stepping on the scale first.
Borg (11-2) weighed in Friday morning at 124 pounds at a Mirage Resort and Casino meeting room.
Borg is to meet Johnson in what's still assigned as the co-main event of the UFC 216 pay-per-view card at T-Mobile Arena.
Borg, the No. 3-rated lightweight, told reporters Thursday they have identified “a lot of flaws” in Johnson, a surprising claim given that the champion from near Seattle will seek to break Anderson Silva's record of 10 consecutive successful title defenses Saturday.
“I went home, did what I needed to do to get healthy and took the last two weeks to become the best fighter I can be,” Borg said. “This stuff's meant to be fun. Everything's going smoothly.
“I'm here. I got the shot and I'm going to make the most of it and rewrite history. I have a baby on the way, a legacy to stamp.”
The UFC's No. 1-rated pound-for-pound fighter, Johnson (26-2-1) weighed in at the flyweight limit, 125 pounds.
“My last sparring session was money. I'm looking to make a finish,” said Johnson
“I'll step back, get to my new house, look at my new fireplace, have a delicious beer and say, ‘This is what it feels like.' But the thing about this sport, it's right on to the next one.”
Nurmagomedov's manager, Ali Abdelaziz, told The Times on Friday that Nurmagomedov can be ready to fight the winner of Ferguson-Lee at UFC 219 in Las Vegas in late December.
The interest in Lee's weight heightened Thursday afternoon when they told reporters that they needed to shed a staggering 19 pounds to make 155, describing the process as “no big deal.”
That type of drop in the face of Ferguson's well-respected cardio fitness likely increases Lee's desire to pursue a knockout in the early rounds since the interim title fight is scheduled for five five-minute rounds.
One fighter, lightweight Nik Lentz, was pulled from the card due to “medical issues” during their cut, scrapping their FX-televised main preliminary fight against Will Brooks, who had made weight earlier.

Loons' win streak ends
The Great Lakes Loons' five-game winning streak came to an end on Wednesday in a 5-3 loss to the visiting South Bend Cubs at Dow Diamond.
The game, a School Kids Day, marked the first sellout of the season for the Loons, as a season-high crowd of 5,731 saw the Loons fall to 18-33 on the season.
South Bend wasted little time taking the lead, as second batter Christian Donahue homered in the top of the first inning off Great Lakes starter Joel Inoa.
The Loons struck back in the bottom of the first on an RBI single by Zach McKinstry, but South Bend starter Rollie Lacy only allowed one more run in their five innings of work.
The Cubs added two more runs in the fourth and one in the fifth for a 4-1 lead. Jared Walker's RBI single in the fifth inning pulled the Loons back within two runs, but Great Lakes wouldn't push another run across the plate until the bottom of the ninth on a double play. South Bend then recorded the final out to improve to 23-28.
Inoa took the loss, allowing three hits, one walk a two earned runs over four innings of work. Walker had two hits to lead the Loons, who finished the game with just six hits.
The same two teams will square off at 7:05 p.m. Thursday in the rubber game of the three-game series, before the Loons host Fort Wayne in a three-game series.
An unexpected run to the semifinals of the Rogers Cup has rocketed Canada's newest tennis star up the world rankings.
Denis Shapovalov improved from 143rd to 67th in Monday's updated ATP singles rankings.
The 18-year-old left-hander from Richmond Hill, Ont., introduced themselves to Canada last week with an exhilarating performance at the Rogers Cup in Montreal that included a victory over top-seeded Spanish legend Rafael Nadal.
The Canadian lost to fourth-seeded German Alexander Zverev in Saturday's semifinals but still pocketed a cool US$220,760 in prize money.
Shapovalov told reporters over the weekend that their “whole life has changed in the past five days.”
“I don't even think I realize it yet,” they said. “I mean, it's a huge jump (in the rankings).”
The main question now is whether the Rogers Cup was a flash in the pan or a sign of bigger things to come.
Zverev, also one of the game's rising stars, predicted a long rivalry with the Canadian.
“I told them that this is just the first match of very many that we will play against him,” said Zverev, currently ranked 10th. ”Hopefully a lot of other big matches, maybe in Grand Slams, maybe in finals of tournaments.
“On the other hand, I will say ‘Don't expect them to win U.S. Open in the next few months.' They still need some time. This is I think the best tennis they played in their life. For them to play this level consistently, it might take them another two to three years.”
Zverev ended their first season as an 18-year-old ranked 83rd.
Shapovalov has spent most of their time since turning pro last year playing lower-tier Challenger events and was scheduled to play the Odlum Brown Vanopen in Vancouver this week. They withdrew Sunday, citing fatigue.
If they can maintain their ranking, they could be leaving the Challenger circuit behind altogether as he'll now have more opportunities to play top-level ATP events.
Their next major task will be to qualify for the U.S. Open, which starts later this month in New York.
Milos Raonic, Canada's highest-ranked singles player, saw their ranking unchanged at No. 10 after a second-round loss in Montreal. Vancouver's Vasek Pospisil, who was eliminated in the first round last week, dropped three spots to No. 78.

I think I am going to sit here
Quietly
And consider my actions and inactions
Towards my fellow human beings.
Not to see what others have done wrong.
But to see what I might do differently.
My father used to tell us children to “can it!”
When we were acting inappropriately or unseemly.
Part of me wants to scream that right now.
But I haven't the mental or emotional energy to waste.
I would rather spend what I have
On what I can do.
And on thoughts of others who need to borrow that energy from me.
My silence is action.
Police say a 22-year-old man has died after being struck by an LRT train on Friday. Kim Smith reports.
A Golden Globe nominee in previous years for their work in “Brooklyn” and “Atonement,” Saoirse Ronan was recognized by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. on Monday morning for their portrayal of the title character in “Lady Bird.” A vivid account of a mother-daughter relationship, the film is also a contender for best picture in the musical or comedy category.
Below, Ronan shares their secrets to having fun at awards shows as well as “Lady Bird” and its writer-director, Greta Gerwig.
Where are you?
I'm back in Ireland now -- just outside of Dublin. It's 20 past four. I'm having a glass of Prosecco and my dog is laying next to me. We think she's a west Highland terrier and golden retriever. She's asleep, so they don't seem too excited. My mam is lighting candles to set the mood.
Will they come to the Globes with you?
Yeah. [To her] Mam, you'll come to the Golden Globes? They says 'maybe.' They might have to look after the dog.
Did you finally see "Lady Bird" with her?
Yes, and it was amazing. I said to them before we went in -- "OK, mom, let's go to a regular screening and see it with a normal audience -- not film people. Every screening has been pretty packed, so forgive me if I have to keep my head down when we go into the cinema." I'm preparing to go into the theater in disguise, and there were like six people in the whole cinema.
But they absolutely loved it, and the thing that stayed with them the most was Laurie's performance and how well they captured what it was to be a mother.
But you've said you guys didn't butt heads quite as much as Lady Bird and their mom, right?
No. I wish I was as ballsy as Lady Bird — but I'm sure mam wouldn't have appreciated me throwing myself out of the car.
You're a veteran of award shows at this point -- do you still get excited by nominations?
It definitely doesn't lose its sparkle. If it's a film you really loved, it's even more exciting. Over the last month or so, Greta and I have gotten to share in all this.
Greta didn't get nominated for directing, nor did any female filmmakers. How do you feel about that?
I think Greta should win all the awards and she's deserving of them all. Not only because it's their first film and it's so impressive, but this is the first time she's officially done it on their own. I mean this without being biased, really — she's made a film that even technically speaking is spot-on.
I think it's really important we got the best picture nomination. That is essentially hers, so they have been represented in that way. But I guess it's an onward journey to make sure that female filmmakers are being represented. I think the people who have been nominated -- even like myself and Emma Stone -- we can all go out there with our heads held high, because the talk of the town right now are the great female filmmakers.
What's your trick to having fun at award shows?
You have to bring someone that you know you're going to have fun with. So I would usually bring my mam or one of my best mates, and whenever I've brought them with me I end up having so much fun. It's great if you win, but it's also totally fine if you don't because you're going to have a few drinks and see people you like. And you can go off afterwards and have a laugh.
I've gone to McDonald's or In-N-Out after award shows and that's been the best part of the night.
How was your experience hosting "Saturday Night Live" recently?
It was weird, because "SNL" is sort of a combination of being on a film set and being in the theater. Once you get through the monologue, you're fine. With the clothing changes, you're basically just thrown from one place to the next, and you have to stand there as they pull things off you and bring you over to the set. You get such a rush from it, you're literally just sprinting from set to set.
LOS ANGELES-Janet Jackson is reportedly getting over their split from estranged husband Wissam Al Mana by focusing their attention to writing a new album and rescheduling their 75 axed tour dates.
The 50-year-old singer reportedly split from their estranged husband Wissam Al Mana earlier this month, and is now said to be focusing all of their energy on writing new ‘'positive'' uplifting music about becoming a mother to the estranged couple's three-month-old son, Eissa Al Mana. The ‘Scream' hitmaker is also going to play the shows they postponed becoming a mother last year under a new run of dates named the ‘State Of The World' tour, which will hit North America later this year. A source told The Sun newspaper: ‘'Having a baby has upped their desire to release positive music and they want their new songs to be a celebration of life, love and motherhood. ‘'She plans to get back on tour in North America in October, followed by a brand-new album. ‘'Last year's incomplete ‘Unbreakable World Tour' is being revamped to become ?the ‘State Of The World Tour' and they are already scheduling summer rehearsals.'' It comes after Wissam, 42 - who Janet wed in 2012 - penned an emotional message to the pop star amidst claims they have separated.
LOS ANGELES—Three suspects were charged Tuesday with kidnapping two people from a Los Angeles home and holding one of them naked in a bathtub for 30 hours while demanding the other pay a $10,000 (U.S.) ransom, prosecutors said. Keith Andre Stewart, Johntae Jones and Amber Neal were charged with kidnapping, assault with a firearm and other offence in connection with the May 3 incident. It was not immediately clear whether they had attorneys who could comment on the allegations

Neal's arrest at gunpoint by Los Angeles police officers on Monday was captured on video by a bystander and had been viewed more than 2.4 million times on Twitter. It wasn't immediately known when the others were taken into custody. Prosecutors allege the trio went to Daisy McCrackin's home in South Los Angeles on May 3, where they say Stewart pistol-whipped a man who was in the home, Joseph Capone. The three then placed bags over the two victims' heads and drove them several kilometres to Jones' home in Compton, prosecutors said. Once they were at Jones' home, the suspects forced Capone to strip naked and then held them in a bathtub for 30 hours without food, prosecutors allege.

Investigators said Jones and Neal then took McCrackin's car and drove them to several different banks while demanding they pay $10,000 for Capone's release. Eventually they were forced to write a $10,000 cheque to Neal, prosecutors said. The next day, they brought McCrackin — an actor who has appeared in several films including the horror flick Halloween: Resurrection — back to their home, where they escaped from them and called police, authorities said. Jones and Neil were being held on $1 million each and Stewart was being held on more than $2 million bail, according to prosecutors. If convicted, they each potentially face sentences of up to life in prison.

For those mourning the loss of Game of Thrones this summer, fear ye not. HBO's new drama series Succession, which comes from Peep Show's Jesse Armstrong, is a worthy replacement. The setting is less fantastical, and there are generally fewer dragons, but the power moves, machinations, twisted family dynamics, and oodles of realpolitik in action are a delight. The series follows the powerful Roy family, led by patriarch Logan (Brian Cox), a Rupert Murdoch, media baron-type who controls an international conglomerate. But from the very beginning, the show sets up the complicated power dynamics between Logan and their children, all of whom seek power and respect, and have very deep-rooted daddy issues.
Succession could easily become a series that, in this second Gilded Age of one-percenter excess, could be a drag. But the smart, often hilarious script and the active camera with a bevy of quick-zooms keep the show on the cusp of comedy. (Adam McKay directs the premiere, while subsequent episode directors include Mark Mylod and Adam Arkin). It's a drama, let there be no doubt, but there's enough awkwardness and unexpected reactions from the the wonderfully dastardly family members working to usurp one another that there's a necessary lightness to it as well. Everyone is despicable, and yet, the story is an easy one to dive into and feel compelled by.
Logan's children, from a variety of marriages, include the eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), a hippie-dippie rarely-seen presence; Kendall (Jeremy Strong) the scheming president of the family firm who seems to be the heir apparent; Roman (Kieran Culkin), the lackadaisical screw-up; and Logan's only daughter Siobhan (a.k.a. “Shiv,” played by Sarah Snook), a daddy's girl who doesn't work at the company but who has plenty of opinions about what goes on there. The siblings fight constantly, belittling one another, flattering each other to secure loyalty, and constantly creating new alliances as they get offered better deals. The amount of backstabbing in the series is breathtaking on its own, but everything is augmented by clever, lyrical writing peppered liberally with colorful language (an early episode is titled “Shit Show at the Fuck Factory”; of note, Armstrong also wrote for The Thick of It, a British precursor to Veep). The jittery camera also reflects the fact that nothing is ever certain or calm with this family — even in moments of relative peace, there's always a disaster lurking.
The Roy family's spouses and tangential family members, like Shiv's unstable social-climber fiancee Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) or the dunderheaded, failing-upwards cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), or even Logan's manipulative new wife Marcy (Hiam Abbass), all add even more nuance and chaos to the overall dynamic of the series. But each character (of a very sprawling cast) is so carefully and quickly defined that you get a sense of everyone and what's at stake by the end of the first episode. Beyond that, Succession is all about the contention, suspicion, and betrayal among them, not to mention just being a maximum dickhead. You love to hate them. It really never gets old (at least, as of the first seven episodes made available to critics, out of an eventual ten). The series is smart, profane, sarcastic, and above all it's fun.
When a health scare fells the powerful Logan early on, their recovery (and whether or not they really has recovered) plays a major part in upending expected hierarchies within the family, and it makes sense that every decision made regarding Logan and the Roys is consequential because of how rich and powerful they are. But Logan is also unwilling to give up their power, meaning that there isn't really anyone fit to take over from them — once they do, even temporarily, it's clear that no one else knows what they're doing, and the risks they take to establish themselves are often excruciating.
To illustrate, there's a scene about midway through the season that could not be more bland to a new viewer who happened to tune in; it's a board meeting with a slow roll call and a stalling of the agenda. And yet, because of the way the show has built up to this moment and the consequences of a fallout, it's one of the most anxiety-inducing sequences on TV this year. What's even more impressive about it is the way it illustrates how the show makes viewers choose sides and feel invested in the happenings of this family and their firm, even though every single person involved with these decisions is a blaggard.
Like with Peep Show and The Thick of It, Armstrong and their writing team make us care deeply — not emotionally, but out of a perverse interest — about what these fools are going to do next. There's another layer to it here, with the Roy family's wealth and their treatment of it (and those around them because of it), that makes these characters particularly odious. Yet at the same time, it heightens both the dramatic stakes and the comedy that much more. The joy of seeing them all plot against one another and lay traps and sometimes fall into them themselves often rivals the best machinations of Lannisters, Targaryens, or a Littlefinger. Most of the characters in Succession suffer from a litany of faults: arrogance, greed, ignorance, cowardice, selfishness, delusions of grandeur, but the show has a potent combination of virtues that makes up for these sins. Ultimately it's less about who will rule, but what it will cost to see them get there. Pass the gilded popcorn.

Succession premieres Sunday, June 3rd on HBO.
Nashville Predators goalie Pekka Rinne 35) looks on prior to an NHL hockey game against the Buffalo Sabres, Monday, March 19, 2018, in Buffalo, N.Y.
The call to induct Fredericton-born hockey trailblazer Willie O'Ree into the Hockey Hall of Fame has received an extra push of support.
Fredericton Member of Parliament Matt DeCourcey has joined the local movement to get O'Ree, the first black player in the NHL, inducted.
DeCourcey rose in the House of Commons on Friday, saying O'Ree should be awarded that honour.
“As we celebrate Black History Month and the 60th anniversary of their breaking of the black colour barrier in professional hockey, we thank Willie for their continued service to the game and to our communities as a longtime ambassador for NHL diversity,” DeCourcey said.
“A member of the New Brunswick Hall of Fame [and] the Order of Canada, there remains but one honour to be bestowed this person who left such an indelible mark on this sport. Mr. Speaker, for their dedication as a builder, I am sure Frederictonians, New Brunswickers, Canadians, and hockey fans around the world would share the view that it is past due time that Willie O'Ree be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.”
DeCourcey said O'Ree has paved the way for black athletes to be able to play professional hockey, and said they continue to serve as an ambassador and a symbol for diversity in the NHL.
“There's been momentum around the need to see them in the Hall of Fame here locally and I thought it was due time to be on the public record expressing my support to see them inducted for all he's contributed as a builder to the game,” DeCourcey said.
In a phone interview with Global News, O'Ree told Global News they would be elated to be inducted and is honoured to hear it was brought up in Ottawa.
“That's nice to hear,” O'Ree said. “I'm certainly honoured, as there had been some talk of trying to get me in, but… I would be thrilled.”
O'Ree said making it into the Hall of Fame is a goal they set for themselves when they were playing professional hockey.
They said they were moved to be recognized in Boston in January for their contributions to the game.
“I was thrilled and quite honoured that the City of Boston took recognition of my breaking the colour barrier back in 1958 and then honouring me for [the] 60th anniversary,” O'Ree said. “They did a fantastic job.”

DeCourcey said he's connected with people in Fredericton who have started to organize a community-led nomination that can be sent to Hall of Fame chairperson Lanny McDonald.
“I'm happy to support an initiative led by the community to recognize Willie O'Ree,” DeCourcey said. “We will put together as strong a nomination package as we can… to say to the NHL, to say to people right across this country and right across North America, that it's due time to recognize Willie O'Ree for their contributions to the game and to our communities.”
Fredericton resident Robert Mabie grew up playing hockey with O'Ree.
“I played schoolboy hockey against Willie way back when we were youngsters and they always played a league above me because they were a better hockey player,” Mabie said.
The two then went on to play for the Quebec Frontenacs together in 1954.

“Willie was a good hockey player and I spent part of my time in the Junior B level and then they'd take me up and down from Junior B to Junior A,” Mabie recalled.
“We roomed together — they had a hotel that the hockey team stayed in, and we got our meals and everything there and we stayed in the same room for the entire year.”
Mabie said they would love to see O'Ree inducted into the Hall adding they appreciate seeing local leaders like DeCourcey taking action.
“The more people that we can get involved, the better chance they have of getting in, I would believe,” Mabie said. “It would be great for Willie, and it would be great for the NHL Hall of Fame.”
Mabie said they haven't seen O'Ree in quite a while and said they have lost touch other than when O'Ree returns to Fredericton for special events, but notes they remember their former teammate as “just a great guy — a gentleman all the time [who] loves everybody and everybody loves him.”
O'Ree said they will always consider Fredericton home.
“First of all, Fredericton has been my hometown since I was born there and I fell in love with the fans there when I had the opportunity to play,” they said.
“I still have a number of close friends there and I still have some family, but I consider Fredericton my home, although I live in San Diego and [have] resided there since 1967.”
DeCourcey said the deadline for public submissions for nominations to the Hall of Fame is March 15. They said once the nomination is submitted, it will go to all the members of the Hall's board of governors.

A STRAIGHT-SHOOTING cocaine user wasted nobody's time when they were busted for their illicit stash.
"This is what you're here for,” Anthony James Coughlan told police who turned up at their Birtinya property in November.
Toowoomba-born Coughlan had 25.56g of a substance and slightly more than half of it was pure cocaine.
Brisbane Supreme Court heard Coughlan could've faced jail time if found to be dealing.
But the court accepted the 26-year-old had the drugs only for themselves and possibly to share with friends.
Coughlan previously said the drugs would have been worth $3500 to $4000.
Chief Justice Catherine Holmes told Coughlan if they were found with drugs again, the suspicion of commercial dealing "will be almost inevitable”.
But they added that they wrote an apology letter to the court and their work supervisor supplied a supportive, positive reference.
Coughlan's relative youth, no prior criminal history, and rehab sessions he'd been taking also earned them credit.
Their family were supportive and they made an early guilty plea to one drug possession charge.
The Chief Justice said Coughlan's rehabilitation was best served if they were not jailed.
They got an 18-month jail sentence, suspended immediately, operational for three years. -NewsRegional
The adventure bike niche is the fastest-growing segment in the American motorcycle industry.
But many people who own the big, adventure-ready machines don't know where to ride them, don't know who to ride them with, and, perhaps of the greatest concern, don't know how to ride them off-road.
Jim Hyde, and their RawHyde Adventure training programs, have become legend for helping them.
On a Friday afternoon last spring, dozens of riders were streaming into Hyde's hidden mountain compound north of Castaic.
Arriving on BMWs laden with adventure gear, or hauling their motorcycles in trucks and trailers, the riders had come to RawHyde to build their skills and face their fears.
“I'm terrified,” said Jonathan Martin, a rider from San Jose who had never taken a motorcycle off-road.
I could relate. Though I'd raced motocross as a kid and had ridden dirt bikes in the desert for decades, I had very little experience putting a big bike through its paces off the pavement.
So, I was a little unnerved by the prospect of taking a 600-pound, $18,000 motorcycle onto uneven terrain. When shown Friday what I'd be doing through the weekend, I thought: Not me, not with this bike and certainly not in the dirt.
I had plenty of company. As the three-day training weekend began, I found that most of the 34 riders arriving at the compound were similarly spooked.

RawHyde charges $1,395 for the basic two-day, one-night camp, if the rider brings their or their own motorcycle. The base rate includes training, lodging and meals. Motorcycle rentals, gear rentals and additional training, including a two-day ride that follows the weekend, are extra. The camp is held several times a year.
The students were a mixed bag. Some were veteran dirt bike riders eager to brush up their skills on bigger equipment. Others were brave newbies with specific plans to put the training to use.
Some of the riders were young and fit. Most were not.
“Hey, everyone looks like me,” said Tracey McCormick, a retired fighter pilot who had recently purchased a BMW adventure bike. “I thought it would be all kids.”
After breakfast Saturday, the students and staff attended the morning briefing, where RawHyde's founder gave an overview of the training to come and set ground rules, which included: “We will not tolerate any clowning around — at all.”
The students I met seemed quite serious, and had varying motives for attending.
Mark Adams, a photographer from Los Angeles, was preparing for an off-road ride across the country.
Jeff Gibson, a restaurant franchise owner from Utah, wanted to “be the cool dad,” and ride dirt bikes with their son and grandson.
Giles Kavanagh, a finance officer from New York, was hoping to survive an off-road ride in Peru.
Hyde, an intense, compact man with sharp blue eyes and close-cropped white hair, grew up on what is now the RawHyde compound. They retired in 2000 from selling medical equipment and moved back to the mountain property shortly after.
After a few missteps running tours in off-road sport utility vehicles, they shifted their focus to motorcycles, and turned full time to adventure training in 2007.
Since then, RawHyde has trained 3,500 students, they said, and the company has grown. Annual revenue was roughly $500,000 in 2007, Hyde said. It rose to $1.8 million last year — 70% of that from training sessions, with the remainder earned via post-training tours and motorcycle rentals.
Their staff has grown, too. Hyde employs seven people full time. They have 14 part-time coaches, and three part-time medics. Their kitchen boasts three full-time chefs.
Most of the instructors, they said, are former students who became so enamored of the camp that they left other jobs to become trainers.
The business model makes sense for their partners, too. One of Hyde's instructors is Owen Balduf, who does sales for Long Beach BMW Motorcycles. Balduf estimated that the dealership has sold 70 motorcycles over the last few years to RawHyde graduates eager to own their own machines.
Hyde's teaching style is blunt and direct.
“It's an illusion that this is a safe activity. It isn't,” Hyde said that morning. “But we're going to teach you the skills to do it without killing yourself.”

The RawHyde curriculum began with a simple exercise: Going slowly, on a dirt road, students were asked to stand up, remove one foot from a footpeg, and then swing that leg up onto the motorcycle seat. Then repeat, on the other side.
This was the first of several drills designed to get riders off their seats and onto their feet, so they would begin moving their bodies around on the motorcycle — essential, we would later learn, for controlling the heavy bikes on uncertain terrain.
Soon, riders were shifting their weight around while making circles and figure-eight loops. Within hours, we were doing tight turns and loops on a steep hillside.
The drills gradually got more complicated. Learning clutch and throttle control, later that day we were doing figure eight loops with two, or three, or even four other motorcycles inside the same circle — closely maintaining speed so we didn't bump into the bikes in front of or behind us.
They got more difficult, too. We were told that we would soon practice crossing a patch of deep sand, which, because of the size and weight of the motorcycles, is the great nemesis of every big-bike rider.
We'd all been warned, near the beginning of the instruction, that we should be prepared to fall over a few times. So riders were all required to wear proper helmets, boots, gloves and jackets. The delicate parts on our bikes had been removed or taped up for safety.
And fall we did. Some riders went down repeatedly. This allowed us all to practice another important technique we'd been taught, that of getting a big motorcycle back on its feet when it tips over. Some riders were expert at this before Saturday afternoon.
Some sustained injuries, too. Two of the riders who started the course were not able to finish, one going out with a bad knee, another with a sprained ankle.
The day ended with drinks in the bar, a substantial dinner of salmon steaks and jasmine rice in the dining room, and a musical performance, featuring coach Owen Balduf on electric violin, in the lounge.
The talk was entirely moto-centric — best bikes, favorite rides, the greatest adventures, the worst accidents — as a group of men, smoking cigars by the campfire, placed bets on which occupants of the four-person cabins would snore the loudest.

By midday Sunday, many of the novices were riding like veterans. Drills such as those designed to help a rider stop on a steep hill, and turn around without falling, were beginning to pay off.
The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) intends to begin a pilot project next year to evaluate how all-electric buses perform on crowded and hilly routes.
Then purchases will begin. From 2025, new bus orders will be only for all-electric models and within 10 years, by 2035, all diesel buses are to be replaced.
There are also other agencies, like SamTrans from San Mateo County that decided on 100% electrification (by 2033).
“Mayor Mark Farrell and the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), which operates Muni, today announced San Francisco's commitment to have an all-electric bus fleet by 2035. This means that the SFMTA will only purchase all-electric buses starting in 2025 to meet the goal for 2035. An all-electric bus does not use fuel and relies solely on the battery within its operating system.”
Mayor Farrell said:
“San Francisco is proud to once again lead on sustainable initiatives that not only improve our city, but improve the world. This new investment represents a bold shift in how we move hundreds of thousands of people on public transit, while reaffirming San Francisco's commitment to sustainable energy practices.”
More about the electrification:
“The SFMTA Board of Directors today approved a resolution supporting the commitment towards an all-electric bus fleet. Muni currently operates the largest fleet of zero emissions electric trolley buses. Trolley buses, like all light rail, streetcar, and cable car vehicles, run on 100 percent greenhouse gas-free Hetch Hetchy electricity via overhead wires. Muni also runs a fleet of low emissions electric hybrid vehicles. The electric hybrid vehicles run on battery, as well as clean, renewable diesel.
“We are excited about the possibility that by 2035 we will be able to provide an all-electric fleet that won't require overhead wires,” said Cheryl Brinkman, Chairman of the SFMTA Board of Directors. “As an agency, we have always been forward thinkers when it comes to greening our fleet and we will continue to take steps to test electric vehicles here in San Francisco to reach our goal.”
The SFMTA has been rolling out new electric hybrid buses with higher capacity on-board battery systems. The increased on-board battery capacity will allow the SFMTA to run a test program to operate “Green Zones” along several electric hybrid routes that would run only by battery for significant portions of the route. The “Green Zone” signifies an area in which the vehicle will not produce any emissions. The SFMTA is working to identify these zones throughout the city.
“Muni's transit system is the cornerstone of our city's environmentally sustainable transportation system and is one of the greenest in the world,” said Ed Reiskin, SFMTA's Director of Transportation. “Our efforts to take our fleet to the next level won't only make for better and more efficient service, but they will continue the work we are doing to be one of the cleanest fleets in the country and improve rider experience.”
The SFMTA is at the ready to move forward with electric bus technology when manufacturers can prove their electric buses can withstand heavy ridership and steep hills. The agency would also have to consider new facilities that can charge a large fleet and developing a systemwide infrastructure to charge vehicles in service or on the street. John Haley, SFMTA's Transit Director said, “While the battery technology is emerging rapidly, it isn't quite ready for primetime. Manufacturers aren't yet producing the number of all-electric buses San Francisco and other urban areas would need, nor could we guarantee that the vehicles would work for the required 15 years with heavy ridership and challenging topography.”
In 2019, the SFMTA intends to purchase a limited number of zero-emission battery electric buses and test them in service throughout San Francisco to evaluate how they perform on crowded and hilly routes. The most important step to support the zero-emission goal is to determine the infrastructure needs for electric buses, including upgrades for our existing facilities to accommodate charging requirements and maintenance.
Of the nearly 900 all-electric buses purchased across the country, only 207 are actually in service. By contrast, Muni is currently operating 250 electric trolley vehicles.
In recent years, the SFMTA has replaced over 90 percent of its older diesel buses with cleaner, more efficient electric hybrid vehicles that run on renewable diesel. These electric hybrid vehicles offer dramatically lower fuel consumption, decreased engine idling time while in service, and a substantial reduction in emissions. The SFMTA's switch from conventional diesel to electric hybrid vehicles has reduced consumption of fuel by 5.4 million gallons and 82,000 tons of CO2 over the 12-year life of the fleet.
Over 50 percent of the transit fleet, including light rail, cable cars, historic streetcars and electric trolley buses are largely powered by greenhouse gas-free hydropower generated from Hetch Hetchy. Beyond that, our new electric hybrid buses use 100 percent renewable fuel. This eliminates greenhouse gas emissions and petroleum fuel and saves a million gallons of fuel each year. San Francisco's transportation sector generates approximately 46 percent of the City's total greenhouse gas emissions mostly generated by the use of private cars and commercial trucks. By contrast, Muni carries 26 percent of all trips in the city, but accounts for less than two percent of these emissions.
On April 19, 2018, in celebration of Earth Day, Mayor Mark Farrell committed San Francisco to net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050, a move that will eliminate the City's carbon footprint.”
The Surrey Eagles will retire Jaxon Joseph's No. 10 jersey at the beginning of next season, the team announced. (Surrey Eagles photo)
A few days after Jaxon Joseph's death – one of 16 in the Humboldt Broncos' bus crash April 6 – Blaine Neufeld, former coach with the Surrey Eagles, said what they wanted, more than anything, was for the 20-year-old hockey player to be remembered.
Now, the Eagles have found a way to do just that – by retiring Joseph's No. 10 jersey.
Team president Chuck Westgard confirmed to Black Press this week that the number will go up into the rafters, but said official plans to honour Joseph – who played for the Eagles during the 2015/16 season – were still being worked out.
After their time in South Surrey, Joseph moved on to the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, first with the Melfort Mustangs and then with Humboldt. The Broncos were on their way to a playoff game in Nipawin when their team bus collided with a semi truck.
Westgard hopes the gesture will serve as a way not only to honour Joseph, but their Humboldt teammates, as well.
“It's a tragedy that hit everyone hard, especially those of us in the hockey community,” Westgard said Tuesday. “Number one, this is a way to honour Jaxon, but number two, it's a way to acknowledge what happened and make sure people don't ever forget.
“We need to remember those kids, and those people.”
Speaking with Black Press a few days after the bus crash, Neufeld said the tragedy hit home with everyone involved in the sport, calling it “heartbreaking, horrific – it's about as bad as it gets.”
Though Joseph only played part of one season in Surrey, they were one of the team's most well-respected players, Neufeld said.
“Beyond the game of hockey, they were a young man who was built to succeed in life, and it's just a shame they aren't going to get that chance,” they said at the time.
Joseph's number will be the second retired by the club. Former forward Jeff Nabseth's No. 8 jersey was retired after they were killed in a bike accident on Vancouver Island in 1999.
Caige Sterzer wore No. 10 last season with the Eagles, and while the team brass hasn't spoke with them yet about making a switch, Westgard said “he won't have any problem with it.”
Turkey's exports in April were $13.9 billion with a 7.8 percent increase and imports were $20.6 billion witha 15.6 percent increase compared with the same month last year, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) said Thursday.
The foreign trade deficit was $6.7 billion, with a 35.6 percent yearly increase, the provisional foreign trade statistics prepared the Turkstat and the Ministry of Customs and Trade showed. "Exports coverage imports was 67.5 percent, while it was 72.3 percent in April 2017," the statement said.
The country's foreign trade balance showed a $27.4 billion deficit from January to April, a yearly increase of 56.2 percent.
Official data showed that Turkey's total exports totaled some $55 billion in the same period, a 8.6 percent year-on-year rise, and imports rose 20.8 percent to $82.5 billion.
Exports to European Union countries showed a 21.5 percent annual hike in the four-month period, while the increase in April was 22 percent with exports standing at $7.3 billion, constituting 50.7 percent of all exports.
The share of EU member countries' share of Turkey's exports was 51.5 percent in the four-month period, reaching $28.4 billion, while imports from the 28-member EU bloc were $30.3 billion, up 23.3 percent annually.
In April, Germany was the leading destination for Turkish exports with $1.36 billion, followed by the U.K. with $852 million, Italy with $784 million and France with $690 million.
Germany was again the leading country in imports at $1.98 billion, followed by Russia with $1.89 billion, China with $1.78 billion and the U.S. with $1.08 billion.

As part of the bridal launch, Gilt will also offer 15 exclusive styles from the SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker footwear line. Well-known silhouettes including the Cosette and Fawn will be available in exclusive colorways and heel heights. The shoes range in size from 35 to 40 and are priced between $350 and $485.
Coinciding with the bridal launch, Gilt City will feature offers from some of Parker's favorite places in the New York City to help brides prepare for their big day, such as Leather Spa, Lars Nord Tailor, and Tarallucci e Vino.
The SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker Bridal Collection ranges in price from $295 for the sleeveless bodysuit to $2,395 for the embroidered gown. Sizes range from extra small to large for the bodysuits and 0 to 14 for all other pieces.

When asked why they wanted to design a bridal collection, Parker told WWD, “I didn't, really. They came to us.”
When they launched their shoe business four years ago, they had a small pop-up in New York, which was how they launched the brand — an exclusive with Nordstrom.
“We kept having these wonderful women of all ages and backgrounds and sizes and shapes, they kept telling us they were buying for their wedding and they were not buying what would be conventionally thought of as a bridal shoe. We recognized that there was this space where brides were looking for something that felt different, that suggested who they were. So we were encouraged to create a bridal collection within our collection, so in those deliveries we always have a bridal shoe. But people tend to use our shoes anyway outside of that for that special occasion.”
They said because of that, Gilt, which is part of the HBC portfolio of brands, came to them and asked if they wanted to do this collaboration.
Parker described the looks as “very, very simple.” They said there's a strong emphasis on bodysuits, which they think are flattering. And the colors are simple. “The intent is they should be usable outside of that special occasion. Whether you're the person walking down the aisle, or you're attending, these are all pieces that should be relevant in your closet,” said Parker.
“There are some pieces that feel more decadent and more specifically bridal. There's no law saying they're not appropriate for many other important occasions as well,” they said.

For now, Parker said the Gilt collaboration is a one season deal. “The interesting thing about Gilt is that it's there until it's gone. And the shoes are so pretty. They're really lovely,” they said.
Speaking of shoes, Parker said their SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker pop-up store in New York at 6 West 52nd Street is still up and running. “It's temporary permanent and permanently temporary,” they said. “Our landlords would like us to stay. It's a very interesting location, as you know. It's a little bit off, we're not right on either avenue. We have the 21 Club across the street, but that's a particular person. We're having to be very creative with how we market. We have no marketing dollars. We're really relying on Instagram and that return customer. That customer who walks in for the first time, and then tells their colleagues and other friends who are visiting,” they said.
At the pop-up, one can find Parker at the point of sale, in the stockroom and on their hands and knees helping customers try on shoes. “Because the more you hear about the brand, the more you know what customers need, what customers want, how are they fitting in our shoes, when you're hearing people saying, ‘These are the most comfortable shoes,' and you know it's a point of pride and you've been working on that, all of our shoes are handmade in Italy. When you're doing that and you're in front of them, and you're there when someone returns a shoe, and you're hearing about why. All the billions of dollars in the world and all the billboards in Times Square can not make up for that,” they said. “And I love it.”
Do they love it more than acting?
“It's completely different. It's much easier, in a way. Also, it's an opportunity to thank people, to say hello, to say ‘You're part of this' and when I'm acting and go to a premiere, or have a big premiere, I don't get to walk the rope line and say thank you to everybody. I don't get to say, ‘Because of you, I'm in this store and I have this opportunity.” I feel that people don't get it. They feel that social media is all the answers. ‘Branding, branding, and don't expand too fast.' And look at all the cautionary tales, and learn from people who have done it well. And cultivate a customer loyalty,” they said.
Someday, Parker would love to expand their own company, which launched its first collection in early 2014, into more categories, but she's taking a cautious approach.
“I have an interest in shoring up that shoe base for us. We have a small bag collection. We're working on doing better by that. They sell well, and we also know where we need to improve. There are always categories that are interesting that we recognize are promising, but those take investment. We have to look at whether we want to invest in that, or put our money toward this. George [Malkemus V] and I own the company, so it's only us investing in it,” they said. They would love to do a children's footwear line (mommy and me) and their business doesn't have e-commerce yet.
Parker said the Gilt collection will go into their own stores eventually. “There's an embargo because it's sold exclusively on Gilt. Then we can integrate it. We're happy to point people toward Gilt,” they said.
Meantime, Parker continues to have a busy acting career. They said she's pleased with how “Divorce” is going, noting that there could very well be another season. “We're talking about it right now literally,” they said. And, in their new movie, “Blue Night,” they play a jazz pop singer with a fruitful and challenging career. They receive a grim diagnosis at the beginning of the movie and it's 24 hours in their day.
Another project she's working on is their imprint at Crown Publishing Group's Penguin Random House called SJP for Hogarth, where they publish literary fiction. Them first book, “A Place for Us,” by Fatima Farheen Mirza, will be published in June.
Finally, turning to their fellow “Sex and the City” actor and friend Cynthia Nixon's run for governor, Parker thinks they make a strong candidate. “There are a million reasons I think she'd be good. They and I have been friends since we were 11. She's a born-and-raised New Yorker. She's a product of the best of our public school system — Hunter College. She's been an activist since they were a little girl. Raised by a single mother. They have cared deeply and has been involved, and they and I have had lots of interesting conversations about our public schools and public housing. She's interested in the gubernatorial seat because they know where those money decisions are made. They have lots of questions about infrastructure here in the city, as well as upstate. I think they see that there are things that can be improved upon and are different ideas than our governor's.”
Will they be campaigning for Nixon?

Albuquerque, N.M. — Federal legislation to expand the Amber Alert child abduction emergency notification system in Native American communities across the country has cleared its last hurdle before heading to the full U.S. Senate for consideration.
The legislation is in response to the 2016 deadly abduction of 11-year-old Ashlynne Mike on the Navajo Nation, the largest American Indian reservation in the U.S.
The high profile case raised questions about gaps in communication and coordination between tribal and local law enforcement.
Sponsor John McCain, R-Arizona, said authorities did not issue an Amber Alert for Ashlynne until the morning after family members reported them abduction.
The girl was found dead in a remote area near the New Mexico-Arizona border after police have said they were abducted by a stranger in a case that McCain described as devastating. FBI data shows 7,724 Native American children listed as missing in the U.S., McCain said.
The measure was endorsed this week by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and has bipartisan support from lawmakers from Montana, New Mexico and North Dakota.
The measure would make permanent and expand the tribal Amber Alert pilot program, which provides training for tribes to operate their own alert systems. Grant funding would be available, and the U.S. Justice Department would be required to assess the capabilities of tribal Amber Alert systems.
Amber Alerts are triggered when authorities notify broadcasters and transportation officials about abductions — resulting in a barrage of public messages via the media, cellphones and alerts on highway electronic signs.
After years of struggling to develop an emergency notification system, the Navajo Nation — which spans parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah — is now implementing a new system and training officers.
Ashlynne was lured into a van near their school bus stop on a Monday afternoon in May 2016.
Tom Begaye Jr. of Waterflow, New Mexico, has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges in Ashlynne's death.
They told investigators they sexually assaulted the girl and struck them twice in the head with a crowbar and that they were still moving when they left them in the desert, according to court documents.
An Amber Alert was not issued in New Mexico until around 2 a.m. the morning after Ashlynne's disappearance, leading to outcry that the public did not get information about a child in danger during crucial hours of the search for them

Welcome to California Inc., the weekly newsletter of the L.A. Times Business Section.
I'm Business columnist David Lazarus, and here's a rundown of upcoming stories this week and the highlights of last week.
Trading will kick off Monday following another week of gains capped off by a jobs report that exceeded forecasts. The nation added 228,000 jobs in November, as the unemployment rate held steady at a 17-year low of 4.1%. Manufacturing and construction had a strong month, as did business, professional services and healthcare services. One continuing weak spot: Average wages grew at a mediocre 2.5% annual rate despite a tightening labor market.
LOOKING AHEAD
Movie awards: Hollywood's awards season gets into full swing this morning when nominations for the 75th Golden Globes are announced starting at 5:15 a.m Pacific Time. The awards, handed out in 14 categories, are determined by members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. On Wednesday, nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Awards will be announced at 7 a.m. The Golden Globes will be presented at the Beverly Hilton on Jan. 7, and the SAG Awards will be held Jan. 21.
Blast off: A SpaceX launch delayed from last week is now set for Tuesday at 8:46 a.m. Pacific Time from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. This will be the the first time NASA — or any U.S. government agency — will employ one of SpaceX's used rocket boosters. It will also be the first launch from the launch pad that Hawthorne-based SpaceX damaged in a September 2016 explosion. The rocket will carry supplies to the International Space Station.
Interest rate rise?: On Wednesday, Federal Reserve officials are expected to announce another small hike in the central bank's key interest rate. The Fed has raised rates twice this year, in March and June, pushing its benchmark rate to a still-low level of 1% to 1.25%. At three meetings since then, the Fed has left rates unchanged. Wednesday will also be the last news conference by Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen in their current position. Them term ends Feb. 3.
Net neutrality: The Federal Communications Commission is expected to vote Thursday on a proposal to eliminate net neutrality rules that govern online traffic. Republicans, who now have a 3-2 majority on the FCC, oppose the Obama-era regulations. Eliminating the net neutrality rules would allow internet service providers to block access to some websites and charge others for faster delivery of their content to consumers.
Premiere: The highly anticipated "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" debuts Friday, and box office experts predict it will have the biggest movie opening of the year. The Walt Disney Co. film is expected to collect $180 million to $210 million in ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada in its opening weekend. Two years ago, "Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” earned a record-breaking $529 million in its first weekend of worldwide release, including $248 million in the U.S. and Canada.
THE AGENDA
Petroleum products still power nearly all cars driving the world's highways, minus the rare alternative-fuel vehicle. But there is something astir and it's called elektrifizierung. That's German for electrification. While big American companies — and to a large extent, the Koreans and the Japanese — have low-key electric efforts, the German Big Three automakers are aggressively pursuing a strategic shift. It was all on display at the recent LA Auto Show.
STORY LINES
Here are some of the other stories that ran in the Times Business section in recent days that we're continuing to follow:
Weinstein suit: Six women are suing Harvey Weinstein and the studio they co-founded, seeking to turn their case into a class-action suit representing what they say are hundreds of women sexually assaulted or harassed by the movie mogul. The federal lawsuit filed in New York against them and Weinstein Co. outlines what the women allege was a massive scheme that facilitated predatory behavior by Weinstein and, they say, enabled them to rape and sexually assault women.
Merger: CVS Health Corp. plans to buy Aetna Inc. for $69 billion in a blockbuster deal that would further consolidate the U.S. healthcare industry by merging the nation's largest pharmacy chain with a major healthcare insurer. The deal, which was approved by both companies' boards of directors, combines the 9,700 drugstores and 1,100 walk-in healthcare clinics operated by CVS with Aetna's 22 million medical members. The deal must still pass regulatory scrutiny.
Disney and Fox: Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger may stay on the job longer than expected if the Burbank entertainment giant buys major assets from 21st Century Fox. Iger, 66, had said they would retire from the company they have steered through a rapid expansion when their contract expires in July 2019. But the Fox deal probably would face a lengthy regulatory review, so the Disney board is expected to extend Iger's contract to allow them to oversee the process, a source said.
Tax reform: Vulnerable California Republicans say they are watching closely as House leaders work on a final tax bill with the Senate, hoping they'll win back some popular deductions that would lower tax bills in their districts. California Republican votes may prove essential to the final tax bill's chances, and some House members have signaled they are willing to vote against it. Meanwhile, GOP leaders are considering a change to the bill that would allow a limited deduction for state and local taxes, an important tax break for Californians.
Pickford gets the upper hand to vindicate England coach Southgate
Saint Petersburg, Jul 4 (AFP) Mocked by Belgium's Thibaut Courtois for being too small for a top-class goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford stood tall when England needed a penalty shootout hero to end years of pain from the spot.
On just their seventh international appearance, Pickford became the first England stopper in 20 years to save a penalty at a major tournament.
With the sides tied at 3-3 in the shootout, the Everton 'keeper leapt to their right and got a strong left hand to Carlos Bacca's strike, putting the Three Lions on course to win a knockout game for the first time since 2006.
It was a sweet moment for Pickford, and for their manager Gareth Southgate, whose decision to back the 24-year-old despite their inexperience and leave 75-time capped Joe Hart out of their squad was vindicated.
"I don't care if I'm not the biggest keeper," said the 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metre) tall Pickford. "I've got that power and agility to get around the goal. I'm very good at it." Pickford deserved to have won the game a lot earlier on a tense night in Moscow.
As the game entered stoppage time they flew high to their left to turn Mateus Uribe's blistering long-range effort behind.
Pickford had barely got to their feet, though, when Yerry Mina's towering header from the resulting corner brought Colombia level with a crushing blow that more mentally fragile England sides of the past may not have recovered from.
"It was a top-class save. I'm surprised they could reach it given their height," Southgate said with a wry smile.
"He's really athletic around the goal, they are excellent and they executed the plan in the penalty shootout."
- 'Strange' technique -
=======================
Pickford was one of just two first-team regulars not rotated by Southgate against Belgium for England's final group game last week and was criticised for their technique in failing to stop Adnan Januzaj's effort that sealed top spot in Group G for the Red Devils.
"The goalkeeper is 10 centimetres smaller than me," Chelsea's giant goalkeeper Courtois told Belgian website Voetbal24.
"I would have caught it. They were too busy throwing their legs in the air." Courtois was not alone. Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, who also formed part of the England coaching team at Euro 2016, described Pickford's attempt to stop Januzaj's strike as "a bit strange".
"I've been criticised for going with my top hand, but as long as you save it, that's all that counts," said Pickford after silencing their critics.
"I might be young but I've got good mental strength and experience and I used that."
Southgate has suffered more than most from England's penalty torture in the past. Even after Tuesday's success, they admitted their miss in the Euro 1996 semi-final on home soil against Germany will live with them forever.
But in refusing to dismiss penalties as a lottery like many of their predecessors, their attention to detail paid off.
On top of psychometric tests for their players and incessant practice on the training ground, they even made sure Pickford handed the ball to each of their teammates to ensure opposite number David Ospina could not play any mind games by delaying their lonely walk from the centre circle even by a few seconds.
England had already waited too long to win on penalties. Thanks to Pickford that curse is now broken and their best chance in a generation to end 52 years of hurt at the World Cup remains intact

PaddockTalk Perspective
AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  The Austin police chief said Friday that a Ford Explorer SUV that the automaker repaired for a return to service with their department actually doesn't appear to have had exhaust containing carbon monoxide seeping into it  despite theirs saying earlier that it did.
Interim Police Chief Brian Manley said previously that during a test of three SUVs repaired by Ford Motor Company, one tested positive for carbon monoxide. But Manley told The Austin American-Statesman hours later that additional testing revealed alarms may have activated for some other reason, meaning their original assertions were a likely false alarm.
"We do not believe this issue is a Ford issue or related to the repairs they have done," Manley told The Statesman. That is consistent with Ford, which responded to Manley's earlier comments by defending its repairs and saying it has yet to receive all the details about the reported new problem.
Ford spokesperson Elizabeth Weigandt said Friday in an earlier emailed statement that, "Ford was not provided with information on the levels of CO detected but we are ready to inspect any vehicle."

They also said the automaker has "been happy to collaborate with" Austin police on repairs and added: "The methods and parts we've utilized to repair Austin's vehicles have worked well to address the concern."
Austin police pulled nearly 400 Explorers off patrol in July because of carbon monoxide concerns. Police departments across the country use Explorers and several also took them out of service.
Ford has previously blamed the issue on non-factory outfitters that drill holes into police SUVs to install extra equipment like lights and radios.

The One-Off Ferrari SP38 Looks Absolutely Incredible!
Ferrari's One-Off program has done it again! After releasing cars like Ferrari 458 MM Speciale, the SP Arya, the F12 TRS, or the super limited-run Ferrari J50, they've unveiled a new one-off supercar this week: the Ferrari SP38. This new Special Projects model is based on the impressive 488 GTB platform, and it was unveiled at Fiorano to a special customer.
Designed by the Ferrari Style Centre, the SP38 seems to be inspired by the iconic Ferrari F40. It comes with cool new headlights, a thin front bumper lip and hidden side air intakes. At the back, the rear bonnet and window have been replaced by a carbon fiber structure. Looking good, right?
Speaking of updates, that mesmerizing shade of red is actually a bespoke triple-layer metallic red that was designed specifically for this car. And if you're thinking about what the lucky owner of this beauty will find inside the cockpit, I'm sorry to say you will be disappointed. Ferrari hasn't revealed any details about the interior spec yet, but we're sure their Taylor Made program came up with some very special for this one-off supercar.
If you're already jealous, you should know that they Ferrari SP38 is no different than the 488 GTB, at least where it counts. It comes with the same 3.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8, that's good for about 670 hp and 760 Nm. As a result, the SP38 will do 0 to 100 km/h in around 3.0 seconds and reach a top speed of around 330 km/h. Does that sound OK?
The $1.9-billion project covers a 16-mile stretch of the 405 between the 73 Freeway in Costa Mesa and the 605 Freeway near the Los Angeles County line. It includes building one new general-purpose lane in each direction between the 605 and Euclid Street and adding a new lane in both directions between the 605 and the 73 that, combined with the existing carpool lanes, will create “express” toll lanes much like those on the 91 Freeway.

One prosperity gospel televangelist is now taking donations for their next private jet…
Oh wait, excuse me, their “ministry's private jet.”
Louisiana preacher Jesse Duplantis already has three private jets, but they need a fourth one to get them closer to God.
According to CNN, Jesse was having a convo with the one upstairs when the epiphany came that they needed a new $54 million plane. “It was one of the greatest statements the Lord ever told me,” Jesse said.
“He said, ‘Jesse do you want to come up where I'm at? I want you to bleed me for a Falcon 7X.'”
In other words, folks pull out your wallets!
Jesse made a whole video on their website urging their congregation to donate to their private jet fund saying “All it's gonna do is it's going to touch people, it's going to reach people, it's going to change lives one soul at a time.”
There's more.
“I really believe that if Jesus was physically on the earth today, they wouldn't be riding a donkey,” Jesse said. “He'd be in an airplane preaching the Gospel all over the world.”
So I guess Jesse never thought Jesus might be fine with the coach section.
This isn't the first time a minister has wanted their jets shining for Jesus.
Another prosperity gospel preacher, Kenneth Copeland, bought a Gulfstream V jet from Tyler Perry using donations from their congregation.
You can watch Kenneth and Jesse defend their needs to fly luxuriously in the clip below…
…if you can stomach it.

American Canyon High School won't be calling a U-Haul truck, but the school could be making a big move in a little over a year from now.
Last week American Canyon, along with Napa and Vintage high schools, were approved by a 9-0 vote to leave the CIF Sac-Joaquin Section, possibly for the North Coast Section starting in the 2018-19 school year.
The request was made by the Napa Valley Unified School District (NVUSD) in January from a letter by Mark Morrison, executive director of secondary education for the district.
On Monday, American Canyon athletic director Jill Stewart explained by email the motivation for their school to join the North Coast Section.
“Three schools in the NVUSD will be aligned,” Stewart said. “We wanted to bolster community rivalries within the district. There are better opportunities for our teams to go further in the playoffs as NCS uses a competitive equity model. Declining enrollment in NVUSD schools and school size fitting better in NCS (were other reasons).”
The NCS will have an alignment committee meeting on Thursday in San Ramon. It will be at this meeting that a discussion will be held about which league or leagues the schools will be joining.
“We are not sure as of yet (where we will be heading); there's been lot's of speculation,” Stewart said. “I will be attending the NCS meeting on Thursday to get an idea of the conferences and leagues, and the in's and out's of the section.”
Stewart also didn't know how the Solano County Athletic Conference would look once their school leaves.
“From what I have heard and read, the SCAC and Monticello Empire League (MEL) made a proposal at the last SJS alignment meeting to become a nine-team conference,” Stewart said. The SCAC currently consists of American Canyon, Benicia, Bethel, Fairfield, Vallejo and Vanden. The MEL currently consists of Napa, Vintage, Vacaville, Armijo, Rodriguez and Will C. Wood.
It was reported in January that Vanden was voted into the MEL during a realignment meeting with Wood possibly joining the SCAC. That changed in the Feb. 9 realignment meeting where a nine-team MEL/SCAC league was proposed.
Although American Canyon opened in August of 2010, the Wolves have competed in all varsity sports in the SCAC since the 2011-12 school year. The football team has won at least a share of the SCAC title the last five years. The boys soccer team won a SCAC title in 2015, while the girls soccer team won a co-league title in 2016. In February of 2013, the school's girls wrestling program won a Sac-Joaquin Section title, American Canyon's only section title in the school's history.

When Stewart was asked if they felt the school, with its growing enrollment and now in its seventh year of existence, had outgrown the Sac-Joaquin Section, they aren't quite sure of the answer.
“Out grown? That's tough to say,” Stewart replied. “I know that as a school and district aligning our three high schools is most important. This will provide continuity to our district which is needed as our athletic programs grow.”
Although American Canyon could soon be moving on from the SCAC, Stewart still had kind words for the league and schools currently residing in it.
“We have fostered good relationships with the SCAC schools and some good rivalries,” Stewart said. “I hope to continue these relationships in non-conference play. As for leaving the section, our school has worked with the SJS on various committees, therefore it was not an easy decision as we have fostered a good relationship with the section.

A Perfect Circle wrapped up the first leg of their 2018 tour with a performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live Monday night. They won't stay off the road for long, however, as they've just confirmed a bevy of new dates in both North America and Europe scheduled for later this year.
The 11-city North American leg kicks off October 20th in Salt Lake City and also includes dates at the famed Red Rocks in Morrison, CO; The Theater at Madison Square Garden in NYC; and the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville. Come December, they'll head across the Atlantic for shows in the UK, Scotland, and Europe.
A Perfect Circle is touring in support of Eat the Elephant, the band's long-awaited follow-up to 2004's Emotive and their first record since reuniting in 2010. Check out their complete tour itinerary below, and grab tickets here.
Between A Perfect Circle's upcoming dates, singer Maynard James Keenan will *hopefully* put the finishing touches on Tool's own long-awaited new album, while guitarist James Iha is set to reunite with Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin for an extensive tour.

You can't go wrong with Bach. Any time. Any place. Performed in just about any cockamamie way.
Bach befits Christmas better than any other composer, although they aren't usually the first to be called upon. Handel's ubiquitous “Messiah,” suited for Easter, is the Grinch who stole Christmas from Bach's “Christmas” Oratorio. You will have no troubling stumbling upon a performance of the Handel oratorio wherever you find yourself.
But Sunday happened to be a special Bach day. The joyous “Christmas” Oratorio, which has always taken a backseat to Bach's great tragic Passions (“St. Matthew” and “St. John”), received an effervescent performance from the Bach Collegium Japan at the Renée and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall in Costa Mesa in the afternoon, leaving just enough time to wend through holiday traffic for an equally rare reading of Bach's motets by the Los Angeles Master Chorale at Walt Disney Concert Hall in the evening.
In their program note, John Magnum, the president and artistic director of the Philharmonic Society of Orange County (which presented the Collegium), calls the “Christmas” Oratorio the summation of Bach's art as a composer of sacred music. In a booklet note to their latest recording of the motets, the conductor John Eliot Gardiner claims these unaccompanied pieces for chorus constitute the most perfect, and in some ways most hypnotic, set of Bach's works. The two together make for a big day.
In fact, the oratorio is an exercise, quite like nothing else, in unabashed elation. The motets, quite like nothing else originally meant to have a funerary function, are an unlikely exercise in abashed elation.
Elation was to be had Sunday, but curiously, it was the oratorio, as performed by conductor Masaaki Suzuki and their exquisitely trained chorus and orchestra, that proved utterly hypnotic in its quest to reveal the intricate perfection in Bach. Meanwhile, the more sweeping approach to the motets by the Master Chorale's new associate conductor, Jenny Wong, meant raising religiosity much closer to their sleeve.
Suzuki's Collegium is a special group. It adheres to the rigors of early music performance practice with the ascetic formality of a Noh troupe. Yet Suzuki, with their trademark guru-like flowing white hair, happens to have a lively, even puckish, way about him. The exuberant opening chorus of the oratorio begins with such lines as “Shout for joy … abandon hesitation, banish lamentation, begin to sing with … exultation.”
That is exactly what Suzuki got the chorus to do. The small period-instrument orchestra lacked nothing for neon-brilliant illumination. Unreliable valveless trumpets were astonishingly reliable. Dull, old wood flutes sparkled. Timpani sent out sparks.
It was hard to sit still. Yet it was impossible not to sit still, because there was all that detail to admire. While holding back nothing, Suzuki also missed nothing.
This isn't a real oratorio but rather a de facto collection of six cantatas, the first three and the final one relating to the Nativity story. The other two are for New Year's, and Suzuki left them out to keep the performance to just over two hours. It was a reasonable choice. One can handle only so much superb polish — the gloss of the orchestra, the shimmer of the chorus — at one time. Scene setting was exacting in every application of instrumental color. The chorus captured the harmonic intricacies of chorales with micro-tuned flawlessness. Fugues, unexpectedly, seemed almost danceable.
All the emphasis was on the music. Suzuki let the listener apply the religiosity as desired. This went so far as the soloists (soprano Sherezade Panthaki, countertenor Jay Carter, tenor Zachary Wilder and bass Dominik Wörner). All were adequate, with none bringing out much individuality. But part of Bach's greatness, as Suzuki ultimately proved, is that while their music has room to spare for the cult of personality (think Glenn Gould), it just as easily and just as incomparably transcends that cult.
The Master Chorale's Wong comes down on the side of religion. In remarks to the audience, they suggested a cosmic hierarchy with God at the top, Bach in the middle, and the rest of us on the bottom.
It was a bold move for Wong to make their debut with the Master Chorale conducting the six motets, which they led from memory. They used a chorus of 48, large enough to make a mighty sound and large enough to muddy up the rich complexity of inner lines.
They added the accompaniment of cello and portative organ (pairs of the instruments when the choir was divided for the polyphonic motets). They could barely be heard, and proved an annoyance, although they probably helped the chorus maintain steadiness in the difficult contrapuntal passages. Still, why not live it up and use Hurricane Mama, the big Disney Hall organ, and add some real color? It's Christmas after all.
Wong's basic approach was for continual grace and beauty, which could lead to blandness but also impressive robust grandeur. Attempts at theater in polyphonic motets didn't work, such as the chorus clumsily moving to the lip of the stage in front of Wong, who continued to enthusiastically conduct to thin air. But they later undid that pomp by achieving a liminal splendor on the words “Gute Nacht,” bidding a barely audible farewell to sin and pride, the hall lights at that moment effectively lowered.
Elation was the hardest part for Wong, but with the last motet, “Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden” (Praise the Lord, All Ye Heathen), they did not fear (subject of an earlier motet) letting go. They let the spirit give aid (the subject of another motet), and the results were glorious elation. You really can't go wrong with Bach.

Keeping tabs on a tabby's tail can help pet owners understand their cat's behaviour much better.
But you also must take into account the cat's body language to fully understand what they are thinking about, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine's Carlos Siracusa tells National Geographic.
A tapping tail while a cat is napping is "relaxed overall but paying attention to something happening around him, a sound or movement," said Siracusa. If the cat is actually sleeping, it could mean the cat is dreaming.
However, an alert cat that is whipping its tail could suggest nervousness and potential aggression. You would be wise to not touch the cat, Siracusa said.
A tail that is straight up with a curved tip means a cat is being friendly, while an aggressive cat may have its tale straight up.
A relaxed cat will "carry their tail in a neutral or low position," adds Siracusa, while a downward curve can mean defensiveness.
Although figuring out tail movements and what they mean can be a bit tricky, cat's legs tell owners what is really going on.
When a cat darts from one room to another for no apparent reason, sometimes called "the zoomies," it may be due to accumulated arousal, frustration, fear, or pent-up energy, said Siracusa.
In their natural habitat, cats would be climbing trees and chasing prey if they weren't cooped up inside a home, which is low on stimulation.
And cats are more active at dawn and dusk, while the rest of the day they are storing up energy, usually by sleeping or dozing off.
A casualty of the Nintendo Switch port of “Dark Souls: Remastered” being delayed, the upcoming Network Test on the console has also been pushed back, developer From Software revealed yesterday on the official “Dark Souls” Twitter account. The Test on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is set to continue as planned.
“Unfortunately, the change of the Switch release date has affected its Network Test and it will be arranged separately from the test for PS4/XB1,” From Software wrote in the Tweet. “Network Test dates for the Switch will also be announced at the earliest possible opportunity.”
Originally, after the Switch port was announced during a Nintendo Direct on March 8, the Network Test was supposed to launch on the Nintendo eShop “soon,” though no specific date was ever given.
It was announced last week that the Nintendo Switch version of “Dark Souls: Remastered” was being delayed from its original May 25 release date to an unspecified date later this summer. “The new release timing gives the development team the time needed to make sure Nintendo Switch players can fully appreciate the true ‘Dark Souls' experience anytime and anywhere, thanks to the unique portable nature of the Nintendo Switch console,” publisher Bandai Namco said in a press release at the time. The company didn't offer any other specifics about the delay, nor did it immediately respond to Variety's comment request.
“Dark Souls: Remastered” is still set to be released on May 25 for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.
“Dark Souls: Remastered,” as the name implies, is a remastered version of From Software's 2011 game “Dark Souls.” Though not the first “Souls” game, having been a spiritual successor to the developer's 2009 game “Demon Souls,” “Dark Souls” catapulted the series to cult-classic territory. It's since been followed by two sequels, released in 2014 and 2016, and its own spiritual successor “Bloodborne,” released exclusively for the PlayStation 4 in 2015.

Even if B.C. sweeps the club's final five games, it still might not be enough to make the post-season
There was a palpable anger in the B.C. Lions' locker-room following a last-second loss to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats two weeks ago.
Wally Buono would like to see a little more of that emotion from their team on the field.
“After the fact, it's too late. Maybe go into the game a little more angry,” said B.C.'s head coach and general manager. “Football is an emotional game played by angry men.
“The anger has to come before the game, not after the game.”
Fresh off a bye week, where all they could do was stew over the crushing 24-23 home defeat that put another major dent in their playoff hopes, the Lions (6-7) sit last in the CFL's West Division as they prepare to host the Ottawa Redblacks (5-9-1) on Saturday.
Even if B.C. sweeps the club's final five games, it still might not be enough to make the post-season with the Saskatchewan Roughriders (7-6) and Edmonton Eskimos (7-6), who sit third and fourth in the West, both holding the tiebreaker over the Lions.
“You wanna be in the playoffs? You're in the playoffs,” Buono said in describing their team's current predicament. “I've been here a million times.
“I can handle the pressure. Can you?”

The good news for B.C. is Edmonton has lost six straight after starting the season 7-0, but the success or failure of the teams ahead of the Lions in the standings won't matter if they can't figure out their own game.
“It's playoff football for us right now,” said B.C. wide receiver Bryan Burnham. ”We can't lose. We can't rely on other teams. We have to do what we can.
“Every game's a must-win from here on out.”
🚀🚀🚀 #Repost @tsn_official ・・・ Jonathon Jennings keeps airing it out, Lions' receivers keep hauling them in! 🚀 A post shared by BC Lions Football Club (@bclions_official) on Sep 22, 2017 at 10:35pm PDT
Lions quarterback Jonathon Jennings showed signs of life in the loss to Hamilton after a dismal performance against the Calgary Stampeders the previous week, but an offence that was supposed to light up the scoreboard has still yet to find its rhythm for a club that has lost two straight and five of its last six.
“It's been a tough season for all of us,” said Jennings, who has just six touchdown passes and an ugly 12 interceptions. ”It hurts to lose, especially with all the expectations we have for ourselves.
“But we know it's not over. We know our chances aren't lost.”
Wide receiver Chris Williams, who signed with B.C. following two outstanding seasons in Ottawa, said the Lions' biggest problem has been a lack of execution in key moments.
“We've just got to go out there and make plays when the opportunities are given,” said Williams. ”There's going to be some opportunities out there. We've got to sting them. We've got to make it count.”
The Redblacks, meanwhile, sit second in the East after two straight losses — including last week's 18-17 home defeat to Saskatchewan — but should have star quarterback Trevor Harris, who suffered a separated throwing shoulder on Sept. 9, under centre at B.C. Place Stadium.
Last season's Grey Cup champions, seven of the Redblacks' nine losses have been a combined 17 points in what has also been a frustrating 2017.
“You play football to play football, not to watch it or be on the (injured reserve),” Harris told reporters in Ottawa before the team flew west. “Even just missing three weeks is something that's an eye-opener.”
The Redblacks beat the Lions 31-24 in the nation's capital back on Aug. 26. The visitors trailed 31-3 in the fourth quarter before a frantic comeback attempt fell short after quarterback Travis Lulay replaced an ineffective Jennings.
But Lulay suffered a torn ACL in their right knee two weeks later, thrusting Jennings back into the starting role.
Despite their struggles, Buono said the third-year pivot still has a chance to save both theirs and the Lions' season.
It just has to start now.
“Athletes thrive on success,” said Buono. “When success doesn't happen, everybody's confidence starts to wane. It's what your foundation is, it's what your beliefs are, it's what your support system is that helps you to get through it.
“At the end of it you've got to pick yourself up. Nobody's going to help you.”

Winter isn't here quite yet, but the Colts and Bills treated us to one of the most memorable snow games on Sunday. The "Snow Bowl" was all about what players could do with their legs rather than their arms. The Colts and Bills combined for only 156 passing yards, but veteran RB Frank Gore ran for 130 yards, while the Bills' LeSean McCoy had 156 of their own.
One of the highlights came late in the 4th quarter when Colts K Adam Vinatieri made a 43-yard extra point to send the game to overtime.
The Bills would win in OT on a 21-yard run by McCoy, but everyone knows Mother Nature was the real MVP.
This game reminded us of a few other times when the gridiron seemed like a winter wonderland. From the Snowplow game to the Ice Bowl, here are the 10 Best Snow Moments in NFL History.
Moments are ranked by game temperature.
10. Leon Lett's Turkey Day Blunder
Game: Dolphins vs. Cowboys
Date: 11/25/1993
Temp: 33 °F
Less than a year after their Super Bowl XXVII gaffe, Leon Lett had this miscue leading to a Miami recovery and subsequent game-winning field goal. If you thought your family Thanksgiving dinners were awkward, imagine how the Cowboys' locker room was after this one.
9. Brett Favre's Throws Three TDs (and a Few Snowballs)
Game: Seahawks vs. Packers
Date: 1/12/2008
Temp: 31 °F
Brett Favre's final victory as a Packer was a memorable one. The Hall of Famer completed 18 of 23 passes for 173 touchdowns and three touchdowns in the Packers' 42-20 victory.
8. Steve Van Buren Runs Away With the 1948 NFL Championship
Game: (Chicago) Cardinals vs. Eagles
Date: 12/19/1948
Temp: 28 °F
The conditions at Shibe Park were so treacherous that nearly 8,000 fans who had paid for their tickets chose to watch the 1948 NFL Championship from home rather than attend. The tarp on the field was so heavy from the snow accumulation, that the players had to help the grounds crew remove it before the start of the game. Steve Van Buren plowed their way to 98 yards on 26 carries, including the only scoring play of the game -- a five-yard rushing TD in the 4th quarter.
7. LeSean McCoy Goes Off for 217 Rushing Yards
Game: Lions vs. Eagles
Date: 12/8/2013
Temp: 27 °F
Running in a few feet of snow is difficult, but rushing for over 200 yards in the snow is nearly impossible. LeSean McCoy ran for 217 rushing yards in the Eagles' 34-20 victory, breaking Steve Van Buren's single-game franchise record of 205 yards.
6. The Snowplow Game
Game: Dolphins vs. Patriots
Date: 12/12/1982
Temp: 26 °F
New England's kicker John Smith made the kick, but the snowplow gave the essential assist. Dolphins coach Don Shula protested the Patriots' victory, but then-commissioner Pete Rozelle, said the result could not be reversed. The Dolphins would get revenge a month later by beating the Pats, 28-13 in the first round of the playoffs.
5. Adam Vinatieri's Kicks Off the Pats' Dynasty
Game: Raiders vs. Patriots
Date: 1/19/2002
Temp: 25 °F
This 23-yarder could've joined the likes of Wide Right and other infamous misses, but instead Adam Vinatieri's kick marked the beginning of the Patriots' dynasty. Vinatieri couldn't nail the second 40-plus yarder on Sunday, but they remain one of the snow game (and kicker) G.O.A.T.s.
4. The Ice Bowl II
Game: 1975 AFC Championship (Steelers vs. Raiders)
Date: 1/4/1976
Temp: 23 °F
With icy conditions causing 12 total turnovers and 12 total punts, it's amazing the Steelers and Raiders still managed to put up 26 points.
3. The Frigid OT Thriller at the Frozen Tundra
Game: 2007 NFC Championship (Giants vs. Packers)
Date: 1/20/2008
Temp: -1°F
One look at at Tom Coughlin's crimson face and you could tell the conditions were glacial. Coughlin's hue was due to the frozen tundra being -1 °F with a wind chill of â23 °F. Despite the conditions, Eli Manning and Brett Favre both threw for over 200 yards in a seesaw contest that ultimately came down to a 47-yard game winning field goal by the Giants' Lawrence Tynes.
2. The Freezer Bowl
Game: 1981 AFC Championship (Chargers vs. Bengals)
Date: 1/10/1982
Temp: -9 °F
It was a balmy -9 °F when the Chargers took on the Bengals in the 1981 AFC Championship. The average low temperature in San Diego in January is 49 °F, can you really blame them for losing 27-7?
1. Bart Starr's One-Yard Rush to Win the Ice Bowl
Game: 1967 NFL Championship
Date: 12/31/1967
Temp: -13 °F
This one-yard run by Bart Starr sealed the 1967 NFL Championship for the Packers and also got their teammates out of the -13 °F (-48 °F with the wind chill) conditions of the Ice Bowl.
Atari co-founder Samuel “Ted” Dabney died on Saturday after a battle with cancer. They were 81.
An electrical engineer and former U.S. Marine from San Francisco, Calif., Dabney developed “Computer Space,” the world's very first commercial video game, with Nolan Bushnell in 1970. The game was a failure upon release in 1971, but in June of the following year, the pair launched Pong, Atari's smash arcade hit.
Although they left the company in 1973 after a falling out with Bushnell, Dabney made an indelible mark on the video-game industry. They famously built Atari's earliest arcade machines from repurposed TV components, and played an instrumental role in shaping the unmistakable sound effects that defined the arcades of the '70s and '80s. Despite the differences, the pair collaborated on Pizza Time Theatre, which later became known as Chuck E. Cheese's.
Dabney spent time at Raytheon and Fujitsu, and continued making games under the banner of their own Syzygy Game Company. They later owned and operated a grocery store and deli with their wife, Carolyn. Dabney was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in late 2017.
“Ted was my partner, co-founder, fellow dreamer, and friend,” Bushnell tweeted upon hearing the news. “I'll always cherish the time we spent together.”
On Saturday morning, Marty Goldberg and Curt Vendel, authors of the book “Atari Inc.,” paid tribute to Dabney in a Facebook post: “We're at a loss. We just got word that our friend, one of the nicest, sweetest down-to-earth guys we knew, Atari co-founder Ted Dabney, has passed from their cancer. Thought they still had a bit more time. You always wish someone like them did.”
To the Editor:
As Superintendent of the Williamsburg Independent School District and on behalf of our Board of Education, I would like to thank our school community for their incredible and thoughtful support of our WHS varsity girls' basketball team during the recent All A Classic State Basketball Tournament hosted at EKU this past week. Making it to the Final Four of this tournament was an amazing “history-making” experience for our girls and for our school and our entire community.
The outpouring of support and love for our team and for our school was phenomenal, and I can say with full confidence that our coaches and our team felt that support and are very thankful for it. That support is one of the things that is so special about our school, and we don't ever want to take that for granted. Not only our own school community but the surrounding community as well have supported this team and continue to support them as shown by all the calls, emails, notes and the great crowds that were present for each game.
Coach Crider, their staff, and their team were full aware that they were representing the 13th Region in their tournament bid and were humbled by the opportunity that they had. Again, on behalf of our entire school community, thank you so very much!! Go Jackets.
Amon W. Couch, Ed.D

The 2018 NFL Draft is just days away, and for most New England Patriots fans, the buzz has never been higher. This is an extremely important offseason for the franchise and the Patriots need an influx of young talent on defense, which was made clear in Super Bowl LII. One potential focus for the Pats in this year's draft is perennial “need” of edge rusher.
The edge rusher position in today's NFL differs depending on who you ask, but in Bill Belichick's defensive scheme, the edge rusher's main responsibility is the ability to set the edge of the line of scrimmage more so than just filling up a stat sheet with sacks. With two first-round picks, this upcoming draft has the potential to resemble that of 2012, when the team selected Chandler Jones and Dont'a Hightower. While Hightower came out of Alabama as your traditional middle-of-the-field linebacker, they have since been molded into a more dynamic weapon rushing the passer in addition to stopping the run.
The Patriots never quite filled the yearly production they got from Jones after shipping them out to Arizona two years ago. The Patriots have a star in Trey Flowers and will turn to Deatrich Wise Jr. to take a leap in year two. It is also hard to hate the Adrian Clayborn signing. But the writing is still on the wall: the 2018 Patriots need to do a better job at creating pressure than the 2017 Patriots did. Here's one prospect in each round that could help this year's defense.
There's a lot to like about the Patriots potentially adding a guy like Landry, aside from them being a Boston College product. First off, they might be the class' second-best pure rusher behind Bradley Chubb. The Patriots sent defensive line coach Brendan Daly to watch film with Landry. Check out this tweet from CLNS Media's Mike Petraglia.
DALY INTENSE: Just sensational coaching up of potential first rounder Harold Landry @HAROLDLANDRY2 by #Patriots DL coach Brendan Daly pic.twitter.com/WOxCny2aoc — Mike Petraglia (@Trags) March 21, 2018
Landry is a little undersized at six-foot-three-inches, but they have a knack for getting after the quarterback. They had a down 2017 campaign, but they racked up 16.5 sacks their junior year. Some mock drafts have them penciled in as high as nine to San Francisco, while others have them right in the Patriots wheelhouse in the early 20's.

Josh Sweat is a freak athlete, plain and simple. Their best shot at NFL stardom, however, might be a switch to outside linebacker, a la Jamie Collins. Sweat's stock is all over the board. He's been slotted anywhere from the end of the first round, which is an over-assessment, to the beginning of the third round. They have a pretty long injury history, which could cause them to slide a bit, but Patriots haven't shied away from guys with medical red flags in the past. One interesting tidbit, according to MockDraftable, is that Sweat's combine numbers compare to the likes of Jadeveon Clowney and Bradley Chubb. The Patriots also hosted Sweat on a Top-30 visit earlier this month. Insert eyes emoji.

We're cheating a bit here with this one, as Hubbard is more of your traditional defensive end. However, there might not be a more perfect Patriot fit in this draft at the position. Aside from them receiving a lacrosse scholarship from Notre Dame, Hubbard crushed the 3-cone drill at the Combine with a 6.84 time. Their strength of identifying the play would certainly help with the run defense, which was abysmal last season. They did have 13.5 tackles for loss last season for the Buckeyes. Hubbard would be a solid play with the 43rd pick, and being a Greg Schiano guy, should certainly be on the Patriots radar.

Here's a list of players who met with Patriots at 2018 NFL Combine 2018 Patriots mock draft: Bill Belichick drafts Malcolm Butler's replacement
It is clear Bill Belichick loves two things: prospects that hail from Rutgers and versatile football players. While the Rutgers connection was fueled by Belichick and Schiano's friendship when they were the coach for the Scarlet Knights, Turay's ability to to play all over the defensive line could be worth a revisit to the pipeline. For what it's worth, Turay's NFL.com comparison is Yannick Ngakoue. Like Ngakoue, Turay is a fantastic tackler and is explosive getting off the line. Turay could sneak into the second round, and with the Pats' third-round selection not coming until the end of the round, and the team currently lacking a fourth-round pick, a trade up or down might be in order.
We get to the point of the NFL draft where every selection is a wild card, but there are some things to like about Utah's Kylie Fitts. Their long arms fit the Patriots mold and they have the ability to not only rush the passer, but drop back in coverage at times. The talent is there: Fitts was originally signed by UCLA out of high school as a four-star recruit and top 10 defensive end prospect, according to NFL.com. The major knock on Fitts is they have trouble staying healthy. If the Patriots can find a way to keep them on the field in a limited role, they could be a potential steal on Day 3.
Louisville has been an intriguing school to watch this draft season. Yes, the Patriots have been linked to quarterback Lamar Jackson, but the school has a few other prospects that will get scooped up next weekend, particularly cornerback Jaire Alexander and defensive end Trevon Young. Young is still working their way back from a rough hip injury in 2015, but has the ability to crack an NFL roster via special teams.

Nick Caserio attends Lamar Jackson's pro day
Dooley's role has increased the last two seasons at Wisconsin after some defensive standouts went down with injuries. In 2016, Dooley filled in for injured Vince Biegel, who is currently with the Packers, and their role increased once again last season when the Badgers defensive standout Jack Cichy went down with a knee injury. Filling in for Cichy, Dooley totaled six sacks. Their ability to answer the bell when called upon is clear, but their future on an NFL roster is not. Dooley's best bet is a camp tryout in hopes of cracking a squad on special teams.
An important construction project is now underway in a Bow River channel that runs parallel to Quarry Park in southeast Calgary.
It's the first of five sites the city has identified as areas where fish habitat in the Bow can be improved.
“What we're actually doing is we're reactivating a channel that's about a kilometer long, so they're making it a little wider and making it a little deeper,” said Shane Keating, Ward 12 councillor.
“So over the winter and in the spring the fish will have a great place in which they can spawn.”
Severe bank erosion caused by the June 2013 flood forced the city to take measures to mitigate any further damage.
WATCH ABOVE: The city is forging ahead with shoring up the banks of the Bow ahead of the spring melt. Work continues along Memorial Drive at 19th street in the north west. And as Doug Vaessen reports even bigger projects will soon begin down river to protect homes and an Enmax substation in the southeast.
Truck-loads of riprap were brought in to shore up weakened banks.
It solved the problem, but created another – the loss of sensitive fish habitat.
“When you just put a bunch of rocks in an area, there's nothing there for the bugs that are in the water to be able to finish their life cycle, so the vegetation is absolutely critical,” said David Blair, co-owner of Fish Tales, a fishing supply store in Calgary.
Blair said there are several ways to improve fish habitat in the river.
“They can install woody debris, they can create some undercut banks, plant willow bushes – all of that stuff, which is 100 per cent natural, is way superior to just a bunch of rocks in the river.”
Scott Meldrum, who often fishes on the Bow River, agreed protecting fish habitat is important.
“I think it's for a great cause. I mean we've got to keep these waters nice and clean, and keep the fish coming,” Meldrum said.
“People fly over here from all over the world to fish this river. And it's just great fishing.”
And for Blair, that's what keeps them in business.
“For us it's critical – it's the whole reason that we are in business is because of the Bow River,” Blair said.
To accommodate the Quarry Park project, the city installed fencing and closed a pedestrian path along the river bank.
It's slated for completion by the end of October.
Design work on two other projects to restore fish habitat has been approved for Bowmont West and Beaverdam Flats.
Each project costs $2 – 3 million each, with costs shared by the city and the province's flood mitigation program.

On five occasions this season, Scunthorpe have conceded in the 85 minute or later, which has cost them nine points overall.
With those extra nine points Scunthorpe would currently sit fourth, be on 67 points and still have a sniff of still finishing in the top two.
But the reality is they don't have those extra points and their priority now is making sure they amass enough points to remain in the play-offs with Plymouth and Peterborough breathing down their necks.
Indeed if both those sides win the game in hand they have over the Iron, then Scunthorpe will find themselves outside the top six for the first time since the middle of October.
The truth is Scunthorpe should be comfortably inside the top six, but the reality is they are not.
What makes it more galling seven of those dropped nine points have come in the last two months.
They conceded injury time equalisers against Doncaster and Bristol Rovers, an 87 minute equaliser at Wigan, while an injury time goal from Southend United's Michael Turner condemned them to defeat at Roots Hall.
Conceding so many late goals is nothing new in a United side but it has certainly been highlighted due to the fact it has happened so many times in such a short period of time.
For the record the other time Scunthorpe have conceded late was against Fleetwood back in October when an 85th minute goal saw the Cod Army rescue a 1-1 draw.
So although Scunthorpe have lost plenty of points from losing positions, they have also gained plenty of points in the last 10 minutes.
It actually outweighs the number of points they have lost with the Iron winning 12 points in the last 10 minutes of games.
Josh Morris has won plenty of those points with late goals against Oxford, Bury and Peterborough giving the Iron victories in all these matches.
There were also late goals against Oldham, Bristol Rovers and Bury for Duane Holmes, Neal Bishop and Charlie Goode that have all turned draws into wins.
So although there have been plenty of occasions where Scunthorpe have lost points, and there are a variety of reasons for that, they are actually three points up if you weight it against the late goals they have scored this season.
There is nothing better than your side scoring a last minute winner and nothing worse than conceding a last minute goal and Scunthorpe have had plenty of those experiences this season.
But as with last season, there is still a big feeling of ‘what if.' But only the end of the season will decide how crucial those dropped points will be.
“I have to admit I thrive on the duality of being a Gemini,” says artist-turned-designer Payal Khandwala. “I love that I enjoy the dichotomies in all things, be it in people, in situations, in clothes. I don't like too much of one thing. I find that being able to be adaptable allows me to appreciate what makes life more layered and complex.” Geminis have a bad rep for their indecisiveness, but Khandwala is turning that notion around on its head.
The designer has launched a collection of reversible saris called ‘Gemini', which borrow from the duality of the zodiac sign to offer more to the customer. “Like most of us, I'm looking to reuse my garments without having to invest in more. I wanted to extend this experience to the sari, so that it can in some ways become a little more expressive than it already is. This is why I recreated the sari as a little sari that doubles as a dupatta, and this time around I re-imagined it as a reversible sari. The idea, as always, is to keep our wardrobe as modular and flexible as we can without the fuss, and preferably without having to spend more money,” they explain.
Technically speaking, the sari has two pallus that allow it to be reversed. The design is such that it extends along the length of the pallus for maximum impact. Alongside the sari, Khandwala has introduced a new range of blouses with the capsule collection as well, that are anything but basic. “We have sleeveless tops, wraps, blouses, box tops, tunics and waistcoats. Our pleated shapes are very inclusive when it comes to sizes; this makes them a great go-to option for alternates to blouses. They sit close to the body to contrast the volume of the sari, but they remove the hassle of the fitted blouse, as they expand and contract generously to fit,” adds Khandwala. Scroll through the slideshow below for a quick glance at their new collection.

Mumbai: Public lender Punjab National Bank said it has initiated the process of raising up to Rs 5,000 crore through (QIP).
The committee of directors for capital mop-up at a meeting approved opening of the QIP, Punjab National Bank (PNB) said in a regulatory filing on stock exchanges.
The bank has approved the floor price of Rs 176.35 per share of face value Rs 2, it said.
The board of the bank had already given approval a few weeks ago to mobilisation of Rs 5,000 crore through various instruments, including rights issue and private placement, during 2017-18.
The total fundraising, including the upsize option, is aimed at boosting the bank's capital ratio.
State-run banks are raising funds as part of a recapitalisation plan in which New Delhi will inject 1.35 trillion rupees through recapitalisation bonds, while the lenders are required to raise on their own about 580 billion rupees.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Kotak Mahindra Capital, Morgan Stanley and PNB Investment Services are the banks managing the sale.

LAHORE - It was difficult to understand why they were doing it but one could gauge the pain that they were still going through while standing at the Charing Cross signal the site of tragic blast incident.
The man was Naveed Khan, who runs a shwarma shop on The Mall. They were taking photos and making videos with their cell phone of the site, which was washed sometime in the late afternoon. It was amazing the way they were taking the photos. “It was a tragic incident. It is now part of history and I want to keep record of this tragic chapter of our history. Last night I had seen this place filled with the blood and body parts of the victims of bomb blast.
“It's heart wrenching as I saw it all personally just few yards from Al-Falah building,” Naveed said.  They are no doubt a very brave man who instead of running away from the scene fully participated in relief efforts to shift the injured and dead bodies to hospitals.
“The site has been washed. Nothing reminds you of what happened yesterday. It is black metal surface of the road and a shattered-pole,” they said with a sigh.
The Charing Cross was opened to traffic and public at around five in the evening. Every passerby stood for a moment. Men or women on foot or in their cars slowed down to have a look at the same place where the incident had taken place. There was sadness on everyone's face and the people hardly talked about what had happened there yesterday. Their solemn faces showed their grief. Their eyes were telling the whole truth.
“It's unbelievable that how a man with so many explosives came here to conduct the blast. Today, all my fellow traders are very sad for the innocent lives that we have lost,” Naveed said.
A couple on a motorbike stood there for some minutes and started cursing perpetrators of the blast. They also condemned the government for its failure to protect people. “Hell to the attacker and hell to those who gave them birth,” said the lady, with anguish visible on their face. “Baira gharq howay zalma da” (may they rot in hell), the lady said loudly and then they both left for their destination.
Some people who were sitting beside the wall of Al-Habib Bank near Regal Chowk, just in front of Hall Road at the Mall, and were sharing their views about the incident.
Rafiq Ahmed, a man with white beard and wrapped in green shalwar kameez said to another man sitting next to them whom they called Tahir at the tea shop. “Police were targeted because the attacker blew themselves up at the moment when all the senior officials had reached there.
“Some days ago, a religious group staged rally but it was all peaceful. There was no terror threat then. But these peaceful pharmacists became target of terrorists,” they said. This scribe also intervened and asked them that “if the IPL was the focus of the perpetrators as some people were saying that India doesn't want it to be successful” they replied “No, this doesn't look like, it were police.
Another at the place sipping tea said very quietly that this is a new series of attacks which has begun when the new team of army leadership is in charge now and they want to put pressure on it. They, then started criticizing police saying that how a common man expect peace and safety if police themselves are not secure.
“Yes, you're right! No security for anyone. May God bless us all. We are at the mercy of God,” Tahir Wadood said.
Though, the traffic was allowed in the evening, no rush was observed. Sadness had descended everywhere. During the visit of old Mozzang Bazaar the shops were open but mostly the people who were sitting at different places were expressing their anger and despair.
“The terrorists have become so strong that they can hit anywhere, anytime,” said Shabbir Maanik who is owner of an eatery at Mozang Bazaar.
“We're insecure because the attack did not even spare senior police officials. Nothing is safe including schools, hospitals, buses and trains, because our rulers do nothing for the public rather than make hollow slogans. Why they are not ever attacked?” lamented Shabbir while dealing with a consumer who had come there to buy some ‘Naan Channay'.
“We lack the system and we don't want to improve it. So such incidents can't stop. The attackers belong to us; we brought them up and now we are reaping what we had sown. The sense of fear and killing will prevail unless serious radical steps are taken to combat this menace,” Zahid Azeem said. Zahid is a teacher who teaches at a private school on Empress Road and lives in Mozang area.

The push for tariffs began in April 2017, when Suniva Inc., a bankrupt Georgia-based panel maker filed a trade complaint arguing that it had been crippled by a flood of imports. Trump responded in January, imposing duties of as much as 30%, saying they were necessary to protect American manufacturers and create jobs.

BAHAWALNAGAR-Thousands of lady health workers laid a siege to the office of Bahawalnagar deputy commissioner (DC) as protest against registration of an FIR against 800 health workers and suspension of 14 of them including seven health supervisors on Wednesday.
The lady health workers from across Punjab reached Bahawalnagar to participate in the protest on the call of Health Workers Union (LWU) Punjab president Rukhsana Anwar. They have set up camps outside the DC office
On the occasion, LWU district president Afia Jabeen told the media that no work was done at the DC office without bribe. They alleged that the officials demanded money from them as bribe for release of their pending salaries.
They urged the administration to pay their pending salaries, cancel the FIR against health workers and restore the suspended ones as soon as possible. "Otherwise, the protest will continue to an indefinite period," they vowed.
On the other hand, the district administration has sealed the DC office. The road leading to the DC office has been blocked. A large contingent of police, commanded by DSP Saddr Circle, has been deployed outside the office.
Meanwhile, a man allegedly shot dead their aunt over a domestic issue in Kamalia Saddr police precincts here the other day.
According to police, suspect Haroon, resident of Inami Khoud, opened fire at their aunt Shabana Bibi over some domestic dispute. They died of their wounds before they could be taken to the hospital. The assailant managed to flee away. DSP Kamalia Aatif Meraaj reached the spot and held an enquiry into the incident. The police took the body of the deceased into custody and shifted it to Kamalia Tehsil Headquarters Hospital (THQ) for post-mortem. Further investigation was underway.
PROTEST IN TT SINGH: A group of villagers from Chak 679/20 GB, Pirmahal blocked traffic on Pirmahal-Rajana Road at Allah Hoo Chowk as protest and set tyres on fire against alleged Pirmahal police excess here the other day.
Their leader Iqbal told the reporters that two weeks back, men of their opponent group thrashed one of their fellows. They added that when they had submitted an application to Pirmahal police for registration of a case, they arrested a man of the complainant party instead of taking action against the accused party. They further alleged that a few days back, same men tortured another man of their group and fractured their arm but police were reluctant to register a case.
Police officials, on the other hand, claimed that during inquiry, the allegations levelled by the complainant party against their opponent party's head Faisal and others were found baseless. Later, the protesters dispersed as no official came to negotiate with them.

NEW YORK - Kim Jong-un's right-hand man was due in New York on Wednesday for talks with President Donald Trump's top diplomat as officials scramble to organize next month's historic nuclear summit between the North Korean and US leaders.
Kim Yong Chol, a veteran power player and a member of the young autocrat's inner circle, was due to arrive on an Air China flight from Beijing at 2:20 pm (1820 GMT), becoming the most senior North Korean official to visit the United States in 18 years.
They were due to meet US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was travelling up from Washington, for talks later Wednesday and on Thursday to finalize planning for a June 12 summit designed to end a nuclear stand-off that once threatened to plunge Korea back into war.
US and North Korean envoys have also been meeting in Panmunjong in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, and an American “pre-advance” team is in Singapore to make logistical arrangements for the rapidly planned meeting.
But with 13 days to go, the talks between General Kim and Pompeo, the former CIA chief who pioneered the latest round of face-to-face meetings, are the highest-level effort to stabilize the on-again, off-again process of getting two unpredictable leaders to the table.
“If it takes place on June 12th, we'll certainly be prepared. If it for some reason takes place at a later date, we'll be prepared for that as well,” White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders said Tuesday.
Earlier this month, Trump suddenly but only briefly announced an cancellation of the summit after a North Korea issued a sharp rebuke of what it saw as threatening language for the US side, and Sanders warned talks could be postponed if Kim is not serious about disarmament.
“Again, denuclearization has to be on the table and the focus of the meeting. And the president has to feel like we're making progress on that front. And the only one that will make that determination will be the president,” they said.
But the summit appears increasingly likely to go ahead, amid a flurry of international diplomatic activity.
Moscow said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would travel to North Korea on Thursday to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear program. Pompeo, meanwhile, called their South Korean and Singaporean counterparts over the weekend.
Japan is also keenly watching summit preparations. Trump will meet its Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Washington on June 7.
On Sunday US negotiators, headed by Washington's ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim, began meeting North Korean counterparts in the truce village of Panmunjom that divides the two Koreas.
“They plan to have additional meetings this week,” Sanders said.
Kim Yong Chol will be the most senior North Korean on US soil since Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok met then-president Bill Clinton in 2000.
The general has played a front-seat role during recent rounds of diplomacy aimed at ending the nuclear stalemate on the Korean peninsula.
They sat next to Trump's daughter Ivanka, who is also a White House aide, during February's closing ceremony for the Winter Olympics in South Korea, an event that was seen as a turning point in the nuclear crisis.
They also accompanied Kim Jong-un on both of their recent trips to China to meet President Xi Jinping, and held talks with Pompeo when they travelled to Pyongyang.
General Kim's journey to the US caps a frenetic few days of meetings between North Korean and American officials.
An AFP photographer saw Kim Chang Son, Kim Jong-un's de facto chief of staff, in Singapore Tuesday for preparatory discussions there.
The key task is to settle the agenda. The main stumbling block is likely to be the concept of “denuclearization” - both sides say they want it, but there is a yawning gap between their definitions.
Washington wants North Korea to quickly give up all its nuclear weapons in a verifiable way in return for sanctions and economic relief.
But analysts say North Korea will be unwilling to cede its nuclear deterrent unless it is given security guarantees that the US will not try to topple the regime.

LAHORE - July is going to be a very important month both for the political future of the family of Mian Nawaz Sharif and the PML-N.
On July 6, an accountability court will deliver its verdict in the Avenfield case which, if it goes against Maryam, will mean the ouster of the Nawaz Sharif's family from politics. And this will lead to the transfer of the “cane of authority” to the family of Mian Shehbaz Sharif, although the former prime minister will remain the party Quaid.
The July 25 general election will decide the fate of the PML-N. In case the party got a good public response i.e. a good number of seats in the assemblies, the party will go on. Otherwise, the possibility of its disintegration cannot be ruled out, especially so because a number of forces want to do this at any cost.
As of now, Nawaz Sharif stands disqualified from politics for good. (Another verdict against them on July 6 will bring no change in the situation). Wife Kalsoom Nawaz is fighting cancer and won't be able to take part in politics for the rest of their life. Them mere survival will be a miracle. Both sons of the three-time former prime minister – Hussain and Hasan – have no role in Pakistan's politics as they are foreign nationals. In case they are brought to Pakistan through Interpol, for which the procedure has already been started, they may have to face a trial on serious charges against them.
This means the political role of what is called Nawaz Sharif's family hinges on Maryam alone, who will be able to do anything in the future only if they get a positive verdict first from the accountability court and then people's court on July 25. They have changed their constituency many a time because they cannot afford electoral defeat.
An adverse court verdict will seal their political fate unless there's another verdict to overturn it. And a favourable court verdict but a negative outcome of the general election will also mean the end of the Nawaz Sharif family's role.
This will be the first election of Maryam, and the Sharifs will have to do anything to save their political future.
Otherwise, the transfer of political role to the Shehbaz Sharif family will mark a new phase in the politics of the PML-N, which is already passing through a difficult phase.
So far, public support of the PML-N is there only because of Nawaz Sharif. Shehbaz Sharif or other leaders are only the beneficiaries.
Once the effective control of the party goes to Shehbaz Sharif, the situation will witness a remarkable change.
Many people close to MNS don't feel comfortable with Shehbaz, and vice versa. The supporters of MNS may have to look for other options in the changed situation.
July 6, the day on which the accountability court will give its judgment, will become important for the PML-N, no matter what the verdict.
The day is followed by July 5, when ZAB's government was overthrown in 1977. It is observed as a black day by the PPP. (This day is like October 12, 1999 for the PML-N).
Collingwood's leadership group might politely remind Daniel Wells to keep fit this off-season. (AAP)
Collingwood's leadership group is expected to chat to veteran Daniel Wells about their off-season fitness goals after they arrived at the club out of shape.
Before they head off on holidays, Daniel Wells can expect a gentle reminder from Collingwood's leadership group to deliver themselves to pre-season training in good shape.
The 32-year-old's first campaign with Collingwood after their high-profile switch from North Melbourne has been hampered by calf and thigh injuries that have restricted them to 10 games.
By their own admission, Wells did not arrive for their first pre-season with the Pies in ideal condition.
In February, coach Nathan Buckley conceded Wells had not presented themselves in match condition, but defended the decision to hand the talented but injury-prone onballer a three-year deal.
In the games they have played, the silky-skilled midfielder has made a big difference, the Pies losing just two of those matches and drawing another.
"I think there'll be a discussion at some point," teammate Jeremy Howe said on Fox Footy's On The Couch when asked if the Pies' onfield leaders would speak to Wells about their off-season conditioning.
"Clearly, we know how much of an impact they have when he's fit and firing.
"We're definitely a better side when they play, so a lot of it comes back to Wellsy and their decisions in the off-season.
"But when they play he's a super contributor."
Howe joined skipper Scott Pendlebury and vice-captains Taylor Adams and Steele Sidebottom in the club's leadership group in July.
Wells picked up a thigh injury in their first game against their old side in round 20 and it is unclear if they will return to the field this year.
With two rounds left in the home-and-away season, Collingwood is out of finals contention in 13th with eight wins and a draw.
Buckley's future at the club has been the subject of speculation throughout their side's rollercoaster season, with a soon-to-be-completed internal review to determine their fate.
Thailand is considering turning the cave where a teenage football team has been trapped for a week-and-a-half into a tourist attraction, officials said yesterday.
"Now that the kids have been found, we can relax a little, and we can consider other plans," Narongsak Osotthanakorn, commander of the search and rescue mission and governor of Chiang Rai province where the cave is located, told a press briefing, dpa reported. Narongsak's remark followed a local news report citing a tourism official about the plan.
"After the rescue team found the 12 football players and their coach on Monday night, the cave has become of interest for both local and foreign travelers," Karuna Dechatiwong, tourism governor for Chiang Rai province, told the Bangkok Post. The local tourism office will work with the private sector to work out the exploration route and promote the site once the rescue mission is over, they added.
Tham Luang-Khun Nam Nang Non Cave is Thailand's fourth longest cave, stretching for 10 kilometers and located some 1,000 kilometers north of Bangkok near the border with Myanmar. It is a little known and barely-explored site due to its difficult terrain.
It remains unclear when the group will be brought out of the cave after they were discovered by British divers late Monday. Rescue teams were giving crash courses in swimming and diving as part of complex preparations to extract a young soccer squad trapped in a cave and hoping for a swift end to their harrowing 11-day ordeal.
Divers, medics, counselors and Thai navy SEALS were with the 12 schoolboys and their 25-year-old coach, providing medicines and food, while experts assessed conditions for getting them out safely, a task the government said would not be easy."
"The water is very strong and space is narrow. Extracting the children takes a lot of people," Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters, according to Reuters. "Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive," they said, adding that if water levels fell and the flow weakened, they would be taken out quickly.
By late Tuesday, about 120 million liters of water had been pumped out, or about 1.6 million every hour.
Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn on Wednesday cautioned against any negligence in investing for the future, underscoring the need for South Korea to capitalize on its technological edge to nurture new growth engines.
During a joint session held by the Presidential Advisory Council on Science and Technology, and the state science and technology strategy panel, Hwang also reiterated that the government has to further strengthen support for startups through a policy initiative that covers all stages of their growth, including research and development.

"Since the (2008) global financial crisis, the world economy has entered the 'new normal' era of low growth, and our economy has also been suffering a lot due to the difficulties facing our mainstay industries and the emergence of trade protectionism,"Hwang said."But as there is a saying, 'crisis is an opportunity,' we should not be negligent of investing for the future, particularly at this juncture," they added.Hwang cited science and technology as the centerpiece of the country's efforts to overcome economic challenges and create future growth dynamos, calling on industries to pursue the convergence of cutting-edge technologies to sharpen their global competitiveness.The acting president, in addition, called for "boldly" improving regulations related to the use of the big data, noting the need for local firms to harness the increasingly crucial technology to brighten their business prospects."The importance of the big data has been increasing day by day in intelligence and information-based societies," Hwang said. "It is anticipated that the success of companies or a country will hinge on the ability to use big data." (Yonhap)
The City of Regina is urging residents to take proactive measures against an infestation of cankerworms.
Forestry, Pest Control and Horticulture Manager Russell Eirich said residents should be concerned as they are expecting the cankerworm population to rise this year.
Cankerworms are defoliating insects that can harm leaves and cause premature deaths in trees.
“All of a sudden, one day you'll notice your tree has leaves, and the next couple of days there are no leaves,” Eirich said.
“It's actually cyclical in nature. Every seven or 10 years, we'll see extreme peaks or extreme lows… we're now on that upward swing again.”
Last year, the city sprayed approximately 2,000 trees for cankerworms.
This year, they're expecting to treat around 10,000 trees.

Residents are being asked to wrap their elm, Manitoba maple or fruit trees in advance of the upcoming influx of the worms.
The bands can help prevent cankerworms from laying their eggs in the trees.
“We're asking people right now to band their trees because by doing that, we're going to be interfering with their productive cycles and hopefully control them that way,” Eirich said.
Eirich said it's an inexpensive but effective way to control the worm population in the city. The problem is at its worse between mid-May and June.
A step-by-step guide on how to band your trees is posted on the City of Regina website.
Paris: German second seed Alexander Zverev came back from two sets to one down to reach the French Open third round on Wednesday — only to be defeated by a broad Yorkshire accent.
Zverev beat Dusan Lajovic of Serbia 2-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 to continue their bid to become the first German man to take the title in Paris since 1937.
But the 21-year-old, who also speaks fluent English and Russian, was mystified when a reporter from the northern English county of Yorkshire wanted to know what it would take for them to finally win a Grand Slam.
"Where you from buddy?," asked Zverev to the stunned journalist.
"Yorkshire," replied their inquisitor.
"Nice. If they ever make a tournament there, I'm coming just because of that accent.
"Love it. I didn't understand a word you're saying."
The exchange lightened the mood for Zverev who is becoming increasingly impatient of being asked when they will make a breakthrough at the majors to match their impressive efforts on the ATP Tour.
They have a year-leading 32 wins and arrived in Paris with clay-court titles in Munich and Madrid and a runners-up finish to Rafael Nadal in Rome.
But the Slams is a different story.
Their best is a run to the last 16 at Wimbledon in 2017, just a few weeks after they were dumped out of Roland Garros in the first round.
They were defeated in the third round at the Australian Open in January by South Korea's Hyeon Chung.
"Everybody tries to make a bigger story out of it than it is," said Zverev who has now equalled their best run in Paris by making the third round.
"I have had great success on the ATP Tour, won three Masters, made two other finals this year. I'm not worried. I know if I'm doing the right things and if I do the right work I'll win those long matches, and the success will come itself."
They also recalled a morale-boosting conversation with Roger Federer at the Australian Open after they lost to Chung.
Federer, the record 20-time major winner, reminded them that it took them until they were into their 20s to get past the quarter-finals of a Slam.
Up to that point, an under-achieving Federer faced the same barrage of questions that Zverev is batting back now.
"Hearing that from the greatest player of all time is, you know, comforting, because you always think, Oh, if I'm not going to win this one, I'm never going to win one. And he's the greatest player of all time," they said.
Next up for the tall German in Paris is a third-round clash against Bosnia's Damir Dzumhur, the 26th seed, for a place in the last 16.
Kansas big man Udoka Azubuike will withdraw from the NBA draft and return for their junior season with the Jayhawks, the school announced Wednesday.
The 7-foot center, who averaged 13.0 points and 7.0 rebounds last season, was considered a likely second-round pick by most NBA executives.
"I received good feedback from many sources around the NBA over the last month but in the end, after discussing with my family and coaches, we decided it would be in my best interest to return to Kansas for my junior year," Azubuike said.
Azubuike started 34 games last season, and they set a Big 12 record while shooting 77 percent from the field -- the best mark in the nation.
Their return helps bolster a Jayhawks team that should enter next season as a Final Four contender despite losing its top three scorers -- Devonte Graham, Svi Mykhailiuk and Malik Newman -- and four of its top five players.
Kansas adds transfers Dedric Lawson and K.J. Lawson, as well as a stellar first-year student class led by McDonald's All American guards Devon Dotson and Quentin Grimes.
"We're all very excited about Udoka making the decision to return for their junior year," Kansas coach Bill Self said. "We supported them declaring and investigating, which I think was a smart move. It was certainly a move that was handled exactly as the rule was intended.
"He wanted to find out more information on what the NBA franchises thought of him, and they were able to accomplish that in many ways. The feedback that they got and that we received was that he's definitely improved, and NBA personnel think very favorably of him."
The Jayhawks also bring back Marcus Garrett, Silvio De Sousa and Mitch Lightfoot from last year's team.

Per a new public poll issued by the Angus Reid Institute, Canadians are split right down the middle when it comes to the federal government's decision to purchase the proposed TransMountain pipeline project. (Black Press files)
Twinning the B.C. section of the Trans Mountain pipeline will begin in the North Thompson by this fall, the company says in its latest six-month work schedule filed to the National Energy Board.
Work is underway along the entire line from Edmonton to Burnaby to set up temporary construction yards and camps with worker accommodation and construction offices, as well as pipe stockpile sites in Valemount, Blue River, Clearwater, Merritt and Hope.
Work is scheduled to begin in September to clear and survey a 120 km section of pipeline route between Mt. Robson Provincial Park and Blue River, connecting to a longer section between Edmonton and Jasper National Park in Alberta.
Work includes wildlife surveys, weed control and relocation of rare plants to comply with the 157 conditions required by the NEB and a further 37 conditions in the B.C. government's environmental certificate. Despite federal and provincial approvals and what the company calls “unprecedented scrutiny,” the project continues to be dogged by orchestrated protests.

Spending on the project has resumed after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in May the federal government is buying the project assets for $4.5 billion, to ensure the twinning of the 65-year-old pipeline that delivers synthetic heavy crude and refined fuels from the Alberta oil sands to B.C. and Washington state refineries.
Kinder Morgan Canada negotiated the sale after setting a deadline of late May to have assurances that the project would proceed without interference from the B.C. government.
Work continues this summer on expansion of the Sumas terminal at Abbotsford, Burnaby terminal and Westridge marine terminal, which includes a tunnel through a portion of Burnaby Mountain.

COLUMBUS – Seventy-five Ohio fire departments will share $745,000 in grants from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) under a program to protect firefighters from carcinogens and other harmful elements encountered during a fire fight. Among those departments receiving the grants was the City of Eaton Fire & EMS Division.
Eaton Fire & EMS was awarded $10,904.16 to purchase one extractor/washer and 40 barrier washable hoods, according to the BWC.
The fire departments are receiving the funding under BWC's Firefighter Exposure to Environmental Elements Grant Program, which helps departments purchase safety gear, exhaust systems and specialized washing machines. Because residue collected on firefighters' gear during a blaze can cause respiratory disease, cancer and other ailments, it is important not only to wear appropriate protective gear, but also to ensure it's cleaned properly.
“Ohio's firefighting community is confronting the Cancer threat head-on by equipping their stations and officers with tools that can protect their health now and into the future,” said Abe Al-Tarawneh, superintendent of BWC's division of safety and hygiene. “I'm pleased BWC was able to identify and meet this need for hundreds of fire departments across the state.”
Originally funded at $2 million a year, BWC increased funding for the program due to heavy demand and has now awarded more than $3.3 million to 324 fire departments statewide. Yesterday, BWC announced the creation of similar grant programs targeted to police and school safety.
The grant program, announced as a component of BWC's 2017 rebate, provides a 5-to-1 match up to $15,000 for public and private employers with annual payroll of at least $500,000. No match is required for employers with less than $500,000 in payroll. More about the program is available at bwc.ohio.gov.
Madrid: Cristiano Ronaldo insisted on Wednesday they had a "clear conscience" after Spanish prosecutors accused Real Madrid's star forward of evading 14.7 million euros in tax through offshore companies.
"Conscience clear, always," Ronaldo told reporters at Lisbon airport as they and their Portuguese teammates prepared to fly out to the Confederations Cup in Russia.
Real Madrid earlier gave their backing to Ronaldo, releasing a statement saying the club had "full confidence in our player Cristiano Ronaldo, who we understand has acted in accordance with the legality regarding the fulfilment of their fiscal obligations".
"Since their arrival at Real Madrid C.F. in July 2009, Cristiano Ronaldo has always shown a clear will to fulfil all their tax obligations."
"Real Madrid C.F. are absolutely convinced that our player, Cristiano Ronaldo, will prove their total innocence in this process. Real Madrid C.F. hope that justice is done as quickly as possible so that their innocence can be proven as soon as possible."
The 32-year-old Ronaldo — the world's highest paid athlete according to Forbes magazine — follows in the footsteps of Barcelona forward and Argentina star Lionel Messi, who was found guilty of the same offence last year, although the sums involved were allegedly smaller.
If they too are put on trial and found guilty, they risk "a fine of at least 28 million" euros ($31.3 million) and could potentially be jailed for three-and-a-half years, according to the Gestha union of experts at Spain's Inland Revenue.
Ronaldo is accused of "four crimes against the public treasury between 2011-14... which involves tax fraud of 14,768,897 euros", Madrid's public prosecutor's office said on Tuesday.
"The accused took advantage of a company structure created in 2010 to hide income generated in Spain from their image rights from tax authorities, which is a 'voluntary' and 'conscious' breach of their fiscal obligations in Spain," it said.
Prosecutors accuse the Portugal international of evading tax via a shell company based in the British Virgin Islands and another in Ireland, known for its low corporate tax rate.
In addition, they say they only declared 11.5 million euros of Spanish-related income from 2011 to 2014, while what they really earned during that time was close to 43 million euros.
And finally, they accuse them of "voluntarily" refusing to include 28.4 million euros in income linked to the sale of their image rights for the 2015 to 2020 period to a Spanish company.
Roseanne Barr has slammed their co-stars for "throwing" their "under the bus" amid the cancellation of their sitcom.
The 65-year-old TV star had their eponymously titled sitcom 'Roseanne' cancelled this week after they took to Twitter to make racist comments toward former White House aide Valarie Jarret, whom they likened to an ape and accused them of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood political party.
And after their co-stars also took to social media to hit out at the star for their behaviour after their show was cancelled, they have now fired back with comments of them own.
In response to Sara Gilbert's tweet - in which they labelled Roseanne's comments as "abhorrent" - they simply wrote: "Wow! Unreal."
Roseanne also took aim at Michael Fishman after they posted a lengthy statement to Twitter explaining how "intolerable" Roseanne's comments were.
Part of their statement read: "I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue. While I am going to miss being part of the ABC family, I believe that to sit back, or remain silent in an attempt to distance myself from the actions/statements of others would unintentionally endorse or placate those statements which I find truly offensive. My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent portions of society often marginalized. In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against; bias, hatred, bigotry and ignorance to make society a better place for all. (sic)"
And Roseanne replied: "i created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it.ME. You throw me under the bus. nice! (sic)"
Michael then responded to Roseanne agreeing that they had tried to be inclusive on their show, but noting that it made their comments "so out of character" and shocking.
They tweeted: "You fought, built, and designed 'Roseanne' for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that."
The star has since deleted the tweet in question and posted an apology in which they defended their comments as "a bad joke".
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish police plan to launch a criminal investigation into options trading at Nokian Tyres stemming from manipulated product tests, darkening the mood after the company reported rising quarterly profit on Friday.
The police action follows lengthy investigations by the country's financial watchdog after Nokian said in 2016 that it had supplied special high-quality tires for tests by motoring journalists, leading to stronger test scores that helped garner good publicity.
The watchdog had asked the police to investigate whether Nokian misused insider information or breached disclosure laws.
In 2016, shares in the company fell after it admitted the use of high quality tires in tests. Daily Helsingin Sanomat later reported that some members of the company's management team had sold options before it went public about the issue.
“The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has opened a criminal investigation into suspected securities market offences related to tyres manufactured by Nokian Tyres plc and the tyre test results in different magazines,” the police said in a statement on Friday.
The company's view is that no crime had occurred, a spokesperson told Reuters.
“It is good that the matter will be resolved,” they said.
Nokian shares fell 6.8 percent in early trade on Friday.
Nokian Tyres has said the use of special tyres happened in the past but they have discontinued the practice and that their tests in its main markets have been reliable for years.
It had launched an internal investigation into the matter in October 2015, and the reported option trades took place in October and November 2015, before the company went public with the past practices.
Nokian earlier on Friday said its fourth-quarter operating profit rose 13 percent from a year earlier and that it expected growing sales and profits for this year.
Tom Brady hopes the offense is able to score more, but points to a strong team effort in the Patriots' ability to grind out a win. (0:29)
TAMPA, Fla. -- There were a couple of hold-your-breath moments early in the New England Patriots' 19-14 victory Thursday over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, when quarterback Tom Brady absorbed a hit and seemed to be a bit slower than the norm getting to their feet.
What happened?
“Just football,” they said with a smile. “I'll be there next Sunday.”
Few doubts that, of course, but if Brady is to be there every Sunday, limiting how many hits he's taking would be a good start. The Buccaneers hit the 40-year-old six times Thursday night, which included three sacks.
Through five games, Brady has now taken 32 hits and been sacked 16 times.

The sack total surpasses last season's, when they were brought down 15 times in 12 regular-season games.
Why such a noticeable spike?
Here are a few of the reasons:
Adjusting without Julian Edelman. Losing their go-to receiver to a torn right ACL on Aug. 25 took away a player Brady often looks to when pressure closes in. Not having that security blanket has been a factor in opposing rushers getting to Brady before they can get rid of the ball, as the Patriots have had to adjust their attack. Specific to Thursday night's game in Tampa, one could say the same thing about playing without tight end Rob Gronkowski (thigh injury). Likewise in Week 2 with Danny Amendola, who missed that game against the Saints with a concussion.
More of a vertical offense. Acquiring a speedy wide receiver in Brandin Cooks has opened up more options in the vertical passing game this season. Because of that, Brady has held on to the ball longer at times to allow those routes to develop, which can also allow pressure to get home. Also, the Patriots have faced some solid personnel, which deserves some credit, too.
Offensive-line breakdowns. The protection in front of Brady hasn't been as solid as it was for extended stretches in 2016. Left tackle Nate Solder had some early-season struggles, which were related to them not playing in the preseason as they worked themselves into regular-season form. Right tackle Marcus Cannon, who had arguably their best season in 2016, hasn't consistently matched that level in 2017 and missed a game with a concussion. But the hits on Brady don't always fall on the O-line; sometimes the receivers aren't getting open fast enough.
Short-yardage inconsistency. The running game hasn't been able to consistently gain traction in third-and-1 and fourth-and-1 situations, and in general, hasn't truly balanced out the offense. The Patriots have attempted 195 passes and have 128 rushing attempts. As more of a one-dimensional attack, it has allowed opponents to have a better read on when to dial up pressure.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman said that they are determined to rule the kingdom until they die in an interview as they open a marathon tour of the United States with a stop in Washington.
In an interview with US broadcaster CBS that aired Sunday, Salman said it is expected that they will be ruling the country in the next 50 years "if things go their normal ways."
When asked whether is there anything to stop him, the young prince said "only death."
As the leader of one of the major allies of the United States in the Middle East, Salman is expected to promote their ani-Iran agenda during their meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, who also views Iran as a threat to their country's security.
"Iran is playing a harmful role. The Iranian regime is based on pure ideology."
The 32-year-old prince once again compared the territorial ambitions of that country's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to those of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany.
Mohammed bin Salman also said their country is combatting corruption and working to mend "shortcomings" on human rights, adding that "Saudi standards are not the same as American standards" when it comes to human rights.
They defended last year's purge when more than 150 high-level princes, ministers, military officials and business people were abruptly rounded up and detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel.
"What we did in Saudi Arabia was extremely necessary. All actions taken were in accordance with existing and published laws."

Researchers at Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry at Western University have released new findings on two very timely topics.
The study, recently published by researchers, proved that recalling traumatic memories increased the rewarding effects of opioids, and the neurological link between post-traumatic stress-disorder (PTSD) and opioid addiction.
READ MORE: Death Dealing: Who uses opioids in London?
At the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry at Western University, associate professor Steven Laviolette, said the research was aimed at identifying mechanisms in the brain that might explain why when recalling a traumatic memory associated with PTSD might make someone more vulnerable to the addictive properties of opioid drugs.
Dr. Laviolette explained to 980 CFPL that opioid-class drugs have effects on users like reducing anxiety and have shown an ability to alleviate many negative emotional aspects of recalling traumatic memories associated with PTSD.
Dr. Laviolette said that it creates a “vicious circle.”
In a release by Western University, it says that more than 60 per cent of those who live with PTSD also struggle with addiction problems.
“You have this very dangerous combination of the dependence-producing effects of opioids,” Dr. Laviolette said. Recurrent, traumatic memories associated with PTSD can lead to a vicious cycle. The recall of traumatic memories causes PTSD patients to take more opioids, and taking more opioids exposes patients to the risk of addiction.
Linking preclinical models of both PTSD and addiction, researchers looked at receptor transmissions in the prefrontal cortex of the brain, specifically dopamine receptors.
READ MORE: Death Dealing: Opioids aren't the problem
“We were able to identify how transmission through these receptors not only regulate the recall of traumatic memories but how in turn that might be linked to sensitivity of the rewarding effects of opioid class drugs of abuse,” Dr. Laviolette said.
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps to control the brain's reward and pleasure centres.
Rodents were used in part of the research. Researchers found that when the D4 receptors in the rodents were blocked, it made memories that would be usually non-traumatic become traumatic, which led to an increased preference for morphine (an opioid class drug).
They also showed that blocking the D1 receptor led to blocking the traumatic memory recall, and diminished the euphoric feeling and rewarding effect from using morphine.
Dr. Laviolette says there are two important implications from the results.
READ MORE: Death Dealing: What London is doing about opioids
The first is that there are potential pharmacological advancements that could be developed to aid those with opioid addiction problems in addition to their PTSD.
The second is that the data, along with diagnostic screening and testing, will be key to a more accurate identification process for those living with PTSD, who may be at a greater risk to the addictive properties of opioid-class drugs.
BURLEIGH FALLS — Author Mary McGillis discussed their book titled Thank Our Lucky Stones at a book release for reviewers held at the home of Ronald and Lisa Schokking on Tuesday afternoon in Burleigh Falls.
McGillis will be launching their book at Happenstance Books and Yarns in Lakefield in May.
The book features early beliefs, wisdom, knowledge, customs and lore regarding stones prevalent among Celtic nations and others, with a new twist.
ISLAMABAD - Last year, Pakistan held informal talks with General Electric, Siemens and Switzerland's ABB to build the country's first high-voltage transmission line. Chinese power giant State Grid committed to building the $1.7 billion project in half the time of its European counterparts – and clinched the deal.
This is a familiar tale in Pakistan and many other countries. As China makes its "Belt and Road" initiative – a massive project to connect Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime routes – a policy priority for the next decade, Chinese companies are taking the lion's share of infrastructure projects across the region.
Just last year, Chinese firms won project contracts in Belt and Road countries worth $126 billion, state media reported.
In Pakistan, whose geographical position makes it central to Beijing's "Silk Road" plans, contracts have been awarded for projects worth more than $28 billion – all by Chinese companies working together with local firms. More than $20 billion in new investment is likely in the next few years, Pakistan's Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told Reuters this week.
Last month, Pakistan's government took out full-page newspaper advertisements on the first China-Pakistan project completed under the plan, a 1,300 mw coal plant that it said was constructed in 22 months, a record time for such a facility. The plant is owned by China's state-owned Huaneng Shandong and the Shandong Ruyi Science & Technology Group.
China Inc's main advantage, officials in both countries said, is the ability of Chinese banks – with the blessing of the government - to fast-track loans for projects related to the Silk Road. That makes a huge difference to projects like Pakistan's power transmission line, which aims to end regular energy cuts that leave the country's 190 million population without electricity for several hours every day.
"(Chinese companies have) that advantage because of the support of the Chinese government," said Mohammad Younus Dagha, a senior government official who was in charge at the Water and Power Ministry until earlier this year.
Dagha, who spoke to Reuters shortly before being transferred to the Commerce Ministry, said Beijing was fast-tracking loan approvals and pushing its banks and insurance firms to speed up due diligence work.
Chinese government officials declined comment on specific loan approvals.
But two officials at two Chinese state-owned banks that direct government funding, China Development Bank (CDB) and Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM), told Reuters that they have been instructed by the government to favour lending to Chinese firms for Silk Road projects.
The officials also said that the two banks prefer that companies working on infrastructure projects across the region import raw materials or purchase equipment from China.
There is some criticism in Pakistan that the awarding of the contracts to Chinese companies – while speeding up projects – is also costing the country more money.
In the transmission line project deal, for example, General Electric estimated it could make one key part of the line – the converter stations – for about 25 percent less than what State Grid was charging, according to a Pakistani government official and two power sources familiar with GE's projections. By awarding the contract to State Grid, Islamabad paid a higher price, they said.
An official at Nepra, Pakistan's independent energy regulator, said State Grid was also given a tax break not on offer to other investors.
Pakistani government officials declined to comment on tax issues regarding the deal.
China Electric Power Technologies Company Limited (CET), the State Grid subsidiary that will build the line, said the price it asked for was fair. "It's a very reasonable cost," said Fiaz Ahmad Chaudhry, managing director of Pakistan's National Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) referring to the overall State Grid contract. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the process for Belt and Road projects in Pakistan was "open and transparent" and would bolster bilateral relations and regional prosperity.
The edge of Chinese companies in Pakistan is likely to continue. Under the Silk Road plan, China and Pakistan are planning to build $57 billion worth of power plants, port facilities, railway lines and roads in Pakistan.
During a meeting in Bejing last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that the plan would be accelerated. The transmission line project was conceived as a government-to-government contract to build an 878-km connection between soon-to-built power plants near the coastal town of Matiari and Pakistan's industrial heartland by Lahore.
According to Pakistani officials, no formal competitive bidding was sought for the project, which was finally awarded in December last year.
But the officials said GE, Siemens and ABB were contacted when initial talks with State Grid stalled around mid-2016 over costs.
Dagha told Reuters they briefly met officials from the three companies on the sidelines of a Paris power conference in August and informally talked about the transmission line contract with them.
GE made an initial cost estimate of $800 million for the converter stations, against State Grid's initial bid of $1.26 billion, according to documents from Nepra and sources familiar with GE's cost estimate.
Despite the lower cost, the problem for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government was speed. Sharif has staked their political credibility on ending Pakistan's frequent power blackouts before the next general elections are held by August 2018.
So, Dagha said they asked the Western companies to also match State Grid's ambitious timeline and wrap up work in 27 months.
"They said 'you must be joking...it's impossible'," Dagha recalled. Dagha said Western executives predicted it would take at least 48 months to build the line.
"They said just to prepare the proposal...and for the banks to agree to that would require at least 8-9 months at the fastest pace."
One Western energy company executive in Europe confirmed the meeting took place. Another executive in Europe who is familiar with the matter said "international companies did not have the opportunity to make a bid for the project". Both sources declined to be named. General Electric, Siemens and ABB declined to comment.
There was domestic pressure in Pakistan to speed up the deal, several government and regulatory officials said. An official at Nepra, which had to sign off on the contract, said the government put pressure on the regulator to accept State Grid's price demands, warning the deal could come apart as the Chinese were prepared to walk away.
Pakistan's government did not respond to claim Nepra was put under pressure, although government officials have in the past voiced frustrations that the regulatory agency was slowing down projects.
The Nepra official also said the Pakistani government had sweetened the deal for State Grid by removing a 7.5 percent withholding tax on tariffs the Chinese company would charge consumers the next 25 years. The tax break, the Nepra official said, was not on offer for other companies. Federal government officials and the NTDC did not respond to requests for comment on the removal of the withholding tax.
State Grid was awarded the contract in December last year. It charged $1.7 billion, including a trimmed $1 billion for the converter stations, according to public documents seen by Reuters.
Khawaja Asif, Pakistan's energy minister, defended charges that Pakistan was favouring the Chinese or overpaying for power infrastructure. "That conclusion is a bit misplaced, or exaggerated," said Asif.
Ashfaq Mahmood, a former top bureaucrat in Pakistan's Water and Power Ministry, said the reality of Pakistan's need to improve its infrastructure made a certain reliance on its bigger neighbour inevitable. "This is an opportunity on which the Chinese have capitalised and we cannot blame them."

NAIROBI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A Kenyan lawyer present at the symbolic “swearing in” of opposition leader Raila Odinga was arrested on Friday, local media reported.
Miguna Miguna was taken from their Nairobi home before dawn to a police station, Citizen TV and NTV reported on their Twitter feeds.
An Odinga ally, Miguna has declared themselves a leader of the opposition's National Resistance Movement, which the government this week declared a criminal group.
They had stood beside Odinga on Tuesday at the symbolic presidential inauguration, which the government has called an “illegal act” that put the lives of thousands of Kenyans at risk .
Police spokesperson Charles Owino did not answer their phone when called for comment on the arrest.
It follows the arrest on Wednesday of an opposition lawmaker who administered Odinga's “oath”. They were freed on bond on Thursday.
The government took three private television channels off the air on Tuesday as they began to cover of the opposition ceremony. They remained off the air on Friday despite a court order on Thursday that overturned the government-ordered shutdown.
The government was not served with the court order on Thursday afternoon because of a delay at the court registrar's office, Okiya Omtatah, an activist who filed the High Court case and won the lifting of the suspension, told Reuters.
“As soon as we serve the order this morning I expect the stations to be back on,” they said. “If not they'll (the government) be in contempt of court.”

A jury has ruled in favor of Taylor Swift in a case involving a Denver radio DJ accused of groping the pop singer.
Swift had accused Mueller of grabbing their butt during a photo-op in 2013. Mueller was tossed by security after being confronted by the singer's bodyguard, which led to their firing from a Denver country music station.
Mueller claimed innocence and then sued the singer, seeking $3 million in damages. Swift subsequently filed a countersuit to “serve as an example to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts.” They sought a symbolic $1 in damages, which Mueller will now be required to pay.
On Friday, a judge dismissed Swift as a defendant in Mueller's suit concluding that Mueller had failed to prove the singer personally set out to get them fired. In the verdict issued Monday, a jury concluded Swift's mother, Andrea, and radio promotions director, Frank Bell, were also not liable for tortious interference.
New Delhi: Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), the RSS' Muslim wing, organised an Iftar party in Ayodhya, where Muslims broke their fast with cow milk.
"Muslims took a pledge at the Iftar that they will not eat beef as it causes disease. They also agreed that cow milk is good for health and has medicinal values," MRM patron Indresh Kumar told PTI.
Kumar was the chief guest at the Iftar party organised on Wednesday evening.
The MRM had invited prominent Muslim residents of the town, for the Iftar, the first meal after the day's fasting.
Kumar said that the gathering also acknowledged the benefits of keeping cows.
They also claimed that cow slaughter is not permissible in any religion, including Islam.
The MRM was set up in 2002 by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) at the initiative of its then chief KS Sudarshan to allow the sangh parivar to reach out to the Muslim community on various issues including the vexed Ayodhya Ram Temple dispute.
Vasyl Lomachenko has proven themselves willing to engage in any fight offered him, except the the one that'll be decided outside the ring.
Minutes after overwhelming fellow two-time Olympic gold medalist Guillermo Rigondeaux, who quit on their stool after the sixth round Saturday night at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, Lomachenko declined to campaign for the fighter-of-the-year award that 2014 winner Terence Crawford is aggressively seeking.
“It's already won. I won it already. Why wouldn't I have?” Crawford asked two members of the Boxing Writers Assn. of America who'll decide the award.
The case for the unbeaten Crawford is hooked to their August knockout of Julius Indongo to win the fourth major belt for the 140-pound junior-welterweight division. Before that, Crawford stopped Felix Diaz after 10 rounds.
Yet Lomachenko's impressive Saturday victory was their third triumph of the year; Crawford fought twice. Crawford doesn't see that as a problem after going 3-0 in 2016 and finishing behind Northern Ireland's Carl Frampton, who fought twice.
“I won the [fourth] belt, [so] it shouldn't even be up for debate,” Crawford (32-0, 23 knockouts) said. “You tell me right now why I shouldn't [win]? Three fights [for Lomachenko], but who did they fight that amounts to … ?”
Lomachenko previously stopped former featherweight title challenger Miguel Marriaga and Jason Sosa, who also failed to answer a bell.
When Crawford was told they have a “good chance” to win, they replied, “It's not a good chance. I feel like I've won it.”
He's not getting any resistance from Lomachenko, who maintained what they said even before fighting Rigondeaux, who lost for the first time since 2003.
“He's not in my weight class. He's not in my weight category. I like to fight guys my size,” Lomachenko said, pointing to unbeaten lightweight champion Mikey Garcia as their ideal next foe, although their promoter is expected to first seek fellow super-featherweight champion Miguel Berchelt for a possible March date. “I want big, big fights.”
Asked if dominating Rigondeaux, who never landed more than three punches in a round, boosts their fighter-of-the-year case, Lomachenko flatly said no.
Three wins, they were reminded.
“So what? Not three big wins. It's not my weight, not my size,” Lomachenko repeated. “It's not big for me. Maybe it's big for people who love boxing, but not for me.”
That doesn't eliminate them from the running. The fact that Lomachenko doesn't want to boast could charm voters, who are well aware that by retiring Rigondeaux on the stool, Lomachenko now has a four-fight streak of doing so.
Bob Arum, the veteran promoter who handles both Crawford and Lomachenko, said they see a difference in the Ukrainian's favor.
“Crawford could've competed with a Sugar Ray Leonard, guys like that. Crawford belonged with the really great fighters, and is a sensational fighter,” Arum said. Lomachenko “is super-human. When have you ever seen anything like this? Rigondeaux couldn't hit them with anything. Something really, really spectacular.
“This guy is super special. He'll make a joke out of [World Boxing Assn. lightweight champion Jorge] Linares. He'll make a joke of Garcia.”
Arum predicted those fights can happen thanks to their company's network deal with ESPN.
“They'll all come. With ESPN behind this, we have plenty of money to offer these fighters, and ESPN wants the best,” Arum said.

Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Gerard Baker.

A newsroom unsettled by layoffs and buyouts of 200 colleagues. A senior editor decamping for the competition. And above all a lingering question from many reporters: did The Wall Street Journal pull its punches in scrutinizing the man who is now president?
The paper's top editor, Gerard Baker, held a meeting with their staff Monday to give a muscular defense of the paper's coverage of Donald Trump and, by extension, their own leadership.
Despite Trump's casting of the press as a foe, Baker said, the Journal had proved unbiased, yet not adversarial. They read off headlines from a variety of stories that they said demonstrated the paper's tough scrutiny, according to two participants in the meeting.
Other news organizations had embraced a more adversarial posture in response to Trump, Baker said, in remarks that some of the paper's journalists took to be a reference to The New York Times and The Washington Post.
Baker said those staffers who admired that adversarial approach should go join one of those other outlets.
No one, they said, could accuse the Journal of being soft on Trump.
Some reporters and editors at the storied paper tell NPR they believe the Journal had been just that, particularly during the campaign, to please the conservative views held by Baker and the paper's controlling owner, News Corp executive chairperson Rupert Murdoch.
Murdoch's Ties to Trump
Baker was elevated by Murdoch to be editor-in-chief in late 2012 and before that was the paper's number-two editor; previously they had been a conservative columnist for Murdoch's Times of London who had championed such political figures as former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.
Murdoch has ties to Donald Trump and their relatives and grew increasingly bullish on them as the election neared and as Trump took office. That's perhaps best reflected in the morning and prime-time programs of the Fox News Channel, which Murdoch now personally oversees at 21st Century Fox.
Murdoch, who likes to have close ties to presidents and prime ministers in their native Australia, the U.K. and the U.S., is said to speak to Trump weekly; Trump's daughter Ivanka until recently served as a trustee to the fortunes of their young daughters with their ex-wife Wendi Deng.
This story is based on interviews with six veteran journalists at The Wall Street Journal, as well as two dozen interviews conducted with Journal staffers before and after Baker's promotion in 2012. Baker did not reply to a request for comment for this article about the meeting and the newsroom's concerns.
A Conservative Editor-in-Chief
Baker is not shy about their belief, shared with Murdoch, that the rest of the big legacy news outlets betray a liberal bias daily. That leads to Baker's reflexive distrust of the news judgment that yields the front page of The New York Times each morning.
And it shows.
Flaps that led the nightly news, such as the emergence of a 2005 tape on which Trump boasted that they had grabbed a woman's genitals without their consent, received less attention in the Journal than they did elsewhere. The Washington Post broke the story, which dominated headlines elsewhere for days.
During the campaign, these journalists at the Journal told NPR, the paper did not initially take Trump altogether seriously. Even when their candidacy developed real strength, coverage in the Journal, with some notable exceptions, was not aimed at holding the political neophyte accountable for their actions and policies.
Several reporters and editors said stories that proved unflattering to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, their foundation and labor union allies, shot to the front page. Analogous stories involving Republicans, Trump or acts by corporate players were slower to post and print.
Several reporters said the Journal was more rigorous after Election Day, during the transition and since Trump took office.
But Baker's emailed admonition to editors to avoid referring to “seven majority-Muslim countries” as the focus of a new restrictive Trump immigration order rubbed many staffers wrong.
Reporters saw that as parroting the administration's position that travelers from those nations represented a security threat to the United States, while failing to note that no one from those countries had committed an act of terror in the U.S. proper.
At an event earlier this month at Harvard University, Baker noted that the policy affected only seven among dozens of Muslim-majority countries in the world.
“We must absolutely use the words majority-Muslim countries, but we must also explain, we must use other words, including that they had been previously identified by the previous administration as — I think the phrase was — countries of concern,” Baker said on Feb. 1 at the Nieman Foundation.
“This is very emotive. I understand why people use it. It was initially obviously a phrase that Donald Trump themselves used, but they subsequently retreated from that. We do need to be very careful about that language, and we do need to be very precise.”
Baker's Vision for the Journal
Baker told reporters Monday there was no good reason to be antagonistic to the Trump administration for the sake of it, or to declare war. Instead, they argued for the marshalling of facts and context. The Journal would alienate its subscribers were its forcefulness to be mistaken for bias, they said.
Baker spoke of the importance of focusing the paper more on business coverage – its original mandate. Murdoch and their top lieutenants had expanded the paper with the intent of making it a general news rival to The New York Times. The recent layoffs and buyouts, Baker said, were part of an effort to strip the paper back down to its roots.
Baker also acknowledged the disappointment that one of their top deputies, Rebecca Blumenstein, was leaving the paper for the Times to take a similar job. They had pre-dated the acquisition of the Journal by News Corp and was seen as a bridge between the paper's owners and the values of the newsroom.
Several Journal reporters and editors say they admire the principles Baker articulated. But they expressed dismay that the Journal, with all its expertise in chronicling and investigating the worlds of business and finance, did not own the story of the first entrepreneur and rookie politician elected president of the United States.
And these journalists questioned whether Baker could be trusted to make the decisions necessary to ensure unbiased coverage.
After Trump's victory, Baker wrote a column for the conservative British Spectator magazine mocking the rest of the U.S. press.
“The shock of Trump's victory was greeted the next morning with a keening that was taken up like the call of the muezzin from the minarets of traditional and social media,” they wrote.
(Baker also detoured to call New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman “the blowhard, self-anointed intellectual voice of proper thinking elites.”)
Such a column might be more expected from a newspaper editor in the U.K., where a journalist's political beliefs are typically more openly expressed.
Baker was having none of it. The idea that the Journal, or its leadership, had favored Trump, was “fake news,” they declared.

Chic's Nile Rodgers missed the first show of their career on Sunday (Aug. 13) when an illness forced them to seek treatment at a Toronto hospital.
Related: Chic and Earth, Wind & Fire Team for Summer Tour
The band was scheduled to play the Air Canada Centre with Earth, Wind and Fire for 2054: The Tour when Rodgers became sick. The news surfaced sound engineer John Ryan tweeted, “Nile Rodgers is in hospital tonight. Lights are out for him.”
The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer responded, “Thanks Johnny. I've never missed one gig in my life… well, its been that way till now. The Dr. caught me trying to sneak out. #LOVE,” and added that doctors are “taking great care” of him.
Rodgers was diagnosed with prostate cancer six years ago and wrote about their struggle on their blog (via Billboard). After undergoing extensive treatment, they were cured in 2014. They discussed their struggle at the Glastonbury Festival in June.
“My doctors told me I was suffering from extremely aggressive cancer and that I needed to go home and get my affairs in order,” they said during the show. “Well, I happened to get a phone call from two French guys called Daft Punk and a gentleman named Pharrell Williams and we got together and wrote this song called ‘Get Lucky.' And I feel like the luckiest man in the world tonight because six years after that doctor told me to go home and get my affairs in order, today, six years later, I am cancer-free!”
It is still unknown what caused Rodgers to miss Sunday's show and whether or not they will be healthy enough to perform tomorrow night (Aug. 15) in Indianapolis, Indiana.

MIRPUR (AJK)-Amidst full-throat Pakistan-Zinda'abad slogans, a magnificent ceremony was held at the City Campus of Mirpur University of Science & Technology (MUST).
MUST Vice Chancellor Dr Habibur Rehman was the chief guest who hoisted the flags of Pakistan and AJK, followed by the National Anthem and the salute by a full-uniformed contingent of the soldiers.
The ceremony was largely attended by all ranks of the MUST and the SCO including the faculty members, city elite, parents and students, senior journalists and officials of the civil administration.
The grand mega jam-packed ceremony was echoed with full throat Zindabad slogans for Pakistan, Pak Army, SCO and the MUST Varsity and ‘Kashmir Baney Ga Pakistan' by the jubilant participants including students, teachers, parents and officials.
The students enthralled the spectators with their speeches highlighting the importance of freedom and responsibilities to safeguarding it.
Students of various faculties of sciences and engineering presented a tableau depicting the significance of the historic events of pre- and post-Pakistan movement and the emergence of the separate homeland of the Muslims of the Subcontinent under the dynamic leadership of father of the nation - Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
The performance of the varsity students on the tunes of the famous Milli Naghmas were the hallmark of the grand event.
Speakers highlighted the significance of Independence Day of Pakistan and the national responsibilities to safeguard the ideological and geographical frontiers of the country.
The MUST VC said that the auspicious day of August 14, 1947 has the greatest significance in the history of the South Asia when Muslims of the Subcontinent succeeded in achieving their separate homeland - Pakistan under the dynamic leadership of Quaid-i-Azam through materialising the dream of great poet philosopher Allama Iqbal.
They said that it is the day of renewal of the pledge by the entire nation including the young generation to perform their individual and collective role for the more speedy progress and prosperity of the country besides to make it an invincible fort of Islam in letter and spirit since it came into existence in the name of Islam and under the spirit of the Two-Nation Theory.
Pakistan, the vice chancellor said, is incomplete without its jugular vein. They said that Kashmiris struggle for freedom is in fact the struggle for the completion of Pakistan - since Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of the partition plan.
“Kashmiris have linked their destiny with Pakistan by adopting the historic resolution before the creation of Pakistan,” Dr. Rehman said.
The people of Jammu & Kashmir are rendering unprecedented sacrifices for last 70 years to achieve the goal of freedom, they said. They added that a stable and prosperous Pakistan is the guarantee to the success of Kashmir liberation struggle.
SCO Commanding Officer Syed Ayad Hussain felicitated the entire nation on the day. They said that the independence day of Pakistan has the exceptional national importance in the history of South East Asia.
Prof Waris Jiraal said that Kashmiris indigenous struggle for freedom was in fact the struggle for completion of Pakistan. They vowed the Jammu and Kashmir peoples resolve to lend all of their energies to bring the Kashmir freedom movement to its logical end.
Expressing full solidarity with the freedom loving population of occupied Jammu & Kashmir on the Independence day of Pakistan, speakers underlined that hearts of the people of Azad Jammu & Kashmir, occupied Jammu & Kashmir and Pakistan beat in unison. They said that India could not win hearts of the people of Jammu & Kashmir - nor could do so in the future.
Similarly, in Mirpur major National flag hoisting state-ceremony in AJK was held at the lawn of Mirpur Municipal Corporation where AJK Minister M Saeed and Commissioner Mirpur division Zaffar Mahmud, unfurled the national flags of Pakistan and AJK.

Ranchi: Elaborate security arrangements have been made for Thursday's 'Jharkhand bandh' called by the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and other Opposition parties to protest against amendments in the Land Acquisition Act, 2013, by the Raghubar Das government.
The state-wide bandh is supported by Congress, RJD and JVM (Prajatantrik) of former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi among others.
Joining of all Opposition parties in the bandh could be seen as the unity among the non-BJP parties in view of the upcoming general elections next year. The bandh has been called against amendments in the Land Acquisition Act, through a bill passed in the Jharkhand Assembly in August 2017. The bill had done away with the impact assessment clause to allow government sponsored developmental projects. The bill has been sent to the President for their consent.
As many as 5,000 police officers and magistrates would be deployed all over the state in view of the bandh, said Home Secretary SKG Rahate along with Director General of Police (DGP) DK Pandey at a joint press conference in Ranchi on Wednesday. A total of 3,000 home guards, tear gas unit, riot control unit and 300 highway patrolling vans would also be deployed, Rahate added. CCTVs have been installed and close monitoring would be done to ward off any untoward incident, they said.
As per the Jharkhand High Court's earlier directive, forceful imposition of bandh is unconstitutional, the Secretary said, adding that action would be taken against those damaging public or private properties. The damages would be realised from those indulging in such acts, they said. Rahate also referred to the Supreme Court ruling that mob violence is a crime and it is the responsibility of the state government and administration to control such incidents.
Appealing to the people to maintain peace, the DGP said that the government's aim is 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Surakshya and Saabka Vikas' (together with all, safety and development for all). "All should join in maintaining peace," the DGP said and warned of action against those obstructing peace. They said the police would provide security on national highways, railway tracks, government offices, hospitals and to school children.
Drones will also be used during the day, the DGP said. The Home Secretary said that incidents of violence would amount to contempt of court.
FILE PHOTO: A protester wearing a Europen Union flag themed beret takes part in an anti-Brexit demonstration after Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the process by which the United Kingdom will leave the Euopean Union, in Birmingham, Britain March 29, 2017.
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Sunday that it wants talks with the EU to move on to the next phase, as it set out details of the future relationship it wants with the bloc and senior ministers presented a united approach to negotiations.
Britain is keen to start talking about its post-Brexit relationship with Europe, wary of the need to reassure anxious businesses, citizens and investors. But Brussels has insisted that progress must be made on divorce arrangements first.
"We need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and EU," Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement.
Britain's call to move forward with Brexit talks came as finance minister Philip Hammond and trade minister Liam Fox presented a united front that there should be a time-limited transition period - signalling a truce between rival factions in Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet.
Davis's Brexit department said it was preparing to publish several papers, including plans for a new customs arrangement and a proposal on how to resolve the difficulties of a non-physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
"We've been crystal clear that issues around our withdrawal and our future partnership are inextricably linked," a source in Britain's Brexit department said.
"These papers show we are ready to broaden out the negotiations."
Talks so far have focused on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU, what rights British and EU citizens will have, and how to manage a land border to the bloc in Ireland. The two sides will be looking for a solution to those issues at the next round of talks due at the end of this month.
The decision to announce the publication of papers on its plans indicates Britain's desire to counter criticism from Brussels about its approach to the talks.
In July, EU officials said progress was difficult not because Britain had unacceptable demands, but because it had no position at all on many issues. EU negotiators have warned that an already-tight timetable could be delayed ahead of a scheduled March 2019 exit.
IRISH SCHENGEN AREA?
A British paper focused on "issues unique to Northern Ireland and Ireland" is expected ahead of the talks, but no further details of the proposal were provided on Sunday.
The Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain was seeking a "Schengen area" between Britain and Ireland, which would allow free movement of people and a "light-touch customs regime" across the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Brexit department declined to comment on the story.
The report, which cited an unnamed source in the Brexit department, said that Irish citizens would be able to work freely in the UK, and British citizens would work freely in Ireland. Citizens of other EU countries could access the UK over the Irish border but would not be able to work in Britain without a work permit.
Separate papers would also address "Continuity in the availability of goods for the EU and the UK" and "Confidentiality and access to official documents", the Brexit department said.
Eager to push talks past the opening divorce issues and on to the future trading and legal ties to the bloc, Britain also promised a series of "Future Partnership" papers in the run-up to October's European Council. The first will be a proposal for new customs arrangements.
The push to move forward with Brexit comes as Prime Minister May's top ministers moved to strike a more united tone on leaving the European Union, after in-fighting in the wake of an electoral failure in June in which May's Conservative party lost its majority in parliament.
Some still dispute their approach, with former foreign minister for the now-opposition Labour party David Miliband and pro-EU Conservative MP Anna Soubry warning in Sunday newspapers of the economic "self-harm" of leaving the single market.
However, pro-European finance minister Hammond and ardent Brexiteer trade minister Fox set out a joint position in the Sunday Telegraph that a transition period was needed when Britain leaves the EU, but single market membership would still end and the interim period would not be used to stop Brexit.
Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet that the article was the "right way forward" and would "create certainty and a great new European relationship".
In 2013, Liberal newcomer Mike Morris easily won the election, taking more than 55 per cent of the vote.
In 2009, Liberal cabinet minister Pat Bell defeated NDP candidate Tobias Lawrence by nearly 3,500 votes (56 to 37 per cent).

A Hartlepool comedian has gone down a storm with their latest impression of American President Donald Trump.
Funnyman Danny Posthill, who shot to fame two years ago on hit ITV show Britain's Got Talent, was asked to surprise politicians Alex Salmond and David Davis with their take on President Trump.
Comedian Dany Potshill as Donald Trump with polticians Alex Salmond and David Davis.
Complete with suit and wig, Danny travelled up to Scotland where they met the pair outside the Assembly Rooms at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival on Sunday.
They were contacted by campaign group Scotland in Union to surprise the politicians and it has since proved popular online, with the video being shared thousands of times on Facebook.
Danny, who grew up in the Rift House and Fens areas of Hartlepool, said: “I get booked to do certain events as Donald Trump as they are so popular and controversial.
“I know that Alex Salmond and Trump were good friends but fell out, so I was asked by Scotland in Union - a social media political group - to turn up as Trump to meet them after their show in Edinburgh.
Danny Posthill.
“I just said to them ‘Alex you're fired' and they asked me what was happening in North Korea, so I said ‘it's going to bomb like your show'.
“It was quite nerve-wracking as I was up against two really educated people, so it was hard to try and out-wit someone of that calibre.
“But it was good fun.”
Danny said they were initially concerned about doing political impersonations over fears that it would split an audience depending on their political views.
But the video taken from the moment has so far attracted 50,547 views on the Scotland in Union Facebook page - something Danny is delighted about.
They added: “Alex Salmond didn't expect me to be there. “It was a surprise and that is what made it funnier.
“I was nervous about it as I didn't know what I was going to say, but I did a bit of research on them and it ended up being about Trump wanting to make friends with Salmond.
“He took it very well.”
Ahead of the American Election last year, Danny even appeared on Sky News as Donald Trump.
Among their other highlights recently have included an appearance on the celebrity edition of TV show Pointless and working with their comedy hero Bobby Davro.
Danny can next be seen playing the Dame in pantomime Snow White at the Tyne Theatre in Newcastle.

AFTER three decades in the business, The Commercial Real Estate Agency's Steve Little says he'd never seen a more popular property than the newly opened Jetty4Shores beachside kiosk.
The lease of the property attracted scores of inquiries from prospective tenants, both locally and from Sydney.
Salute Espresso, which already operates a successful cafe in Park Avenue Lane, is the new operator for the kiosk, which opened at the weekend to a roaring trade.
Mr Little, who offered the lease on behalf of the Coffs Harbour City Council as corporate manager of the Coffs Coast State Park Trust, said the response to the property was incredible.
"I received in excess of 60 inquiries on the property, resulting in more than 30 inspections and 12 lease applications,” they said.
"That is one of the highest responses I've ever had on any property in 30 years; I couldn't believe it.”
Mr Little said most of the applicants were existing businesses in town. Each had to produce a business plan, proposed menu and opening hours.
Charlotte was born May 2, 2015, at 8:34 a.m. local time, less than three hours after their mother checked into the hospital. The baby weighed 8 pounds, 3 ounces, slightly less than their new little brother. Less than 10 hours later, the Cambridges left with the new princess to return to Kensington Palace.
So how do they do it? Here are some factors that could play a role:
Good manners
The royal couple are well aware of the disruption their presence causes at the Lindo Wing, a busy maternity-care facility with scores of women arriving to give birth themselves.
Babies wait for no one, not even a crowd of well-wishers and a massive media mob gathered in the narrow street outside the door, with their whirring cameras and clanking stepladders and shouting and cheering and applauding.
Short hospital stays are the norm in Britain
According to The Guardian, research shows British mums are sent home from the hospital after childbirth more quickly than in any other developed country. They spend an average of just a day and a half in maternity units after having their babies — the shortest stay for any high-income country assessed, according to the data published in PLOS Medicine.
The other side of acute morning sickness?
Kate suffered from the rare syndrome "hyperemesis gravidarum" in the early weeks of their pregnancies. Each time, this common malady of pregnancy was so debilitating they had to stay in bed and forgo official engagements.
"Morning sickness is common — about 80% of women have it — but it tends to go away with no weight loss or other symptoms. But only 2% (of pregnant women) have the acute kind and they can lose up to 10% of their body weight," says Ross.
For this baby, morning sickness forced the palace to announce the pregnancy ahead of the usual 12-week date; their illness forced Kate to cancel an engagement, which would lead to inevitable speculation anyway.
Them battle with excessive vomiting even forced them to stay home in September for Prince George's first day at their new school in London; Prince William had to do the drop-off honours alone.
The cause of acute morning sickness remains largely unknown, Ross says, with hormonal changes, blood sugar levels and some psychological factors in the possible mix. There does not appear to be a genetic connection, Ross says.
"But some women are just more prone to it," Ross says. "If it occurs once, there's a higher risk for it reoccurring so we have to be very proactive with those who have had it once, put them on a strict diet friendly to the stomach. Weight loss is a big concern, for both mother and baby, and it can lead to a higher risk of miscarriage."
Short labour
Ross says the average amount of time for labour is 16 hours; the second average is about eight hours, and the third average is four to eight hours. Kate seems to fall in the latter category.
Ross says the first birth is usually the hardest on the body and after that the body has "good recall" to adjust and stretch to new pregnancies and deliveries. If they received an epidural, that also could minimize the trauma to the body, Ross says.
General good health
Kate did not gain excessive weight during their pregnancies, seemingly below the recommended average of 25-30 pounds, Ross says.
"It's the combination of someone who is in good health, who took great care of herself, got adequate sleep and took their vitamins and for the entire nine months," Ross says. "She was the epitome of the perfect pregnant woman as far as taking care of herself, and that's a huge factor."
Kate's helpful staff
Few women go to the hospital to give birth accompanied by a personal assistant, stylist and hairdresser, ready with the right clothes, brushes and makeup to render them camera-ready.
Natasha Archer, Kate's stylist, was spotted by the media mob outside the hospital just before Kate came out.
And Amanda Cook Tucker, their personal hairdresser, was seen leaving the hospital, having been on hand to blow out their lustrous locks. They were there for Charlotte's birth as well.
Kate's outfit — crimson dress, knee-length with a lacy Peter Pan collar, plus beige suede high heels — seemed carefully chosen: The blogs who follow their fashion immediately pointed to Will's late mother, Princess Diana, and their outfit when they emerged from the hospital with baby Prince Harry in 1984.
German technology company Bragi has launched a set of wireless earphones called the Dash Pro and The Headphone, for the Indian market. The Dash Pro is priced at Rs 27,999 and The Headphone is priced at Rs 12,999 and both of them will be sold via Amazon India, Flipkart and Headphone Zone.
The Dash Pro is a premium set of wireless earphones which the company claims has the advanced audio codec with reduced white noise and louder bass thanks to the foam tip. For ease of accessibility, the earphones feature a one-touch access to Google Assistant, Apple's Siri or Windows Cortana.
Another feature present in this earphone is the Knowles balanced armature drivers which claim to provide premium sound in an ultra-small package. The earphones also have 4 GB of onboard storage and can play back music for up to 5 hours on a single charge.
A case comes along the Dash Pro which can be used for charging the earphones. The Versant technology from Knowles filters out noisy environments which enable you to hear your voice clearly while on a call. The Dash Pro can also translate more than 40 languages in real time.
The earphones have automatic activity tracking powered by Bragi AI which can track your steps and also give feedback about your exercise performance. The earphones are also IPX7 rated, so they are water resistant and can be used while swimming and measuring laps. The custom Bragi OS allows the user to interact with the headphones using body movements such as a tap on the cheek or a nod of the head. The Bragi OS also allows for the device to become smarter and learn new skills. All of the features present in the Bragi Dash Pro can be accessed by the Bragi App on Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
The Headphone by Bragi features a similar design as that of the Dash Pro but with a much more affordable price tag. The earphones also feature the Knowles balanced armature drivers and Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity as seen on the Dash Pro. However, The Headphone has volume controls present on the earbuds and an audio transparency feature which allows the user to hear ambient sounds without taking out the earphones. The Headphone does not come with the motion tracking, Bragi AI or OS and water resistance that is present in the Dash Pro. Also, there is no onboard storage. The Headphone can, however, provide up to 6 hrs of music playback and can be charged in the same case as provided with the Dash Pro.
It took them long enough — in fact, too long. Two days after a protest in Charlottesville, Va., dissolved into violence, President Trump — who initially seemed to see no difference between the racists and Nazis who had called the march and the counterdemonstrators opposing them — finally denounced the hard-right for what it is.
Unfortunately, the time for that statement was Saturday afternoon when the rest of the civilized world spoke up. Instead, on that day, Trump delivered a tepid, mealy mouthed response so inadequate that it set off an uproar around the nation. White House officials and Atty. Gen Jeff Sessions and even Vice President Mike Pence tried to cover for him, but the tsunami of public opinion was already underway.
The fact is that Trump's shocking reluctance to speak out against racism is part of a pattern. During the campaign, Trump initially refused to repudiate the political support they had received from former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, and lied when they said they “didn't know anything about” Duke, an infamous espouser of white supremacist beliefs (who was also in Charlottesville on Saturday). Trump is quick to condemn acts of terrorism committed by Islamic extremists, but failed to note the bombing of a Minnesota mosque a week ago as worshippers were arriving. A Trump statement in January on International Holocaust Remembrance Day failed to mention the racism that made Jews overwhelmingly Hitler's victims.
Trump's reluctance to acknowledge the dark stain of racism among some of their supporters is compounded by their inability ever to acknowledge that they are wrong. Even their more forceful statement Monday, in which they finally said the obvious — that racism is “evil” and that the Klan, white supremacists and other hate groups are criminals and thugs — was prefaced by so much throat-clearing and self-congratulations that they seemed more concerned about appearing to admit failure to lead than to actually lead.
The nation has faced right-wing radicalism before, from the Silver Shirts and domestic Nazis of the 1930s to the third rise of the Klan in the 1960s to the emerging hate and militia movements of the 1980s and 1990s. But in those moments of internal crisis, the nation had reliable leaders in Washington capable of recognizing the evil and standing up to it. Trump, by their laggard actions and disinterest, doesn't seem to know the cancer is there, or even that it is an illness.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A tax overhaul bill passed by the U.S. Senate Finance Committee would lift economic growth enough to generate an additional $1.8 trillion in revenue over 10 years, more than enough to offset revenue lost from a cut in taxes, the Treasury Department estimated on Monday. United States money printing plates are seen at the Museum of American Finance in New York October 15, 2010. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo In a summary analysis of a white paper, the Treasury Department said it based its estimate on a presumed 0.7 percentage point increase to the U.S. economy's annual growth rate. The Treasury Department's estimate compares to an analysis from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation that suggested quicker growth spurred by the tax-cut plan would yield an additional $408 billion in revenue.

Motorola had one shot at the high-end market in 2017. By all accounts, Motorola hasn't exactly taken the high-end smartphone market by storm with its new Moto Z2 Force. Its lukewarm response is partly due to the fact that the competition is so good this year, but primarily due to Motorola's handful of odd decisions that dull the experience of what is mostly a great phone. I've been using the Moto Z2 Force as my only phone since it was announced on July 25. Here's my take on what Motorola has done right, and missed the mark on, after a couple weeks with its latest flagship. See at Motorola
Moto Z2 Force Hardware If you've used any previous Moto Z, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect in the Moto Z2 Force. But unlike Daniel Bader, who has been using Moto Z series phones regularly over the last year, I haven't laid hands on one since the original Moto Z and Z Force were announced. Experiencing it as a one-off device, not jaded by the familiarity to previous Moto Zs, as most people will experience this phone, the Z2 Force isn't stale or basic as the narrative among tech pundits would lead you to believe. If you haven't used a Moto Z phone before, you'll be surprised by this hardware quality. In typical Motorola fashion the core metal frame of the Z2 Force is extremely strong, befitting of the "Force" name. The same characteristic can be found in the metal back, buttons and USB-C port — nary a flex, wiggle or fraction of a millimeter of intolerance can be found in the materials. It feels like a phone that can handle a drop (or seven) without being functionally damaged. When you pick it up, you understand you're holding a top-end phone.
Good aspects aside, the controversial (maybe that's a bit much?) hardware decisions step in. The first being amazing thinness of the phone; a choice that led to the smallest battery in a flagship phone from the past couple years, and removal of the headphone jack. Even though I completely understand the decision from a marketing perspective, I'm not a fan of it — particularly as it just about mandates that you have a Style Shell on it when not using a larger Moto Mod because it's so thin and slippery. Not having a headphone jack is almost as annoying, even as a vast majority of my listening has moved to Bluetooth. It achieved amazing thinness without compromising quality ... but there are considerable downsides nonetheless. The other big decision was to stick with this "ShatterShield" display technology that gives the Force its name. Oh we've come a long way from the original Moto X Force (aka Droid Turbo 2), but there are still major compromises here. The multi-layer screen covering takes up a considerable amount of room inside the already thin body, contributing to the previous compromises I mentioned, but beyond that the experience of interacting with the screen is also diminished. For as good as this top-layer hard plastic screen protector is, it's still plastic — it feels like plastic, looks like plastic and most importantly it scratches like plastic. After my first Moto Z2 Force evaluation unit was scratched to hell in a matter of hours I had it swapped out (thanks, Motorola!) for a new one that I've been much more careful with — and it's still picked up gouges and scratches. I thought the whole idea of the Moto Z2 Force was that it's strong? This screen covering makes you baby it.
Moto Z2 Force Software and performance This is where Motorola continues to shine. Again not having spent much time with Motorola devices in the last year, I had forgotten how great its software experience is. Admittedly coming from a standpoint of preferring a clean, stock-like experience, Motorola absolutely nails it all. From the lock screen to the launcher, notification shade and quick settings, everything is near-identical to using a Pixel XL today. Motorola hasn't messed with the icons, or folders, or rearranged a bunch of settings — it just lets Android be Android. Motorola's software continues to shine. Moto Display continues to be the absolute best "ambient" display solution because of its extra functionality that seamlessly transitions from just displaying information to letting you act on it. The Z2 Force's sensors seem a bit too sensitive and activate Moto Display a little too easily — with just a tiny bump of the table it's on — but that's barely a knock on what is a wonderful piece of software. Add in the other "Moto" functions that let you quickly silence the phone, launch the camera or turn on the flashlight, and you get a wonderful "Android with a little bit more" software suite.
That clean interface is paired up with exceptional performance, as you'd find in any modern phone with a Snapdragon 835 and 4GB of RAM. The Z2 Force clearly has no issue handling a QHD resolution display, whether you're toggling between a few different apps or playing a full-demand game. The sole shortcoming in performance, as I'll cover below, is in the camera. More: Complete Moto Z2 Force specs Battery life will be fine for average users on average days ... see the problem here? Now the big question everyone keeps asking: how's the battery life? With a 2730mAh cell inside you'd expect it to be horrendous. Well, it's actually not all that gloomy. Surprisingly, Motorola has managed to get some great efficiency out of the Z2 Force and it does make it through a typical ~16-hour day for me, using the phone just as I do any other. Now the real rub here is that it hits that full day of life with the last bit before I head to bed with Battery Saver (automatically switched on at 15%) enabled. Meaning heavier days when I used Android Auto for a long bout of navigation, or had a travel day, or knew I'd be out of the house late into the evening, I absolutely had to charge at some point in the middle of the day. The average person on an average day will have absolutely no issue getting through a full day with the Moto Z2 Force. But its lack of extra reserve for those heavier days, or people who just use their phones harder, is worrying. The $79 TurboPower Mod is wonderful and will get even the heaviest users through a complete day without a sweat ... but that shouldn't have given Motorola an excuse to put a subpar capacity in the phone itself. It's also a situation that people just don't have to face with any other top-end phone released in 2017.
Moto Z2 Force Cameras Moving to a dual camera setup in the Z2 Force was unexpected after Motorola had kept things relatively traditional in its last few phones — but then again, having two lenses is all the rage nowadays. As has been the case with many dual-camera experiences, there are compromises here — in the Z2 Force's case it's a lack of OIS and smaller pixels on both sensors. Those shortcomings aren't particularly problematic in daylight situations, where I actually really like the photos the Z2 Force can put out. They're colorful without being over-saturated, and have a pretty good amount of sharpness. Auto HDR mode does a good job of choosing the right times to activate, and capture speeds are good as well. Daylight and black-and-white shots are good ... but this just isn't a complete camera experience. It's in dark scenes where the Z2 Force just falls flat. Knowing that it doesn't have OIS to keep things bright, the phone obviously relies on higher ISOs and slower shutter speeds, leading to grain, blur and just general blotchiness throughout photos. In dark shots where there's some sort of solid light source photos are just average ... but in primarily dark scenes the photos are easily surpassed by flagships from 2015. It also often took multiple shots to get one that actually turned out well — I could rarely rely on the first shot, which kills any confidence I had in the camera. The black-and-white secondary camera is a true bright spot for this whole experience. The range of shades it recreates is fantastic and clearly several steps above any black-and-white software post-processing, and it produces amazingly sharp edges without any over-processed noise. I just wish the physical space this second sensor and lens took up didn't detract so much from the main camera.

Whether you're after embroidered bags, tapenade, scented candles or almond-based body care products, Good Morning South delivers Provence to your door. The French website was launched on June 5, 2017, and aims to introduce the American public to the Provence region and the expertise of its artisans. We met with Marseille-born Lucille Pinero, 31, who co-founded the website.
France-Amérique: How was this project born?
Lucille Pinero: My sister Elsa and I spent our childhood in our grandfather's store on the Rue du Petit Saint-Jean in Marseille, where they sold accessories, leather goods and decorative objects. The success of the family business — my mother, my uncle and my aunt also worked there — inspired our decision to found our own company. In January 2016, I had stopped feeling fulfilled in my career as a journalist, and Elsa's contract for a Parisian concept store had not been renewed. It was the moment to make a go of it.
Can you explain the Good Morning South concept in a few words?
Good Morning South is an online store showcasing designers from the south-east of France. Internet users can purchase products guaranteed “made in Provence,” including ready-to-wear accessories, household linens, decorative objects and food products. Our objective is to provide local artisans with visibility. We also have a “Designers” tab on our website, offering a description of each of our partners. The line of handbags from Folklo by Ka was the result of an encounter between two fashion-mad friends in Marseille. The soap brand La Corvette was founded in 1894, and continues to uphold the traditions of savon de Marseille. Graphic designer and illustrator Lolita Picco creates bags, mugs and fashion accessories inspired by their childhood in the town of Martigues in the Bouches-du-Rhône département.
How do you select your designers?
Word-of- mouth and the social networks have enabled us to promote local artisans, while trade fairs such as Vivre Côté Sud in Aix-en-Provence have led us to meet artisans and discover new products. We work with 16 creators established in the south-east of France, whose products are local and environmentally friendly. More than 200 products are currently available on our website.
What is your strategy for appealing to American customers with a penchant for all things French?
We transmit our gastronomic culture and the expertise of French artisnary. Americans associate Provence with paintings by Cézanne and Monet, the great outdoors and the fresh produce used in Mediterranean cuisine. They are also increasingly attracted to ethical, handmade products. We want to raise awareness about products made in France that combine ethics, integrity and a reconsideration of the role of people in the creative process. We also plan to offer an English version of our site by 2018, and to take part in a New York artisan trade fair.
What are your favorite products?
We are very fond of the story behind the Gang de Grands-Mères brand, whose bowties, ties and knit caps are handmade by Provençal grandmothers. A percentage of profits is donated to a charity that fights against isolation and loneliness among seniors. We also love the minimalist creations from Poulette Bijoux, and the delicious spreadables by Les Niçois such as tapenade, anchovy paste, basil pesto and eggplant caviar!

Snapchat is teaming up with The Pokémon Company to introduce a new Pikachu filter to the app. The official Pikachu filter applies the electric mouse's trademark rosy cheeks, pointy ears, black nose and big eyes to faces in the app, and when users open their mouth the iconic Pikachu cry rings out as an animated version of the characters leaps into frame.
The Pikachu filter is a pretty perfect tie-in for Snapchat, which aims at a demographic that is already pretty gaga for the most recognizable of Nintendo's pocket monsters. Plus, Snapchat could use some brand juice, and Pokémon and Pikachu have proven to offer that for a lot of other platforms, including any of Nintendo's hardware consoles and even AR via Pokémon Go.

Snapchat's Pikachu filter is a limited run option, so if you want to capture yourself looking like Ash's best pal you'd better get on it. The best strategy is probably to stockpile a wide range of selfies of yourself as Pika so you have one for every possible emotional response you can possibly make.
Will Snapchat Pika reach the lofty heights of Dancing Hot Dog? Only time will tell.

Ankara is "absolutely" against Russia's decision to limit the number of companies importing Turkish tomatoes, Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci has said. Russia in October signed a decree, lifting its restrictions on the import of tomatoes from Turkey beginning Nov. 1, 2017. However, Moscow implemented an import quota.
"Amendments to the list of agricultural produce, raw materials and food products originating from the Republic of Turkey, the import of which has been banned since Jan. 1, 2016, stipulate that the term ‘fresh or chilled tomatoes' be amended with a footnote saying that the produce imported within the import quota approved by the Agriculture Ministry shall be excluded from the ban," the Russian government said in a statement. They said Ankara now records all Turkey's imports from Russia. "There is only one reason for this [recording]. If needed, we will do the same. We can also select a company and import [from Russia]," Zeybekci said.
They also said that visa procedures for Turkish companies took time and Ankara is planning to take some steps that will ease the process. The ban on Turkish agricultural products was placed after Turkey shot down a Russian military jet over an airspace violation in November 2015. Moscow also took several other measures against Ankara, including the cancellation of visa-free travel for Turks.

An internationally known stem cell scientist and entrepreneur will join the ranks of candidates trying to unseat Republican incumbents in contested House races next year when they announce Thursday their challenge of 18-term Rep. Dana Rohrabacher.
Hans Keirstead, a 50-year-old Democrat from Laguna Beach, said Wednesday that they will run in the 48th Congressional District, one of more than half a dozen in California that have been targeted by Democrats seeking to harness sentiment against President Trump in their fight for a House majority.
Keirstead's candidacy has been sought by some national Democratic figures, who see their science and business background as a good fit for the district. It runs along the Orange County coastline from Laguna Beach to Seal Beach, and includes some nearby inland cities.
Republicans represent a plurality of the district with more than 40% of its registration, to about 30% for Democrats. A quarter of voters are registered as nonpartisan. The Huntington Beach-based Rohrabacher, who is 69, has served in the House since 1988.
Part of the reason for the Democratic drought in the 48th and other districts now seen as competitive has been the party's candidates; Rohrabacher last faced a serious challenge in 2008, when they won by 10 percentage points. In November, they won by more than 16 points. Hillary Clinton won the district by almost 2 points en route to becoming the first Democratic presidential nominee to win Orange County since 1936.
Several other candidates already have announced their intention to run against the veteran House member.

Nationally and in California, Democrats say they have been swamped by candidates interested in running for office to oppose Trump and Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Keirstead said that is one of their motivations.
“I've come to realize more acutely than ever before the deficits in Congress and how my profile can actually benefit Congress,” they said. “I'd like to do what I'm doing but on a larger stage — and I think Congress provides that, provides a forum for doing the greater good.”
Keirstead was a pioneer in stem cell research, first in their native Canada and, since 2000, in Southern California. They helped lead UC Irvine's stem cell research program and, in their only political endeavor, served as an advisor to a successful 2004 state measure, Proposition 71, that sought to steer $3 billion into medical research.
They also have started and sold several medical research companies that have invented therapies for ovarian, skin and brain cancer, as well as spinal cord injuries, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.
Keirstead has made millions of dollars off of their business endeavors but said they will not use their own money for their campaign.
Although their background gives them a network of allies to help raise money, Keirstead is likely to face criticism for leaping into politics mid-ladder, without the relationship-building that usually precedes a first run.
They became a citizen in 2008, they said. County voting records show they cast ballots in general elections that year and in 2010, 2012 and 2016. The records indicate that they did not cast any ballots in the 2014 midterm elections, and they have not voted in primary elections.
Asked about the missing votes, Keirstead said they had “other commitments and responsibilities” but stressed that the result of last fall's elections show “how important it is to participate in our democracy.”
Campaign finance records show they have not donated to federal or state candidates.
In an interview, Keirstead suggested they are still studying policy positions. They said that they would prefer to improve the Obamacare insurance program rather than adopt a universal healthcare plan favored by some liberal Democrats.
“I think Obamacare put in place a very large system that is fantastic in some measures and very flawed in others,” they said. “There's a lot we can do with the existing system rather than cripple it first as the Trump administration is doing in order to justify a replacement.”
On trade, another issue that has divided Democrats, they declined to take a position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump and some Democrats favor dumping. They also would not say whether they favored Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders last year.
“I just don't really like the labels,” they said. “I'm trying to run as authentic Hans.… I am personally tired of partisan politics where the labels are driving the decision making. I think we should be more results driven.”
But they were happy to criticize Rohrabacher for their advocacy of friendlier relations with Russia and for voting for the House Republican healthcare plan. And they also defended, with a laugh, their unorthodox path to politics.
“I can tell you without a doubt my cancer treatment, my spinal cord injury treatment, would never have been invented had I followed a step-by-step straight path in academia and business, for sure,” they said. “Doing things differently has been responsible for my success. And it's actually encouraged me to take on bigger initiatives like running for Congress.”

Saint Lucia: Afghanistan captain Asghar Stanikzai hopes their team will get more opportunities to face top-flight cricket nations after their one-day international series against the West Indies ended in a 1-1 draw on Wednesday.
Steady rain forced the abandonment of the third and final ODI with not a ball being bowled at St Lucia's Darren Sammy Stadium with the series balanced at one apiece.
But Stanikzai said they believe their team, who lost the T20 series 3-0, did enough to show they deserve more regular matches against full member nations of the International Cricket Council.
"We didn't play as well as we could have but I thought we did enough to show that we deserve to play the bigger teams more often," said Stanikzai. "This was a great experience for us and we can look forward now to what lies ahead with greater confidence."
West Indies captain Jason Holder accepted that their team faced a tough challenge.
"We were up against it after the first match but came back well in the second and we have shown in the previous series against Pakistan that we can compete with the best teams in the world also," they commented. "We just need to put the bits and pieces performances together on a more consistent basis for us to really move up the rankings in international cricket."
West Indies are currently ranked ninth in ODI's and should they fail to reach the top eight by the cut-off date of 30 September 2017, they will have to go through a qualifying tournament next year for the 2019 World Cup in England.
Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan, with combined figures of ten for 44 over the two ODIs that were played was named Man of the Series.
"This tour was a great experience for me coming out of the Indian Premier League and gives me great confidence moving forward with my career as part of the Afghanistan team," they stated. "Our next challenge is against the MCC at Lord's next month and I hope we can show the benefit of this experience at that match."
West Indies now turn their attention to hosting India for five ODIs and a lone T20 International, starting 23 June in Trinidad.
The settlement announced Friday by the federal government for '60s Scoop survivors is being seen as a positive step forward for some Albertans who were affected.

The agreement in principle sets aside $750 million in compensation for Indigenous kids who were taken from their families and placed in non-Indigenous homes.
Watch below: Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett said Friday that the $750-million payout to victims of the 60s Scoop represented an “important first step” in remedying the ongoing controversy.
President of the '60s Scoop Indigenous Society of Alberta and survivor himself, Adam North Peigan, told 630 CHED's Ryan Jespersen now that the compensation is being taken care of, everyone can start to move foward.
“An apology begins the reconciliation, and what needs to happen in reconciliation is we need the opportunity to bring our '60s Scoop survivors together in Alberta to create a safe environment for them to share their stories.”

Mary Jane had four kids taken from them in the 1970s and '80s. They say their family was torn apart and hasn't recovered.
“I've no more contact with them because they're still very angry. And I'm very angry because I went through my whole life [without them], even though I gave them birth.
“I don't celebrate Mother's Day because they're not there.”
I kids will qualify for the settlement, but that will do little to repair the damage that has been done.
“The social worker said that I was dead, so they believed it. To them, I'm still dead. So I guess that's the way it is.”
North Peigan said while you can't put a number on the suffering that they and other have gone through, it is good to see some acknowledgement that it was wrong.
“It's an acknowledgement and it's recognition for what we had to endure after the residential schools closed.”
He's been working with the Alberta government on an official apology that is expected to be issued in the spring session of the legislature in 2018.
Steven Cooper, a lawyer involved with the '60s Scoop Alberta class action lawsuit, called the settlement very reasonable.
“The federal government in this instance has agreed to be reasonable range of payments and did so in time sensitive and understanding fashion,” Cooper wrote in an email to Global News. “This settlement is in stark contrast to the last decade of litigation on Indigenous issues in that the government was willing to listen early on and negotiated in good faith throughout.”
Cooper suggested Canada “struck a good balance between the interest of the taxpayer and the interest of the victims.”
“What we know from previous settlements of this nature is that money changes nothing, but it is tangible acknowledgement that validates the experience of the victims.”
“The existence of the settlement is often more important to victims than its content.”

An Iowa District Court judge has placed Fairmount Cemetery under the control of the Iowa Insurance Division.
A spokesperson told TV-6 in July the cemetery had applied to the state to be put into a receivership due to a lack of money to operate.
The court order allows the Insurance Division to take over operation of the cemetery. The Division reached an agreement with the Pine Hill Cemetery Association to maintain and landscape the grounds and provide full management services to the cemetery.
The Insurance Division asks any consumer who owns burial or interment spaces, or who have purchased merchandise or services at the cemetery to send copies of any documents with updated contact information to the state.
Send any records to the Iowa Insurance Division, attention Connie Dykstra, at Two Ruan Center, 601 Locust St., 4th Floor, Des Moines, Iowa 50309-3738

In the few months since being installed at one of the most dramatic locations on the North York Moors, the near 10ft-high Seated Man bronze sculpture has split opinion, drawing praise, criticism and even waggish comparisons to it supposedly bearing a close resemblance to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
The work by artist Sean Henry can be found off Blakey Road, between Hutton-le-Hole and Castleton, on Castleton Rigg above Westerdale, and has been towering above the local landscape since being put in position in June.
The Seated Man sculpture is the first public sculpture to be placed within the North York Moors National Park and it is intended that it will stay on the hillside for five years.
The work was commissioned by the David Ross Foundation, a philanthropic organisation set up by and named after one of the Carphone Warehouse co-founders.
The work of Mr Ross's organisation includes promoting projects that work towards providing greater access to the arts.
While Henry's description of their sculpture work as exploring “the tension between the making and staging of figures that seem to belong to the real world, and the degree to which they echo our experiences and sympathies” may baffle some, there is no doubt that the Seated Man has a huge number of admirers who believe it to be a unique and positive addition to the landscape.
Indeed, one of the chief complaints since it was installed has related to the number of cars parking nearby as visitors arrive in their droves to take a closer look.
With the Seated Man, Henry chose the location themselves and designed the painted bronze work to complement the moorland location and the heather, blacks, greens and purples which surround it.
Those who make it up to the sculpture have a double reward; the chance to examine it more closely and take in the majestic scenery of the surrounding hills and dales that stretch for miles in different directions.

FEW words can do justice to the raging inferno in a London tower block that left the capital's clear skies scarred by billowing white smoke and the haunting testimony emerging from survivors and relatives of missing residents feared dead.
They ranged from an eye-witness who lost phone contact with a relative stranded on the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower, to residents desperately shining torches as they frantically sought the attention of rescuers, to extraordinary accounts of a mother banging their balcony for help as they prepared to throw their baby to safety.
In a tale of heroism and desperation which has come to personify this tragedy, a bystander managed to catch the unharmed child while others risked their lives to help strangers. Yet, amid the wreckage and confusion, the fate of the infant's mother was not clear. The thoughts of all are with this close-knit community where the survivors have been left with nothing other than the clothes they were standing in as they fled their homes. The speed with which the inferno took hold had echoes of the Bradford City stadium fire at Valley Parade in 1985, while the building's badly charred structure evoked painful memories of New York's catastrophic September day in 2001.
Now is not the time to apportion blame – the priority is supporting survivors, both practically and emotionally, while giving thanks to the courage of firefighters. However urgent questions will need to be asked about how the flames spread with such ferociousness in a 27-floor building which was a ‘death trap'; claims from residents that previous safety concerns had been ignored; misguided advice that residents were told to stay in their flats and multiple accounts of fire alarms not being activated. Put simply, this is a disaster more commonly associated with those countries which don't have building regulations to match Britain's robust health and safety laws. In the meantime, local authorities, housing providers and landlords must work with fire chiefs to check the safety and evacuation protocols at all comparable buildings, if only to reassure residents and tenants that all necessary precautions are in place. This is not a time for short cuts.
Listen and learn
HAROLD Wilson's timeless adage that ‘a week is a long time in politics' has never been more applicable as Britain's leaders come to terms with the outcome of last Thursday's election.
Seven days ago, Theresa May still hoped to secure a comfortable Commons majority after calling a snap election over Brexit. Now the Prime Minister is fi However it only became clear yesterday that Brigg and Goole MP Andrew Percy had stepped down as Northern Powerhouse Minister and was being replaced by the Lancashire MP Jake Berry. Six days after the election, it suggests the North is still an after-thought. And, though Mrs May says they have learned lessons, their reluctance to change course of Brexit – Mrs May still won't reappraise the merit of their pre-election decision to pull Britain out of the single market – will only unite their opponents on all sides of the political divide when the UK needs to be pulling together in the national interest. ghting for their political life.
Yet, despite telling Tory MPs “I'm the person who got us into this mess and I'm the one who will get us out of it”, Mrs May is not doing themselves any favours as they try to form a pact with Northern Ireland's hard-line Democratic Unionist Party.
With both the DUP, and the new bloc of 13 Conservative MPs from Scotland, now making the most of their new-found influence, the Tory leader could have redressed the balance by elevating the post of Northern Powerhouse Minister to the Cabinet.

A moral compass
GIVEN the Lib Dems pride themselves on being a broad church, it's ironic that Tim Farron felt they could not be leader while staying true to their personal beliefs as a strong Christian.
However their position effectively became untenable when former police chief Brian Paddick, the party's openly gay home affairs spokesperson, resigned citing “concerns about the leader's views on various issues”. It's another setback to a party already in danger of losing its moral compass; a handful of gains in last week's election could not mask a far wider loss of support.
Best feet forward
JUDGING by the extent to which older people are embracing social technology, they're intent on keeping their minds active during their retirement.
Yet, if 88-year-old retired Leeds GP Martin Berger is to be believed, regular exercise is the key to a stress-free life and, to prove their point, they continue to go to the gym three days a week and still goes running on a regular basis.
If 80 is the new 40, as appears to be the case thanks to all those retirees who have never been busier as they move with the times and live life to the full, there's hope for us all.

Modern kids stop believing in magic aged six – two years earlier than their parent's generation, according to research.
Researchers found youngsters start doubting the existence of magic and creatures like unicorns, fairies and elves at this age.
While mums and dads, who were eight years old when they felt the same way, think children are losing their sense of the fantastic too early nowadays.
Four in ten parents blame social media and technology for the decline and over a third think too much time at work has had a knock-on effect because they get less quality time together as a family.
The research of 1,000 parents with children aged two to ten was commissioned to mark the launch of Smurfs: The Lost Village which is available on Blu-ray and DVD from 14 August.
(Image: Getty)
Chantelle Hazelden, parenting expert and founder of Mama Mummy Mum, said: “Imagination is a powerful tool and it is something that is in use constantly, whether you are a child or an adult.
“To be imaginative is to be innovative - as parents we should encourage our children to use their imaginations at all times - as it has benefits for both parents and kids alike.”
A fifth of mums and dads said they believed in magic up to the age of ten – compared to just two per cent of kids today.
Amid this, one in ten think kids are losing their sense of the weird and wonderful earlier now because the world is ‘more depressing' than it was during their own childhoods.
And around two thirds fear children are growing up too early.
Thirty-four per cent of parents admits they are ‘very worried' about children losing their sense of magic and innocence.
But in comparison just a quarter are concerned about their children not making friends at school.

Four in ten mums and dads would like kids to keep their sense of magic for longer because they believe it helps maintain their innocence.
And seven per cent think families spend too much time indoors rather than playing ‘magical' games outdoors.
Perhaps as a result, over a third of time-pressed parents said they rely on technology to keep a sense magic alive in their little ones.
And almost a fifth said they don't know how to play ‘magical' games with their children.
The research also found one in six families play magic and fantasy games just once a month or less.
Seventy per cent of parents blames the lack of time spent playing with their children on after work commitments and household chores.
Despite this, half believe magical play helps them bond with their kids, 41 per cent think it helps children make friends with other kids and 31 per cent believe it encourages outdoor play.
And 66 per cent of parents thinks having a belief in the extraordinary helps children develop their ability to be creative.
Over a third said playing with their kids helps them shake off the stresses of being an adult and 40 per cent admit it helps restore a sense of magic which has faded as they've grown-up.
Chantelle Hazelden added: “This summer, I urge families to get outdoors and enjoy the Smurfs: The Lost Village augmented reality experience - the perfect opportunity to try something fun and keep magical, imaginative play alive.”
Smurfs: The Lost Village is available on Blu-ray and DVD from 14 August.
And The Smurfs: The Lost Village Official augmented reality channel, which helps children experience the magic of The Smurfs in their garden and in parks, is also available to download now on the Aurasma app.

When Super Bowl LII kicks off Sunday, football fans will be watching the field but thousands of police officers and other law enforcement will be watching everything else.
“We have collectively gathered a tremendous amount of resources to support the Minneapolis Police Department,” Alex Khu, the special agent in charge and Super Bowl LII federal coordinator, said in a video posted by the United States Customs and Border Protection.
In the week leading up to the Super Bowl at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, MN, the department is using social media to give people a glimpse at what goes on behind the scenes of one of the largest sporting events in the world.
Khu said more than 40 different U.S. federal agencies are involved, making it the largest team deployed in Super Bowl history.
The U.S Department of Homeland Security said this Super Bowl has a few unique challenges including a colder climate, smaller police force as well as several sidewalks and streets close to the stadium that make it harder to secure the area.
With 4 days to go, the race is on to get everything screened and into the stadium. Today's #CBPCountdowntoKickoff gives you a behind-the-scenes look at how #CBP officers scan everything from the bottles of soda to the Halftime Stage prior to entering @usbankstadium pic.twitter.com/omP3cYUPzf — CBP (@CustomsBorder) January 31, 2018
Before anything ends up inside Minneapolis' U.S. Bank Stadium, federal agents need to make sure it is safe. Equipment has been brought in to scan every truckload.
“The platforms, confetti, even the liquid celebration after the game,” Lee Takaki, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said in one of the videos.
“Everything going into the stadium, all the vehicles, containers, pretty much everything that is going to be used in the game.”
That is just what's happening on the ground. From high above, more than six aircraft do surveillance. Footage posted by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection show helicopters, including Black Hawks, circling the stadium. The aircraft will also be in the sky during the game on Sunday.

Officials said more than two years of planning went in to securing Super Bowl LII. The FBI has run through several security scenarios including a stage collapse, an active shooter situation and reuniting missing children.

A significant concern is how all the ticket holders will be searched prior to entering the stadium. The FBI has said the colder weather makes it difficult to have people line up outside. Instead, pre-screening for around 15,000 fans will take place at Mall of America, around 20 kilometres south of the stadium. They will then take trains to the stadium.
Super Bowl LII takes place Sunday between the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles.
SARGODHA-A three-year-old child fell down and died in an open manhole here in suburban village Kotla Sayedan on Tuesday.

Locals have expressed grave concern over the TMA negligence to cover the open manhole. They said that death of the minor has exposed inefficiency and apathy of the officials concerned, demanding stern action against them.
Origami's many marvels: Artist Himanshu Agarwal demonstrates the paper folding art
Have you ever made a paper boat, fan or plane? A tipi-tipi tap? Knowingly or unknowingly, we've all done origami sometime in our lives. Derived from the Japanese words, Oru and Kami, which literally mean paper folding, origami's premise is pretty simple: you start with a square or rectangular sheet of paper and transform it, through folding techniques, into a sculpture. It could be a swan, crane, violin, headphones, a fictional character… anything! It is, essentially, a craft that has been developed into an art, says Himanshu Agarwal, a Mumbai-based origami artist. The idea of origami is not restricted to a certain kind of paper, size or technique. Though the use of glue and cuts is often used to make larger and more intricate designs, it is discouraged in modern origami. Agarwal feels that it is more of a test than discouragement. They say, “It's like a challenge, can you make it (origami) from a single sheet of paper.”
A Medora girl driving an all-terrain vehicle was killed Friday afternoon when the ATV ran a stop sign and collided with a truck, police said.
According to an Illinois State Police District 18 press release, the victim and a girl passenger were driving a green ATV east on Challacombe Road approaching Illinois 267 at 3:54 p.m. when the driver ran a stop sign and collided with 2012 Freightliner truck tractor, hauling a 1978 Enderby-Ander trailer, driving south on Illinois 267. The ATV driver and passenger were ejected from the vehicle.
The Jersey County coroner pronounced the driver dead at the scene. Life Flight Medical Helicopter Service transported the passenger in critical condition to St. Louis Children's Hospital.
Both victims are from Medora; the news release does not list their ages.
Police shut down Illinois 267 for approximately six hours. The Illinois State Police Crash Reconstruction Unit is investigating the crash.
The truck driver, Donald Young, 59, of Brighton, was not hurt in the crash.

Indigenous People's Day at Tufts, a campus group formed to recognize the holiday, held the final two talks in its four-part Indigenous Speaker Series during the last week of this semester. With the tagline of “After Standing Rock,” the series featured indigenous activists to show continued support of indigenous issues and scholarship.
In one of those talks on Wednesday, Dec. 6, Tristan Ahtone, an award-winning journalist and member of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, spoke about their view of indigenous journalism and Native issues, especially in the wake of the Standing Rock protests.
Junior Parker Breza, who is a founding member of the Indigenous People's Day at Tufts movement, was involved in planning this speaker series.
Elaborating on the movement as a whole, Breza noted that a Facebook page was formed to coordinate the campaign for Tufts to recognize Indigenous People's Day on the official calendar. They added that the movement is not an official organization, but an informal group of students who are Native or are passionate about Native issues.
Breza noted that it was this campaign for Tufts to recognize Indigenous People's Day that sparked greater conversation and action on campus, including the annual celebration and the speaker series.
“It's become the central organizing space for lots of different initiatives, including the celebration of Indigenous People's Day every single year,” Breza said. “That's manifested in a couple of ways, including the political effort to change it to the cultural celebration of indigenous peoples. And now [there is a] push for Native studies and the Indigenous Speaker Series.”
Ahtone's talk, titled “Indigenous Journalism,” was centered around the protests at Standing Rock in 2016 and highlighted how major media outlets covered it.
By showing slides of different news headlines, Ahtone noted that reporting on the Standing Rock protests was a time of great visibility for indigenous issues, but it was coverage from major news sources like The New York Times and The Washington Post that dictated the stories.
“The stories are always about how non-Native Americans are interfacing with Native Americans,” Ahtone said. “It's never about us, it's about them.”
Junior Amira Al-Subaey is interested in examining the representation of marginalized communities in the media, which led them to attend Ahtone's talk.
“I'm really interested in dissecting who creates the news that we read and who determines the narratives that we believe to be true,” Al-Subaey said. “Especially in this age where we're seeing big media giants like New York Times and Washington Post producing their own narrative.”
According to Al-Subaey, Ahtone's talk explained the ways in which the news media can exploit marginalized communities in their reporting.
“[Ahtone] coined the term in their talk of ‘exploitative colonialism' and how reporting on various marginalized communities' struggles can reproduce colonial narratives, through erasing certain voices, through erasing certain stories and through reproducing stereotypes of those people,” Al-Subaey said.
Echoing Al-Subaey, Breza noted that Ahtone's discussion of the failure of news outlets to sufficiently cover indigenous issues complicates media objectivity and reflects the biases of society at large.
“I think that when you hear these really simple examples of just how racist media outlets are being, often unintentionally and unknowingly, it makes you pause [to think] about how general society talks about Native issues, [and] specifically our news outlets that we look to as reputable, objective, etc.,” Breza said.
Throughout their talk, Ahtone mentioned many indigenous media sources that highlight indigenous voices and issues in their reporting. One example is High Country News, where Ahtone is a contributing editor.
“There are almost 200 different indigenous media organizations,” Ahtone said. “These are indigenous stories, by indigenous people, which usually does not happen very often.”
Al-Subaey said that they found Ahtone's suggestions helpful in raising more awareness of indigenous issues.
“I thought that was a very tangible way that [other] people can know what's going on in the indigenous communities across the country and across the world, and ensure that we're supporting indigenous voices. If we care about indigenous issues, then [we center] indigenous voices to speak on those issues,” Al-Subaey said.
Events in the Indigenous Speaker Series, like Ahtone's talk, could not happen without funding from other organizations on campus, as the Indigenous People's Day at Tufts group has no funding of its own, according to Breza.
The Media Advocacy Board (MAB) has funding for speaker events in their budget and chose to dedicate it to Ahtone's talk, according to Chair of MAB Ben Kesslen.
“We have a budget that we can use to put toward causes and events that are media-related that we think are worthwhile and important, which is why we helped fund the event,” Kesslen, a senior, said.
Kesslen noted that it was important for MAB to be involved in bringing Ahtone to speak on campus, because they offered crucial insights on Native representation in the media.
“I thought [Ahtone] said really important and interesting things about how the media reports on indigenous people,” Kesslen said. “I think among student journalism here, it was a great lesson on how to better report on and talk about indigenous issues that face our campus.”
Breza noted that with the conclusion of the speaker series this semester, the team behind Indigenous People's Day at Tufts will continue working to establish a program in Native studies, as reported on Oct. 26 in the Daily.
“What we're trying to do is establish a Native studies minor within the [Consortium of Studies in] Race, Colonialism and Diaspora which houses … Latino studies, Africana studies, Asian American studies and colonialism studies,” Breza said.
Breza said that at present, Tufts does have classes but no program in Native studies, which makes it harder to centralize the subject and get funding for faculty.
“It's natural that Native studies would be included in [the consortium], and it's a huge gap right now that [it] is not present,” Breza said.
Looking to the future, Kesslen commented on how they hope Ahtone's talk will incite change on campus.
“I hope the MAB can continue to use our budget to bring speakers to campus who will teach us how to become better and more critical,” Kesslen said. “And I hope that the success of this event is evidence for the need of Native studies on campus and more dialogue around indigenous issues.”

Colombo
Sri Lanka has ordered a corruption investigation at its national carrier, including the controversial termination of a management deal with Emirates airline, the government said Saturday.
President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed a five-member panel to investigate the financial transactions of Sri Lankan airlines from 2006 to 2008, when the deal with Emirates was ended, a statement from their office said.
Sri Lankan, founded in 1979 as Air Lanka, was profitable until the government of strongman president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who ran the country from 2005 to 2015, kicked out the Emirates management team.
The deal was canceled in 2008 after Emirates refused to bump fare-paying business class passengers to give the seats to Rajapaksa's family, who were returning to Colombo from London.
A furious Rajapaksa removed the Emirates-appointed CEO of Sri Lankan from their post and put their brother-in-law, who had no aviation industry experience, in charge of the airline.
Since then, Sri Lankan airlines has sunk into the red, with an estimated loss of more than a billion dollars and debts of $3.2 billion.
Sirisena's office said they ordered the five-member panel to focus on the “termination of agreements between Sri Lankan airlines and Emirates, including reasons and ramifications thereof.”
Emirates paid $70 million to buy a 43.6 percent stake in Sri Lanka's national carrier when it was privatised in 1998 and had a contract to fully manage the airline till it was forced to leave.
Emirates' share of the company was eventually bought by the Sri Lankan government.
A criminal investigation is already underway into the airline's purchase of new Airbus aircraft at a cost of over two billion dollars during Rajapaksa's decade in power.
The mounting debt crisis at Sri Lankan airlines has forced the new government to seek international partners to inject capital and manage the airline, but there have been no takers so far.
The move comes amid allegations that Sri Lanka's new government, which came to power January 2015, has been slow to crack down on corruption under Rajapaksa.
The government last week set up special courts to investigate charges of corruption amounting to billions of dollars under the former regime.—AFP
Benedict Cumberbatch has been wooing audiences for years with their many leading roles including that of the title character on the hit show Sherlock. Cumberbatch may play a sleuthing genius on the show, but internet detectives have uncovered a secret that Mr. Holmes never did. It turns out that actor Benedict Cumberbatch is actually distantly related to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the man who created the character of Sherlock Holmes. The revelation has the internet abuzz. While the connection isn't close, with the two men being 16th cousins twice removed, it is still an uncanny coincidence worthy of a Holmes mystery. [Image by Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty Images] Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a Scottish writer and physician, passed away in 1930. Their stories about detective Sherlock Holmes are noted for being milestones in the crime fiction genre. Cumberbatch has been playing the role of Sherlock Holmes since 2010, never realizing their link to the character they were portraying. Fox News reported on the fascinating link between Sherlock's creator and one of the most famous men to portray him. Lisa Elzey, a family historian at the genealogy website Ancestry.com, commented on the finding. “Making family history connections is similar to piecing together a mysterious puzzle, one that the great Sherlock Holmes themselves would be intrigued to solve,” they said. Researchers had to go very far back to discover the connection between Benedict Cumberbatch and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Their common ancestor was traced back to a 14th century duke, John of Gaunt. John of Gaunt was the Duke of Lancaster and the fourth son of King Edward III of England, making Benedict and Sir Arthur not only distant cousins, but also descendants of royalty. John of Gaunt was Benedict Cumberbatch's 17th great-grandfather and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 15th great-grandfather. The news of the relationship broke on Sunday, coinciding with the premiere of the fourth season of Sherlock. After a two-year hiatus, fans who had been anticipating the season premiere now have a little added treat. Even more fascinating is that this is not the first time that researchers have found a connection between Benedict Cumberbatch and a character they were portraying. In 2014, the same team of researchers who made the link between Cumberbatch and Doyle discovered that Cumberbatch was related to World War II code breaker Alan Turing. Cumberbatch played Alan Turing in the 2014 film The Imitation Game which gave a fictionalized account of Turing's life. According to Telegraph, Turing and Cumberbatch are related through John Beaufort, the first Earl of Somerset. Ancestry's U.K. content manager, Miriam Silverman, remarked on Cumberbatch's family tree. “It would seem that there is a flair for espionage and bravery that has descended down multiple generations of Benedict Cumberbatch's family tree.” Cumberbatch's family tree has been shown to have a number of notable people. Their third cousin twice removed, Noel Carlisle Rees, worked for British Military Intelligence during World War II and smuggled thousands of Allied soldiers out of Greece. A sixth cousin, Chris Hadfield, was a Canadian astronaut. Cumberbatch's grandfather, Henry Carlton Cumberbatch, was a lieutenant in the military, known for being an excellent marksman. Cumberbatch's family is filled with the sort of intriguing characters that could be straight from a Sherlock Holmes story. Aside from starring in the latest season of Sherlock, fans can see Benedict Cumberbatch in the latest Marvel superhero film, Doctor Strange. [Image by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images] While a genealogical connection has not yet been found between the character of Doctor Strange and Benedict Cumberbatch, Cumberbatch's popularity ensures that researchers will continue to look into their family tree in hopes of making yet another startling discovery. At this rate, it is only a matter of time. [Featured Image by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images]

MULTAN-Grieving for Lahore blast that took over a dozen lives, the lawyers and traders observed strike on Tuesday and demanded the government to hunt down the perpetrators of the inhuman terrorist attack.
The black coats boycotted court work on a call given by the Pakistan Bar Council and Punjab Bar Council. No lawyer appeared before any court of law in any ordinary case, though the proceedings in urgent cases took place at the High Court.
Ghaibana namaz-e-janaza (funeral prayer in absentia) for the victims of the blast was offered at District Courts which was led by Syed Athar Shah Bukhari. Hundreds of lawyers attended the prayer. The High Court Bar Association and District Bar Association Multan also held general house meetings to pay tributes to the victims of the blast. The bars passed resolutions condemning the tragic incident.
On the other hand, the traders staged a string of demonstrations in different areas of Multan to condemn the blast. The traders association Akbar Road held a meeting with Idrees Butt in the chair and passed a condemnation resolution. They announced to keep their business shut on Wednesday. Similarly, the traders in Gulshan Market, Gardezi Market, Shah Rukane Alam, New Multan, Hussain Agahi, Daulat Gate and other areas also kept their businesses shut to mourn the carnage.
Meanwhile, the president of Multan Chamber of Commerce & Industry (MCCI) Khawaja Jalaluddin Roomi said that martyrdom of high police officials and the common people in blast in front of Punjab Assembly was the most heinous act and those who planned and executed it should be ferreted out and punished.
Roomi said that terrorism is a curse which had harmed and paid tributes to law enforcing agencies which were launching operations against the terrorists. They said that “tragedy has struck Lahore. Alongside innocent civilians, we have lost two of our own brave police officers Captain Mubeen and Zahid Gondal. They were good men who died serving and protecting the people of this great country”.
Here's Mike Sobel's Wednesday, February 15, 2017 early morning weather forecast for Edmonton, Alberta and the surrounding area.
OSLO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The price of Norway's farmed salmon is expected to drop to 47.5-48 crowns per kilo for deliveries in Oslo next week from about 53 crowns in the current week, industry sources told Reuters on Friday.
“It's difficult. Prices are down 5 crowns and we are at about 48 crowns per kilo in Oslo,” said an exporter who declined to be named.
A producer confirmed the price drop.
“There are mixed opinions but we expect 47.5 crowns in Oslo. It has been a tough week due to more supply,” the producer said.
Salmon prices peaked at around 80 crowns per kilo in early January of 2017 at a time when supply constraints supported prices, but have since fallen as volumes grew.
Production growth from Norway is expected to be around 9 percent in 2018, the Norwegian Seafood Council predicted in early January.
Norway is the world's top salmon exporter, and the share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish.
Average production costs for whole fish, including the cost of harvesting, rose by 13 percent to 34.29 crowns per kilo in 2016, according to data from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries.
Leading Norwegian producers include Marine Harvest, Salmar, Leroy Seafood, Grieg Seafood and Norway Royal Salmon. (Reporting by Ole Petter Skonnord, editing by Terje Solsvik)
In Huntington Beach on Wednesday, that meant the annual patriotic parade down Pacific Coast Highway and up Main Street.
Frankfurt Am Main: German chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives will sit down with their historic centre-left rivals on Sunday to try and seal a deal to form a government more than four months after legislative elections. They have set a deadline of Sunday evening, with the option of extending into Monday or Tuesday.
On the agenda are detailed questions about how a repeat of the "grand coalition" or "GroKo" that has ruled since 2013 will shape healthcare, labour law, pensions and reform of the European Union and euro single currency.
Both sides are reluctant to compromise too much and risk losing support, but are equally fearful of going back to voters in repeat elections that could see a further rise of the far-right.
But neither can they afford to dig in their heels, as a poll for ARD television showed 71 percent of people do not understand "why forming a government is taking so long".
"I hope we can manage it," Merkel said Friday, warning however that there were still "a whole list of very serious points of disagreement".
At stake for Merkel — still rated a "good" or "very good" choice for chancellor by 51 percent of respondents to the same poll — is whether they lead a stable coalition into their fourth term, or risks a fragile minority government or new elections.
The SPD is a reluctant partner, having initially vowed to go into opposition after plunging to a historic low vote share of 20.5 percent in September.
Social Democrats agreed to talk only after Merkel's soundings with two smaller parties, the ecologist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats, fell through.
Challenged by rebels within their own ranks, SPD leader Martin Schulz has sought political cover by putting any final coalition deal to a vote by all 440,000 members.
Kevin Kuehnert, leader of the SPD youth wing, has become a standard bearer for opponents of a new deal with Merkel.
"This kind of politics was rewarded with a 14 percentage point drop (for CDU and SPD combined) last year, and I suspect things will continue that way" if the coalition materialises, they have said.
Others warn the SPD is too weak to face voters again so soon, garnering 18 percent in some polls -- just a few points ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Merkel too faces grumbling among their troops, with more conservative voices accusing them of marching their Christian Democratic Union (CDU) too far into the political centre, giving up terrain to the AfD.
Meanwhile, the press has scented the end of an era approaching.
Eight years of GroKo under Merkel — from 2005-09 and again from 2013-17 — had shown that "the lowest common denominator achieves nothing as long as there is no overarching idea," commented Stefan Braun for the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
Leaders' aggressive swipes at their counterparts away from the negotiating table highlighted how "hesitant, quarrelsome, demoralising and above all uninspiring" the whole process was, they wrote.
Merkel and Schulz should offer honest, ambitious answers to the country's big challenges or "leave the way clear for new leaders or new elections".
At least 65 killed in heatwave in Pakistan's Karachi
A heatwave in Quebec has killed at least 17 people in the past week as high summer temperatures scorched eastern Canada, health officials said Wednesday.
Twelve of the dead were reported in the eastern province's capital Montreal, said regional public health director Mylene Drouin.
The Tribune newspaper said five of the deaths occurred in the past 48 hours in the Eastern Townships, a rural area just east of the city.
"My thoughts are with the loved ones of those who have died in Quebec during this heat wave," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter.
"The record temperatures are expected to continue in central and eastern Canada, so make sure you know how to protect yourself and your family," Trudeau said.
Drouin said the victims were part of "the very vulnerable population, the elderly or people suffering from chronic or mental illnesses."
Temperatures soared to 34 degrees Celsius (93 Fahrenheit) with a humidity that made it feel closer to 40 degrees, the meteorological service said.
The mercury has regularly topped 30 degrees since Friday in southern Quebec, accompanied by stifling humidity levels.
A government heat warning is in place for the region, but meteorologists are forecasting a drop in temperatures at the end of the week.
No deaths had been reported for the same period in the neighboring province of Ontario, which has also sizzled under extremely high temperatures.
In 2010, a heat wave killed around 100 people in the Montreal area.
WINNIPEG – Parts of southeastern Manitoba are under a snowfall warning Monday.
Environment Canada is calling for 10 to 20 centimetres of snow to hit areas including Steinbach, St. Adolphe, Emerson, Lac du Bonnet, Pinaway, Whiteshell and Sprague.
A low pressure system is tracking into Minnesota bringing heavy snow to Manitoba Monday evening into Tuesday.
The snow is expected to start falling Monday morning and will reach about five cm by the evening. The heaviest snowfall is expected to come down Monday night with accumulations of 10 – 15 cm by Tuesday morning.
Strong northerly winds are also expected to gust up to 60 km/hr developing Monday evening. It will reduce visibility in some areas with blowing snow toward the Red River Valley.

The sale of the Apple iPhone X was preceded by fears of slow supply in components hampering Apple's sales of their 2017 flagship. However, more than a month after the launch of the iPhone X, reports tend to suggest more trouble.
Supply-chain sources including as many as four component suppliers are reporting a decline in order, resulting in a fall in revenue. Based on a report by DigiTimes, despite having enjoyed a surge in orders for the iPhone X in September and October, sources from the component supply chain saw their shipments for iPhone devices weaken in the month of November and are expected to drop even further in December.
The report states that camera lens supplier Largan Precision saw flat revenues in November. Chassis maker Catcher Technology and touch panel supplier General Interface Solution is also reporting a decline in revenue.
(Also Read: Apple iPhone X Review: This gorgeous, future-proof iPhone still needs some refining)
Suppliers are still hopeful of a healthy demand through the months of January and February after which they expect a 'sharp decline' in the month of March. This could be an issue for Apple, forcing the company to reduce its iPhone X shipment targets in Q1 of 2018.
A previous report stated that Apple may release a new 6-inch iPhone with a design similar to that of the iPhone X and also feature Face ID. According to certain market observers, this may force consumers to delay their purchases of the iPhone X and wait for the next gen device.
Zurich: FIFA held a last-minute meeting on Wednesday with the two candidates bidding to host the 2026 World Cup ahead of the publication of a report which could disqualify a bid rated not up to scratch.
A joint United States, Canada and Mexico bid is being challenged by underdogs Morocco for the right to stage the 48-team tournament with the hosts to be decided by the FIFA Congress in Moscow on 13 June.
A five-man FIFA task force has inspected both bids and its key evaluation report is expected to be published any time from Friday onwards.
Under new bidding rules, the task force has the power to disqualify a bid if it does not meet minimum technical standards, especially with regard to stadiums.
“It was a very constructive meeting, a very positive meeting,” Hicham El Amrani, the CEO of the Morocco bid, told Reuters. “We gave them the extra information they were looking for and we look forward to the publication of the report.”
World soccer's governing body FIFA and the North American bid did not comment on the meeting.
The task force will award each bid a score ranging from zero to five on six different aspects of their bid: stadiums, team facilities, accommodation, transport, telecommunications and locations for events and fan festivals.
A bid must achieve a score of at least two out of five in the categories for stadiums, team facilities and transport/accommodation to qualify for the Congress vote, as well as an overall score of at least two.
FIFA says the score for transport and accommodation is calculated on a combined basis.
The system was introduced after criticism during previous World Cup hosting campaigns that voters overlooked the technical qualities of respective bids and based their choices on an exchange of political and personal favours.
For the same reason, the franchise was extended to the FIFA Congress — where each of FIFA's member associations each hold one vote — instead of being restricted to the now extinct executive committee.
Even so, outside influences continue to affect the process, as seen when US President Donald Trump made clear in a tweet that they expected countries that receive American economic and other forms of support to deliver votes for their nation's bid.
While it was a snowy start to the week with some school closures, that was the biggest snowfall we'll have this week.
Winnipeg had around 5cm of snow overnight Sunday into Monday. There will be another system heading into the eastern prairies Tuesday that will likely bring another 5cm but that is expected to land primarily East of Winnipeg, closer to Kenora. Winnipeg could see a few flurries from this system but no significant snowfall.
Generally, this week looks like a cloudy one with the chance of some flurry activity as temperatures warm up into Wednesday. Overall, Winnipeg will likely see a few flurries but accumulations through the week look small and very spread out. Weather models are predicting between 2-3cm total for Winnipeg over the course of the week.
There will likely be more snow headed for southern Manitoba but it appears more likely to arrive on the weekend. It's far away but at this point, around 5cm looks possible again.
The City of Edmonton is asking for the public's help in a national challenge.
The federal government launched the Smart City Challenge, a national competition that challenges communities to adopt a “smart cities approach” to improve the lives of their residents through innovation, data and connected technology.
The winning community will get $50 million.

BAY CITY, Mich. (AP)  Federal prosecutors say new evidence caused them to drop charges against two people accused of intentionally discharging oily water into Lake Huron from a tugboat in 2014.
Spokeswoman Gina Balaya (Buh-LYE'-uh) says it was in the "best interests of justice" to drop the case against engineer Jeffrey Patrick and assistant engineer William Harrigan. They didn't describe the new evidence.
A trial was supposed to start Tuesday in Bay City federal court, but a judge dismissed the case last week.
The oily sheens in Lake Huron were spotted by air, east of Cheboygan and east of Alpena, in 2014. Patrick and Harrigan were charged with conspiracy and another crime while aboard a boat called Victory.
Messages were left seeking comment from defense lawyers.
2017 FINA WORLD SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS
Four-time Olympic medalist Park Tae Hwan of South Korea has scratched out of the men's 100 free heats for tomorrow morning. They were seeded 18th.
So far this week, Park has made it through to the finals of the 200 and 400 freestyles. Park was just off the medal stand in the 400 free, coming up fourth in 3:44.38 behind Sun Yang, Mack Horton, and Gabriele Detti. They finished 8th in the 200 free in 1:47.11.
Last month, Park mentioned that their main focuses for the meet would be the 200 free and 400 free, so it is not a huge surprise that they would drop the sprint event. However, they are still entered in the 1500 free for later this week.

Linebacker stands out as the Detroit Lions the biggest need in the NFL draft.
They need a starter to play alongside Tahir Whitehead and depth behind them.
Just because its the biggest need, doesnt mean they will draft one in the first round of the NFL draft which starts on April 27. It depends on which linebacker is available and if they are worth the 21st overall pick.
Also, Lions general manager Bob Quinn could not pass up a guy who might fall a bit who could provide a big boost at another position, really any position except quarterback.

Here are five linebackers who would fit, not necessarily first-round picks:
1. Jarrad Davis (Florida) seems to be a popular mock draft pick for the Lions. Hes likely to be available at No. 21. Bucky Brooks, an analyst for NFL.com has them going to Detroit in their latest mock draft. The Lions cant go wrong adding a defender with exceptional instincts and awareness to the mix, Brooks wrote. JARRAD DAVIS VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS
2. Zach Cunningham (Vanderbilt) could fit the bill for a three-down linebacker. Some believe hes a first-round pick, others have them falling into the second round. He loves attacking blockers in the run game and their 56 run stops led all Power-5 linebackers, but they must cut down on their 34 missed tackles in order to live up to their potential, according to Steve Palazzolo of Pro Football Focus. ZACH CUNNINGHAM VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS
3. Raekwon McMillan (Ohio State) is a possible second-round pick although they could go higher than when the Lions pick in that round at 53. A little bit bigger. Has some thump to him. Ran in the low 4.6 -- think they ran 4.61. Showed hes got a little more athletic ability than maybe we gave them credit for. They could fit 3-4, 4-3, but hed be in the mix (with the Lions), according to NFL.coms Daniel Jeremiah from a conference call. RAEKWON MCMILLAN VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS
4. T.J. Watt (Wisconsin) is the subject of a debate whether hed be better in a 4-3 (which would fit the Lions) or the 3-4. Because of their size (6-4, 252 pounds), athleticism and effort it seems they could be a fit in either scheme. The brother of J.J. Watt, is not a first-round pick but could go in the second or third rounds. Watt is a crafty edge player with outstanding hand skills and technique. They flash a non-stop motor that could make them a 10-sack candidate each year, Brooks wrote.
5. Duke Riley (LSU) could be an impact player. Chad Reuter, a draft analyst for NFL.com, has them going to the Lions in the third round in their new six-round mock draft. One-year wonder who produced at a consistent level despite their average athleticism and lack of starting experience, per Lance Zierlein of NFL.com.
 BONUS PICK: Watch for Anthony Walker Jr. (Northwestern) who is creeping up the charts. Hes expected to go in third or fourth round. CBSsports.com lists them as fourth best inside linebacker available. Has potential to become a starting linebacker within a few years. At Northwester they called them The Franchise.

New Delhi: The Home Ministry has released Rs 174 crore to six states having an international border for development of infrastructure in forward areas, an official said.
The states that will be benefited include Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
"An amount of Rs 174.32 crore was released to Assam, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal under the Border Area Development Programme (BADP)," the official said today.
The fully centrally-funded BADP programme covers all villages which are located within the 0-10 km of the international border in 17 states.
However, priority is given to those villages which are identified by border guarding forces for speedy development of infrastructure.
The schemes permissible under BADP include activities relating to 'swatchhta aabhiyan', skill development programmes, promotion of sports activities, promotion of rural tourism, border tourism and protection of heritage sites.
Construction of helipads in remote and inaccessible hilly areas, which do not have road connectivity, skill development training to farmers for the use of modern/scientific technique in farming, organic farming are other areas which come under the BADP.
Assam shares International Border with Bangladesh, West Bengal shares border with Nepal and Bhutan, Gujarat with Pakistan, Manipur with Myanmar, Uttar Pradesh with Nepal and Himachal Pradesh with China and Nepal.
Fraud and abuse. Personal and side-job spending.
These are just a handful of findings by Maui County's auditor after an extensive review of charges on government credit cards.
The problem may be even deeper, according to a federal lawsuit.
Both the audit and a federal whistleblower lawsuit come in the wake of pCard misspending that we uncovered back in 2015.
Now even more incidents and allegations are detailed, and the county is promising big changes.
A series of Always Investigating reports starting a couple years back showed how busy some county workers were on the Valley Isle, just not always doing the people's work.
A commercial kitchen built at a public works baseyard. A stadium area turned into an auto-repair side business. A lucrative tire buy-and-sell scheme back near that illicit kitchen.
All involved taxpayer money on purchase orders and pCards, which are county credit cards many employees get to use with varying levels of oversight. Many were suspended or fired, several were put under police and prosecutor investigation.
But a federal whistleblower lawsuit filed this week says: “In response to the KHON news story (department supervisors) took superficial measures that were simply too little and too late to stem the overwhelming evidence that continued to roll into the county of widespread theft, fraud and corruption.”

Lesli Lyn Otani, a Maui County engineer, says they were demoted after they brought allegations direct to their department heads of misspending at even more county offices, a county ghost-car and auto-selling scheme, even environmental violations after flooding last September.
“It was like a candy store, and there were very few checks and balances,” said Otani's lawyer, Roman Amaguin. “She wants to see this mess cleaned up, because there's so much waste going on, and people are covering it up and it needs to stop.”
According to the lawsuit, “(supervisors) were aware or should have been aware of the theft and misappropriation, but did nothing about it.”
“There were some employees that were very creative in avoiding detection, but at the same time, it's my belief that any kind of cursory investigation after hearing about the rumors would have uncovered that,” Amaguin said.
The lawsuit lists at least a half-dozen people investigated and placed on leave.
A spokesperson says the county can't comment on pending litigation.
After Always Investigating started digging into misspending, a major county audit followed and the results are just in.
The auditor's team scoured tens of thousands of pCard transactions. Their findings include suspected fraud, waste or abuse that led auditors to contact law enforcement.
“When we found transactions that were irregular, we notified the proper persons. We made things available to them that we looked at, and we let them take the lead,” said Maui County auditor Lance Taguchi.
Keith Regan, the county's managing director, told the auditor county officials are “very concerned about this matter and will fully cooperate and provide any assistance needed to facilitate the investigations.”
The county's director of finance was flagged for charging their wife and child's airline tickets on their pCard along with a work-related flight for himself. A spokesperson says they investigated and administrative actions were taken.
They also say the director paid the county back before the fares were booked. It was not seen as an attempt to misuse funds, but it did not follow proper procedures.
The audit also found end runs around competitive bid rules that apply when buying things too pricey to be allowed on pCards.
“It was pretty evident in the instances we saw where the credit card were swiped within minutes of each other multiple times,” Taguchi noted.
The audit pointed to other weaknesses, like few preventions against swipes for personal or even side-job buys, high credit limits, low training, even a warning that hostess bars could masquerade as restaurants on credit card statements, although no actual hostess bar spending was found.
“Nothing can guarantee that fraud waste and abuse will not occur, but we can put in more controls,” said Taguchi, and “generally refocus everything so that everyone knows that they need to be very careful when they use their pCard.”
After years of planning for one of the biggest California water projects in decades, a key question remains unanswered: Who exactly will pay for it?
Decision time is approaching for the agencies that will have to pick up the nearly $17-billion tab for building two massive water tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the heart of the state's water works.
Whether the board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California commits to paying roughly a quarter of the bill could make or break the project.
Metropolitan management has been a consistent cheerleader for the tunnels, arguing they are vital to stabilizing deliveries of Northern California water that on average provide the Southland with about a third of its supplies.
“The costs of California WaterFix are substantial,” the staff wrote in a report reviewed Monday by two MWD committees. “However…the costs that would be allocated to Metropolitan are reasonable and affordable, given the water supply reliability improvements.”
The staff estimated that the project would cost MWD about $4.3 billion, increasing residential water rates an average of roughly $23 to $38 a year — depending on interest rates on the project debt.
Committee members appeared generally receptive to the presentation. But several indicated they wanted more time before the final project vote, which is scheduled for Sept. 26.
“The 26th is not realistic,” said board vice chair John Murray Jr., who represents Los Angeles.
Public comments at the Monday meeting were divided.
Speakers representing business and labor endorsed the project, saying it was needed to maintain reliable water supplies for the state's most populous region. Charley Wilson, executive director of the nonprofit Southern California Water Committee, called the staff's white paper a “prudent, conservative and responsible financial plan.”
But opponents predicted that MWD would wind up paying far more than the staff estimate, and argued the money would be better spent developing local supplies. The staff analysis “understates the costs and risks” to MWD, said Doug Obegi, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that has been involved in numerous lawsuits over endangered species protections in the delta.
As outlined by the MWD staff, the largely urban customers of the State Water Project would pay 55% of its cost, or $9.2 billion. The largely agricultural customers of the federal Central Valley Project would pay for 45%, or $7.5 billion.
Obegi and others said that breakdown was unrealistic for a couple of reasons.
First, growers can't afford to pay that much. And irrigation districts with senior water rights and wildlife refuges — which both receive water from the delta — would not have to share the tunnel costs.
The State Water Project could wind up paying for 65% to 75% of the tunnels, driving up MWD's cost, according to critics.
By diverting water from the Sacramento River in the north delta and sending it through twin tunnels to the south delta pumps, proponents hope, the project will diminish environmental impacts that have restricted water exports.
State water managers say the tunnels will not significantly boost average delta exports. Rather, they argue, the project will avert future restrictions that could slash delta deliveries to 1970s levels.
According to the MWD paper, if the tunnels are built, future delta supplies would be 1.3 million acre-feet greater than without the tunnels. The staff used that number to estimate the per-acre-foot cost of the tunnel water, concluding it would be far cheaper than new supplies from recycling projects or seawater desalination.
(An acre-foot is enough to supply two average households for a year.)
But in a recent blog post, Jeff Michael, a tunnel critic and director of the Business Forecasting Center at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, called MWD's supply projections “wildly optimistic.” They said the board should demand more plausible cost comparisons with other water sources.
At Monday's committee meeting, MWD general manager Jeffrey Kightlinger said that regardless of how the tunnel water supply is calculated, MWD's project costs would stay the same.
Other water agencies are expected to vote soon on whether to participate in the tunnel project. If too many say noes, the project could die — or the agencies that say yes would have to up their stake to keep it alive.

Earlier today, news broke out that actor Anushka Sharma and cricketer Virat Kohli finally tied the knot in Tuscany, Italy. Given the hushed nature of the intimate wedding, those following #Virushka could barely hold their excitement when the announcement was made. To their relief, in just a few hours, images have surfaced of the happy couple on their big day, including the one Sharma and Kohli released themselves. The duo travelled to Italy with only close family, where they had a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony, with decor by Devika Narain. The bride and groom wore custom-made Sabyasachi ensembles and jewellery for all events. From the floral look at the mehendi to the pastel lehenga they wore for the pheras, Sharma made a stunning bride, and was complemented by a dapper Kohli in coordinated outfits. We reached out to the designer for a comment on the couple's outfits, who sent the following message: “We designed the clothes for both bride and groom for all the functions. From engagement to mehendi and sangeet, for the wedding and post-wedding dinner, and heritage jewellery from the recently-launched Sabyasachi label. It was wonderful to work with the couple. From the House of Sabyasachi, we wish Anushka and Virat a very happy married life.”
The newly-married couple released a joint statement to the media and on their social media, stating, “Today we have promised each other to be bound in love forever. We are truly blessed to share this wonderful news with you. This beautiful day will be made more special with the love and support of our family of fans and well-wishers. Thank you for being such an important part of our journey.”
For those who feel like they've lost out on the live action from one of the most highly anticipated celebrity weddings of 2017, Sharma and Kohli will be returning to India to host a reception in New Delhi on December 21 and in Mumbai on December 26. They also plan to travel to South Africa to spend New Year's Eve together, following which Kohli will start prepping for the upcoming test series. Sharma will return to their shoot schedule early in January.
Until the two receptions take place, scroll through our gallery for all the inside pictures from Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's stunning wedding ceremony.
In tension over housing and land, Gugulethu residents recently built shacks on vacant land to protest against the lack of adequate housing. Some residents set fire to a car that was parked outside the popular Tshisa Nyama, Mzoli's, and looted a supermarket. The City's anti-land invasion unit razed their shacks. But backyard dwellers are making it clear that they have had enough. By HLUMELA DYANTYI and APHIWE NGALO.
A Google Maps search of Gugulethu reveals how congested the yards in the township are.
In 2016 Mayoral Committee Member Benedicta Minnen said that more than 80,000 people live in backyard dwellings in Cape Town.
Cheryl Jonas is just one backyard dweller who has grown tired of living in these subhuman conditions.  They are 49 years old, unemployed and lives in a shack with their parents, brother, sister, their children and their own children. The family's only source of income is the grant their parents receive from the state. Cheryl has lived in Gugulethu their entire life.
All three generations of Jonas's family live in the same backyard and their siblings have built themselves ihokie. These are small back rooms, usually made out of zinc and mud. Jonas said: “Kudala nda applayela indlu, kwango 1999, sendisuka uzama uapplaya, eDeflt, eBellville nalapha eGugulethu, kodwa nangoku andikayifumani indlu.” (I have been (applying) for a house since 1999, I have even applied in Delft, Belville and here in Gugulethu, but I am still without a house.)

Brenda Lange is a community leader in the housing battles faced by residents of Gugulethu. They live in a two-roomed house. They and their mother share a room, while their siblings and their children are backyard dwellers on the same property. They have, like Jonas' family, built themselves iihokie. Lange tells a story similar to Jonas and, as is common in the area, they too have been waiting for an RDP house for more than a decade.

In the many meetings they have had, Lange has questioned their local councillor, Sharon Manatha, about why people who have been on the housing list for decades have not seen any success. “Sathi ku Mimi, ingathi thina siyi Gugulethu asihoyeki, kukho abantu ngoku abafumana izindlu, kuyokhiwa eCrossroad, ide iyofika e airport. Sambuza ba sizongena na? Wathi yiproject yabantu base Nyanga East.” (We said to Mimi, as Gugulethu residents we feel forgotten, there are people who get houses. There are houses being built from Crossroads to the airport, we asked if we are included, they said that the project was for the people of Nyanga.)
Citing the developments in Crossroads, Lange disputes the claims made by officials that there is no land in the province. “If uthi akanaso ispace sethu singabantu base Gugulethu, sizom'nika ispace. Ukwazelaphi uninika abantu befika, abanike ispace, kude bayofika e airport. Bawuthathe phi lamhlaba, besithi akekho umhlaba eWestern Cape?” (If they say there is no space for us, the people of Gugulethu, we will give them space. How can people who have only just arrived get space, all the way to the airport? Where did they get that land when they say there is no land in the Western Cape?)
The owner of the Tshisa Nyama, Mzoli's, has agreed to sell of some of their land so that a few families can benefit. Gugulethu business person and owner Mzoli Ngcawuzele said they are willing to hand over land in the area that has been earmarked for a supermarket.
This is another contentious site in the fight for land in the area. On Sunday 25 February, land invaders targeted the popular restaurant, Mzoli's, by setting alight an ATM and a car outside the eatery. The violence was driven by backyarders who also barricaded Klipfontein Road with stones and burning tires.

Backyard dwellers claim that they were attacking the Tshisa Nyama because of a new shopping centre Mzoli was rumoured to be opening in Gugulethu.
In an interview a week after the protests, a disappointed Ngcawuzele emphasised how betrayed they felt by the Gugulethu community and considers themselves a “father to the Gugulethu community”.
“I am ploughing back into the community in so many ways. I contribute to education and to the elderly. Out there, there are graduates I have taken care of through their studies. I organised three lunches for the elderly, and during Christmas I always have parties for them. I support HIV positive people with meals, and I employ people from the neighbourhood, and people from Khayelitsha,” they said.
Even though Mzoli's did not face any damage to their restaurant, the relationship between the business owner and the larger community has soured. However, having grown up in the area, Ngcawuzele is all too aware of the daily challenges residents face. Their family were forcibly removed to Gugulethu in the 1960s following the passing of the Group Areas Act, which entrenched apartheid segregation and racial inequality.
There are ongoing political debates around the theme of land expropriation without compensation. During their maiden question-and-answer session in the National Assembly, President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke earnestly about the importance of correcting historical injustice, while emphasising that land expropriation does not mean “smash and grab”. This after the Economic Freedom Fighter supporters invaded unoccupied land in Tshwane and Johannesburg earlier this month.
The reality for thousands, such as Lange, is a loss of faith in politicians, business people and councillors. “Into esiyifunayo, sifuna kuze uBonginkosi Madikizela, ngoba kuthiwa nguye ophethe izindlu. uDe Lille naye. Asizombetha, sifuna ianwser eziright,” said Lange. (We want houses, We want (Housing MEC) Bonginkosi Madikizela to come here, apparently they are the one in charge of housing. (Mayor Patricia) De Lille must come too. We're not going to fight her, we just want answers.)
Sitting on the couch in their two-bedroomed home, Lange went on to say that neglect is “making people angry” and more violence can be expected.
Abantu abaninzi barhalela umlilo, and xasizo phemba lomlilo, asizobanyo imall, asizobanaye uSassa, uSassa unceda thina. Ishopping mall, uSassa neclinic, zisondelene, so utshiswa kwemall, noSassa uzotsha neclinic.” (People want fire, and if we fuel the fire we won't have a mall, or a Sassa, Sassa assists us. The shopping mall, Sassa and the clinic are in close proximity to each other, so if one burns they all burn.)
Lange and the people of Gugulethu recognise that the burning of buildings will only affect them badly. “Into abangayi cingiyo bona kulandawo bahleli kuyo, yinto ba inqondo zethu azifani, abantu banomsindo” said Lange, referring to the councillors, who they feel do not care about the people of Gugulethu. (What the councillors don't think about is that people reason differently, people are angry.)
Lange said that Gugulethu residents have been fighting for housing since the dawn of democracy and, even though it was one of the first townships to be built during the apartheid era, residents have been on the housing list for years.
“Gugulethu is recognised as one of the first townships in Cape Town yet we still do not have proper houses. The city does not care for us,” they said.
Lange believes that even though today's government no longer governs under apartheid laws, it remains oppressive towards poor black people and that the need for housing in Gugulethu has caused tension between locally born community members versus those who move to the city from the rural Eastern Cape.
“Why is it that they get houses before us, yet we are still waiting?” Lange said.
Lange remembers a time when people from Gugulethu would rush to check for their names in the local newspaper to see if they qualified for an RDP home, only to be left disappointed.
“Not even 3% of people from Gugulethu were on that list... because people had applied so many years ago, their parents or grandparents would pass away. When you as the heir would go and ask if you could get that house, they would tell you ‘no you can't be given the rights to that house' and my question would always be ‘okay then, what is going to happen to that house?' They wouldn't even know what was going to happen to those houses,” Lange said.
The residents of Gugulethu seem to have lost hope in receiving houses from the housing department, all they want now is land. Lange emphasises this, saying, “Sifuna umhlaba, sifuna ubeka ihokie zethu.” (We want land, we want a place to build our hokkies.)
Xolani Koyana, spokesperson for Executive Mayor Patricia de Lille, said the City of Cape Town's policy states that the municipality must stop those who “illegally occupy city or provincial government-owned land”.
“(L)and invasions are illegal, pose fire, health and flood risks,” they said.
According to Koyana, De Lille has met with one of the landowners of the vacant property who made it clear that they are proceeding with an application for a court interdict against the land invasion and that the land, which was invaded by protesting residents, has been earmarked for development.
The City cannot take further action on this matter due to the ongoing litigation, they said. DM

It is an unimaginable thought for any parent–the loss of a child. But for some Okanagan residents, it is a painful reality. A small group of them have come together to lean on one another as they cope with their grief. As Klaudia Van Emmerik reports, the support group was started by a woman who knows all too well the pain involved in losing a child.
Intermarketing Agency has launched Intermarketing X, a new experiential offering that has secured Thomas Cook Media and Partnerships as one of its first clients.

The agency intends to merge live activations with digital campaigns, and will fuse experiential with digital direct, motion, media, print and partnership strategies with the aim of connecting with audiences all over the world.
The team will be working alongside Intermarketing's established offices in London, Leeds, Amsterdam and Sydney, adding an experiential value to the agency's client portfolio, which includes Liverpool Football Club, NSPCC, Bupa Global and the Shop Direct Group.
Intermarketing X forms part of Intermarketing's growth plan, which has seen the agency increase its turnover by 44% and launch a data and analytics division.
Nickii Gray, Intermarketing Agency managing director, said: "In today's culture, customers hold more power than ever, demanding brand and product experiences that make a difference to their lives. They expect more. And now we want to partner with ambitious brands to deliver more - transforming everyday brand encounters into rewarding experiences that win hearts and change minds.
"As an agency we have 30 years' experience in understanding consumers. We work with brands to find the most relevant ways to engage with their audience, with the ultimate aim of driving long-term loyalty and advocacy. So formalising this ability to bring brand stories to life in today's connected world, and to drive real business results, is a natural evolution for us."

Local governments are getting the additional powers they asked for to require construction of more rental housing, Municipal Affairs Minister Selina Robinson says.
Legislation presented by the B.C. government Tuesday would give municipal councils authority to require a share of undeveloped land to be reserved for rentals. Redevelopment of rental properties would also be subject to replacement by new rental, but the rental share would be up to the local government.
Robinson said the changes respond to requests from local governments for stronger zoning tools to increase rental stock. In urban communities such as Metro Vancouver, the market produces mostly either single-family homes or compact condos for sale, they said.
“This will prevent rentals from being torn down so they can be redeveloped into luxury condos that only a few people can afford,” Robinson said.

The province isn't changing regulation of rent, but Robinson said increasing the rental supply is expected to stabilize rents that have soared in communities with near-zero rental vacancy rates.
Another legislative change requires local governments to collect data on housing types to use for land use planning. Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps said larger communities such as the Capital Regional District are already doing this, planning for 20 years out.
CRD plans indicate that the South Island region will need more than 34,000 additional rental units over the next 20 years, Helps said. Giving regions the authority to do the data collection and planning means smaller communities don't have to do it on their own.
Helps said it is important for councils to work with the development industry on expanded rental construction, rather than imposing new quotas on them.
A large insurance company that will be jointly founded by the Turkish Post and Telegraph Organization (PTT) and Italian Generali will operate insurance and individual pension systems in Turkey. PTT, which has 4,500 branches across the country, will be the agent of the new company. Other insurance companies also want the cooperation to open up to competition through contract bidding.
Generali and PTT will form an equal partnership. Generali will cover the foundation financing and capital and PTT will invest its current network as real capital.
PTT has reportedly been maintaining talks with Italian Generali rather than Generali Sigorta, which has been operating in Turkey for a long time. Generali is a global company that will bring foreign direct investment of up to $500 million to Turkey for the foundation, capital and operation of the new company. Talks are being organized by Mine Ayhan, the former general manager of Generali Turkey.
PTT has been operating in insurance under a subsidiary called PTT Sigorta, which works like a broker or agency for insurance companies and sells their products. PTT Sigorta's infrastructure is provided by Sigorta Yeri, in which Aktif Bank is a partner. Generali has been operating in Turkey for more than 100 years under the name Generali Sigorta, but is smaller than other insurance companies.
Foreign companies now hold 75 percent of Turkey's insurance industry. There is high foreign interest in the country's insurance industry because of its potential. Industry authorities say that PTT's 152-year name will be used in this operation, thinking that the new company will have significant advantages with the use of PTT's recognition and strong network. Considering this, they say that cooperation should take place through contract bidding by opening it to other insurance companies and observing public interest. Due to high potential, other foreign insurance companies are inclined to cooperation and the amount of foreign direct capital to be brought to the country can be increased.

The new and action-packed first official trailer for the sequel to Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim is now online, and features plenty of monster VS. machine carnage. Check it out after the jump!
The first trailer for Pacific Rim: Uprising made its recent debut at NYCC, and it's now been released online for you guys to take a look at.
The footage in the new trailer gives us some background on the events the followed the first film's climactic battle via Jake Pentecost's (yes, John Boyega got to keep their accent this time) voiceover, which echoes their father's rousing speech from Del Toro's original. Then, we see some pretty spectacular shots of the next gen Jaegers rushing into battle against some fierce-looking, evolved Kaiju.
For those of you who are fans of Pacific Rim, you most likely will love the sequel as well from the looks of it!
Here is the official trailer for your viewing pleasure! Let us know all your thoughts on the trailer in the comment section below!
The globe-spanning conflict between otherworldly monsters of mass destruction and the human-piloted super-machines built to vanquish them was only a prelude to the all-out assault on humanity in Pacific Rim Uprising.
John Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) stars as the rebellious Jake Pentecost, a once-promising Jaeger pilot whose legendary father gave their lives to secure humanity's victory against the monstrous “Kaiju.” Jake has since abandoned their training only to become caught up in a criminal underworld. But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, they are given one last chance to live up to their father's legacy by their estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)—who is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction.
Jake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious' Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family they have left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale.

ESPN looks at the main talking points from qualifying for the Japanese Grand Prix, where Mercedes proved it has overcome the blip of Singapore and Malaysia with a dominant pole position at Suzuka.
Shock: Kimi Raikkonen looked out of sorts all day and their FP3 crash at the second Degner left them with a grid penalty for Sunday's race. They were unable to minimise the cost, however, with both Red Bull's beating the Finn to fourth and fifth at a circuit Ferrari should expect to be the next quickest behind Mercedes. Once the penalty is applied, Raikkonen will start from 11th -- hardly a favourable position for Ferrari and its hopes of stopping Lewis Hamilton this weekend.
Shocker: Romain Grosjean's car has been through the wars recently -- but this time it had nothing to do with a faulty piece of circuit. The Frenchman crashed bizarrely at the Esses, losing the car and going into the wall nose first, suffering heavy damage. The faces in the Haas garage said it all -- another big repair job is on the horizon for the American team.

Another mixed homecoming for Honda: Honda has clearly made some steps forward in recent races, evidenced by Fernando Alonso advancing to Q3. While that will clearly be a boost to everyone at Sakura ahead of its home race on Sunday, Alonso's grid position will be a timely reminder of what has gone so wrong in its partnership with McLaren -- a big engine failure has prompted a change, meaning they will start last.
Suzuka still supreme: The Suzuka circuit remains one of the most special venues on the F1 calendar. As Raikkonen's crash in FP3 and Grosjean's in Q1 proved, there is still a big price to be paid for any mistakes, which is not always the case with modern F1 circuits. All three sessions were filled with drivers locking up and running wide as they continued to explore the limits.

Mercedes back on form: If there was any doubt of Mercedes' pace after Friday's rain-disrupted sessions, it was eradicated in fine style in qualifying. Hamilton's best laps were the quickest ever completed around the Suzuka circuit and onboards suggested there were areas they could have improved further. On pace alone the team should have little trouble extending its lead in both championships. Remarkably, it was Hamilton's first pole position at Suzuka and, if they drive like that in future years, it won't be theirs last.
Mixed strategies: Knowing they would face a five-place penalty for gearbox changes, both Valtteri Bottas and Kimi Raikkonen opted to set their times in Q2 on the soft tyres. That means they will start the race on the harder of the two usable compounds (don't expect to see the mediums make an appearance on Sunday), giving them the opportunity to maximise the pace of their cars on an alternative strategy rather than getting stuck in traffic on the same tyre compound as the rest of the top ten.
First-corner watch: Valtteri Bottas' impending grid penalty means the two championship contenders will start from the front row. That will present Vettel with their best chance to pass on a circuit which is notoriously difficult for overtaking opportunities. Otherwise, given the pace we've seen from Hamilton and Mercedes this weekend, the No.44 car could disappear into the distance if they lead into Turn 1.
After being locked inside a car for over two hours on a hot Wednesday afternoon, five-year-old twin sisters died of suffocation in Jamalpur area of Pataudi on the outskirts of Gurugram, Hindustan Times reported on Thursday.
The incident occurred on Wednesday when the girls, Harsha and Harshita, had gone outdoors to see puppies underneath the car — a Hyundai Elantra — at around 4 pm on Tuesday, the same report said.
The family began to look for the girls when they realised they were missing.
When they did not find the twins in and around the house, they decided to look for them near the fields where the car was parked, India Today reported.
However, at around 7.30 pm, the family found the twins lying unconscious inside the vehicle, after which they were rushed to the hospital.
“The girls were found unconscious in the car and were rushed to a nearby hospital. They were declared brought dead by the doctors,” a police officer told News18.
Since the car was old, the locks were not functioning properly and the girls could not open the doors, police added.

New Delhi: Petrol pump owners called off their proposed strike on over daily revision of petrol and diesel prices from Friday after the government agreed to change the timing to 6 am everyday instead of midnight.
Until now price revisions used to come into effect from midnight but considering the fact that dealers would have to deploy manpower everyday to change rates in the middle of the night, the timing has now been changed.
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the new timing of the price change was agreeable to the dealers and so daily price revision will be implemented from 16 June as previously decided.
Private pump owners, who make up for three-fourth of the nations 54,000 retail outlets of the public sector firms, had threatened to go on a strike over concerns of inadequate infrastructure to revise prices every midnight.
"There were some practical difficulties which we have addressed in our meeting with leadership of all the three petroleum dealers association today," they told reporters here.
Instead of changing rates at midnight, it has been decided that prices should change before the start of business, they said. "Daily prices will change from 6 am," they said.
Federation of All India Petroleum Traders president Ashok Badhwar said the government has taken the decision of daily price revision in public interest. "And in public interest, we are also withdrawing no- sale-no-purchase agitation planned for June 16," they said.
Pradhan said the daily price revision follows successful pilot in five cities and would lead to even the smallest change in international oil prices being passed on to consumers.
Till now, rates change on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international oil price and foreign exchange rate of the previous fortnight.
IOC Chairman Sanjiv Singh said whatever the pump operators were doing at 15-day frequency, they will be required to do daily.
Pradhan also said the oil companies will expedite automation of the entire fuel supply chain -- from refinery transportation to fuel pumps -- so that manual intervention is reduced to minimal.
Currently, only 20 per cent of the petrol pumps are automated.
IOC, the nation's largest fuel retailer, said it will provide information on daily price revisions through various means, including LED screens at petrol pumps, toll-free number, social media posts, mobile apps as well as through SMS.
Looking across the Golden Globe film and TV nominations, it's a banner year for movies driven by some of the most unlikely female characters to get the big-screen treatment.
In “The Shape of Water,” Sallie Hawkins plays a mute cleaning woman in 1962 Baltimore who has an supernatural encounter. In “The Post,” Meryl Streep plays a woman in their mid-50s who is thrust by circumstance into a leadership role. Margot Robbie and Allison Janney deliver tour de force performances in “I, Tonya,” a movie that on paper sounds like B-grade cable material. And the great Laurie Metcalf is the hero of “Lady Bird” and its touching look at mother-daughter and familial dynamics, for which Saorise Ronan received the best actor, comedy nom.
None of these are projects tailored to the conventional notions of the audiences who drive movie-going or indie film success. The shutout of female directors from the Globes race is particularly striking this year given the volume of femme-focused projects. The options — from “Wonder Woman's” Patty Jenkins to “Lady Bird's” Greta Gerwig to “Mudbound's” Dee Rees — were numerous.
Female auteurs, showrunners, and producers, meanwhile, are all over the Globes television noms. Hollywood Foreign Press Association voters solidified Frankie Shaw's status as a major comer to watch, landing a comedy series nom and lead comedy actor bid for “SMILF,” the Showtime series that they created, directs and stars in. Two of Shaw's fellow contenders in the comedy actor race — Pamela Adlon (FX's “Better Things”) and Issa Rae (HBO's “Insecure”) — are also creator/stars of their own vehicles.
“It certainly does give rise to the idea that this is the year of the woman in popular media,” Leonard Maltin, film critic and historian, told Variety. From “Lady Bird” to “I, Tonya” to “The Post,” the portrayals of women tackling existential crises largely on their own steam, with grace and grit, made for a strong crop that bucked convention.
” ‘The Post' is essentially a coming of age story — but a coming of age story for a mature woman, which is most unusual,” Maltin said. At the other end of the scale, “Lady Bird” adds up to “a modest movie that is exceptionally well done” particularly for a directorial debut, Maltin said. “Greta Gerwig has obviously had their eyes and ears wide open as she's been making films. To create a film that is so empathetic and believable, relatable and poignant is no small achievement.”
The comedy series race features two female showrunners — Amy Sherman-Palladino at the helm of Amazon's “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” with Dan Palladino — and Shaw of “SMILF.” Among drama series, only “This Is Us” has a female showrunner, Elizabeth Berger who steers the NBC hit with Isaac Aptaker. Drama series nominees “The Crown” and “The Handmaid's Tale” revolve squarely around themes of women, power, privilege, and sexism.
The top TV nominee in the Globes race this year is HBO's “Big Little Lies,” the extraordinary assemblage of talent pulled together by Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman out of frustration at the lack of meaty film roles.
The wealth of work for seasoned stars in TV is on display with the six noms for “Big Little Lies” as well as the four bestowed on FX's “Feud: Bette and Joan.” “Feud's” Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange will once again face off against Witherspoon and Kidman for golden hardware in the lead limited series actor field. Jessica Biel is also a contender in this starry crowd for their career re-defining role as a murderer in the USA Network's “The Sinner.”

We're looking at the future, and at the risk of appearing “archaic” in my thinking, the outlook is bleak!
Retail will become an anachronism. As will the workforce.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (Network Indiana): Indiana may be on the verge of declaring an official state insect, after years of lobbying by elementary school students.
Kayla Xu's teacher says Kayla asked them three years ago why Indiana didn't have a state insect — all but three states do. That question led to research on Say's firefly, and a classwide civics lesson in how to get the bill passed which now covers six grade levels across several West Lafayette schools.
Kayla, now 10 years old, led off a parade of a dozen West Lafayette pupils making their pitch for the firefly before the Senate Public Policy Committee. They quote a Purdue entomologist who describes the firefly as “the Paul Revere of the insect world.” Pioneer farmers would see the flies glowing and take it as a signal to check their crops for pests.
The committee unanimously endorsed the measure. The full Senate will vote next week.
Say's firefly is named for New Harmony entomologist Thomas Say, who identified it nearly 200 years ago. Governor Holcomb announced last fall he'd make the firefly part of their 2018 legislative agenda. They followed up with a plug in their State of the State address.
On the first day of its annual conference, IBM unveiled what is literally the world's smallest computer and it is way smaller than you think.
With computing power equivalent to that of an x86 chip from 1990, it may not be close to being the most powerful chip out there today, but IBM intends it to be the data source for blockchain-based applications. According to a blog post by IBM on its research handle, the "world's smallest computer" comprises of a million transistors and is an outcome of the company's "Crypto Anchor" program.
As explained by IBM, cryptographic anchors enable blockchain to be used in physical products such as a box of chocolates or a bottle of wine. These crypto anchors essentially work as secure digital watermarks to make product counterfeits a thing of the past.
Apart from being incredibly small, IBM intends to make manufacturing these tiny computers cost as low as 10 cents which is under Rs 10. With production costs estimated to be as low as IBM claims, the goal of being able to achieve its widespread adoption should not be too difficult.
According to Arvind Krishna, the head of research for IBM, the onset of crypto anchors are just the beginning.
"Within the next five years, cryptographic anchors — such as ink dots or tiny computers smaller than a grain of salt — will be embedded in everyday objects and devices," they said.
While the computer in itself is only a research project as of now, it is something that IBM believes to be one of its five predictions of turns technology will take in the next five years. Hence it is likely that we see mass production of the world's smallest computer soon.
It is not every day that a great chef at a world-renowned restaurant, who is the creator of a floating green apple taffy balloon filled with helium, gives it all up to rediscover and reinvent himself.
Chef Mike Bagale, former Executive Chef at Alinea, the only three-star Michelin restaurant in Chicago, recently resigned, “in order to travel, explore the world, learn about different food cultures and discover new ingredients.” Their recent pop-up at Masque, Mumbai in collaboration with Chef Prateek Sadhu, where they explored raw and fine ingredients, is one such activity which excites Chef Mike, and they would rather do many more of these.
They confess, “I want to inspire myself again through cooking. I have been cooking for the last two decades and now want to learn and discover new ingredients, find new inspirations, travel, collaborate with talented chefs from around the world and reinvent my cooking.”
Mike recognised their passion for the culinary arts in their mid-20s and cooked to bring pleasure to guests and freely express their creativity. From thereon began a unique journey, until recently when they decided to follow their heart. Great chefs are not always born and nurtured in culinary schools. Mike Bagale certainly proves that. After quitting film school in Toronto, where they were studying, they joined Four Seasons in West Palm Beach and in a short span, grew to the coveted post of Executive Chef. Next came Alinea in 2009, which is founded by Chef Grant Achatz.
Mike is happy to have learnt on the job.  They are entirely self-taught. Experimenting with ingredients and cooking techniques and bettering their skills owing to their deep-seated passion for cooking has been their mantra.
Alinea was a life-changing experience for him. They admit, “My tenure at Alinea taught me to be disciplined, dedicated and driven to excel. Each and every team member there is passionate, and after working with them, I have learnt that with hard work and commitment, the results are extremely rewarding.”
Collaborating with Chef Prateek Sadhu, who has worked at Alinea too, seemed the logical thing to do as they both share a similar philosophy towards food and ingredients. At the pop-up at Masque, Chef Mike created food that displayed their techniques and passion, yet paid homage to the Himalayas.
To craft the menu for this unique culinary collaboration, Chef Bagale began with a trip to the Himalayas with Chef Sadhu, who took them foraging for fresh produce from Kashmir to create a menu that revolves around the season. In keeping with Masque's quest for using products in their prime state of taste and nutrition, the duo returned with the freshest apricots, plums, peaches and other seasonal produce to craft a one-of-a-kind culinary experience.
The menu included teas, herbs, botanicals, mushrooms, Himalayan sea salts, fresh turmeric and much more. Ayurveda added a lightness and additional dimension to the dining experience. They elaborate, “Diners were served food made with ingredients that they had seen, and some which were new to them. Yet, all of these were presented in an innovative way. Though the flavour profiles of some dishes might have been familiar, the experience was intended to be unique.”
From edible balloons to abstract dessert paintings, Chef Mike Bagale has done them all. They seek inspiration for their dishes from things around him. “Life in general inspires me. I am inspired by art, colour, texture and travel. When creating a dish, I try to represent food in an artistic way, but without abusing the ingredients. The edible balloon is a great example of how two simple ingredients — apple and sugar — can be presented in a delicious, creative way, while being respectful to the ingredients.”
As someone keen to learn and absorb, Chef Bagale says, “This culinary collaboration has been extremely educational and we both were excited to learn from each other and share cultures, ideas and experiences.”
Apart from wanting to collaborate and learn, coming to India was the chief attraction for Mike. “India has always fascinated me — the spices, colours, ingredients. So I was delighted to be a part of this culinary collaboration. Personally, I am always seeking unique and educational experiences as I believe they are very beneficial to me and to the community as a whole,” they reveal.
Ingredients are always the hero in a dish, as far as Chef Mike is concerned. Naturally then, when in Mexico and Japan, they are drawn to soy, seaweeds and vinegar. They add, “The ingredients in India are very different from Europe and America. In fact, on this trip I have discovered over five ingredients that I have never used or seen before, and this really excites me. I cannot wait to experiment with them in my kitchen.”
Among other things in India, Mike has taken to Indian breads, especially the puri. “I absolutely love puris, for their flavour and texture. They perfectly compliment the cuisine,” they quip animatedly.
“I have a thing for breads. In fact, it was my love for bread and butter that got me interested in cooking at the age of 10,” they reminisce. At home, Mike enjoys South American, Japanese and Asian food. “I love everything from the Pacific too, so seafood, fruits, chillies, fresh vegetables — it really is a broad mix,” they state.
For the moment, they are happy playing around with the season's culinary sensations in India. And it is this relentless drive to excel and constantly be inventive that keeps Chef Mike Bagale going.
Dubai: Rio Olympic silver medallist shuttler PV Sindhu will begin their campaign against lower ranked Hi Bingjiao of China in the women's singles event of the season-ending Dubai Super Series Finals starting on Wednesday.
World No 3 Sindhu has been clubbed along with No 2 ranked Akane Yamaguchi of Japan, Sayako Sato (world number 15), also of Japan, and Bingjiao (world number nine) in Group A.
All the four players will meet each other in a round-robin format.
The other group has World No 1 Tai Tzu Ying of Chinese Taipei, Sung Ji Hyun of Korea (world number 5), Ratchanok Intanon (world number 6) of Thailand and Chen Yufei (world number 8) of China.
Olympic gold medallist Carolina Marin of Spain and world champion Nozomi Okuhara have withdrawn from the elite competition.
Sindhu is going into the tournament with a lot of confidence having clinched the India Open Super Series and Korea Open Super Series, besides bagging the silver at Glasgow World Championship and finishing runners-up at Hong Kong Open this season.
Meanwhile, Kidambi Srikanth has been placed in Group B of men's singles event along with World No 1 Vicktor Axelsen of Denmark, Chou Tien Chen (world number 7) and Shi Yuqi (world number 8).
Srikanth will be up against Axelsen in first match of the tournament on Wednesday.
Srikanth has also been at the peak of their powers this season as they became the only Indian, and the fourth player ever, to win four Super Series titles in a calendar year.
They won the Indonesia Open, Australia Open, Denmark Open and French Open before they were forced to miss the China Open and Hong Kong Open owing to a thigh muscle strain, which they had sustained at the Nationals in Nagpur last month.

California's utilities are “public monopolies” that are given a legislated profit. They are allowed to be monopolies in return for benefiting the public. San Diego Gas and Electric wants ratepayers to pay for its negligence in regards to wildfires.

Pacific Gas and Electric wants ratepayers to cover the cost of a settlement for its 2010 pipeline explosion.
Ayush Gupta (@gptayu), a Twitter user with a modest 100 plus follows, tagged Narendra Modi saying they travelled to Nainital, a hill station, this summer. Modi's handle retweeted the young man's photo looking out a window towards the mountains and that got 6000 likes, more than 1200 retweets and 120 replies. A few months ago, Modi's handle retweeted a wedding invitation from Akash Jain (@akash207) that plugged for Swachh Bharat or Clean India movement that Modi began when they swept to power. Jain became an instant celebrity, the Modi retweet is still their pinned post and has 9500 likes.
When Modi and Trump meet, it will be more than a first face-to-face between leaders of the world's two largest democracies, it marks the coming together of the world's 2 leading social media champs with a combined Twitter base of 63 million follows; two men who have smashed political campaigning (and victory) dogmas riding on the heady network effects of free media.
The Indian PM has 30.7 million followers on their @narendramodi handle, started 2009; they follow a little over 1700 people. Modi has a sub handle for their personal website @narendramodi_in which has a 1.17 m base as of June 14. There's also @PMOIndia and a sub handle for the Narendra Modi app which crowdsources inputs for Modi's radio address, provides an infographics blast with with an official seal and offers content in more languages than any newspaper does.
Trump is at 32.2 million on their personal handle @realDonaldTrump and like Modi, Trump's handle is also 2009 vintage. Trump follows 45 people, mostly family, White House coterie and many of their own gold plated properties. They have a running list of people they keep blocking.
The mathematical underpinning of social networks tells us that Modi and Trump constitute important ‘vertices' - defined as those with high number of connections, the clout of links between communities emerging from that network. Chances of their connecting on social networks remain high — Trump is known to hand out cellphone numbers, there's no telling why they may not choose to follow Modi. Once that happens, it becomes the shortest path - the “between centrality” of two influential vertices - adding potential snowball effects to their following.
All that of course, is in the realm of academic interest.
In practise however, Modi and Trump are stark contrasts in how they utilise free media but they have amassed phenomenal following, proving that both coarseness and extreme curation work equally well to merit social media dominance.
Modi came to Twitter at a time when petitioning political rulers, newspaper editors and bureaucrats was still a shot in the dark at best. Ditto for US President Donald Trump. The year was 2009 and even as Twitter became a force multipleir in public and political communication, sceptics continued to believe that for the tease of access to truly matter, politicians had to change behaviour. Trump has made no effort to tuck away their bumper-sticker subtlety and depth for a more considered tone, they are still President and piling on Twitter follows at a brisk pace as controversies continue to dog him.
Trump's cash burn on the election campaign was the lowest and contrary to popular opinion, Clinton's seemingly better ground game did not give them a win. It is said that in close elections, social media may make that razor think difference. For Trump, it clearly paid off, It's not helping them govern, though.
In Modi's case, there's no unhinged tweeting at 3 am. Within their social media teams, there's no ambiguity on the no-go areas because the PM themselves is a sophisticated user of these platforms. On their narendramodi_in handle, for instance, you won't find a shred of politics or even the mention of their party name BJP.
Contrast that with how Trump was monitored during the Comey testimony so that they do not reach into their pocket and fire tweets before the lawyer weighed in. It was one of the only times in the last year that Trump did not tweet when the news cycle was at it juiciest. For Trump, political brinksmanship, insulting, name calling is all par for the course on their social handles.
While the #ModiTrump differences are stark, the social media success of both politicos is striking too.
It's crucial to note here that the tech specs in both countries are worlds apart.
In the US, at least 7 in 10 adults get their news on a mobile device, 4 in 10 Americans get their news online, the mobile industry is gearing up for the next generation of wireless technology, “5G”, many service providers have already rolled out 5G wifi in homes and offices across the country. In India, 4G is a thing only now, wifi in public spaces is still nascent and rural mobile connectivity is thin.
For sheer size of network though, there are few social media equals to a Trump Modi combine.
Few citizens will ever get real ‘social' access to political leaders who are big on ‘social' media, yet the delicious thought that it just might happen remains mouthwatering.

KARACHI - The second day of the three-day Pakistan Women Festival was opened by the seminar of first Pakistani female Architecture Yasmeen Lari. They spoke at length on ‘Creating sustainable economic independence for women in Pakistan.'
Lari was awarded with the Sitara-e-Imtiaz by the government of Pakistan in recognition of their services to the architecture profession and to heritage conversation of historical site in Pakistan. The inspiring and enlightening speech illustrated with a slide presentation kept the audience spellbound.
“I came up with a bamboo shelter system which had low carbon footprints. I have built nearly 2,000 sustainable shelter units, which help to promote and propagate the lives of people in Pakistan. When earthquake hit in 2005 I decided to come up with a bamboo shelter system,” they said.
About Pakistan heritage they were of the view “To document and conserve the traditional and historical build environment of Pakistan we must create awareness among the people. Government has funds to spend on many other things but when it comes to invest heritage it is often neglected. We should preserve our historical places so that our youth should get awareness about our history. Their preservation demonstrates recognition of the necessity of the past and of the things that tell its story,” they said.
“When flood came in 2010 it affected 20 million people in Pakistan and their houses were destroyed. At that time I decided to build new safe waterproof homes for them with a bamboo shelter system,” they added.
A panel discussion on the same subject was the next segment. The panellists included renowned names such as Salwa Habib, Roshahneh Zafar and Gul Afreedi and Shaiyanne Malik did the moderation.
Before the end of the discussion, the moderator took some questions from the audience which added value to the discussion that had just taken place.
After the panel discussion, an awards ceremony was held to honour five of those women who have voluntarily or involuntarily helped Pakistan achieve any one of UN's Sustainable Development 16 goals for the years 2015-2030. The five award recipients were introduced individually and visual presentations shown of their work before they were invited on stage by the host.
‘Clean water and sanitation' award went to Seemi Kamal for their extensive work in social development in Pakistan through their organization ‘Raasta'. For the category of ‘Affordable and clean energy' the award went to Fiza Farhan, CEO of Buksh Foundation and Director of Buksh Energy Private Limited, both companies pioneering unique and demand based multi-stakeholder solutions in the domains of gender equality, inclusive growth, renewable energy and impact investment.
Roshaneh Zafar was given the award for ‘Decent Work and economic growth' for their outstanding work through Kashf foundation, a wealth management company for women from low-income households.
‘Industry, innovation and Infrastructure' was given to Ms Bano Bhimjee, the veteran owner of one of the leading women undergarments company in Pakistan, IFG, and ‘Sustainable cities and communities' award was presented to Ms Yasmeen Lari for extensive work through their organization Heritage Foundation.
After a short break women health seminar was also held. The first session was all about the ‘Humanistic Therapy versus psychiatric treatment.' The second panel discussion was on the subject of ‘Allopathic medicine versus alternative treatments'.
The seminars on women health were extremely enlightening and were appreciated by all the attendees. People from all walks of life attended the seminars and appreciated the panellists.

The Chicago Blackhawks had a rather unsuccessful 2017-18 season, but the same can't be said for their American Hockey League affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs. They had a record of 40-28-4 in the regular season and swept the Chicago Wolves and Manitoba Moose in the first two rounds of the Calder Cup Playoffs before falling to the Texas Stars, 4-2, in the third round. Their recent success has caught the attention of many Hawks fans.
There are plenty of great prospects on the IceHogs, but some stand out more than others and have a good chance of making the big club next season. Players like John Hayden, Matthew Highmore, and David Kampf will not be mentioned due to their prior experience in the NHL.
Anthony Louis
Although they didn't score a goal during their playoff run, Louis tallied 14 goals and 30 assists in 70 games during the regular season. Prior to their AHL debut, Blackhawk Up dubbed them as “the team's most exciting prospect.” He's well-known for their speed and puck control, two skills that can't go unnoticed in the ever-changing league. They also use their small stature (5-foot-7, 151 pounds) to get past larger players. Their skills seem to echo the Hawks' breakout rookie from last season, Alex DeBrincat.
There is no word on what their fate is for next season, but there is no doubt they will be seen in a Hawks sweater sooner rather than later.
Darren Raddysh
It's no secret that the Hawks need help on the blue line, and Raddysh could definitely help. The Hawks agreed to terms with them recently, and they should be in the lineup for the 2018-19 season. They recorded five goals and 17 assists in their 66 games with the IceHogs in the 2017-18 season. Prior to signing with the Blackhawks organization, they made a name for themselves in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) by being named the defensive player of the year when they played for the Erie Otters.
During their time with the Otters, they also showed chemistry with DeBrincat that will hopefully come out on NHL ice.  They are also noted to be more of a two-way defenseman, which the Hawks definitely need.
Collin Delia
Although they made their NHL debut late in the 2017-18 season, they are still considered a prospect. They shined in the 2018 Calder Cup Playoffs as the goaltender for the IceHogs with 10 starts, seven wins, and three losses. The Hawks are in desperate need of a reliable backup goaltender next season, and Delia could be a top candidate. After a hectic 2017-18 season where they played for multiple leagues and teams, Delia is starting to prove themselves as an NHL level goaltender. Only time will tell what the Hawks will do in goal, but Delia's future is looking bright.
Chris DiDomenico
The oldest of the prospects, Chris DiDomenico, played for three different teams this season before arriving in Rockford, including the Ottawa Senators. The IceHogs seems to be where they belong, where they scored eight goals and 15 assists in 22 games. They led the IceHogs in the playoffs with seven goals and 11 assists in 13 games.
DiDomenico has played at the NHL level before and is truly starting to show their potential as an NHL player. Signing them onto the Hawks would be taking a chance, but if they continue on the path they were on during the playoffs, it would be one worth taking.
Tyler Sikura
In their 74 games with the IceHogs this season, Tyler Sikura tallied 23 goals and 15 assists in 74 games. They added five goals and one assist during the playoffs. Their numbers from this last year and beyond are impressive, and show that they can be a great addition to the Hawks in the future. Prior to their time with the IceHogs, they have played for various AHL teams such as the Springfield Falcons, Portland Pirates, and Iowa Wild. Their younger brother, Dylan Sikura, plays for the Hawks and made their NHL debut late in the 2017-18 season.

The Latest on the settlement between the company formerly known as Yahoo and government regulators over a huge 2014 data breach (all times local):
4 p.m.
Prosecutors say two Russian intelligence agents, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, used information they stole from Yahoo to spy on Russian journalists, U.S. and Russian government officials and employees of financial services and other private businesses.
A U.S. judge in San Francisco on Tuesday, meanwhile, pushed back a sentencing hearing for a 23-year-old Canadian man, Karim Baratov, who prosecutors say was hired by Dokuchaev to breach at least 80 email accounts obtained from the massive Yahoo hack.
Judge Vince Chhabria questioned whether the sentence of seven years and 10 months that prosecutors were seeking for Baratov was longer than what other hackers had received for similar crimes.
Baratov's attorneys have called for a sentence of three years and nine months.
___
2:15 p.m.
The company formerly known as Yahoo is paying a $35 million fine to resolve federal regulators' charges that the online pioneer deceived investors by failing to disclose one of the biggest data breaches in internet history.
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the action Tuesday against the company, which is now called Altaba after its email and other digital services were sold to Verizon Communications for $4.48 billion last year. The Sunnyvale, California-based company, which is no longer publicly traded, neither admitted nor denied the allegations but did agree to refrain from further violations of securities laws.
Personal data was stolen from hundreds of millions of Yahoo users in the December 2014 breach attributed to Russian hackers. The SEC alleged that, although Yahoo senior managers and attorneys were told about the breach, the company failed to fully investigate. The breach wasn't disclosed to the investing public until more than two years later, when Yahoo was working on closing Verizon's acquisition of its operating business in 2016, the SEC said.
"Yahoo's failure to have controls and procedures in place to assess its cyber disclosure obligations ended up leaving its investors totally in the dark about a massive data breach," Jina Choi, director of the SEC's San Francisco regional office, said in a statement.
Los Angeles: Zlatan Ibrahimovic returned from a one-game suspension to score two goals Wednesday, but it was too little too late as their Los Angeles Galaxy fell 3-2 at home to FC Dallas.
The Galaxy had won two games in a row and hoped to continue the trend when they welcomed back Ibrahimovic, who sat out a match after receiving a red card for slapping Montreal's Michael Petrasso on 21 May.
But FC Dallas, solidifying their status as Major League Soccer Western Conference contenders, had the game well in hand by the time Ibrahimovic broke through.
Ryan Hollingshead scored their first goal of the season in the 33rd minute as they finished off a crisp sequence by FC Dallas.
Hollingshead then set up the visitors' second goal, their cross from the left headed in by Cristian Colman shortly before halftime.
After Ibrahimovic had a goal waved off for offside just after the hour mark, the Galaxy saw two chances off of corner kicks go begging.
Dallas seized a 3-0 lead in the 66th minute after Michael Barrios' shot forced a one-handed save from Galaxy goalkeeper David Bingham and Carlos Gruezo to headed home the rebound.
Ibrahimovic, the former Manchester United and Sweden striker who made a dramatic arrival in MLS in March, produced the Galaxy's first goal in the 69th, and the hosts gained an edge when Colman was sent off in the 80th.
Ibrahimovic took advantage with a goal in second-half stoppage time, but the rally would go no further.
It was another disappointing home defeat for the Galaxy, who have lost more matches at StubHub Center than they have won.
Dallas, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten run to five games and on 23 points are two points behind Western Conference leaders Kansas City.
Grappling with issues that are more ‘entrenched in the mind' than the inherent talent and skill, the Indian hockey team will open its Hockey World League Semi-finals campaign against Scotland at the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre in London. It was at this venue that India achieved both an agonising low and a soul-lifting high.
In the 2012 London Olympics, India finished 12th — last among the participating nations. Then at the 2016 FIH Champions Trophy, they picked up a silver; arguably their highest podium finish since the 1980 Moscow Olympics where the national team won a gold. National coach Roelant Oltmans has already said that in 2017 and 2018 they expect the Indian hockey team to make a mark on the world stage once again by breaking into the top four. In other words, consistency has to be the calling card for the national team that surely aims to be on the podium, both at the World Hockey League final (December, 2017) and then at the World Cup finals (December, 2018), both hosted by the state government of Odisha in Bhubaneshwar.
On the face of it, Scotland doesn't seem to be much of a challenge but it's in their part of the world that they usually come good. However, hockey statisticians would readily point to India's all-win record against Scotland. BG Joshi, hockey statistician, says that India has played five times against the Scots, winning all of them and scoring 22 goals in the process. In their last encounter at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014, India won 6-2. Numbers don't lie. But neither do they touch the psychological pulse of a team correctly.
In the recent Sultan Azlan Shah Hockey Tournament, Great Britain (GB) won the trophy beating top seeds Australia in the final. And Alan Forsyth, the Scot playing for GB who starred with four goals in the tournament, will try and make an early impression in the tournament against India. Scotland knows that a good result against India will open the pool up, giving them a psychological advantage against teams like Canada and Pakistan. Gordon McIntyre, the midfielder, has played for Scotland 75 times and five times for GB. An admirer of Andy Murray, their tenacious play in the midfield should bother the Indian defence. Chris Grassick is the third Scot to have played for Britain, and was in the squad that played the 2016 Rio Olympics. They have played 91 times for Scotland and 19 for GB, scoring four goals for the latter, and will lead the team against India.
India turned up in London after playing a Three-Nation Invitation in Dusseldorf. They beat Belgium 3-2 and lost 1-2 while against Germany they drew 2-2 and then lost the last match 0-2. Training matches are good in bringing back the focus before a team embarks on a competition where results matter, which in turn then lifts the world ranking. India, at the stage, apart from reaching the podium, needs good results as a top-four world ranking also helps them get a better pool at the World League Final and the 2018 World Cup finals.
In India's Pool B, the other teams are Netherlands (4), Canada (10), Pakistan (13) and Scotland (23). The Dutch are the highest-ranked and along with Pakistan, in the overall tally of matches, the Indians have a losing record against them. Never before, in the last three decades of international hockey have teams been so even, at least the ones in the top eight. England, after the Rio collapse, are finding their feet and many do hope that it might be an India-England final. But as said, earlier, many of India's best and worst results have come from fissures in their mind, rather than the lack of artistry in their wrists or the power in their penalty corner flicks.
Without their goalkeeper and captain, P Sreejesh, who is healing an injury sustained in the Azlan Shah, India will be under tremendous pressure at the back. But it's a great opportunity for Akash Chikte and Vikas Dahiya to lay a claim to being the second-best goalkeeper in the country. Chikte, though, should fancy themselves as being the under-study to Sreejesh. In the 2016 Asian Champions Trophy, Chikte played the final against Pakistan when Sreejesh had an injury. India won 3-2 with Chikte making some brilliant saves in the 3rd quarter when Pakistan were pushing India back into their own territory.
Rupinder Pal Singh's unavailability due to a pulled hamstring is a setback since they are a player on the rise and someone who was coming of age with their speed and accuracy in penalty corners. S Uthappa's exit due to a family emergency will create an issue in the rolling substitution but India with a decent set of forwards should be able to cope. Uthappa has been replaced with Sumit, a core member of the 2016 Junior World Cup winning team but also a player who showed class and maturity at the recent Azlan Shah. Their ball skills and vision that creates corridors of play even in tightly-bound defences is a reason to feel excited about the youngster. The Indian coach does gush about Sumit. “I agree they are very exciting but needs that experience to find their feet at the senior level,” says Oltmans. “I know they played very well at the Azlan and looking forward to the Tokyo Olympics, they are one of the players we have a lot of hope from.”
Rupinder's replacement is Jasjit Singh Kular, who is a part of the 33-member core group that trained in SAI Bengaluru. With 46 international matches against their name, Kular should use this opportunity and increase their tally of five goals as a penalty corner flicker. Losing two key players is not a setback for Oltmans anymore. “With a core group who have been working together since 2017, February year, we have several options and I don't see this as a setback for us at all.” Oltmans does agree that Rupinder is an important player in the structure that they are looking to create before the Finals in December. “But injuries are a part of the sport and we have to cope with it.”
But Oltmans will be keenly watching the poaching skills of Ramandeep Singh, Mandeep Singh, Talwinder Singh, SV Sunil and Akashdeep Singh. This is the set of forwards that should be playing the next two years looking to be a part of the team flying to Tokyo for the 2020 Olympics. And as Oltmans said, after the loss to Malaysia in the Azlan Shah that deprived India of playing the final, “Goals are needed from the forwards and if India wants to raise itself onto the podium, the forwards will have to deliver.”
Mandeep had a hat-trick against Japan in the Azlan and for almost four years has been the 'Kid on the Block'. It's time those stats of 28 goals in 67 matches increase to proclaim the fact that they are ready to be on that road where former Indian greats have walked. Mandeep and Ramandeep are the pure strikers with Akashdeep creating the chances as the inside forward while Sunil's sprint takes care of the defence and keeps them rattled.
It's that release inside the opposition striking circle from Sunil that gets to be so crucial when defenders swarm around Indian forwards, and even an inch of space can be the difference between scoring and missing. If one speaks of Mandeep as a player whose time has come to deliver, then stronger words need to be used for Ramandeep who can shrug off the tag of an Oltmans favourite should they rise to form and sustain it. Thus making into the team has not always depended on their prowess in front of goal.
Oltmans also leans on stats to explain their view point on goals and forwards. “I don't care who scores,” they say. “Just score those three goals.” And then they explain further. “In terms of stats, the team that scores three goals wins 90 percent of the matches.”
It's been a treacherous ride since the high of the 1960s, 1970s and to some extent even the 1980s. Strategies, tactics do stand out. Stats can be impressive when looked at in totality. But matches are sometimes won in stand-out moments, in those seconds of inspirational skills and moves that can lift a team to the podium and make them believe in themselves. Hopefully, India can dazzle with skills and frustrate opponents with grit.
Plans to bring Tinie Tempah to Hartlepool for a gig at the end of next month look uncertain after promoters were given extra time to provide vital information to police and the council.
The grime superstar is set to headline a show at Jacksons Landing on Sunday, July 30, as part of Marina Live.
Former Jackson Landing site.
But a licensing committee meeting at Hartlepool Civic Centre heard vital information on the organisation of the show had not been received and efforts by the borough council's Commercial Services Team and Cleveland Police to contact the promoters had been unsuccessful.
The event has been organised by Phresh Creative Management, led by local entrepreneur Junior Masandi, and Joe Franks of The Open Jar bar at the Marina, in partnership with Capital Radio and Hartlepool Borough Council.
The committee heard Mr Franks had been e-mailed about the arrangements for the show but had not responded.
The authority was still awaiting risk assessments, traffic and crowd management plans, and details of what would happen in the event of extreme weather or if the site had to be evacuated.
Everything hinges on the event plan, and we have not received that yet. Sgt Paul Higgins
Sylvia Pinkney, of the Commercial Services Team, said: “The applicant has failed to meet the deadline set.”
Sgt Paul Higgins, of Cleveland Police: “Everything hinges on the event plan, and we have not received that yet.”
Junior Masandi told the committee there had been a problem with the contact details on the application: “There is a mistake, Joe's contact details being on there,” they said.
“All that should have come to me and I would have managed it.”
They had appointed Matt Simpson, of specialist firm In-House Events, to handle the organisation.
“I am very selective who I work with,” said Mr Masandi.
“It is everybody's reputation on the line, so I want to have the best people involved. Matt is the best person for me to work with.”
Matt Simpson told the committee work on the plans was now under way and the documentation would be ready by June 23. It would then have to be reviewed by the police event planning team and the council.
Mr Masandi told the committee they were keen to push ahead, as the agreement with Capital Radio to promote the show could not go ahead until the license was in place.
They were challenged by chairperson Coun Rob Cook, who said: “I have serious concerns that we are in a Catch 22 situation, that unless you get the go-ahead today, it won't go ahead,” but replied : “No, that is not what I am saying.”
Councillors agreed to adjourn the decision to Monday, July 7.
CHANDLER, Ariz. – An Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history was charged Friday with manufacturing armour-piercing bullets, according to court documents.
Unfired armour-piercing bullets found inside the Las Vegas hotel room where Stephen Paddock launched the attack on Oct. 1 contained the fingerprints of ammunition dealer Douglas Haig, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Phoenix. It says Haig didn't have a license to manufacture armour-piercing ammunition.
The documents don't say if the ammunition was used in the attack. Haig was charged 35 minutes before holding a news conference where they said they didn't notice anything suspicious when they sold 720 rounds of ammunition to Paddock in the weeks before the massacre that left 58 people dead.
Haig told investigators that when Paddock bought the ammunition at their home in suburban Phoenix, Paddock went to their car to get gloves and put them on before taking the box from Haig, the complaint said.
“I had no contribution to what Paddock did,” Haig told reporters earlier Friday, adding that there was nothing unusual about the type or quantity of ammunition the shooter bought. “I had no way to see into their mind.”
A phone message left Friday afternoon for Haig's attorney, Marc Victor, wasn't immediately returned.

The two armour-piercing bullets found inside Paddock's hotel room with Haig's fingerprints had an “incendiary capsule” on their noses, the documents said. A forensic analysis of those two bullets had tool marks consistent with the equipment in Haig's backyard workshop, according to the complaint.
It also alleges that FBI agents searching Haig's home on Oct. 19 found armour-piercing ammunition.
Haig, a 55-year-old aerospace engineer who sold ammunition as a hobby for about 25 years, said they met Paddock at a Phoenix gun show in the weeks before the shooting and that they were well-dressed and polite.
They didn't have the quantity of tracer ammunition on hand that Paddock was seeking, so Paddock contacted them several days later and lined up a sale at Haig's home. Tracer bullets contain a pyrotechnic charge that illuminates the path of fired bullets so shooters can see whether their aim is correct.
Haig said they were shocked and sickened when a federal agent informed them of the massacre 11 hours after it unfolded.
Haig's lawyer said they held the news conference in a bid to protect their reputation after they were revealed earlier this week to be a “person of interest” in the investigation. Haig's identity emerged by mistake after their name was not redacted in court documents.
A law enforcement official previously told The Associated Press that investigators don't believe Haig had any involvement or knowledge of the planned attack when they sold ammunition to Paddock. The official wasn't authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Haig arose in the investigation when a box with their name and address was found in the Mandalay Bay hotel suite where Paddock opened fire on a music festival below.
They gave the box to Paddock to carry the 720 rounds of tracer ammunition from the sale.
Haig said Paddock told them that “he was going to go out to the desert to put on a light show, either with or for their friends. I can't remember whether they used the word ‘with' or ‘for.' But they said that they were going out at night to shoot it with friends.”
Haig, who has closed their ammunition business, said they have received unwanted media attention and death threats since their name was released.
The Las Vegas Police Department and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives declined to comment when contacted earlier Friday.
The FBI and U.S. attorney's office in Nevada have not responded to emails seeking comment.

New York just made college free. And if this new Senate bill becomes law, free college will go national.
But free isn't free — this plan would cost a lot of money.
We're talking about the bill Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced a bill last week, which would abolish tuition and fees at public four-year colleges and universities for students from households making $125,000 or less per year, and would make community college tuition-free for students from all income levels.
It's very similar to the law that just passed in New York. The Senate bill has numerous co-sponsors in both the Senate and House, according to Mic — all Democrats except for Sanders, an independent.

Sanders made free higher education a cornerstone of their presidential campaign, helping them get to a 54% favorability rating among 18- to 29-year-olds, according to a Harvard poll.
Introducing the bill in a press conference, Sanders said the U.S. is falling behind as a world leader in educating young people.
“Our job — if we are smart — is to make it easier for people to get the education they need, not harder,” Sanders said. “The United States not so many years ago in terms of the percentage of young people who graduated from college — we were number one. Today we are in eleventh place. … That is not a prescription for a strong American economy of the future. It is a prescription for failure, and together we are going to change that.”
The U.S. once led the world in the percentage of young college graduates. Today, we are in 11th place. That is unacceptable. #CollegeforAll — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) April 3, 2017
Sanders said the bill would also cut student loan interest rates in half by allowing Americans to refinance their debts “at the lowest interest rates possible” and triple funding for the Federal Work-Study program.
Over the next decade, the federal government is projected to make over $70 billion in profits off of student loan programs. #CollegeforAll — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) April 3, 2017
Sanders admitted that the plan is costly — and wants Wall Street to pay for it.
“Now, some people say that this legislation is expensive, and they're right. It is,” they said. “Well, I'll tell you how we're going to pay for it. We are going to ask Wall Street to end their speculation. We're going to put a speculation tax on Wall Street.”

The estimated cost of the program is $47 billion a year. That would cover, Sanders estimates, 67% of the $70 billion it costs for tuition at public colleges and universities. States, they propose, would cover the remaining 33%.
A “speculation tax” would charge those in trade markets for each bond, stock or derivative they sell. It's often referred to as a “Robin Hood tax.”
Some have praised Sanders for following through on proposals they advocated for as part of their presidential campaign in 2016.

Lol if Bernie sanders thinks that their free college bill is gonna pass I'd like to know what drugs he's on — Vinny The 🅱️ender (@Vinny_Giarmoleo) April 4, 2017
During their campaign, Senator Sanders said free college would be cheap. It costs more than our defense budget.https://t.co/Z1cgp2X6m1 — Euler (@doctoreuler) April 4, 2017
Sanders proposed the same legislation as Senate bill 1373 in 2015, without any co-sponsors.
It's not likely to pass or even be voted on this time around either, though, because both houses of Congress are controlled by Republicans, who don't support it.
BOSTON -- Chicago Bulls guard Dwyane Wade played with LeBron James long enough to know how overwhelming James can be on both ends of the floor. After watching Bulls All-Star swingman Jimmy Butler's monster performance against the Celtics on Sunday, they were ready to compare their current teammate to their old running mate on the Miami Heat.
Butler scored 30 points, grabbed nine rebounds, and also spent time guarding Celtics All-Star Isaiah Thomas in a Game 1 win.
Editor's Picks Celts expect Thomas to play Game 2 vs. Bulls The Celtics expect Isaiah Thomas to play in Game 2 against the Bulls before traveling home to be with their family after the death of their younger sister.
"I had the luxury of playing with a guy named LeBron." Wade said before Monday's practice. "And we did the same thing when we played -- to Derrick Rose. You have a point guard who guards them but when you need a guy who's longer, who's just as fast, and all those things, it helps. It gives them a different look, it kind of throws off things. You're not going to slow down Isaiah Thomas from getting the looks and getting opportunities. The guy can score as good as anybody in this game. But just to give them a different look, if you get their offense out a little further, if it takes a little bit more time off the clock, all those things help. It's good to be able to have a guy like that to say, 'get us 30, and then go guard the guy that's got 30.'"
Thomas finished the game with 33 points, but Butler was able to help keep them in check down the stretch, while also carrying the Bulls at times offensively. Wade knows that there are only a handful of players in the NBA who have that kind of ability.
"As I sit here, obviously Jimmy, Paul [George] Kawhi [Leonard], Draymond [Green] Bron," Wade said. "I'm sure I'm leaving somebody out. Avery Bradley's a great defender. He's not as tall as those guys, but he's a great defender. Patrick Beverley's a great defender. Obviously he's not guarding 4-men ... there are some guys that really get after it. We have the luxury of having one."

For their part, Butler tried to take the attention in stride. Their goal against Thomas is to set the tone early in the matchup, while keeping a body on the diminutive guard.
"Be physical," Butler said. "If I foul, I foul. Don't foul too many times. Challenge every shot. Contest everything at the rim. We all know what they do for that team and what he's done this year putting the ball in the basket. I think I can guard anybody. Especially if that's what my team needs me to do. However long it is, however many minutes, I'm out there to do that. This is what playoff basketball is about and you got to be ready."
Wade, who scored 11 points in Game 1, has been open about the fact they have to take a backseat to Butler's game. He's just hoping to help Butler out when they need a boost from their teammates.
"When I came here, in my [introductory] press conference, I said it was Jimmy Butler's team," Wade said. "And we'll ride Jimmy until we can't ride them any more. And then when they're ready to ride me, I'm ready. At this point in the year it's all about doing whatever it takes to win, and each game is different. You don't know what kind of defensive coverage they're going to throw at them [Tuesday]. So we all got to be prepared but, whatever it takes."
The state is proposing a new Michigan teacher retirement system, a plan that has Northern Michigan public schools concerned.
Governor Snyder and legislative leaders agreed on a proposal to reform the retirement plan into more of a 401k plan instead of a pension.
Currently teachers starting before 2010 have had a pension plan, while teachers starting after 2010 have had a choice between a 401k and a hybrid pension plan.
9&10's Taylor Jones looked into the latest proposal and spoke with educators.
The new proposal will give teachers the option to choose a new 401k plan or a new hybrid pension system.
But educators feel these more expensive options will drive away new teachers.
“It's just not as lucrative financially for a potential school employee that retires, and with that said, I can't see how this is going to be encouraging to new employees or new teachers to come into teaching,” says Joel Bronkema, principal of Mcbain High School.
Educators at McBain, concerned that a new 401k plan will shy away teachers.
“It will be four percent given by the school, then the employee can choose to have a three percent contribution on their own, which will then be matched,” says Bronkema.
Teachers could choose a new hybrid pension system, but the state plans to ask for a bigger contribution from school employees, driving them to choose the 401k plan.
But educators feel both options don't support retired teachers and a pension would, making it that much harder to find teachers.
“We already can't get substitute teachers and we can see us having a really hard time getting math teachers, science teachers, special education teachers that are already very difficult to employ and with not having more benefits and more opportunities,” says Bronkema.
The state feels this plan could save some money.
Teachers worry this plan could drive away new teachers.
“I think if you look at the public sector in general, I think that seems to be an easy target for legislators to take some money away. If it was going into education right now, I would probably be deterrent. I'd probably look more toward the private sector,” says Shawn Murphy, McBain high school teacher.
Legislative committees approved the bills steering newly-hired school employees into 401-k only retirement plans.
Those bills are being discussed in both the state house and senate.
Cyber threats have metastasized worldwide.
In the U.S., they have presented as security issues for critical infrastructure, such as industrial sites, and cast doubt on the integrity of crucial information technology systems used for elections –including many vulnerable voting machines themselves that are employed and managed at the state level.
Technological approaches to curbing or countering these cyber threats are proliferating, but they alone cannot offer adequate protection. What is needed is manpower: hundreds of thousands of information security professionals working in the private and public sectors to actively defend the cyber terrain on which America's national security, prosperity, and democracy depend.
Like many private companies and public agencies in the U.S., the Department of Defense struggles with a shortage of information security professionals. But RAND research suggests that the armed forces, and the nation more broadly, might already have some of the personnel resources it needs — in the ranks of its Reserves and National Guard.
RAND researchers studying the skills of personnel in the Army National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve in 2015 estimated, conservatively, that more than 100,000 of these men and women have some degree of cyber competence, including thousands with deep or midlevel cyber expertise.
Many of these soldiers, like their counterparts in the reserve components of other military services, perform information security functions in their civilian careers, often in high-tech sectors. Some are serving in newly created reserve component cyber formations.
A growing proportion of service members in the reserve components are also “digital natives” — part of the younger generations who grew up using a wide variety of technologies. Many want to leverage their tech skills as part of their military duties.
The Department of Defense — and individual states across the country — would do well to tap into this pool of trained, vetted, and often combat-experienced men and women available to extend the labor pool of information security professionals — personnel who could provide support to federal and state civilian authorities during times of crisis.
For example, the reserve component could be mobilized to help the Department of Homeland Security defend the industrial control systems of critical infrastructure experiencing an attack, especially the newest addition to the DHS list of critical infrastructure, the election system itself.
Other countries have begun to leverage civilian-acquired skills in their defense against cyber threats. In the wake of cyberattacks against its public and private Internet infrastructure in 2007, Estonia announced plans to develop the Estonian Defence League, a collection of volunteers—now numbering in the hundreds—who are prepared to help the country respond to emerging cyber crises and attacks.
The U.S. has different options for filling shortfalls in its arsenal of information security professionals. In March, for example, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AR) proposed the creation of a “cyber national guard” to attract talented civilians who do not want to serve in the military, but are willing to contribute to the nation's cyber defense.
The reserve components of the U.S. military are uniquely positioned to attract, train, and manage a cadre of information security professionals who are able to operate both with the active components of the U.S. armed forces and with civilian authorities. Innovative approaches to recruiting, tracking readiness, and career planning of these professionals will be required, and new models of reserve component participation and training might prove necessary.
There is every reason to believe that nefarious actors, including powerful nation-states, will continue to target critical infrastructure, the U.S. election system as a whole and information technology systems in general.
This threat to American democracy and cyber way of life demands hands-on attention to the underlying machines and devices. Mitigating this threat with human resources will require the cyber equivalent of boots on the ground. The state of Ohio has already tapped its National Guard to defend its election system from hackers.
Time is running out to build an adequate nationwide defense for the next presidential election cycle, but many of the necessary personnel resources are right here—in the form of the Guard and the Reserves that are ready and willing to be called up to perform the mission.
A meeting is planned between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the sidelines of a gathering of G20 foreign ministers in Germany, Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson said on Wednesday.
It will be the first time Lavrov meets their newly appointed counterpart and comes as U.S.-Russia relations are under particular scrutiny following the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to improve ties with the Kremlin.
"A meeting is planned and being worked out," Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson Maria Zakharova told journalists in a briefing.
Prospects for better relations with Washington have suffered setbacks since Trump's inauguration including the resignation on Monday of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was seen in Moscow as a leading advocate of softer U.S. policy on Russia.
Zakharova did not say what Lavrov and Tillerson planned to address in their meeting, but earlier comments from the foreign ministry suggested Syria would be a topic of discussion.
In the spring of 2013, Andy Avalos, then Boise State's defensive line coach, walked into what they thought was Salmon River High School.
"Excuse me, ma'am," Avalos said to the woman working the front desk. "Is this the high school? I'm looking for Leighton Vander Esch."
The woman began to laugh.
"This is K through 12. We only have one school here," they replied.
Roughly 150 miles north of Boise, where the Salmon River and the Little Salmon River converge, sits Riggins, Idaho. Population: 420.
The first student Avalos saw was a little girl who barely came up to their waist.
"Do you know Leighton Vander Esch?" they asked the little girl. "Is they a nice guy?"
"Oh, he's awesome," they said excitedly. "He's right down over there."
When you attend the same school as first-graders and you're a member of a graduating class of 11, it's a constant struggle to get recognized by college scouts. Even when you're the best player in every game of every sport you play.
"It wasn't even fair," Avalos told me with a laugh about Vander Esch's dominance.
Vander Esch led the Savages to state titles in basketball and football during their junior and senior seasons. During their senior season, they averaged over 11 rebounds and almost 30 points per game in basketball. In football, they threw 28 touchdowns and ran for another 34 scores. As a linebacker, they recorded 131 tackles with five interceptions, five fumble recoveries and four defensive touchdowns that year.
But it wasn't your everyday high school football. With so few students, Salmon River is unable to field an entire football team. So the school competes in eight-man football.
Friday night lights literally were supplied by the headlights of trucks that were parked in a row down both sidelines.
"It's a whole different world," Avalos told me of the eight-man football game.
"There was a lot of work to do, physically and mentally," Vander Esch told me after their pro day in Boise.
Maybe it was a reason that Boise State, even with everything Vander Esch accomplished, didn't offer them a scholarship. They were a preferred walk-on as a 190-pound linebacker in 2014, when they redshirted.
But Avalos, who added defensive coordinator to their title in 2016, believed growing up in a small town surrounded by multiple national forests was an advantage for Vander Esch. You hunt and you fish. Vander Esch's father, Darwin, hunts so often that he's been known to say if they go too long without killing something, they get on edge. It's a place that makes you humble and hungry. Accompanied by a toughness and a chip on your shoulder as big as the mountains that surround the town.
After a 2014 season in which they spent countless extra hours adjusting to 11-man football in the film room and on the practice field and added 30 pounds to their frame, Vander Esch still wasn't on scholarship. He'd make extra money in Riggins as a rafting guide.
But coaches saw how well they moved. They saw how fluid they were and understood that if they could concentrate on football, they were going to grow by leaps and bounds, mentally and physically.
Before the 2015 season, Boise State gave Vander Esch a scholarship, and they thrived. The transformation was so drastic that when the coaches were cutting up some practice film from 2014 before this season started and the new members of the staff were asked who the player was on the film, not one said Vander Esch. They had developed into a 240-pound monster who was named Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year in the 2017 season, and they are now considered a potential first-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.
"That was just the tip of the iceberg last season," Vander Esch said. "The sky is the limit."
The more people I talked to, the more I realized Vander Esch doesn't have an ego. He'll never walk into a locker room and pound their chest. They naturally become the alpha male with the credibility gained from outworking everyone in the weight room and on the practice field. When he's drafted and plays their first NFL game next season, he'll only have a handful of starts playing 11-man football under their belt, as they didn't become a starter until 2017.
"Money is nice and all that, but they don't care," Avalos told me, ironically on the very same day Vander Esch signed an endorsement contract with Nike. "He wants to be good at what he's doing. Whatever he's doing, he's going to do a certain way. One way and one way only. He's going to work their ass off to be the best or as good as they can be, whatever it is. He's got the aptitude and the motivation to do it."
When you get a grasp of where Leighton Vander Esch comes from, you understand how he's wired. And it might just be the reason they succeed.

Ethiopia is Now Africa's Fastest Growing Economy (CNN)

CNN
Ethiopia, Africa's second most populated country, is forecast to be the fastest growing economy in Sub-Saharan Africa this year, according to new data from the IMF.
Ethiopia's economy is predicted to grow by 8.5% this year. The figures signal continued economic expansion following a long period of impressive growth. In the last decade, Ethiopia has averaged around 10% economic growth, according to the IMF.
To boost the economy, the country is pursuing a number of large-scale infrastructure projects, including the Grand Renaissance Dam and a railway network.
“(Ethiopia) has had a very high growth rate and I think that's a result in large part of a very concentrated effort by the government to boost industrial production and manufacturing,” said Vijaya Ramachandran, an economist at the American think tank Center for Global Development (CGD).
Ramachandran, along with three academics, released a report suggesting Ethiopia can follow in China's footsteps, and become a destination for low-wage manufacturing jobs.

WASHINGTON—The Republican-led Senate voted decisively to punish Moscow for interfering in the 2016 election by approving a wide-ranging sanctions package that targets key sectors of Russia's economy and individuals who carried out cyberattacks.Senators on Wednesday passed the bipartisan sanctions legislation 97-2, underscoring broad support among Republicans and Democrats for rebuking Russia after U.S. intelligence agencies determined Moscow had deliberately interfered in the presidential campaign. Lawmakers who backed the measure also cited Russia's aggression in Syria and Ukraine.Despite Russia's bellicosity, there's been no forceful response from U.S. President Donald Trump. The president has instead sought to improve relations with Moscow and rejected the implication that Russian hacking of Democratic emails tipped the election their way.Read more:U.K. praises British, Romanian pilots for protecting Black Sea from ‘Russian aggression'Article Continued BelowU.S. deputy attorney general says there is no reason to fire head of Trump-Russia investigationRussian President Vladimir Putin's “brazen attack on our democracy is a flagrant demonstration of their disdain and disrespect for our nation,” Sen.

The 71-year-old Tabarez has used a wheelchair since they were diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome in 2016.
GOALKEEPERS
There is little doubt Galatasaray goalkeeper Fernando Muslera will be between the posts for their third World Cup.
Defence
The Atletico Madrid partnership of Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez also anchor the heart of Uruguay's defence. Godin has made more than 100 appearances since their debut in 2005 and scored at their third World Cup with a header against Italy in 2014. The 23-year-old Gimenez offers a solid companion to a player nine years their senior and already has one World Cup under their belt.
Versatile Lazio wingback Martin Caceres should also be sure of a starting spot unless there is a recurrence of one of their frequent injuries.
MIDFIELDERS
Tabarez has always had doubts about their midfield's attacking qualities. While the unit has usually been capable of defending well, the midfielders have often struggled to generate chances for the forwards.
During qualifying, Tabarez called up several young players who improved in this area: Federico Valverde (19), Nahitan Nandez (22) and Rodrigo Bentancur (20).
FORWARDS
Uruguay shouldn't be short of goals. The strikers are the team's greatest strength.
Suarez is Uruguay's all-time leading scorer with 50 goals and is coming off the back of a strong season with Barcelona. Paris Saint-Germain forward Edinson Cavani is next on the list with 41, including a continent-leading 10 goals in 18 matches in South American qualifying.
GROUP GAMES
Uruguay, which will be based in Nizhny Novgorod, will face Egypt in its first match on June 15. That will be followed by matches against Saudi Arabia on June 20 and Russia on June 25.

Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds never cease to savagely troll each other on social media; here's their latest exchange
It's never too late to admire Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively's sense of humour. They have been known to troll each other on social media for years. The A-list actors have the looks, the talent, a huge fan following and a delightful relationship. The couple wed in 2012 and are parents to two children.
Even though fans sometimes miss out on their inside jokes, they still keep coming back for more.
This time, it all started when Lively tweeted a teaser of their upcoming movie A Simple Favor based on Darcy Bell's novel of the same name.
Reynold's was quick to respond to them
You can tell me. We're married. You once drove me to the hospital when you were giving birth. So... what the fuck happened to Emily? https://t.co/W5vWQI9TVr — Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) May 26, 2018
Lively wrote back.
Oh darling, of all the secrets I'm keeping from you, this should be the LEAST of your concerns... trust me. — Blake Lively (@blakelively) May 26, 2018
Also, here's a list of the couple poking fun at each other: Blake posted a comparison picture of their husband as Deadpool.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 set to erase all its losses from Tuesday as signs of easing political turmoil in Italy emerged.

Italy's 5-Star Movement party made a renewed attempt to form a coalition government and called for eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona to withdraw their candidacy as economy minister.
The Italian government's successful auction of five- and 10-year bonds also assuaged concerns about the country's ability to finance itself after a sell-off in Italian bonds on Tuesday resulted in the biggest one-day surge for two-year yields in 26 years.
Fears about instability in Italy had sent investors scurrying to safety assets on Tuesday. U.S. stocks took a beating, with the S&P 500 posting its first 1 percent drop in May, while the U.S. Treasury market had its best day since at least July 2011.
“The market is reversing what appears to be a knee-jerk reaction from yesterday,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. “As people take a step back, it appears that the sell-off was overdone.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 302.45 points, or 1.24 percent, to 24,663.9, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 34.81 points, or 1.29 percent, to 2,724.67 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 69.01 points, or 0.93 percent, to 7,465.61.
The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks hit an all-time high during Wednesday's session, buoyed by data confirming the strength of the U.S. economy. Small-cap U.S. companies generally have less international exposure than their large-cap counterparts.
Payroll processor ADP's monthly report showed U.S. private sector payrolls increased by 178,000 jobs in May. The Commerce Department revised its estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product growth slightly downward but estimated that U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter would rise above 3 percent annually.
The S&P energy index .SPNY jumped 3.2 percent and was on track for its biggest one-day gain in seven weeks.
Energy shares, which provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500, benefited from a 2.2-percent surge in U.S. crude oil prices. [O/R]
Cloud-based business software maker Salesforce.com (CRM.N) rose 2.1 percent and computer and printer maker HP Inc (HPQ.N) jumped 4.2 percent after both companies raised their full-year profit forecasts.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.78-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 193 new highs and 28 new lows.
CHARLOTTE – The N.C. Department of Public Instruction honored Huntingtowne Farms and Rama Road elementary schools for their use of Positive Behavior Intervention and Support.
They were among 12 schools and two academies in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools recognized at the 67th Conference on Exceptional Children for positive school culture.

The shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice Wednesday morning is not the first time that members of Congress have been the targets of a politically motivated violent attack. Here is a list of historical precedents for the attack in Virginia.
‘Viva Puerto Rico libre'
Four Puerto Rican nationalists entered the U.S. Capitol with automatic pistols and began shooting from an upstairs spectators' gallery onto the crowded floor of the House, firing nearly 30 shots. During the shooting, the gunmen unfurled a Puerto Rican flag, and Lolita Lebron, one of the four shooters, shouted, “Viva Puerto Rico libre!”
No deaths resulted from the attack, but five representatives were wounded, including one member of congress who was shot in the chest.
Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irving Flores, Andres Figueroa Cordero and Lebron all received lengthy prison sentences. In 1979, President Carter granted them clemency and they were released. At that time, Lebron said: “We didn't do anything that we should regret. Everyone has the right to defend their right to freedom that God gave them.”

RFK assassination
On June 5, 1968, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.) was fatally shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles moments after finishing their victory speech upon winning the California presidential primary. They died the next day at Good Samaritan Hospital.
Sirhan B. Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian immigrant, was convicted of Kennedy's murder and sentenced to death on April 17, 1969. Their sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972. The New York Times reported that Sirhan believed at the time that Kennedy was “instrumental” in the oppression of the Palestinian people.

Anthrax attacks
One week after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, beginning on Sept. 18, letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to news media offices and to two Democratic senators, Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Five people died and 17 others were infected.
In August 2008, prosecutors announced that charges were to be brought against Bruce E. Ivins, a government scientist. Ivins took their own life before those charges could be filed. On Feb. 19, 2010, the FBI, Department of Justice and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service issued a summary of their investigations concluding that Ivins acted alone in mailing the anthrax letters.

Gabby Giffords shooting
On Jan. 8, 2011, U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords was meeting with constituents in a Safeway store parking lot outside Tucson when a gunman, later identified as 22-year-old Jared Loughner, opened fire.
The shooting left six dead. Thirteen were injured, including the member of congress, who was shot in the head and suffered permanent brain damage.
Authorities believed that Giffords was the target of the attack. Federal evidence filed after the shooting noted Loughner's professed love of guns, rants about semiautomatic weapons and an early encounter with Giffords while they were still in high school.
One tipster recalled seeing Loughner at the library on a regular basis watching videos of Giffords' speeches and “repeatedly talk[ing] loudly to the computer causing a disturbance to others in the area.”

Screenshot from a video provided by Pacific Yellowfin Charters shows an astute seal seeks shelter on the swim grid of a tourist boat in Frederick Arm, north of Campbell River.
A seal escaped the jaws of hungry orcas by hitching a ride on a nearby tourist vessel on July 1, and the encounter was caught on video.
A pod of transient orcas were hunting the harbour seal in Frederick Arm, an inlet north of Campbell River, when the savvy animal swam up to the boat and climbed aboard.
Footage provided by Pacific Yellowfin Charters shows the worried-looking seal hiding behind the boat's outboard motor on the swim grid, a low platform at the stern of the vessel.
The clever seal occasionally glances up at passengers aboard the 26-foot boat. But it's mostly focused on its hungry hunters, which circulate below and breach menacingly just meters away.
The boat eventually navigated away from the scene, and the seal slipped away.
The New York Jets sit at 2-2 despite all the offseason predictions of doom and gloom and talks of tanking pervasively permeating every summer discussion.
The Jets have not been above .500 since the end of the 2015 season, but have a golden opportunity to get there Sunday against the winless Cleveland Browns.
Most predicted the Jets wouldn't sniff three wins all season after they jettisoned veteran contracts and traded assets for draft picks. Players said throughout the offseason that they blocked out all those 0-16 forecasts. Now the team is using them as a motivational factor.
According to Connor Hughes of NJ Advance Media, players were greeted with notes reminding not to "forget what they stated about us."
When every #Jets player walked in the locker room this morning, they found this note on their stool. The story: https://t.co/Vzh3B7Kzv2 pic.twitter.com/WYFWJAMitb â Connor Hughes (@Connor_J_Hughes) October 5, 2017
Jets players railed against those predictions of futility.
"It was all offseason: 'The Jets are going to be 0-16,'" linebacker Jordan Jenkins told Hughes. "That's pretty much on my mind before every game.
"I looked at [the note], and in my head, I was like, 'Don't worry, I ain't forgotten what the heck nobody said.' I still remember all that kind of stuff. I don't need any reminder in the slightest."
Added Austin Sefereian-Jenkins: "I posted mine up. I mean, I'm not forgetting. [The preseason 0-16 talk] is disrespectful to everybody in the locker room. I'm not forgetting that. They didn't think we were good enough to win one game, so they definitely don't think we're good enough to win three games. We take that [expletive] to heart."
And finally, Kony Ealy: "I was one of the people who came into this season hearing 0-16," the defensive end told Hughes. "I was disgusted by it. For you to make bold predictions like that, about any professional team? It's bad on you.
"No team is the same as before. Everybody is professional. You should never underestimate any team. Ever. Looking at that, it reminds me of what was a part of this organization, but not what will be going forward."
Sure there is still 11 games left for the Jets to crater, but for now the players will use predictions by people they claimed didn't matter to fuel their drive towards respectability.
The lesson: Never underestimate the lengths a sports team will go to create bulletin-board material to use as motivation.
Recently, we've seen reports of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus owners who've upgraded to iOS 11.3, only to find their display stuck on the Home screen, unable to interact or navigate further. Why? These users previously either performed a DIY repair or had a third-party repair company (non-Apple Store or authorized retailers) perform a screen repair; unfortunately, certain non-genuine third-party screen components were made incompatible with the iPhone as of 11.3.
If you've run into this problem, don't panic: There's an update out (iOS 11.3.1) that should restore compatibility. Additionally, most repair shops have since updated their screen component sourcing with displays that are compatible with iOS 11.3, and any reputable shop (including us at iFixYouri) should provide a free display swap under the original repair warranty. Here's what you need to know.
Why did the screens stop working in the first place?
While Apple no longer voids iPhone warranties when you attempt a DIY screen repair or get a screen repair done by a third-party shop, the company also doesn't go out of its way to supply the same top-tier parts that go to its authorized repair shops and Apple Stores. As such, third-party shops rely on parts that have been independently verified to work with various iPhone models.
Note: Apple only maintains your iPhone warranty if you've repaired the screen and screen only — replacing other parts by yourself or at an unauthorized repair shop can still void it.
When Apple updates its software, however, there's a small chance that previously-functional parts can stop being recognized by the operating system as legitimate; like a bad blood transfusion or organ replacement, iOS ceases working with that part.
This isn't the first time we've seen issues with non-functional third-party replacement parts: In 2016, Apple faced a class-action lawsuit when iOS 9.2.1 disabled Touch ID on iPhones repaired by third-party companies. The court ended up dismissing the lawsuit, and Apple released an update to iOS 9 that restored the functionality of those iPhone models (and reimbursed any customers who had paid an out-of-warranty fee to get the part fixed).
One note: While we saw reports early on that the iPhone 6 Plus's "touch disease" — wherein the touch response of the iPhone 6 Plus screen became unresponsive or unpredictable, and was often accompanied by a white bar across the top of the display — was also caused by bad parts in third-party shops, this isn't true: The issue stemmed from an Apple hardware design flaw.
Could this be an intentional plan by Apple to thwart third-party repair companies, and force users to pay higher prices at authorized repair centers or Apple Stores? While that makes for a nice narrative, the more likely answer is that of security: Apple is (rightfully) concerned about potential hardware exploits, and in closing certain doors to potential hackers, repair companies can get accidentally shut out, too. Additionally, Apple recently issued a patch in iOS 11.3.1 that should fix non-communicative displays.
Here are the different replacement displays you can get from a screen repair
Third-party shops can use replacement parts of varying quality: When choosing a repair shop, always look for companies that source high-quality replacement parts and provide warranties on their replacement screens. There are a few different types of replacement screens available to consumers:

North Sound (Antigua): After holding Sri Lanka 1-1 in the recently-concluded three-match Test rubber, the Windies are all geared up to host Bangladesh in a two-match Test series, starting on Wednesday.
The home side start the series at No.9 in the ICC Test Team Rankings, just behind their opponents, but a 2-0 series win will take them above Bangladesh to No.8, and that's on their radar, according to an International Cricket Council (ICC) release.
There were three players in the main that drove the Windies' fortunes against Sri Lanka in the series.
Shane Dowrich, the first-choice wicket-keeper, was the batting star, totalling 288 runs in six innings with a century and two half-centuries. Their unbeaten 125 in the first Test was the prime reason for their team's win.
Jason Holder, the captain, underscored their all-round potential again with 198 runs, including the best of 74 in the final Test and 12 wickets, nine of which came in the same Test as that half-century.
And Shannon Gabriel, the paceman, tore through the Sri Lankan batting in the second Test for returns of 5/59 and 8/62. In all, they picked up 20 wickets in the series.
Even though the team didn't always perform as a unit, the three stars had good support from Kieran Powell, Roston Chase, Kraigg Brwathwaite, Shai Hope and Devon Smith at crucial times, while Kemar Roach showed positive signs a lot of the way.
The hosts also recalled batsman Shimron Hetmyer to the squad while retaining paceman Keemo Paul. The only change was uncapped reserve-wicketkeeper Jahmar Hamilton missing out.
Bangladesh, meanwhile, haven't played much Test cricket of late. When they did earlier this year, against Sri Lanka at home, they lost 0-1.
Mominul Haque, the No.3 batsman, was their best with the bat then, scoring two centuries on their way to 314 runs in four innings.
But over four innings, there were only four other half-centuries, seniors Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim scoring one each.
Similarly, Taijul Islam was the only one to pick up wickets regularly – 12 in total – with the rest of the bowlers not showing too much penetration.
The return of Shakib Al Hasan, as captain, should help the team. Shakib is one of the premier all-rounders in the game and though not in particularly good form of late, can add a lot to the team in both departments.
Importantly for Shakib and their teammates, they did well in the two-day tour game against a Cricket Windies President's XI side.
Iqbal (125) and Mahmudullah (102) struck centuries, while Abu Jayed and Shafiul Islam picked up two wickets apiece. Shakib also signalled a return to decent form with an innings of 67.
Squads:
Windies: Jason Holder (c), Devendra Bishoo, Kraigg Brathwaite, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich (wk), Shannon Gabriel, Shimron Hetmyer, Shai Hope, Keemo Paul, Kieran Powell, Kemar Roach, Devon Smith
Bangladesh: Shakib Al Hasan (c), Abu Jayed, Imrul Kayes, Kamrul Ismal, Liton Das, Mahmudullah, Mehidy Hasan, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Nazmul Hossain, Nurul Hasan, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Taijul Islam, Tamim Iqbal.

Speaking at a rally in Gujarat's Palanpur on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused Pakistan of interfering in the ongoing Assembly elections. Moreover, Modi also claimed that retired Pakistani military officers are willing to help senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel become the chief minister of the state.
Modi's latest salvo came after a senior BJP leader claimed that suspended Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar, along with former vice-president Hamid Ansari and ex-prime minister Manmohan Singh met with the Pakistan High Commissioner on 6 December.
This is what Modi said in the rally:
"There were media reports yesterday about a meeting at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house. It was attended by Pakistan's high commissioner, Pakistan's former foreign minister, India's former vice-president and former prime minister Manmohan Singh. The meeting at Aiyar's house carried on for almost three hours," Modi said.
Modi claimed that Pakistan Army's former director-general, Sardar Arshad Rafiq, is interfering in Gujarat's election, alleging that they had appealed to make Patel the next Chief Minister of Gujarat.
The Congress was quick to deny any such meeting with the Pakistani officials, calling the allegation "baseless". Nevertheless, unfounded allegations of a "foreign hand" meddling in India's internal affairs have been as old as the Indian State itself.
The most popular proponent of the "foreign hand" theory was the late Indira Gandhi, who often accused western powers for trying to destabilise the country.
As noted by eminent historian Ramchandra Guha, the "foreign hand" theory was the biggest contribution of Indira to India's political discourse.
During the 1970s and 1980s,"foreign hand", most often than not, referred to the US-led western world, as the Soviets were considered to be close to India. That was the Cold War era when the world was sharply divided into the capitalist and socialist camp.
There were numerous occasions when Indira blamed the "invisible hand" for creating trouble in India.
In January 1975, when the then Union minister Lalit Narayan Mishra was killed in a bomb blast at Samastipur railway station, Indira immediately blamed "foreign elements" for the murder.
"Foreign hand" became a frequent theme of the Indira government in the 20 month-long Emergency period.
Just five months into the Emergency, Indira raised the "foreign hand" bogey to discredit the Jayprakash Narayan-led Opposition.
"There are many people outside the country, who are not our well-wishers and who do not like to see India being strong and united and carrying forward its economic programmes," Indira told the nation during a radio broadcast on 11 November 1975.
At a 1976 public rally in Calcutta, when the Emergency was in full swing, Indira Gandhi warned "foreign critics" to stop interfering in India's internal affairs.
“As the prime minister I can say the more they try to suppress us or oppose us, the more strong and united we will be. We don't care for their criticism, whether it came from the Socialist International or any other organisation," The Indian Express quoted them as saying on 3 March, 1976.
In the rally, they also slammed "foreign powers" for belittling India's achievements like the 1974 Pokhran test and the launch of Aryabhatta satellite.
Indira's fear of a foreign hand sabotaging India continued even under their successor and son Rajiv Gandhi.
India Today reported in 1985 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had uncovered a Khalistani plot to kill Rajiv in the US. The report added that the prompt action of the FBI helped "snuff out much bally-hooed fear in India that an American 'foreign hand' is out to undermine the integrity and stability of the subcontinent."
Rajiv, who famously said that only 15 paise out of one rupee reaches the needy, was also known for repeatedly claiming an "invisible foreign hand" for disrupting India's economic development.
A November 1984 profile in The Guardian profile stated: "Rajiv is the one who most frequently talks about the ‘foreign hand' - a reference to the CIA and Pakistan - highlighting its alleged role in domestic affairs, particularly Punjab (sic)."
As the Cold war came to an end, after the Soviet Union's disintegrated in December 1991, the narrative of a "CIA hand" took a backseat. This may have been possible due to India's ties with the US improving in the post-Cold War era.
However, international NGOs like Greenpeace now occupy the position, once held by the CIA. Nevertheless, the US too has made infrequent appearances in conspiracy theories in the 21st Century.
While the Anna Hazare-led Jan Lokpal movement took the nation by storm, the Congress party suspected the United States' involvement in funding the stir.
"The US never supported any movement in India since its independence. For the first time, the US said that Anna Hazare's movement should be allowed and there should be no obstruction to it. What was the need for the US to give this statement?" Rashid Alvi, a senior Congress had said back then.
Moreover, the CBI too made claims of a "foreign hand" maligning soon-to-be Congress president Rahul Gandhi.
In September 2012, the apex investigator told the Supreme Court that three foreign websites were behind the charge that Rahul had abducted a girl.
The most recently reported instance of an alleged "foreign hand" came in 2012, when the then prime minister Manmohan Singh claimed that foreign-funded NGO were behind derailing the Kudankulam nuclear pwoer plant in Tamil Nadu.
"There are NGOs, often funded from the United States and Scandinavian countries, which are not fully appreciative of the development challenges that our country faces," India Today quoted the former prime minister as saying.
What Manmohan claimed in 2012 was taken a step further by the Modi government in 2015, when it cancelled the licenses of around 9,000 foreign funded NGOs.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the decision was taken as the NGOs were “prejudicially affecting the public interest and economic interest of the state.”
Greenpeace India was the major target of the government, which believed that the international NGO was working against the country's economic progress.
The present NDA government is also a topic of discussion among the conspiracy theorists.
After the Congress slumped to its lowest ever tally of 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, a senior Congress leader Mohan Prakash claimed that the BJP won a clear majority with the help of Israel's Mossad.
They claimed that the RSS had been working in tandem with Mossad since 2009 to defeat the Congress, adding that the Israeli intelligence agency was unhappy over limited bilateral ties under the UPA regime.
While conspiracy theories have remained on earth as long as the humankind, political scientist Jyotirmaya Sharma's statement highlighted the possible reason behind the phenomena, "The fear of the foreigner is phoney. It is not real. It has been created as a bogey to justify your capitulation to the outsider.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Security ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations will on Tuesday press major tech and social media companies to do more to combat the spread of extremism, officials said.
Security Ministers and Foreign Ministers pose for a group photo on the second day of Foreign ministers meetings from G7 countries in Toronto, Ontario, Canada April 23, 2018. REUTERS/Fred Thornhill
Representatives from Facebook, Twitter Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft Corp will address the meeting in Toronto.
The four companies are part of the Global Internet Forum to Counterterrorism (GIFCT), set up last year under pressure from governments in Europe and the United States after a spate of deadly attacks.
“It is important for GIFCT to increase its efforts to prevent and counter violent extremist and terrorist use of the internet,” said Scott Bardsley, a spokesperson for Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale.
Ways to do more included ramping up research on how extremists use the internet, as well as the creation and adaption of technological solutions, they said.
Security officials say a spate of so-called lone wolf attacks around the world is in part caused by people becoming radicalized by what they see online.
The European Union last month said internet companies had three months to demonstrate they were removing extremist content more rapidly or they would face legislation forcing them to do so.
One person briefed on the Toronto talks said it was unclear whether the G7 would back calls for regulation, given reluctance by Washington to crack down on what are predominantly U.S. companies.
Goodale told reporters on Monday that the focus of Tuesday's meeting was what the firms and governments could do together to counter “terrorist use” of the internet.
“What if there is no cooperation (in) the effort to counter a very serious harm like foreign interference with democracy - what are the consequences of that?” they said.
The GIFCT said last December that a database it had created to identify extremist content contained more than 40,000 videos or images.
The G7 nations - the United States, Britain, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Japan - also are due to discuss cybersecurity and how to prevent attacks by militants returning to their home countries after fighting in places like Syria and Afghanistan.

Karachi: Former Pakistan Test captain Javed Miandad has advised the cricket boards of India and Pakistan to work together for the resumption of bilateral series between the two neighbouring countries.
"It is high time the two boards got on one platform and tried to convince the governments to give clearance for resumption of bilateral cricket between India and Pakistan," Miandad said in an interview.
The 124 Tests veteran said it was a shame that despite having good teams and exciting young talents, India and Pakistan are not able to compete against each other on regular basis.
"What is the purpose of this World Test Championship or any other ICC backed league if India and Pakistan don't play against each other," they said.
Miandad said they had lost all hope in the ICC in playing any role to get India and Pakistan to resume bilateral cricket, which has been suspended since 2008 except for a short limited over series held in 2012-13 in India as a goodwill gesture.
"India and Pakistan series is much bigger than the Ashes and if we work out our issues the two countries can rule the cricket world," they said.
"No matter the level of political relations in the past we have played cricket in very tense conditions and it has eventually helped the governments," Miandad stated.
They said if bilateral cricket was held it would help in easing relations between the two countries.
Miandad said that if India and Pakistan can play in ICC events like the World Cup or Champions Trophy or in the Asia Cup, why not in bilateral matches.
"One could reconcile to the situation if there were no matches between the two countries at all but if we can play in ICC events then why not otherwise," they asked.
The batting great also asked the ICC to keep a close eye on the mushrooming of T20 leagues to prevent any fixing scandals.
Apple's latest software update for the iPhone and iPad brings a long overdue, helpful new feature: the ability to sync Messages across your various Apple devices in iCloud.
The feature, which arrives only a few days ahead of Apple's next Worldwide Developer's Conference, had been previewed at last year's WWDC.
What it lets you do is store your messages, photos and other attachments in iCloud to free up space on your devices. It might also bail you out of real trouble should you ever lose your phone or tablet. That's because you'll be able to get to your messages when you sign in to a new device.
Conversations are encrypted.
Keep in mind that if you delete messages and conversations from one device, they are automatically removed on all those devices.
You can fetch iOS 11.4 on your iPhone by tapping Settings, General, Software Update.
From there you must enable Messages in iCloud. Here's how: Tap Settings and tap your name at the top of the screen. Then tap iCloud and tap the Messages switch so that green is showing rather than gray. You'll have to do this for each device.
IOS 11.4, which also brought stereo pairing and multi-room audio capabilities to Apple's Siri-driven HomePod speaker, won't be the latest release of iOS for long. At WWDC on Monday, Apple is expected to showcase iOS 12.

LAHORE, Feb 15 (APP): All Pakistan Abdul Hafeez Kardar School Cricket Cup which was to commence from Wednesday across the country under the banner of Pakistan Cricket Board has been postponed.
“The event has been postponed due to unavoidable circumstances and its new dates will be communicated soon”, said a spokesperson of PCB while talking to APP here on Wednesday.
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said on Tuesday there is a “high chance” that some Japanese steel and aluminium products will get exempted from new U.S. tariffs as they are not quickly replaceable.

“I think there is a high chance that Japanese steel and aluminium products would be exempted from the new tariffs on a per-item basis, as they contribute greatly to U.S. industries and many of them have little substitute,” they told a news conference.
U.S. President Donald Trump has pressed ahead with import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent for aluminium, but exempted Canada and Mexico and offered the possibility of excluding other allies, backtracking from an earlier “no-exceptions” stance.
Trump's proclamation also allowed importers to seek exemptions for specific products.
Japanese steelmakers and others are encouraging their U.S. clients to apply for exemptions, Seko said.
Separately, Japan is seeking a country exemption.
“We will continuously and tenaciously ask (U.S. Trade Representative) to exempt Japan from the tariffs,” Seko said.
Japan exports about 2 million tonnes of steel products a year to the United States. That is only about 5 percent of Japan's total steel exports, but its steelmakers are deeply concerned that the U.S. tariffs may prompt retaliation and trigger a trade war.
Japan, which produces about 2.1 million tonnes of rolled and extruded aluminium a year, exports about 27,000 tonnes to the U.S. out of total exports of about 243,000 tonnes.
Global automakers and vehicle suppliers are pressing the Trump administration and U.S. Congress to exempt the European Union and other allies from the steel and aluminium tariffs set to take effect on Friday, industry officials said.
The annual congressional baseball game dates back to 1909 and is now one of the only public displays of bipartisanship left in Washington, D.C. The game, which pits Republicans against Democrats, mirrors similar events that dominate American culture every summer — including Little League competitions, corporate charity events and Major League series. Baseball is, after all, our national pastime.
And gun violence is our national shame, as American as apple pie and, yes, baseball.
The Wednesday attack on the Republican team's final practice before the game by a shooter reportedly armed with an assault rifle was a chilling reminder of the 2011 attempt on Congresswoman Gabby Giffords' life, which left six dead and 13 wounded. It raises serious concerns about ensuring the security of our elected officials and their staff.
For many parents, such concerns are a part of everyday life. In communities across the country, parents cannot safely send their children to school, to parks or to baseball practice for fear of gunfire.
Last week, shots were fired near a baseball field in Chicago where the Loyola Park Dodgers youth baseball team was playing, causing panicked parents and coaches to frantically move the children into the field house. In May, a shooting at Davenport Park in Akron, Ohio, during a basketball game led parents to chip in to pay for an off-duty police officer to provide security at future games. Last November, two people were killed and four injured in a shooting during the annual “Juice Bowl” youth football game at Shawnee Park in Louisville, Ky. And 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton was killed in a Chicago park just a week after performing at President Obama's inauguration in January 2013.
The gun fatality rate in the U.S. is 25 times higher than other high-income nations.
So far this year, there have been more than 27,800 shootings that have taken the lives of more than 6,800 people and injured an additional 13,500. To say that the United States lags behind other peer nations on this measure is a gross understatement. The gun fatality rate in the U.S. is 25 times higher than other high-income nations. For young victims ages 15 to 24, the rate is 49 times higher. Women in this country are 11 times more likely to be killed with a gun than their international peers.
The burden of this violence does not fall equally among all communities. While African Americans make up only 14% of the U.S. population, they account for 56% of gun fatality victims. Nearly 50% of gun shooting victims are between the ages of 15 and 29, and gun violence has taken over the top spot as the leading cause of death for young people in the U.S.
While the epidemic of gun violence in this country and the maddening politics around the issue can make this feel like an intractable problem, nothing could be further from the truth. There is a growing body of research showing that states that have enacted common sense measures — such as universal background checks, limits on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and restricting gun access by domestic abusers — have significantly lower rates of gun violence than permissive states.
A Center for American Progress study released in October found that the 10 states with the weakest gun laws collectively have an aggregate level of gun violence that is three times higher than the 10 states with the strongest gun laws. Other research from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that when Missouri eliminated a requirement that individuals obtain a permit before purchasing a handgun, gun-related deaths in the state increased 26%. And when Connecticut enacted this same requirement, gun deaths fell 40%.
State legislatures around the country have finally begun to heed the call of a majority of Americans to do something to address this public health crisis of gun violence. Since the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary school in December 2012, seven states have strengthened their laws regarding background checks for gun sales, five have legislated to restrict access to assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and 20 have enacted new laws to ensure that domestic abusers do not have easy access to guns. New polling shows that public support is higher than ever for measures like these.
In addition to high levels of support for policies like universal background checks — support that is shared among Republicans and Democrats, gun owners and non-gun owners — a new poll conducted by Penn Schoen Berland found that 54% of voters feel there should be fewer guns in circulation in America's neighborhoods.
Since the start of this baseball season, approximately 3,120 people have been killed with guns in this country — more than four times as many people as the active Major League Baseball roster. Perhaps, at long last, the bipartisan spirit of baseball that imbues the annual congressional game will stay with the members as they return to Capitol Hill, and they will finally take action to address this epidemic nationwide.

Islamabad - Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa said on Monday that the Indian atrocities have not been able to deter the spirit and sacrifices of the brave Kashmiris in Indian Occupied Kashmir.
“We will always stand with them in their just struggle against repression”, Gen Bajwa said during their interaction with troops deployed at forward posts on the Line of Control.
According to ISPR, the COAS was apprised of the recent abnormally frequent ceasefire violations from the Indian side and effective response by Pakistani troops.
The army chief was told that the only restraint faced by the troops is the professional ethos of Pakistan Army which bars them from responding in kind when Indian troops target innocent civilians along the LOC. The COAS lauded the motivation and spirit of the troops. They said that there's no better way to celebrate independence than defending the country.
Earlier on arrival, the COAS was received by Commander Rawalpindi Corps Lt-Gen Nadeem Raza.
Meanwhile, Independence Day was celebrated throughout the length and breadth of FATA with great national spirit and enthusiasm. A number of events were organised in Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orkzai, Kurram, North and South Waziristan agencies.
A friendly cricket match was also played between Khyber and NWA teams at Younus Khan Cricket Stadium in Miraan Shah which was witnessed by over 20,000 individuals.

An Ontario judge's decision in the ‘60s Scoop class-action lawsuit in that province could have a ripple effect across the country, including Saskatchewan.
The $1.3 billion dollar suit, representing thousands of indigenous people in Ontario, was launched against Ottawa eight years ago.

They were taken from their homes as children in the 1960s and 70s by government welfare agencies and placed in the care of non-indigenous families.
In their ruling on Tuesday, the judge found Canada had breached its duty of care to the children.
The court's decision is being felt here in Saskatchewan.
Melika Popp is a local ‘60s Scoop survivor and says the ruling is a huge step forward for all Canadians.
However, they are calling on the government to take more action and apologize for the practice, as well as implement the 94 calls to action made by Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
“I think it would create transparency and I believe that in order to heal, in order to grow, in order to learn, transparency is necessary,” Popp said.
“I think it would be holding the government essentially accountable.”

Popp says addressing the core issues related to racism would mean more than settlement money.
A $250 million ‘60s Scoop class-action lawsuit was commenced in Saskatchewan last year.
A hearing is scheduled to take place in Regina on March 2-3 to determine the carriage of the class action.

"It's a scary thing just to think about, something like that happening."
A terrifying moment for students on this bus.
Their bus driver turned in front of a semi, the truck driver couldn't avoid the crash.
Northern Michigan News Leader has been on the scene bringing you every development since it happened on the morning of Monday, March 13.
That's when we learned 14 students from Farwell were on the bus, two of them hurt.
It all started when the bus driver made a turn in front of a semi on M-115 and Cedar Road.
9&10's Cody Boyer has been working this story all day.
They join us with the latest on the crash investigation in tonight's top story.
-------------------------------------------------------
Deputies say a split second would have changed what happened this morning on 115.
The superintendent says the truck driver saved lives.
"This one is something I've never been part of before and don't ever want to again,” says Carl Seiter, Superintendent, Farwell Area Schools.
A terrifying morning for students, parents and farwell superintendent Carl seiter.
14 kids were on a bus that turned in front of a semi-trailer.
"What I think happened was driver waited for a southbound vehicle, southbound vehicle crossed in front of them and then they proceeded to cross 115,” Seiter says.
A neighbor's home surveillance camera caught what happened next.
The semi swerved to miss the bus and ended up just clipping the door.
"Thankfully, physically, everybody is okay but I have to question myself, included, and the driver as to whether or not they are going to get over this any time soon,” Seiter says.
"To hear that it was a semi versus a school bus…that was really scary,” says Marybeth Desmith, whose kids used to go to Farwell schools.
It's news Farwell parents like Marybeth and Breea Hockemeyer never want to hear.
"You put a lot of trust in the bus driver,” Hockemeyer says. “My roads are horrible and just the chatter-bumps, so you have to have a lot of trust in their driving skills and stuff to get kids to school."
"It's a scary thing just to think about, something like that happening and how it could've ended up,” Desmith says.
In the end, the superintendent says the truck driver's actions changed everything.
"I can't thank them enough,” Seiter says. “Ben Florenza…he's a father of three. They knew in their mind what the right decision was and I'm thankful for that."
The school has placed the substitute bus driver on a week's leave while they look into what happened.
--------------------------------------------------------
The angle of the intersection where this accident happened has concerned drivers before.
While no major accidents have happened there, deputies in Clare County still say it is dangerous.
Cedar and Twin Lake Roads both run at odd angles to 115.
In bad conditions like Monday morning, deputies say it's especially hard to see oncoming traffic in one direction.
They say drivers can avoid accidents like this one by being patient.
"You've got to look over your shoulder, the one direction, if you are turning and it's much smaller than a 90-degree at most angles and there can be some blind spots associated with that, for sure," says Dep. Ed Williams, Clare Co. Sheriff's Office. "Nobody ever wants to have a child on that bus, the one that gets hit. That's terrible."
Both Northern Logistics, who owns the truck, and the school are running protocol drug screens on each driver.

New Delhi: India is looking at the possibility of falling back on the rupee-rial arrangement for importing oil from Iran in the wake of US sanctions on buying oil from the Persian Gulf nation, official sources said Wednesday.
They said India is expecting the Trump administration to get in touch with it over the issue of imposition of US sanctions on Iran, adding the government will be able to formulate a strategy on oil import from that country following the talks.
"In the next few weeks, we expect to have some engagements on the issue with the US. We cannot pre-judge what the US will be doing," said a source.
India may likely to fall back on the rupee-rial arrangement for importing oil from Iran in case the US forces it to cut procurement of petroleum products from that country, the sources said.
India is also expected to convey to the US the importance of the Chabahar port project considering that it can be a major link for trade with war-ravaged Afghanistan.
The sources said there has been an informal indication from the US that the Chabahar port may be kept out of the sanctions regime.
Shipping to Iran and ports in the country are also coming under the US sanctions.
"They understand our reasoning on Chabahar. It (the US sanctions) should be carved out in the context of Afghanistan," said the source.
The US has told India and other countries to cut oil imports from Iran to "zero" by November 4 or face sanctions, making it clear that there would be no waivers to anyone.
The sources said there was no doubt that the US was going to put pressure on India and other countries which import oil from Iran, noting, "the question is what do we see as a national interest and how do we explain our case to the US. That is still to be done."
The rupee-rial that arrangement was used to buy oil from Iran before sanctions were lifted against it three years ago. Under the mechanism, India used to pay in euros to clear 55 percent of its dues through Ankara-based Halk bank. The remaining 45 percent payment was remitted in rupees in accounts Iranian oil companies had with the Uco Bank.
The first set of US sanctions on Iran will start from 6 August and the second set will begin from 4 November.
The sources said the US was prepared to work with countries that are reducing their oil imports on a case-to-case basis.
India is an oil-dependent country and will act what is in its national interests, they said.
Last week during their visit here, US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley had said that India should snap trade ties with Iran.
According to the sources, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had not given any assurance to their Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif about oil import from Iran when they held talks here in May.
They also said the Petroleum Ministry has not decided on cutting oil import from Iran.
Iran is India's third-largest oil supplier after Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Iran supplied 18.4 million tonnes of crude oil between April 2017 and January 2018 (first 10 months of fiscal 2017-18).
Iran had struck the JCPoA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) deal with the US, the UK, Russia, China, France and Germany after years of negotiations.
In May, President Donald Trump announced that the US was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal signed by the Obama administration in 2015, under which Tehran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.
More than a dozen people were evacuated from a construction site and a restaurant in Costa Mesa on Friday after crews discovered a leak in a natural gas line.
At about 2:50 p.m., Costa Mesa fire officials responded to 580 Anton Blvd., where a seven-story apartment complex is being built, after workers discovered a pinhole leak in a 2-inch gas line, said fire Capt. Chris Coates.
People working on the site had already begun to evacuate when fire crews arrived. Firefighters evacuated a nearby restaurant as a safety precaution, Coates said.
Southern California Gas Co. is working to repair the line, according to Coates.
No injuries were reported.
It isn't clear how the line was punctured.

EDWARDSVILLE — The 28 Southern Illinois University Edwardsville students in Dr. Zachary Schaefer's fall 2017 organizational communication course can now add entrepreneur to their resumés.
The class broke into two teams at the start of the fall semester for an assignment in crowdfunding. Each team was tasked with implementing a business plan and each has completed the semester having achieved its fundraising goals.
The teams created Koterie, a mobile application for college students, and 26, a team-based card game. Koterie was funded by 54 backers on Indiegogo to achieve its goal of $1,655. The game 26 gained the support of 38 backers to reach its goal of $2,220 on Kickstarter.
“Experiential learning opportunities give students the opportunity to hone cognitive, behavioral and emotional skills simultaneously,” said Schaefer, an associate professor in the College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Applied Communications. “In addition to reading and writing about how something should occur in an organizational setting, this course enabled the students to make decisions regarding the formation and organization of an actual company.”
“This experience has helped me familiarize myself with organizational structure, manage various personalities, establish and uphold deadlines, and create an inspiring and fun workplace culture,” said Koterie team leader Stacy McEldowney, a senior majoring in corporate and organizational communication who originally proposed the business idea. “I want Koterie to become a legitimate business and take this venture as far as it can possibly go.”
McEldowney and a few interested teammates are now working to form an LLC, and perfecting the app by assembling a team of programmers and designers. In time, they plan to put Koterie on the app market.
“I would like to own and operate several businesses, and I believe Koterie is a great start to making these dreams come true,” they said.
“Working on 26 is a feather in my cap,” said 26 team leader James Moss, a senior double major in mass communications and applied communication studies. “It's one more experience and accomplishment that will help me stand out from the competition when I apply for jobs, as I can confidently say I've led a project that was funded on Kickstarter.”
Though the Belleville native describes creating 26 as an “arduous process,” consumers may soon spot the game on a commercial shelf, as Moss and six other team members plan to advance their product.
“One of the biggest takeaways has been how difficult it can be to get people to back up their supportive words with dollars,” Moss said. “We're now working to fulfill the rewards promised to our backers. We're also exploring ways to make 26 into something bigger.”
The students' commitment to their businesses and development as leaders has been a rewarding experience for Schaefer, who doesn't shy from presenting students with challenging learning opportunities.
“It is a privilege to witness the students' reactions when they realize that in today's world, there are platforms, systems and resources available to help bring their ideas to life,” Schaefer said. “I believe that a combination of passion, strategy and execution leads to memorable lessons, powerful results and positive impact.”
Schaefer plans to mentor the interested students as they transition from “a group of university students” to business people.

It's known as the friendly city, but Moose Jaw, Sask. residents are in shock after a man stood on Main Street over the weekend and allegedly pointed what appeared to be a handgun at civilians and police.
Police have identified the man as 60-year-old Jack Keewatin. Police say they were on Main Street North and Manitoba Street pointing what appeared to be a handgun at people. When officers arrived, police said they turned the gun on them.
Police say that weapon was actually a BB gun that looked almost exactly like a pistol.
“It was pretty chaotic, people were scrambling for cover and trying to leave the area and their vehicles. It did result in a three-vehicle collision, so the public was taking it seriously, which was the right thing to do,” Moose Jaw Police Service Sgt. Rick Johns said.

“It was crazy, all I could hear was ‘drop your weapon',” Past Times store manager Carmen Collins said. They watched the whole scene unfold from the store's window.
“There was this guy on the corner and they were waving this gun around, at the police, at cars, just randomly, everywhere,” Collins said.
“The kids were crying in the back, and I just kept telling them it's good. I got you.”
Brianna Tauber was working across the street at a coffee shop.
“The other barista called our manager's because they were really scared. I locked the door to make sure no one would leave,” Tauber said.
“It reminded me of a scene from an western movie, because they were dress[ed] all in black, had a hat and they were standing in the middle of the road waving a gun. It just looked like a showdown.”
Keewatin is facing a number of firearms charges. They made their first court appearance Monday.
Police are still investigating and over the next few days, they will be reviewing witness statements to determine exactly what happened.
Dozens of mourners marched in the rain to pay their respects to two foul-tempered fixtures of a Halifax community – a pair of geese who were run down at a crosswalk.
Organizer Katy Jean estimated some 75 residents of Dartmouth, an independent enclave across the harbour from the city's core, braved the downpour Saturday evening to memorialize the fallen geese of Sullivan's Pond.

New York: The Bangladeshi suspect in Monday's pipe bomb explosion beneath New York's Times Square is a former limousine driver from Brooklyn who learned to build a bomb on the internet, officials said.
Akayed Ullah, 27, was in police custody after they were injured by a pipe bomb they fastened to their torso with Velcro and zip ties. Three other people were also hurt in the blast in a pedestrian tunnel linking two subway stops beneath West 42nd Street, officials said.
One neighbour in the Brooklyn neighbourhood of Windsor Terrace said they had not seen them in months, but described their home as quiet and observant in Islamic customs. They saw no evidence of extremism.
"They're really nice people. This is shocking," said the neighbour, Arlene Jograj, a teacher who had greeted Ullah in passing. "We all know each other. We have block parties. I've been over there for dinner parties after Ramadan. We're a really tight-knit street," they said.
Ullah came from the southeastern Bangladeshi district of Chittagong and last visited the country on 8 September, inspector general of police AKM Shahidul Hoque told Reuters on Monday. They had no criminal record in Bangladesh, Hoque said.
Several US officials familiar with the investigation told Reuters that there was no information indicating Ullah was previously known to any US spy or law enforcement agency for any connection to militant groups. But that does not rule out the possibility some connection could be found.
Ullah arrived in the US seven years ago on a family visa, one authoritative source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
US investigators believe they were self-radicalised after entering the US, most likely by watching militant propaganda on the internet, the officials said, adding that they were unaware of any specific militant video that might have led them to produce their faulty explosive device.
From March 2012 through March 2015, they held a licence to drive a limousine or black cab as an independent contractor, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission said in a statement.
New York state governor Andrew Cuomo called the suspect a "lone wolf", similar to the suspect in the most recent attack in New York, when an Uzbek immigrant driving a rented truck ran over people on a bicycle path on 31 October, killing eight. Both acted alone, inspired by jihadist groups such as Islamic State, Cuomo said.
"Both of them went on the web, downloaded information," Cuomo said of the two suspects, adding that Ullah learned to make a bomb online. "They're not people who come from overseas. They live here. They're disgruntled," said Cuomo, who went to the scene of the crime where they met with investigators.
Ullah was influenced by violent Islamist extremists and was "angry", Cuomo said. This could have been for any number of reasons, whether because of US policy abroad or their lot in life at home, they said.
New York police shut down an entire block of row houses in Windsor Terrace, deploying a large show of force with at least one helicopter flying overhead. It was not clear if the neighbourhood was Ullah's most recent address.
Neighbours called it a diverse, family-oriented neighbourhood of longstanding white families of Italian and Polish descent with more recent Chinese, Indian and Bangladeshi arrivals.
"This is a great neighbourhood. It's very family oriented, very safe," Jorgraj said. "This doesn't change my opinion of the neighbourhood at all. This is just the state of the world we live in now."
A team of 15 kids from Hants County, N.S., will fly to Cuba on Feb. 10 to play baseball with other kids there. They will also donate baseball gear and school supplies they have collected for students in the region.
“I think it's going to be the greatest thing ever,” said Camden Miller, 11, as they participated in their team's final practice before the trip, on Saturday at Truro‘s Cougar Dome.
He'll be playing for Team Canada as part of the Canada-Cuba Goodwill Tour.

Head coach Terry White said the team has collected an estimated 600 pounds of gear and supplies.
The donated items will go to schoolchildren in Cuba.
“It'll give our kids an opportunity to see how fortunate they are here, and how less fortunate kids are in other areas,” White said.
The team spent three months fundraising to pay for the trip.

NEW YORK-Mariah Carey surely must be hoping that their 2017 goes better than 2016 ended.
The pop music superstar endured what can only be described as a massive technical meltdown during their New Year's Eve performance late Saturday -- a fiasco witnessed by thousands in New York's Times Square and millions more across the United States.
The huge malfunction happened during their performance on "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve With Ryan Seacrest," billed as "the last big performance of 2016 by Mariah Carey."
But the sound system malfunctioned badly from the opening notes of their performance of "Auld Lang Syne," leaving the singer flummoxed and visibly defeated.
Wearing a flesh-tone sequined leotard and stiletto platform shoes, Carey paced along the front of the stage while their backup dancers performed acrobatic moves, in what was supposed to have been the evening's headlining event minutes before the ball dropped to mark the start of the new year.
"I'm going to let the audience sing, OK?" a frustrated Carey could be heard to say at one point during the number. "I'm trying to be a good sport."
An audio track of their singing could be heard, even as their mike simultaneously picked up the sound of their voice call for technical assistance.
"That was - I'm leaving," Carey, 46, said in the microphone as the first number ended.
They stayed - but things did not go better during their performance of "Emotion," one of their biggest hits, and they halfheartedly mimed their way through the number.
Hours later, Carey posted a rueful tweet, summing up the disastrous event.
"Shit happens," they wrote on Twitter Sunday, with a frownie face emoticon.
"Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here's to making more headlines in 2017."

Actress Jessica Chastain who was last seen in Niki Caro's The Zookeeper's Wife (2017) is in talks to play the villain in the upcoming X-Men movie, X-Men: Dark Phoenix.
In 2016, X-Men: Apocalypse had the X-Men fighting the prehistoric Egyptian mutant En Sabah Nur and also saw the first group of X-Men being formed with Scott Summers (Cyclops), Jean Grey, Ororo Munroe (Storm), Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) and Peter Maximoff (Quicksilver) under the tutelage of Charles Xavier, Mystique (Raven) and Hank McCoy (Beast).
The new film will focus on the Dark Phoenix saga from the X-Men comics world. Jean Grey, a student at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and a powerful mutant with telekinetic and telepathic abilities will have a personality shift when, in a mission with the X-Men team, they are protected and later imbued by an all-powerful cosmic energy called Phoenix Force.
Over some time, this force overwhelms and takes control of Jean Grey's personality, making their evil (thus, Dark Phoenix) and corrupts them to such an extent that it becomes inevitable on the part of the X-Men to fight them
Sophie Turner, who had played the role of Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse will reprise their role in the upcoming film and 20th Century Fox (the production studio) has reportedly closed deals with Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy and Nicholas Hoult to return to the franchise after their original three-picture deals expired. The other stars from X-Men Apocalypse — Alexandra Shipp, Tye Sheridan and Kodi Smit-McPhee will also be seen in the latest film, The Hollywood Reporter stated.
The Hollywood Reporter also said that there is speculation that in the upcoming X-Men saga, Chastain would essay the role of Lilandra, the empress of the alien empire Shi'ar, who gets into a conflict with the X-Men, after they pledge to imprison and execute the Dark Phoenix. Incidentally, as per the Marvel's X-Men comics worl,d Lilandra also happens to be one of the love interests of Charles Xavier and they even get married at one point of time.
It will be interesting to see how Simon Kinberg, who has been associated with the X-Men films for a long time and is writing and making their directorial debut with the upcoming film, integrates Lilandra in the Dark Phoenix saga.
The film is slated to release on 2 November 2018.

Even at age 45, Jaromir Jagr is still one of the most productive players in the NHL. They still have the ability to rack up points and also plays with a physical edge. Yet, as the offseason is coming to a close, Jagr still finds themselves without an NHL home and that is extremely shocking.
Although Jagr had a down year this past season, they still managed to put up 46 points. This was on a Florida Panthers club that did not offer them much support. Jagr should be able to find themselves another chance to play sooner rather than later.
Others have also come up with reasons why Jagr would fit with different NHL clubs. With that, it is apparent that they are capable of still being an NHL player. There would not be so much interest in them otherwise.
The Calgary Flames are a team, in my opinion, that should take a look at Jagr. They would have nothing to lose and would only benefit from this. Jagr would instantly become one of their best forwards and make the Flames a better team overall. As much as the Flames upgraded this season, they still have issues with their offensive core. Jagr could help with that.
Right Wing Woes
The Flames have immense talent down the middle and two strong left wingers in Johnny Gaudreau and Matthew Tkachuk. However, their right side is fairly weak and could use an upgrade. Besides Michael Frolik's decent production, the Flames seem to lack a first line right winger and that's where Jagr could come in.
The Flames have used Micheal Ferland on the first line many times, but they do not possess the skills of a top-six forward. Although they are an integral piece of the team, it is clear that Ferland should be playing on their checking line and penalty kill. With Ferland out of their top-six and Jagr in, they would produce more offense.
Lastly, a first line of Gaudreau, Sean Monahan, and Jagr would be lethal. Can you imagine the remarkable plays they would make? Jagr still has the ability to help lead an offense and that would benefit both linemates. The Flames would be a more difficult team to play if this was their starting line each night.
Veteran Presence
With the Flames being on the rise, they could use Jagr as a leader in the locker room. It is clear that Jagr has an abundance of experience in the league. Not many players even come close to how polished they are. Jagr could be the guy that motivates them to reach new accomplishments.
Looking at the primary core of the Flames, the majority of their top players are all young. Besides captain Mark Giordano and a few role players, this team is mainly in their early to mid-twenties. It never hurts for an NHL team to bring in a veteran for guidance. With a player like Jagr, the Flames would receive something special.
Push For Contention
At the end of the day, the Flames know they are in a position where they need to win. Gaudreau stated this best.
The Flames luckily have some time with their core players before they expect their big raises. Yet, as previously stated, they will not go far if they do not improve their top-six forward core. For the short term, Jagr would be a solid upgrade. They could drive this team to the position where they are expected to be at.
It appears unlikely that Jagr will play in Calgary this season. However, it is an option the Flames should consider. After an offseason of big moves, it is now time for them to work toward becoming an elite team in the NHL. If they were to pursue this, Jagr could end up being the final piece to the puzzle.

There are too many trees in Sierra Nevada forests, say scientists affiliated with the National Science Foundation (NSF) Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (CZO).
That may come as a surprise to those who see dense, verdant forests as signs of a healthy environment. After all, green is good, right? Not necessarily. When it comes to the number of trees in California forests, bigger isn't always better.
That's in part because trees use lots of water to carry out basic biological tasks. In addition, they act as forest steam stacks, raking up water stored in the ground and expelling it as vapor into the atmosphere, where it's accessible to humans and forest ecosystems only when it falls back to Earth as rain and snow.
That process — by which plants emit water through tiny pores in their leaves — is known as evapotranspiration. And according to researchers, excessive evapotranspiration may harm a fragile California water system, especially during prolonged, warm droughts.
New research published this week in the journal Ecohydrology shows that water loss from evapotranspiration has decreased significantly over the past three decades. That's due in large part to wildfire-driven forest thinning — a finding with important implications for forest and water management.
A century of forest management had kept wildfires to a minimum. But without fire, Sierra forests grew very dense. In recent decades, new policies have allowed nature to take its course, with wildfires helping to thin out overgrown forests.
“Forest wildfires are often considered disasters,” said Richard Yuretich, director of NSF's CZO program, which funded the research. “But fire is part of healthy forest ecosystems. By thinning out trees, fires can reduce water stress in forests and ease water shortages during droughts. And by reducing the water used by plants, more rainfall flows into rivers and accumulates in groundwater.”
Using data from CZO measurement towers and U.S. Geological Survey satellites, researchers found that over the period 1990 to 2008, fire-thinned forests saved 3.7 billion gallons of water annually in California's Kings River Basin and a whopping 17 billion gallons of water annually in the American River Basin — water that would otherwise have been lost through evapotranspiration.
Forest thinning has increased in recent decades in an effort to stave off disastrous wildfires fueled by dense forests. This study shows that restoring forests through mechanical thinning or wildfire can also save California billions of gallons of water each year.
“The need for forest restoration is being driven largely by the need to lower the risk of high-intensity wildfires and restore forest health,” said University of California Merced scientist Roger Bales, director of the Southern Sierra CZO and study co-author. “Downstream users who benefit from the increased water yield are an important potential revenue stream that can help offset some of the costs of restoration.”
Forested areas needing restoration are large, Bales said, but potential changes in water availability are significant. The total effect of wildfires over a 20-year period suggests that forest thinning could increase water flow from Sierra Nevada watersheds by as much as 10 percent.
The U.S. Forest Service says that 6 to 8 of the 21-million acres it manages in California need immediate restoration. Another 58 million acres nationally also require restoration. For California alone, restoration costs are estimated at $5 to $10 billion. But, according to the study authors, the restoration might help pay for itself.
“We've known for some time that managed forest fires are the only way to restore the majority of overstocked western forests and reduce the risk of catastrophic fires,” said James Roche, a National Park Service hydrologist and lead author of the new study. “We can now add the potential benefit of increased water yield from these watersheds.”
Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Friday recognized Corled Nkosi as a Commonwealth Point of Light awardee for developing a hydroelectric power plant from scrap metal to supply electricity to people in their area in Mzimba District.
A press release by the British High Commission in Malawi says Nkosi has been awarded for emerging as the best youth with significant impact to their local community.
Nkosi was presented with a personalized certificate signed by the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth on Tuesday in Lilongwe during a meeting between the British High Commissioner and a group of volunteers doing inspiring work in communities across Malawi.
They have beaten other 175 youths with various skills and talents to become the first ever Point of Light recipient in the country.
The Points of Light awards recognize outstanding volunteers every day of the week –people whose service is making a difference in their communities and whose story can inspire others to create innovative solutions to social challenges in their own communities and beyond.
Nkosi came into the limelight following a feature story by Malawi News Agency (Mana) in October 2017 detailing their science and innovation of coming up with the hydroelectric power plant which serves over 2000 people in their area for free.
Link to the original story can be found below:
http://www.manaonline.gov.mw/index.php/component/k2/item/1742-corled-nkosi-self-made-engineer-behind-kasangazi-hydro-electrical-power-plant
The story generated huge interest in that the British High Commissioner, Holly Tett toured Nkosi's power plant to appreciate their innovation in December, 2017.
“I have really been impressed by Corled's ingenuity and drive to achieve a better life for himself, their family and community by providing electricity.
“Inspiring young people like Corled are the future of the Commonwealth and give us all the hope that we will be able to face global challenges,” Tett said.
A letter from the British High Commission to Nkosi informing them about the award, which Mana has seen, indicates that they will travel to London in April to represent Malawian youths at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.
The meeting will bring together leaders from all the 52 Commonwealth member countries to reaffirm common values, address shared global challenges and agree on how to work to create a better future for all citizens, especially young people.
The press release says voluntary service is a vital part of the meeting's agenda which is why the Queen has chosen to recognize outstanding volunteers across the Commonwealth.
“I am, therefore, delighted to let you know that Them Majesty the Queen, as head of the Commonwealth, would like to honour your inspiring voluntary work with a Commonwealth Point of Light Award for outstanding volunteers,” reads part of the letter addressed to Nkosi.
In an interview Friday, Nkosi could not mince words but express their amusement to the development.
“I sincerely thank the British High Commission for such recognition and for a chance to participate in this year's Commonwealth meeting in London.
“There are youths with various talents and I would love to see the Heads of State during the meeting discuss much on how to nurture the youth's talent and how to support them with needed resources to ensure they achieve their goals,” Nkosi said.
Points of Light began in America under President George H W Bush and today over 6000 US Points of Light have been recognized.
Commonwealth Points of Light is a continuation of this programme. One volunteer will be recognized from each of the member countries preceding the Heads of Government meeting.
The Amazon bestseller list has become something of a political barometer of late. Recently Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis's memoir March rose to the top after President Trump criticized them for questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election. Since the election, Hillbilly Elegy, a memoir that has become a guide to working class America has been at or near the top of the list. Now the classic dystopian novel 1984, written by George Orwell and published in 1948, is number one.
The Amazon best seller list is updated hourly so it can swiftly track a surge in a book's popularity. A spokesperson for Signet Classics which currently publishes 1984 said sales have increased almost 10,000 percent since the inauguration and moved noticeably upwards on Sunday. That's when Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway appeared on Meet the Press. When host Chuck Todd challenged the Trump administration's assertions about the size of the Inauguration Day crowd, Conway responded by saying that the administration had " alternative facts."
That phrase drew a lot of attention.
On CNN's Reliable Sources, Washington Post reporter Karen Tumulty said "alternative facts" was a " George Orwell phrase." Expanding on that idea in an interview today Tumulty said it reminded them of the double speak found in 1984 where "war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength."
CNN tweeted Tumulty's remark which contributed to the surge in book sales. Eventually other journalists also made the connection and the story took on a life of its own. As the story took off so did sales of 1984. Earlier this week Signet Classics ordered a 75,000-copy reprint of the book and the company spokesperson says there could be more printings in the near future.
STANFORD VS. SOUTHERN CAL
Results
Hosted by USC
Saturday, February 3rd
25 Yards
Dual Meet Format
FINAL TEAM SCORES:
STANFORD: 151.5
USC: 148.5
The Stanford men remain undefeated in dual meet action after winning a nailbiter on the road against Pac-12 rival USC on Saturday. The Cardinal has a chance to go undefeated this season with only Cal remaining on the dual meet schedule.
The Stanford distance crew pulled in big points for their team. In the 1000 free, first-year student Johannes Calloni led the charge with a 9:07.13. Teammates James Murphy (9:10.38) and Matthew Hirschberger (9:13.55) followed for a 1-2-3 sweep. Pac-12 champion Grant Shoults and All-American Liam Egan battled in the 500 free. Egan set the pace up front, leading by nearly a second with 200 yards to go. Shoults made their move to close the gap and take over the lead for the final 150 yards, winning in 4:22.30 to Egan's 4:22.54.
Brad Zdroik was one of Stanford's top performers. In the 200 fly, they were neck-and-neck with USC's Alex Valente through the front half, but used their back half speed to distance themselves from the field as they won in 1:45.19. Zdroik nearly made it a stroke sweep, coming up just .01 shy to teammate Andrew Liang in the 100 fly, 47.01 to 47.02. Valente followed closely for 3rd in 47.22.
Matt Anderson also brought home an individual win for Stanford. Anderson and teammate Brennan Pastorek had a close race in the 200 breast, with Anderson pulling slightly ahead on the back half to win 1:58.76 to 1:59.06. USC's Carsten Vissering followed in 1:59.44. Anderson also took 2nd in the 100 breast, touching in 54.40 behind Vissering (53.41).
USC's Robert Glinta had a standout swim for the Trojans in the 100 back. Glinta dominated the race in 46.16, finishing less than 2 tenths shy of their season best 45.97 from the USA vs. College Challenge. They also led off the Trojans' 200 medley relay in a quick 21.66 and turned in a 1:42.45 in the 200 back for a narrow 2nd place to teammate Patrick Mulcare (1:42.24). Mulcare also won the 200 IM in 1:46.96.
Dylan Carter came up with a pair of wins for USC, touching in 1:36.07 for the 200 free win. They came back for the 100 free, using their front-half speed to take the edge over Stanford's Sam Perry, winning 44.16 to 44.39. Carter was slightly faster on the leadoff split on the 400 free relay with a 43.92. Fellow All-American sprinter Santo Condorelli returned for the Trojans today after sitting out yesterday's meet against Cal to rest their shoulder. Condorelli nabbed a win in the 50 free, as they were the only man to break 20 seconds in 19.73. Carter and Condorelli teamed up on the 200 medley relay, with Carter posting a 20.48 fly split and Condorelli putting up a 19.35 free split.
PRESS RELEASE – STANFORD:
LOS ANGELES – No. 4 Stanford survived a narrow decision against No. 10 USC, beating the Trojans, 151.5-148, in a Pac-12 dual meet at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Saturday.

Stanford returns to action on Feb. 17 when it hosts Cal at Avery Aquatics Center. The meet will start at Noon PT, with Senior Day ceremonies taking place prior to the meet.
PRESS RELEASE – USC:
On Senior Day, No. 10 USC won 10 events, including a pair of relays, but ultimately fell to No. 4 Stanford in a nail biter, 151.5-148.5, Saturday (Feb. 3) at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
USC falls to 6-2, 2-2 after hosting top four teams on back-to-back days, while Stanford improves to 5-0, 4-0.

ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP):Minister for States and Frontier Regions (SAFRN) (Lt. General (R) Abdul Qadir Baloch on Monday informed the National Assembly that about 1.38 million registered Afghans Refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards were living in Pakistan.
Answering the questions in National Assembly during question hour, they said that the major districts of Afghan refugees residing areas are Peshawar, Nowshera, Kohat, Haripur, Swabi, Quetta, Pishin, Chaghai, Loralai, Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Attock, Mianwali, Malir and Karachi (East and West).
The minister said that in addition there are approximately 700,000 undocumented Afghan's in Pakistan.
Qadir Baloch said that the repatriation of registered Afghan Refugees is guided by the principle of voluntarism and
gradualism as embedded in the Tripartite Agreement signed between Governments of Pakistan, Afghanistan and UNHCR that is valid till December 31, 2017.
Under this program more than 4.3 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan since 2002 which is marked as the largest voluntary repatriation program in UNHCR's history, they added.
They said that the government encouraged repatriation of Afghan Nationals to their country of origin in whatever manner that it can.
Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said that they would write to the Prime Minister to suspend SAFRON secretary for three days for not replying the questions and wrongly addressing the National Assembly.
A user receives funds from a friend for Burning Man festival expenses via Venmo.
PayPal Holdings, Inc
Venmo takes the anxiety out of splitting brunch and utility bills. With a linked bank account and someone's username, you can send and request cash in a few taps. But some wonder if the app makes it a little too easy for people to hit each other up for money.
Just ask Soham Maniar of Houston. They were hosting a friend for a weekend, and the two took an Uberpool to dinner. Later, Maniar was surprised to receive a request for $2.85, their half of the ride cost.
“When someone is nice enough to host a friend or guest, it doesn't mean you have to give them something in return, but I think in a world without Venmo, that friend would not have asked me for $2.85 in cash after I got out of a cab,” Maniar says.
You can take advantage of Venmo without ticking off your friends with these simple tips from Maniar and others.
Try not to sweat the small stuff
“Anything under $20 with friends I usually never charge,” Maniar says. “And if someone did something nice for me, I try and return the favor when it makes sense.”
There's no right threshold. After all, if it's almost payday and you have a $30 bank balance, covering a coworker's coffee might not be in your budget. “It's not nickel-and-diming if [the amount] does make a difference,” says Erin Lowry, author of “Broke Millennial.”
But if you can afford it, consider springing for small items once in a while. When Maniar treats, they say, “I like to assume they'll treat me for something in return in the future. It probably evens out.”
Reciprocity is key, though. If you notice that one of your friends tends to take advantage, “you need to have a conversation,” Lowry says — in person. “Don't Venmo them for the last six years of your friendship.”

Don't stealth-charge
Venmo and other peer-to-peer payment apps let you request money without asking first — even without a username, which you can find with the app's search function — but that doesn't mean you should. Establishing how you'll split the bill (or that you'll split the bill) ahead of time helps avoid annoyance later.
“Unless we've spoken about sharing a cost, don't expect a Venmo request from me for splitting it,” says Stefanie O'Connell, a finance blogger. And “don't send me a Venmo for the guacamole you offered me a bite of,” they add.
Spell it out
Use the memo field to add detail about the request, especially when you're splitting multiple bills. (Emoji not required.)
“Before sending someone a request for money, you should clear it with them, including what it's for and what they should expect to pay,” says Elaine Swann, a lifestyle and etiquette expert.
After a weekend trip, a simple note, such as “Hotel $100, gas $40, dinner $30” can take the stress off your recipient, particularly if you're requesting a large chunk of money.
Make your transactions private
You can control who sees your transactions on an individual basis or set a default for your account: private or friends only. If your friend's account is wide open but yours is locked up, the app will honor the more restrictive setting, according to Venmo's website.
To privatize your feed, open your Venmo menu, scroll down to “settings,” and then click on “privacy.” Be sure to click “save” when you're done.
For O'Connell, privacy is important on the app. “Who owes me money and who I owe is nobody's business but our own,” they say.
It's like real life — but (hopefully) better
Does Venmo actually make people ruder? Or is it just another way to demonstrate rudeness? It's a chicken-or-egg argument with no easy answer — but some suspect it's more often the latter.
“If you're a jerk, you're probably going to be a bigger jerk [on Venmo],” Swann says.
Lowry agrees: “If you're somebody who remembers that four years ago your friend borrowed money for coffee and never paid you back, you're going to use Venmo that way,” they say.
The good news is that if you're considerate about money outside of the digital world, you're well on your way to being considerate about Venmo. Think of it as a tool for payment, not a substitute for communication, and soon you'll be splitting brunch without provoking a single eye roll.

Opposition stages walkout from NA
Zahid Chaudhary
Islamabad
The opposition in the National Assembly on Thursday expressed concerns over reports that state institutions are not cooperating with the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed to probe the offshore dealings of the Prime Minister's family and that relevant ‘record and documents are being changed or tempered with. ‘
Both Leader of the Opposition Khurshid Shah and Shah Mehmood Qureshi of PTI took strong exception of the reports. As Shah Mehmoud Qureshi took the floor to speak on the issue, members from the treasury benches resorted to sloganeering against Imran Khan. Responding to the concerns of the opposition, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar emphatically denied reports that the record or documents are being changed or tempered with. They said the state institutions are not creating any hurdle in the investigation of JIT.
The institutions are providing all the required material to the JIT, they said adding the government respects the process of investigation but doubts and suspicions on it also part of the record. We fully respect the law and the constitution. They said the Prime Minister who will appear before the JIT tomorrow has also asked the party workers to stay away from the JIT Secretariat.
Ishaq Dar urged the political parties to sit together and formulate a national economic agenda for the country. They said the Speaker National Assembly may lead these efforts after the Holy month of Ramazan.
They said it will be a great service to the nation if we agree on the agenda with an open heart. They said they are firm believer that the future of Pakistan is bright. They said international financial institutions are also admiring the economic performance of the country.
The Finance Minister said Pakistan has achieved economic stability due to the prudent economic policies of the present government.
About the Supplementary Grants, the Finance Minister clarified that these are not unconstitutional. They said we are also grateful to the Supreme Court for recognizing the government's stance on the supplementary grants. Nevertheless, they said the government is trying to bring them to the minimum level.
The House on Wednesday approved all the 124 Supplementary Demands for Grants and Appropriations amounting to over 121 billion rupees for the outgoing financial year. These related to different ministries and departments.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar moved the supplementary demands for grants.
The House also held discussion on the Charged Expenditure amounting to over 68 billion rupees for the outgoing financial year. These related to the Senate, repayment of domestic debt, servicing of foreign debt, Supreme Court, Islamabad High Court, Wafaqi Mohtasib and Federal Tax Ombudsman

It's a bet large swaths of gamblers would have made with confidence as this NBA season began. And as last season began. And probably the season before that, too. It's Warriors-Cavaliers in their record fourth straight final — a modern inevitability on the order of death, taxes and multiple burner accounts. So much for the romantic notion that these NBA playoffs would be, um, unpredictable.
The notoriously fragile health of Steph Curry is always a concern. One roll of an ankle, one tweak of a knee, and the NBA final gets a lot more interesting. ( Marcio Jose Sanchez / The Associated Press )
“It may not be as suspenseful as a lot of people want it to be or as drama-filled,” Kevin Durant, the Warriors all-star, was telling reporters in Oakland on Wednesday. “But that's what you've got movies and music for.” In other words: If you're looking for plot twists and surprise endings, odds are you could probably make better use of your screen time than watching the best-of-seven series to decide the NBA champion. To some eyes, it seems awfully obvious what's about to happen beginning Thursday night at Oracle Arena. The Warriors, with their all-star-stacked lineup, are heavy favourites to win their third ring in four years (and their second straight since Durant's free-agent arrival made them a court-tilting superteam). The Cavaliers, meanwhile, are 13-to-2 underdogs to be the surprise winner — the second-biggest long shot in the past 30-some finals, surpassed only by Allen Iverson's Philadelphia 76ers in 2001. So the common-sense, stick-to-the-facts prediction — Warriors in five — cribs from that 2001 series. Those Shaq-Kobe Lakers, like these Warriors, came into that series as the defending champion and undisputed juggernaut. It took a 48-point night by Iverson to secure Philly its only win and avoid the sweep. Surely LeBron James will be good enough for one of those guns-blazing masterpieces.

So yeah, Warriors in five would be the safe selection. Pure logic suggests the Cavaliers can't possible hang here, not with a supporting cast led by a still-possibly concussed Kevin Love and a gaggle of laughably inconsistent misfits. Then again, maybe that's why they're more dangerous than the oddsmakers would have you believe. James, who's been playing under a massive burden of expectation since teenagehood, finds themselves in a rare no-lose moment. They can fail to carry their team to a title and still come out a hero; carrying their barren team to the final has already been widely viewed as one of the great accomplishments of their career. And as for the rest of the Cavaliers — nobody's expecting much. Any significant contribution will be seen as a pleasant surprise. So the pressure, on Cleveland's end, is as insignificant as it gets on such a big stage. The Warriors, for their part, can't say the same. And for all their obvious firepower, they've looked vulnerable in recent days. They trailed by double digits at halftime of both Games 6 and 7 of the Western final. If not for Houston's historic Game 7 brickfest, it'd be easy enough to imagine Golden State currently on vacation. The Warriors can't expect Cleveland's James to wilt like Houston's James (Harden). And as much as Love's availability is a question mark, the status of Warriors forward Andre Iguodala injury is a bigger concern. It was announced Wednesday Iguodala will miss Game 1 with the bone bruise on their left knee that kept them out of the final four games in the Western final. That's significant because Iguodala would likely be Kerr's primary option to guard James, a role the swingman rode to a championship-series MVP in 2015.
And while the Warriors clearly have other options to defend Cleveland's No. 23 — Draymond Green could do it, as could Durant, to name two — neither rings perfect. Green, after all, is at their best when he's emboldened as a roving help defender. Durant, if he's devoting that kind of energy to the defensive end, might not be as lethal with the ball in their hands. If Durant's off, then it's often down to the state of Steph Curry's jump shot, which is directly tied to Curry's notoriously fragile health. One roll of an ankle, one tweak of a knee, and the series gets a lot more interesting. When you think back to how discombobulated the Warriors looked at times against the Rockets — “splintered,” is the word Kerr used to describe their team at its worst moments of the Western final — it's not impossible to imagine James finding a way to keep their team in closer contact with the Warriors than Game 1's 13-point Vegas spread would suggest is possible.
Article Continued Below
He's done it before, albeit before Durant was in the picture. The Cavaliers were underdogs to the Warriors in 2015, when Love missed the entire series to an injury and Kyrie Irving was lost for the duration after a Game 1 knee tweak. Cleveland's second-leading scorer after James in that series was Timofey Mozgov. Amazingly, James still made it a six-game affair. And Kerr spent part of Wednesday making the case that James is even better now, particularly as a jump shooter. “He's shooting fadeaway threes from 30 feet to close games out,” Kerr told reporters. “The shooting is what has really gotten better in the last few years.” The shooting will need to be dead-eye, the Warriors will need to be splintered to the point of disintegration. But if you're inclined to back historic underdogs, there's something to be said for having the NBA's alpha dog on your side. As the old hounds say, mind you: Don't bet more than you want to win.

ISLAMABAD - The Ministry of Finance on Tuesday has notified the incentives for civil servants as announced in budget 2018-19 including increasing salaries by 10 percent and also enhancing the house rent.
"The President has been pleased to sanction with effect from 1st July, 2018 and till further orders, an Adhoc Relief Allowance-2018 @ 10 percent of basic pay to all the civil employees of the Federal Government as well as the civilians paid from Defence Estimates including contingent paid staff and contact employees employed against civil posts in Basic Pay Scales on standard terms and conditions of contract appointment," said an official notification issued by the ministry.
The amount of Adhoc Relief Allowance-2018 will be subject to income tax and will also be admissible during leave and entire period of LPR except during extra ordinary leave.

(JOLIET, ILLINOIS) For the first time in nearly twenty years, Dirt Oval 66 will thrill fans throughout the 2017 season with exciting wheel-to-wheel RACING action at the pristine facility, which is located at Route 66 Raceway in Joliet, Illinois. Construction is currently underway to shorten the large 1/2-mile oval that had previously hosted several high-profile dirt events in the late 1990s – including several visits by the now defunct Hav-A-Tampa Dirt Racing Series – to a more racer-friendly 3/8-mile layout. Dirt Oval 66 President Sherri Heckenast is elated with how the new racing surface is coming along and looks forward to greeting fans and competitors to the new-look speedplant for the season opener on Thursday, April 27.
“The racetrack is coming along very nicely and I can't wait to see a wide variety of classes competing this year at Dirt Oval 66,” exclaimed Heckenast recently. “We worked with the previous dirt to remove any rocks and brought in nearly 1,000 loads of premium dirt to resurface the track. Along with shortening it to a 3/8-mile track, it should lend itself to some great racing action for the fans and drivers. We are running a special event schedule in 2017 with support classes and fans will have the luxury of watching all different forms of Motorsports throughout the year!”
After a couple of open practice sessions to get the track ready for the opener, a special Throwback Thursday Open Wheel program is planned to kick off the season on Thursday, April 27. The parking lots will open at 11:00am, while General Admission gates will swing open at 4:00pm. Showtime will be promptly at 7:00pm. General Admission tickets are currently available for purchase for the April 27 lid lifter and all shows – along with camping – by calling the track office at 815-740-8000 or toll-free at 844-866-DIRT and by visiting www.dirtoval66.com.
An action-packed schedule featuring 14 special events has been released for 2017 with the ultra-popular Team Demo Association (TDA) presenting five demolition derby's on May 27, June 24, July 22, August 26, and September 23. Also on the schedule is a World of Outlaws Craftsman Sprint Car Series and World of Outlaws Craftsman Late Model Series doubleheader on June 27-28. Dirt Oval 66 is proud to host the ONLY World of Outlaws Sprint Car race in the state of Illinois in 2017!
The 4th Annual ‘Monster Truck Mayhem' will bring the ground-pounding Monster Trucks to the facility on August 5, while the big ‘Chicagoland's Dirty 30' program on September 13 will lead into NASCAR week at the nearby Chicagoland Speedway. Things will then wrap up at Dirt Oval 66 on October 13-14 with the two-day ‘Chi-Town Showdown' for the World of Outlaws Craftsman Late Model Series competitors. You can view the full racing schedule by pointing your web browser to www.dirtoval66.com.
“I come from a long family line that has been involved in motorsports for years and I believe in mixing up the schedule to provide a unique show for the fans to hopefully keep them coming back and spending their hard earned money with us,” said Heckenast, who is operating Dirt Oval 66 independent from Chicagoland Speedway and Route 66 Raceway. “I have promoted Kentucky Lake Motor Speedway and Kankakee Motor Speedway in the past, along with owning the Team Demo Association promotion since 2008. My dad raced demos and stock cars for years, my brother currently races on the World of Outlaws Craftsman Late Model Series tour, and I drove a Late Model myself up until 2010. The staff here has been around the sport and everyone is excited to showcase Dirt Oval 66 as a premier dirt racing facility that provides quality entertainment for the entire family!”

I arrived in Taos two days ago after a too-short drive over the famous High Road from Santa Fe, a road that goes through lovely scenery and appealing small towns. Although it was Sunday, and hardly anybody was to be seen, I enjoyed the quiet.
But before I left Santa Fe, I had to return for breakfast to the place where I got those fabulous blue corn pancakes with roasted pinon nuts. Tecolote, which has moved in recent years because of its popularity, now lives in a strip mall, but who cares when the food is that good?
This time I had another house special: Huevos Yucatecos, described like this on their menu:
I had posole, known in English as “hominy.” This belly-busting breakfast also came with a bakery basket containing three sizable muffins: jalapeño, blueberry, and raisin. It was a superb meal, and kept me full till dinnertime, a dinner that consisted of a salad and some fruit (I need to detox before I resume my gluttony):
Out in the parking lot I saw this license plate, which I'd dearly like to have on my car:
The High Road (see link above) goes through scenery that looks like the next two pictures:
In the small town of Las Trampas sits a well known adobe church, San José de Gracia, which Wikipedia describes this way:
The San Jose de Gracia Church, also known as Church of Santo Tomas Del Rio de Las Trampas, is a historic church on the main plaza of Las Trampas, New Mexico. Built between 1760 and 1776, it is one of the least-altered examples of a Spanish Colonial Pueblo mission church, with adobe walls rising 34 feet (10 m) in height. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970.
Shortly after arriving in Taos and booking a cheap room (yes, they left the light on for me), I headed for perhaps the most famous of New Mexican adobe churches, San Francisco de Asis Mission Church, built between 1772 and 1816, and also a National Historic Landmark. Its rear faces the road, so it's easy to miss. But the rear of the building is, as artists have found, more visually interesting than the front:
The front, with two cross-topped bell towers:
One reason the church is famous is that it's been depicted by many painters and photographers, most notably Georgia O'Keeffe and Ansel Adams:
Here's O'Keeffe's painting (below) and their take on the building:
The Ranchos de Taos Church is one of the most beautiful buildings left in the United States by the early Spaniards. Most artists who spend any time in Taos have to paint it, I suppose, just as they have to paint a self-portrait. I had to paint it—the back several times, the front once. I finally painted a part of the back thinking with that piece of the back I said all I needed to say about the church. I often painted fragments of things because it seemed to make my statement as well as or better than the whole could. And I long ago came to the conclusion that even if I could put down accurately the thing that I saw and enjoyed, it would not give the observer the kind of feeling it gave me. I had to create an equivalent for what I felt about what I was looking at—not copy it.
And an Ansel Adams photograph:
The entire landscaped front:
And, of course, since this is a Catholic church, there's a recent “memorial to the unborn.” It wouldn't be as affecting if the picture was the single cell of a fertilized zygote.
The inside of the church with its wooden ceiling:
The main altar, repainted in 1981:
One of the two paintings flanking the entrance. The Mary and Jesus is complemented on the other side by Jesus holding their bleeding heart.
A closeup of the adobe exterior, showing the straw mixed with the dried mud:
Of course all of us amateur photographers have to have a go at a picture, too, and this is mine. Sadly, the morning light wasn't great and the photo turned into what I call “Adobe Buttocks”:
My next visit was to what is probably Taos's premier visitor destination: Taos Pueblo, The website Taos.org says it's the oldest continuously inhabited community in the U.S.:
Taos Pueblo is the only living Native American community designated both a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and a National Historic Landmark. The multi-story adobe buildings have been continuously inhabited for over a [sic] 1,000 years. The Pueblo is 3 miles northeast of Taos Plaza. Archaeologists say that ancestors of the Taos Indians lived in this valley long before Columbus discovered America and hundreds of years before Europe emerged from the Dark Ages. Ancient ruins in the Taos Valley indicate our people lived here nearly 1000 years ago. The main part of the present buildings were most likely constructed between 1000 and 1450 A.D. They appeared much as they do today when the first Spanish explorers arrived in Northern New Mexico in 1540 and believed that the Pueblo was one of the fabled golden cities of Cibola. The two structures called Hlauuma (north house) and Hlaukwima (south house) are said to be of similar age. They are considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the USA.
Below is a photo of the “north house” (I couldn't approach the “south house” as it's off limits; as Wikipedia notes, “The Taos community is known for being one of the most private, secretive, and conservative pueblos”.).
The two “houses” are big adobe apartment buildings, with each door opening into a single-family unit. There are up to three stories, with the upper units accessible only by climbing a ladder. (I wonder how the older people manage that). There are also isolated, smaller houses.
Other views of the north house. There is no electricity or running water; water comes from a creek running through the pueblo that debouches from a pure mountain lake in the mountains behind. It's a sacred lake, and was made 100% Tiwa-speaker property by decree of Richard Nixon.
I have no idea how many people live in the Pueblo. I took a tour from a woman who was a member of the tribe and studying biology at a local college, intending to go into “native medicine.” They told me there were 15-20 people living there permanently, but others visit from time to time or during ceremonies. Each unit is passed down within a family.
The way to get to an upstairs unit:
Some of the residents sell basked goods and handicrafts from their homes. Their own baking is done in outdoor adobe ovens that look like this:
It's a breathtaking structure, and of course requires maintenance to keep the adobe uncracked.
I am told that the wooden racks are used to dry vegetables and other foodstuffs:
Some adobe bricks ready to be used:
A view from the courtyard of the local church, built by Indian labor under the Spanish whip:
Red Willow Creek, the source of the Pueblo's water:
The Pueblo residents fiercely resisted Spanish occupation, attacking the killing several priests and the Governor General. Their last big revolt was in 1847, when the Spanish attacked, forcing the residents to hole up in this original church, which was then knocked down with cannons. The bell tower and original bell remains, surrounded by a graveyard that one isn't allowed to photograph:
The rest of the day I wandered around downtown Taos, including the plaza, which is full of ritzy stores. Nearby is the home and grave of the famous Kit Carson (1809-1868), a frontier polymath, or, as Wikipedia describes him, “an American frontiersman. . .a mountain man (fur trapper), wilderness guide, Indian agent, and U.S. Army officer.” Their deliberate murdering and scalping of many Indians has taken a lot of the shine off their image. Here are the first and last known photos of Carson, followed by my photo of their grave:
Finally, the home of Mabel Dodge Luhan (1879-1962), a wealthy heiress who moved to Taos in 1917 with their third husband, becoming a patron of the local art scene. They also entertained many famous artists and writers. From Wikipedia:
D. H. Lawrence, the English author, accepted an invitation from them to stay in Taos, arriving with their wife, Frieda, in early September, 1922. They had a fraught relationship with their hostess, however, later writing about it in their fiction. Dodge later published a memoir about the visit entitled, Lorenzo in Taos (1932). Editor and book designer Merle Armitage also wrote a book about this time in New Mexico. Taos Quartet in Three Movements was originally to appear in Flair Magazine, but the magazine folded before its publication. This short work describes the tumultuous relationship of D. H. Lawrence, their wife Frieda, artist Dorothy Brett and Mabel Dodge Sterne, a wealthy patron of the arts. . . . In New Mexico, Dodge and Luhan [Tony Luhan, their fourth husband and a Native American] hosted a number of influential artists and poets, including Marsden Hartley, Arnold Ronnebeck, Louise Emerson Ronnebeck, Ansel Adams, Willa Cather, Walter Van Tilburg Clark, Robinson Jeffers and their wife Una, Florence McClung, Georgia O'Keeffe, Mary Hunter Austin, Mary Foote, Frank Waters, Jaime de Angulo, Aldous Huxley, Ernie O'Malley and others.
All those luminaries stayed here:
I didn't go inside, but you can see more pictures of the house, inside and outside, here. And here, left to right, are Mabel Dodge Luhan, Frieda Lawrence, and British painter Dorothy Brett.
Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci had harsh words for President Donald Trump's reaction to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, this weekend.

LAHORE-Ajoka theatre is presenting a three-day theatre festival to mark the 70th anniversary of the Partition of the Sub-continent. Entitled “Revisiting Partition” the event will feature three plays on the theme at Alhamra on October 10.
The festival will open with “Kaun hai yeh Gustakh” on Tuesday. Written by Shahid Nadeem, the play focuses on Saadat Hassan Manto's life struggle after their migration to Pakistan in 1948.
Enactments of their short stories Siyah Hashiye, Khol do, Thanda Gosht & Toba Tek Singh depict the horrors of the violence which accompanied Partition.
On the second day, “Shahr-e-Afsoos”, based on legendary fiction writer Intezar Hussain‘s famous short story will be performed. The play is an acclaimed experimental production, which has been designed and directed by Madeeha Gauhar. The play depicts the nightmarish world of three guilt ridden scepters who have lived through the bloodied times of both 1947 and 1971.
The festival will conclude with a performance of “Anhi Maai da Sufna” on 12th October, Shahid Nadeem's play inspired by true stories of the generation dislocated and tormented by the Partition. The play has been directed by prominent Kolkata- based theatre director Usha Ganguly.
Ajoka's Executive director Shahid Nadeem said, “This festival is Ajoka's tribute to the resilience of the generation which retained the love of their motherland despite the forced mass migration across the border. While celebrating the 70th anniversary of our independence, we should also reflect on the hatred and violence unleashed on innocent people on both sides of the border seven decades ago and which still impacts our state policies and collective mindset,” they said.
There are two categories. Matthew Stafford supporters. Matthew Stafford detractors. There is no room in between.
Stafford is respected by their peers. In an NFL Network poll, Stafford was voted by their fellow players as 31st-best in the league.
However, the scouting-based website profootballfocus.com isnt nearly as kind. It doesnt rank Stafford among the NFLs Top 50. The Pro Football Weekly preseason magazine doesnt have Stafford in the Top 50, either, and rated them as only the NFLs 11th-best quarterback.
Staffords supporters are quick to point out they are by far the best QB the Lions have had since Bobby Layne. Their detractors are equally fast to respond its a low standard.

Staffords supporters will detail a long list of epic fourth-quarter comebacks. Their detractors counter with how Stafford struggles the first three quarters.
Staffords supporters are fully aware they rank second all-time in yards passing per game. Their detractors claim it doesnt matter because they have a losing record and has yet to win a postseason game.
So what is Matthew Stafford? Star? Disappointment? Clutch performer? Choke artist?
Probably the most accurate word entering their ninth season is enigma.
This is the final season of Staffords contract, but odds are the Lions will make them the highest paid player in NFL history - or close to it - soon.
To their supporters, its a no-brainer.  They are just 29. They have made strides the last season-and-a-half under offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter. Why start over? To their detractors the idea is lunacy. Why not start over?
I do think you are seeing them make strides, head coach Jim Caldwell said of Stafford before the Lions mini camp workout Wednesday in Allen Park. I think they will continue to grow.
He is ultra bright.  They are constantly finding ways to get better. They have a strong arm. They can make all the throws.
Stafford has improved their completion percentage and mobility. Last season, they dispelled the notion they were merely a product of Calvin Johnsons brilliance.
The Lions, however, faded at the end last season. When push came to shove, they couldnt beat the Giants, Cowboys, Packers and Seahawks.
After Wednesdays workout, Stafford side-stepped questions about their contract with the usual cliches about, just trying to improve.
They have many attributes. A big arm. Underrated athleticism. A quick mind. Stafford accepts accountability and avoids excuses. Many times, they have been at their best with a game on the line. It hasnt, however, been the most-defining games.
Maybe this is the year. How many times have you heard that about the Lions - and Stafford? It does seem like the two go hand-in-hand.
Matthew Stafford remains a terrific talent more than a successful quarterback, a perpetual promise yet to come to fruition.
This town keeps waiting and asking, Is this the year?
The answer depends on who you believe.
The supporters or the detractors.
So far, Stafford has only proven both to be correct.

Fox has given a series order to a revival of “Showtime at the Apollo,” with comic Steve Harvey set to host. The new iteration of the classic variety series is slated to premiere in the 2017-18 season.
The series order follows two “Apollo” specials Fox aired in December and January that served as trial balloons for a new series.
“We all had such a blast on the two specials that aired earlier this season, that we thought it really deserved being a weekly event,” said Harvey. “But our mission is a little different this time around. Instead of just putting on a great show, we're going to do that and find the next great comic and the next big music star. That's what the Apollo is all about. My roots are on that stage and I can't wait to be there every week, looking for great talent. Who said you can't go back home again?”
The Apollo's weekly Amateur Night competition, = has been running for 82 years and helped launch the careers of artists such as James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Lauryn Hill, Michael Jackson and The Jackson Five, and D'Angelo. Featuring the Amateur Night competition and performances by established stars, “Showtime at the Apollo” aired as a syndicated television show from 1987 to 2008 and featured music, comedy, dance and other acts. Harvey served as its host from 1993 to 2000.
The new series will be executive-produced by Jim Roush and Chris Wagner for the Roush-Wagner Company, with Reginald Hudlin and James McKinlay also will executive-producing and serving as showrunners. Executive producer Don Weiner will direct the series. The Apollo Theater's Jonelle Procope and IMG's Michael Antinoro also executive produce.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - A Rhode Island company is going to build a wind farm that will be 10 times the size of the nation's first offshore wind farm.
Deepwater Wind says the new 400-megawatt wind farm will also create more than 800 jobs and result in $250 million in investments in Rhode Island.
Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo and other officials visited the Port of Providence on Wednesday for the announcement.
Massachusetts and Rhode Island announced offshore wind projects last week aimed at delivering a combined 1,200 megawatts of energy, enough to power about 600,000 homes.
Deepwater Wind also built the nation's first offshore wind farm off Block Island, Rhode Island. It has five turbines. With this latest project, the company plans to build up to 50 turbines south of Martha's Vineyard.
"It is an enormous clean energy machine," Deepwater Wind CEO Jeff Grybowski said. "It will displace about 650,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide every year. It is one of the most consequential clean energy projects in the history of the northeast United States. And we're going to build it and deliver that at low cost."
Grybowski said they couldn't say exactly what the price of the energy will be because Deepwater Wind must negotiate a contract with utility company National Grid. They said it would be competitive with traditional sources of fuel and a "game changer" in replacing those sources.
The company says it will take about 800 people and roughly $1 billion to build the wind farm. Another 50 permanent jobs will be created.
The $250 million investment in Rhode Island includes $40 million in port infrastructure improvements to position the state for future offshore wind projects.
Raimondo called it a fantastic day for Rhode Island because of the amount of clean energy that will be produced and the number jobs created. They said Rhode Island can be an epicenter for the offshore wind industry. They said they think some of the companies that make turbines will eventually move to the state.
"This is big. This is about as big as it gets," they said.
Deepwater Wind didn't ask for tax credits for the project, called Revolution Wind.
Both the Rhode Island and Massachusetts wind farms, which the states describe as a collaborative effort, will be located south of Martha's Vineyard. The Vineyard Wind project will be Massachusetts' first offshore wind farm.
Local construction on the Revolution Wind project could start in Rhode Island in 2020 with commercial operations by 2023. The turbines are expected to generate enough energy to power more than 200,000 homes, or about half the homes in Rhode Island.
The wind farm will be in a 256-square-mile federal lease area. Deepwater Wind plans to build 15 turbines in that same area to supply renewable energy to Long Island, New York.
Pop culture toy company Funko wants to help you start the day off right with a new line of breakfast cereals. Yes, really.
The company is putting out its own cereal line this summer featuring characters from its Pop! Vinyl figure collection like Mega Man, Cuphead, Gollum, Jason Voorhees, and Freddy Krueger. Because nothing says “beloved cereal mascot” like mass murderers that hunt children with sharp objects and distinctive headgear.
“Funko, purveyors of pop culture and all things awesome, is committed to helping you start the day off right by putting the fun back in breakfast with FunkO's,” the company said in a blog post on Monday. “And as we all know from Saturday morning commercials; every breakfast starts with a bowl of brightly colored cereal that comes out of a box with a really cool mascot on the front and a prize inside!”
Each box contains O-shaped cereal in an alarming shade of red, blue or green, plus a collectible figure. But, you're going to have to do some traveling to grab them all. Starting in July, the Mega Man FunkO's will be available at GameStop, while the Cuphead and Mugman boxes will be at Hot Topic. You can get the Freddy Krueger and Jason FunkO's at FYE and the Gollum FunkO's at BoxLunch. Finally, Freddy FunkO's will be available through Funko itself.
The toy company said it plans to add additional cereals throughout the year.
Funko isn't the first pop culture company to mine Saturday morning nostalgia for fun and profit. Last year, Nintendo teamed up with Kellogg's to create a Super Mario cereal with marshmallow power-ups. The box also included Amiibo functionality that awarded gold coins or a heart to “Super Mario Odyssey” players when they tapped the box on their Nintendo Switch.
Traffic cops have issued vital driving advice to coincide with our campaign calling on the Government to improve road safety on the A19.
The Safe A19 campaign was launched after the dual-carriageway saw two serious collisions in a space of a few days.
Our campaign is pressing the Department for Transport to launch an inquiry into the safety of the road.
It has been backed by Easington MP Grahame Morris and is also supported by Hartlepool MP Mike Hill.
Officers from the Cleveland and Durham Specialist Operations Unit urged drivers to show consideration and common sense.
Inspector Jon Curtis said: “When joining traffic on a slip road, you should try to join at a speed that is similar to that of the traffic you are joining and only if there is a sufficient gap in the traffic flow for you to do so safely without impeding other drivers.
Many people still continue to drive at speeds that are inappropriate for the types of road they are on and for the weather conditions Inspector Jon Curtis, Cleveland and Durham Specialist Operations Unit
“If you cannot do this then you must stop and wait until there is a large enough gap to pull into the lane, once again without forcing other vehicles to slow down.
“By the same token if you are in the left hand lane of a dual carriageway and you notice that a vehicle is approaching the junction to join your lane, check your mirrors and your blind spot and if it is safe to do so, move into the right hand lane. This allows the approaching vehicle to join the carriageway without slowing down.
“You should spend most of the time in the left hand lane, with the right being reserved for overtaking or turning right where you are permitted to do so.
“Do not hog an overtaking lane as this can cause frustration to those behind you who want to use the lane correctly.
“The speed restrictions on dual carriageways will depend on their location and the amount of traffic they have to deal with.
“Generally in non-urban areas the maximum speed limit is 70mph. This speed restriction may be lower in built-up areas, so take observe these variations.
“Many people still continue to drive at speeds that are inappropriate for the types of road they are on and for the weather conditions. Always drive within the speed limits of the road you are travelling on and adjust them downwards when weather conditions deteriorate.
“You should always take care not drive too closely to any vehicle in front of you.
“As a minimum, you should try to allow two seconds between your vehicle and the vehicle in front.
“This distance should be increased for speeds of 50mph or above, and at least doubled or more for poor weather conditions.”

End of a memorable journey? More
What's the story?
As per media reports, a senior BCCI official recently stated that veteran Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh is not in contention for the ICC World Cup 2019. The official cited various reasons for the same and explained that there are many younger cricketers who can be groomed to replace Singh in preparation for the big tournament.
"His batting has lost sting. They rarely bowl and their fielding has gone down a few notches. If we have to prepare a team for 2019 World Cup, we have to take a call now. In case of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, we still don't have a replacement but Yuvraj's place has multiple contenders," the official told the Press Trust of India.
Yuvraj played in the ICC Champions Trophy that was hosted by England earlier this year. They were also a part of the ODI squad that travelled to West Indies last month. Barring a couple of good performances, the left-hander struggled in both the series and failed to make a mark.
In case you didn't know...
India's squad for the limited overs series against Sri Lanka was announced yesterday (August 13), and Singh was not included in the same. Youngster KL Rahul was recalled to the national side after recovering from their shoulder injury, and replaced the Punjab batsman in the squad.
Attacking batsman Dinesh Karthik was also swapped for Manish Pandey, who had an excellent tour with the India A side in South Africa earlier this month.
The details
Singh played their last ODI match, against West Indies last month More
Singh has been in and out of the side for the past few years and it looks increasingly difficult for them to make their way into the playing XI one more time.
MSK Prasad, chairperson of the national selectors, recently said that the door hasn't been closed on Yuvraj, but also stated that fitness will be the parameter for all national selections henceforth.
What's next?
Prasad said that the selectors have locked in on 22-24 players for the World Cup and will look to try and test them in the next 4-5 months.
Yuvraj should start preparing for their next opportunity immediately so that they are ready to fire on all cylinders if and when he's given a chance to play in the ODI side once again.
Author's take
The chances of the southpaw making a comeback into the side look very bleak, at least for now. Age is not on their side and they would really have to do something extraordinary to fight their way back into international cricket.
However, Yuvraj is nothing if not a fighter. It remains to be seen if the left-hander can fight their way out of this hole, which might just be the toughest one he's ever dug themselves into in their cricketing career.

Donald Trump has burst with pride since they won the U.S. presidential election last November.
They were so proud of their Electoral College victory, which they took with an initial count of 306 votes to Hillary Clinton's 232, that they distributed copies of an election map to Reuters reporters in April.
Trump has also highlighted their achievement by noting that it's more difficult for Republicans to win the Electoral College.
They did this in December, just after their Electoral College win was confirmed with a tally of 304 votes to Clinton's 227.
Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2016
And they said it again in April.
I did what was an almost impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2017
But is they right about that? Yes and no, if you ask one law professor.
And if you ask an expert in the system, he'll tell you that the Electoral College helps to ensure fair and competitive elections.
The Electoral College gives every state as many votes as it has representatives and senators in Congress, according to the U.S. House of Representatives.
The number of seats in the House of Representatives is determined proportionally, by population, while every state has two senators.
Take California, for example. It has 53 seats in the House, and two in the Senate, giving it a total of 55 Electoral College votes.
Wyoming, meanwhile, has one representative and two senators, giving it three Electoral College votes.
Once elections are finished, electors in each state meet and cast their ballots for president and vice-president — and usually for the candidate who received a plurality in the state.
READ MORE: Donald Trump records Electoral College win despite protests across U.S.
The system was designed as part of the “Great Compromise,” an agreement reached in 1787 that decided how Americans would be represented at a congressional level, Gary Gregg, a University of Louisville professor, told Global News.
It was an agreement that convinced all U.S. states to join the union, as it gave each state, including ones with smaller populations, two electoral votes to account for their senators.
It's a system that, as it functions now, “gives us good competitive elections requiring the winner to speak to both bigger and smaller states, achieve both some rural and urban votes,” Gregg told Global News.
The last few elections have shown that the Electoral College system supports “competitive elections that can be won by both candidates and both parties,” they added, noting Republican and Democratic victories over the past 13 years.

But not everyone feels the way Gregg does.
Shortly after Trump won the election, David S. Cohen, a professor at Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law, wrote in Rolling Stone that “The Electoral College rigged the election for Donald Trump.”
They argued that the system, at this point in history, “tilts the playing field in favour of candidates who appeal to low-population states and a small set of contested ‘swing' states.
Cohen did some math comparing the number of Electoral College votes in California vs. Wyoming.
They noted that, with 55 Electoral College votes, California has one per 670,000 people.
READ MORE: Results of the 2016 U.S. election
Meanwhile, Wyoming has three Electoral College votes with a smaller population, enough that there's one for every 186,000 people — giving it “four times the power” of people in California in this system, they wrote.
Trump did better in a number of states with lower populations — like Wyoming, where they won just over 70 per cent of the vote.
Ergo, the Electoral College is “structurally tilted toward the Republicans in that it gives outsized influence to the small states,” Cohen told Global News in an email.
But Trump is right in one sense, they added — the Democrats have the edge in high-population states such as California and New York, giving them a line on a hefty number of Electoral College votes.
However, just because there are more Democratic voters doesn't mean that the system gives the party an outright advantage.
“It doesn't tilt toward the Democrats as much as pure democracy should tilt in their favour because the Electoral College structurally tilts toward the Republicans,” Cohen said.
“Best proof of this? Of the elections since 2000, Democrats have won the popular vote four times out of five, but have only won two of those elections.
“Why? Because the Democrats get more votes but the Electoral College's structure helps Republicans.”

The Electoral College has proven a source of controversy, even if it has produced differing results in successive elections.
After Trump's win, Democratic lawmakers in a number of states joined an effort to introduce legislation in which Electoral College voters would cast ballots for presidential candidates who earned the most votes across the United States.
But if you ask Gregg, the system as it works in the U.S. right now gives voters “good competitive elections.”
“Bush won it in 2004, Obama in 2008, Trump in 2016,” they said. “Seems pretty competitive and balanced to me.”
Thiruvananthapuram: Thousands of fishermen on Monday took out a march to the Raj Bhavan in Thiruvananthapuram demanding a coordinated search operation to trace missing fishermen and a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Ockhi-hit areas even as the toll in the cyclone rose to 42.
The fishermen from coastal villages in the district under the aegis of the Latin Catholic church also demanded that the Centre declare the calamity as a national disaster.
The protesters waving black flags and photos of the dead and missing fishermen walked about two kms from Palayam to Raj Bhavan raising slogans, bringing the traffic to a standstill on the busy stretch.
Addressing the gathering, Latin Catholic church head Archbishop Soosai Pakiyam, who led the march, said it was a matter of grave concern that still the authorities "are unable to come out with the exact number of fishermen missing in the cyclone."
They wanted a coordinated effort by fisheries department, marine enforcement and coast guard to trace the missing men, who had put out to sea on 29-30 November when the cyclone struck the state.
The toll in the cyclone and rain-related incidents rose to 42 on Monday with the recovery of two more bodies about 100-150 nautical miles from the shore between Vizhinjam and Kochi, official sources said.
The search operations by multiple agencies to trace the missing fishermen entered the 11th day on Monday.
On Sunday, the fishermen in the coastal villages of Vizhinjam, Poonthura, Pozhiyur and Adimalathura near Thiruvananthapuram had observed a day of prayer and sought Central funds for rehabilitation of the affected families.
A message, read out during the special prayer meetings in the churches, had said the cyclone should be declared as a national disaster and urged the Centre to provide more funds for rehabilitation of the victims.
As per the figures released by the Latin Church, more than 300 fishermen were still missing, while the official estimate of the missing men is 95.
The state government has also demanded a financial assistance of Rs 1,834 crore from the centre in view of the loss suffered due to the cyclone.
On 9 December, the government had requested the Navy, the Coast Guard and the Indian Air Force to continue the search operations for the missing fishermen for another 10 days.

Islamabad - Former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief selector and head coach Mohsin Khan lashes out at the PCB for not handling tainted players' case properly, due to which Pakistan cricket has been suffering badly.
Talking exclusively to The Nation, Mohsin said: “If PCB had fully implemented Justice Qayyum recommendations and given exemplary punishments to the involved persons, things could have been completely different and it would have sent a very clear message to cricketing world that there is absolutely no room for cheaters and Pakistan know well, how to deal with the players, who try to inflict damages on national cause. Pakistan is like mother to all, so doing anything wrong or even thinking about it, means we are selling our own mother.”
Mohsin said: “The Pakistan Super League (PSL) is a bundle of lies and it is nothing, as only a few certain individuals trying to pose that it is a huge achievement. Look at the international players hired, as the majority of them had retired from international cricket or representing their countries, while those left don't enjoy automatic spot. Holding the PSL final in Lahore doesn't mean a lot, as the entire PSL should have been conducted in Pakistan.
“I know Pakistan is facing security issues, but with the active sacrifices of our armed forces and government, terrorism menace is almost under control. I, along with a few former PCB chairpeople, seriously think that we could have waited for a year or two before conducting the PSL in Pakistan. Our masses deserve to watch the PSL at home soil,” they added.
Mohsin has said that the leagues are conducted keeping in mind a few certain things. “Firstly, PCB is not bankrupt, secondly Pakistan is playing international cricket both at home and abroad. What does Pakistan cricket achieve from the first PSL edition, only one player in form of M Nawaz and they too aren't given proper chance in national team in any format of the game.
“Thinking about including T20 players in Test or ODIs is a clear indication that people sitting at the helm of affairs doesn't know the ABC of cricket. Other international countries started their leagues when they are on top in all the formats. The PCB should have first worked on improving domestic structure, then international level and after that, they should start work on the PSL or any such projects. They are in haste and make decisions in haste. It wasn't ideal time for starting the PSL,” they added.
About Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif involved in fixing scam, Mohsin said: “Frankly speaking, it was PCB's failure, as they let the culprits off the hook. After the punishment of five year, when the PCB gives chance to the tainted players once again, it will send a very negative message to the youngsters, who will then take fixing lightly. In my view, lifetime bans were the only solution to clear cricket from corruption. I seriously hope and pray both Shrjeel and Khalid may come clear if they are innocent, but if they are involved, then they must be given exemplary punishments.”
“Already crowds presence at the UAE was very thin and now people watching the PSL on television screens also dropped to a very considerable number. It is high time when neat and clean people must take over PCB and used bullets and persons, who had inflicted huge damages on Pakistan cricket, must be taken to task.
This is the only way of saving Pakistan cricket from further downslide and restoring the confidence of international community in Pakistan cricket,” Mohsin concluded.

ISLAMABAD - The Islamabad High Court Tuesday directed the Inter Services Intelligence to clear road in front of its office within four weeks.
Besides this, a single bench of IHC comprising Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui also granted exemption to Secretary Ministry of Defence and Director General (DG) Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) from appearing before the court in a petition against encroachment in the federal capital.
Justice Siddiqui directed them to open the road, clear the encroachments and submit the report in this connection before the court.
Previously, the IHC bench had noted in its order: “Request is allowed. On said date i.e 4-7-3018, Secretary Ministry of Defence along with Director General (DG) Inter Services Intelligence shall appear in person.”
In this regard, the Ministry of Defence sought exemption for its Secretary and Director General Inter-Services Intelligence from appearance before the court. The ministry also sought six-week time from the IHC to plan for alternate security arrangements for the ISI's headquarters.
The application moved by Defence Ministry's Deputy Director Legal Lt Commander PN Shafiq-Ur-Rehman stating that a direction dated May 23, 2018 was issued to the ministry to explain its actions with regard to enhanced security measures covering the road and land in front of the ISI Headquarters.
It added that the ministry in its report dated June 20, 2018 had explained that due to deteriorating security situation in Pakistan, and loss of precious lives of servicemen from 2008 onwards certain additional security measures were warranted imminently.
The said report had also highlighted the fact in view of the unprecedented scale, all government institutions especially the law enforcement and intelligence agencies were constrained to adopt enhanced security measures.
The applicant in its report, dated 21.06.2018, also drew attention to the fact that these were not idle threats or hypothetical scenarios, wherein the ISI was merely one potential target among many. Rather, several of its establishments and offices have come under attack resulting in loss of life and property.
It further stated that the ministry with other respondent in the case entered into the consultative process and a consensus was developed which maintained a balance between the need for security and ensuring that the general public was not inconvenienced or encumbered in any way. It was as a result of this consensus that the current security arrangement was established on temporary basis.
“In order to allow an unhindered flow of traffic, alternate roads were constructed from the main roads in front of the ISI Headquarters, specifically connecting the Kashmir Highway and Khayaban-e-Suharwardy,” said the application.
The ministry further submitted that no inconvenience was being caused to the general public rather they have been facilitated by providing an alternative route without any risk to their security and safety.
It further added that the MoD was in process of planning for management of security measures with regard to the ISI Headquarters.
“The Headquarters building is old and was not constructed keeping in view the current security threats. The road Khayaban-e-Suharwardy is right outside the said building and there is no buffer zone between the two. In case it is opened immediately without taking further necessary security measures, this can have catastrophic effects on the agency,” the application contended.
It added that due to set of old buildings, proximity of main building to the road and other security vulnerabilities, it was not only impossible to shift the current management immediately without having a complete alternative security arrangement in place, but would also be detrimental to the lives of hundreds of employees that work in the building, who are declared targets of many factions of terrorists, supported by foreign hands.
The application, however, stated that the security vulnerabilities shall not be listed in public filing.
The application also requested the IHC to modify its earlier orders dated June 22 and June 29 of 2018 regarding summoning of defence secretary and DG ISI, adding the applicant and potentially the general public will suffer irreparable loss if these orders were not modified.
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Protesters clashed with police trying to reclaim disputed religious artefacts from a museum in Catalonia on Monday, in the latest display of tension between Catalan separatists and Spain's central government ahead of a Dec. 21 election. A monastery in neighbouring Aragon region says over 44 of its artefacts were sold illegally to Catalonia in the 1980s and the issue has become a symbol of broader disagreement between opponents and supporters of Catalan independence. Culture Minister Inigo Mendez de Vigo angered Catalan nationalists in November by using special temporary powers to accept a petition by a judge from Aragon calling for the artefacts to be returned to their previous home, the Monastery of Sijena. The previous month, Madrid took control of Catalonia to quell the crisis over secession and called a snap regional election. Mossos d'Esquadra (Catalan regional police officers) scuffle with protestors in front of the Museum of Leida after police entered the museum to carry out an order and return over 40 contested artworks to the Spanish region of Aragon following a protracted legal battle in Lleida, Spain, December 11, 2017. REUTERS/Albert SalameHundreds of demonstrators on Monday massed at the museum of Lleida in western Catalonia where the artefacts were kept and pro-independence groups called supporters to stop the police from removing them. There were minor scuffles, though no injuries were reported and the artefacts were eventually taken away at around noon. Slideshow (2 Images)Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, currently in self-imposed exile in Brussels, criticised the move on Twitter and blamed the three principal unionist parties running in upcoming elections, the ruling People's party (PP), the socialist party and Ciudadanos. “Carried out at night and using a militarised police force, as always, and taking advantage of a coup d‘etat to plunder Catalonia with complete impunity: This is the model that Ciudadanos, PSC and PP defend,” Puigdemont said. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said their government could not oppose court rulings because it would mean stepping outside the rule of law.

NEW YORK POST:
A passenger was taken into custody Wednesday after landing in Charlotte, NC, for attacking three airline crew members during the flight.
Charlene Sarieann Harriott, 36, was aboard an American Airlines flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to Charlotte on Wednesday morning. As the flight began its descent, Harriott, who was seated at the rear of the plane, reportedly ran from their seat toward the cockpit.
Flight attendants, who had taken their seats when Harriott bolted from the last row, ordered them to stop. When Harriott did not, the flight attendants gave chase down the aisle.
The crew restrained them with duct tape and zip ties in the first-class section of the plane, the Charlotte Observer reports, but Harriott “became more aggressive and physically violent toward the flight crew.”
This week's guests include Jarrod Suffecool, Intelligence Team Lead for Binary Defense, who takes us on a fascinating journey through the Dark Web (darknet). You'll learn about the unsavory activities that include “crime-as-a-service” — professional hacking kits and criminal services (created or offered by skilled hackers) that anyone can buy or rent online, and they're often very inexpensive. This makes it easier for less skilled criminals to pull off sophisticated attacks and scams, and we'll see a lot of this by tax fraud rings over the next two months. You'll also learn about Tor, the browser used to access Dark Web. Binary Defense Systems specializes in monitoring and infiltrating criminal marketplaces on the Dark Web to protect businesses and uncover evidence of crimes.
You'll also hear from author/publisher Joe Kissell, of Take Control Books. Joe talks about some of the problems he's encountered with macOS High Sierra, and about the decline in the quality of Apple's operating systems. What about reports that Apple is cutting back on planned features for iOS 12 to emphasize reliability. Also discussed: The apparent failure of Apple's “underpromise and overdeliver” policy by postponing features in new products that aren't ready for prime time, including the delays in expanding support for the APFS file system to Fusion drives and Time Machine. What about the complexities and reliability problems of iCloud, which is a cornerstone of Apple's services? Joe mentions that he's had to backup and restore their new Mac after owning it for less than a month, and Gene talks about the very worst Mac they ever owned, one that required constant repairs from Apple in the short time they owned it.
A tactical helicopter squadron based in Edmonton departed for northern Iraq on Monday.
Sixty members of the Royal Canadian Air Force's (CAF) 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron, based at the 3rd Canadian Division Support Base in Edmonton, are assuming duties to fight ISIS as part of Operation IMPACT.

Squadron members will fly and maintain up to four CH-146 Griffon helicopters, which provide tactical transport for Canadian troops and material near Erbil, Iraq.
“We provide air power that integrates with and supports our CAF and coalition partners. The tactical helicopter detachment is a crucial component of this commitment,” Major-General Christian Drouin, Commander 1 Canadian Air Division, said.
“430 Squadron has done a tremendous job over the past few months, maintaining a level of excellence that I know 408 Squadrons will continue.”

In a sign that contract negotiations will go down to the wire, talks between the Writers Guild of America and Hollywood's major studios and networks have been put on hold for one week as the two sides move closer to the May 1 deadline with no agreement in sight.
Both sides issued a statement late Monday saying that they have agreed to resume negotiations April 25. Neither side elaborated on the situation but they had been scheduled to meet Monday after the Easter holiday weekend.
It remains unclear what transpired Monday behind closed doors but the breakdown in talks so close to the deadline indicates that little progress has been made in the negotiations, which began in March.
This marks the second time that negotiations have fallen through. The two sides walked away from the table March 24 after the guild said producers balked at their demands. The producers claimed that the writers walked away first, which the guild has denied.
The WGA is engaged in discussions with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the major studios, networks and independent producers. The two groups have been bickering over issues including compensation and benefits, with the writers demanding more pay and greater employer contributions to the health plan.
An online strike authorization vote is set to begin Tuesday and conclude April 24, the day before talks are set to resume. The last time the WGA struck was in 2007, with a work stoppage that lasted 100 days and brought much of the Hollywood industry to a halt.

(Reuters) - Barcelona have agreed a deal with Guangzhou Evergrande to sign midfielder Paulinho for 40 million euros ($47.16 million), the Spanish club announced on Monday.
The 29-year-old Brazilian will have a release clause of 120 million euros in a reported four-year contract, and will undertake medical tests before being presented on Thursday at the Nou Camp.

Philanthropists Melanie and Richard Lundquist have donated $32 million to Torrance Memorial Medical Center to improve neurological, orthopedic and spinal care at the hospital.
The gift announced this week brings the couple's total contributions to the hospital to $100 million over the last 11 years. The sum is the most a single donor has given to a hospital that isn't a research or teaching facility since the Chronicle of Philanthropy began tracking donations over $1 million in 2005.
Melanie Lundquist said that without a teaching hospital, residents of the South Bay don't always have access to the most advanced medical care. They have to leave the region for certain procedures, which can be inconvenient or even dangerous.
“It dawned on me about 20 years ago that if I had a heart attack at 4 p.m. in the afternoon I was DOA if I had to go to Cedars,” said Lundquist, who lives in Palos Verdes Estates. “Top-notch care should not depend on your ZIP Code.”
In 2013, the Lundquists donated $50 million for the creation of a patient building at the hospital with all private rooms, now called the Lundquist Tower. The couple had previously donated $18 million for other hospital upgrades, including the Lundquist Cardiovascular Institute, they said.
The $32-million gift will go toward the creation of an orthopedic and spine institute as well as a neuroscience institute. Patients will no longer need to be referred out of the South Bay for neurological care, Torrance Memorial Chief Executive Craig Leach said.
The hospital will also use the money to provide better stroke care. Leach estimated that about 2,000 patients a year in the South Bay will require advanced stroke care.
“That's not something you want to get on the 405 Freeway and make your way to Cedars or UCLA for,” they said.
Some of the funding will also go toward improving the care delivered to surgical and intensive care unit patients, they said.
The $32-million donation is the second-largest gift this year to a healthcare provider or organization, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. It's among the 60 biggest gifts in the healthcare sector since 2005.
“I call them heroes,” Leach said of the Lundquists. “We really are indebted to them.”
Most donations to healthcare organizations go to research institutes, such as those trying to cure cancer, or to hospitals testing out the latest technologies or therapies to treat rare medical conditions. But Melanie Lundquist, who volunteered at the hospital's front desk for more than a decade, said they saw firsthand the vital services Torrance Memorial provides.
“The medical needs in the community are no different than the medical needs of the community that does live near a teaching and training hospital,” they said.
L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn, who represents the South Bay, said the Lundquists' donation helps ensure healthcare is accessible for the community.
“By focusing resources on improving a key community hospital, the Lundquists are helping to strengthen the safety net for health care in our entire region,” they said in a statement.

Mal Pugh, who last summer became the youngest U.S. player to score a goal in Olympic soccer competition, is leaving UCLA to turn pro after playing just three spring games for the Bruins.
Pugh, 18, who also scored in their international debut last year, enrolled at UCLA in the winter quarter and was due to begin their first-year student season next fall.
“This decision was certainly not easy for me to make,” Pugh, who was the top recruit in the country coming out of Colorado's Mountain Vista High School, said in a statement. “UCLA is such a special place, and being a Bruin was an incredible thing. UCLA soccer brought amazing things to my life, and chasing after a national championship with my friends and teammates would've been special. But I could not turn down this opportunity.”
Pugh has given no public indication if they intend to play in the U.S.' National Women's Soccer League or in Europe.
Pugh has played 22 games with the national team, scoring four times — including a go-ahead goal against Colombia in Olympic group play — and earning 10 assists. They also are honored as the 2015 U.S. Soccer young female player of the year and won both the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards at the 2015 CONCACAF U-20 women's championships.

Said he: “Let me first of all sincerely thank you, our father the Sultan, for what you are doing for this country, working tirelessly to ring peace and to bring unity to the people. So for all of us this is what is meant by one Nigeria.
“We cannot run away from this country. The unity of this country is very, very paramount. The unity of this country is non-negotiable. I am from the Niger Delta, from Rivers State to be specific so I cannot see us in a divided country. No way. We stand for the unity of this country,” Wike added.
According to the governor, their administration has put a lot of time, resources and energy to protect national assets especially the ones in Rivers State.
“In Rivers you hardly find pipeline vandalisation. We are working at all times to protect national assets in our state. In my state, I am governor for all the people living in the state. I am not a governor of a particular political party, but a governor for all the people of Rivers State.”
While commending the Sultan for their leadership of the Muslim community in Nigeria, Wike said they were in Sokoto to felicitate with their colleague, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who gave out their daughter in marriage on Saturday.
They equally dispelled the notion that their relationship with Tambuwal had political connotation, saying has been their friend for a long time, “long before politics defined who we are now.”
“Tambuwal is my friend for a long time. If anything affects him, it affects me also. If they give out their daughter in marriage, I have to be here to support him. If any problem happens to him, it affects me as well.
“Your Eminence I am here to seek your royal blessing. You have blessed me before, that is why I am growing. So let me wish you a prosperous new year ahead,” they added.
In their remarks, both the host governor and Sultan implored Nigerians to live in peace with one another, and wished their countrymen and women a year full of happiness and blessings.

New Delhi: The Congress on Saturday accused the BJP government of conspiring against it, saying it (the CBI moving SC to reopen Bofors case) was being done to "save itself from facing public backlash in the 2019 general elections" and to divert attention from its failures.
"The decision of the Delhi High Court in the Bofors case established how Congress leadership, including (former prime minister) Rajiv Gandhi, was a victim of the smear campaign of the BJP decades ago," Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters.
Hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Surjewala said: "The smear campaign of the BJP against the Congress was exposed in 1991 by the people's mandate. And even after the death of Rajiv Gandhi the top courts exposed their conspiracies."
The Congress leader was referring to the Delhi High Court ruling of 4 February, 2004, giving a clean chit to Rajiv Gandhi in the Rs 64-crore Bofors pay-off case.
The court in its order said that no convincing evidence has been brought before it to prove that they received any kickbacks in the Rs 1,437 crore deal to buy 155 mm Howitzer guns from AB Bofors of Sweden.
Surjewala's remarks came a day after the CBI filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the 2005 Delhi High Court verdict discharging Britain-based Hinduja brothers - Srichand, Gopichand and Prakash Hinduja - in the case of alleged corruption in the purchase of Bofors 155 mm howitzers.
Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, Surjewala alleged that the "conspirator BJP government under Modiji is indulging in cheap politics by using the Bofors issue again to divert the attention of the public from the real issues".
"A failed Modi government is using such cheap tricks to save itself from being dethroned in 2019.
"They are indulging in cheap politics but they are not going to succeed," the Congress leader said.
Surjewala also said that even Attorney General KK Venugopal in their letter said that there is no evidence or truth in the case.
"Despite that, after 27 years of the death of Rajiv Gandhi, filing an appeal in the courts exposes the Modi government," they said.
The Rajiv Gandhi government (1984-89) was rocked over the allegations of kickbacks in the purchase of 155 mm howitzers from the Swedish arms manufacturer.
The CBI on 22 January, 1990, registered an FIR for alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery under the provisions of Indian Penal Code and sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Martin Ardbo, the then president of AB Bofors, alleged middleman Win Chadha and the Hindujas.
Protesters in North Carolina have toppled a long-standing statue of a Confederate soldier.
Activists on Monday evening used a rope to pull down the monument outside a Durham courthouse. Video footage posted online shows protesters – some white, some black – kicking the crumpled bronze statue as dozens of people in the crowd cheered and chanted.

The Durham protest was in response to a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. One woman was killed Saturday after one of the white nationalists drove their car into a group of peaceful counterprotesters.

What we learned in the Rams' 43-35 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles:
Jared Goff remains in search of a defining fourth-quarter drive
The Rams quarterback had two opportunities in the final quarter to lead their team to victory.
But they lost a fumble that enabled the Eagles to take the lead.
Then, with the Rams trailing by two points with less than four minutes left, Goff could not complete a third-down pass to Sammy Watkins, forcing the Rams to punt.
Todd Gurley needs more carries
Coach Sean McVay might be concerned about overworking their star running back, but Gurley had only 13 carries against the Eagles on a day when they were producing big chunks of yardage.
Leading in the fourth quarter, McVay could have put the ball almost exclusively in Gurley's hands for a long drive to take time off the clock.
Instead, Goff was stripped of the ball on a pass play.
Penalties are a problem
The Eagles sustained a key drive because of two penalties, and the Rams lost opportunities because of others.
Cornerback Trumaine Johnson suffered a concussion, so they were not available after the game to discuss the unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty that enabled the Eagles to continue a touchdown drive.
Eagles receiver Alshon Jeffery noted that they and Johnson were only jawing.
But McVay said officials had issued a warning.
Regardless, in a game as big as Sunday's, those kinds of miscues were particularly costly.
Secondary depth is going to be tested
Kayvon Webster suffered a torn Achilles. Johnson is in concussion protocol.
That means the Rams will travel to Seattle this week relying on backup cornerbacks.
Nickell Robey-Coleman can start at one spot. Troy Hill and Kevin Peterson are other cornerbacks on the roster.
Safeties Lamarcus Joyner, Blake Countess and John Johnson all have experience as cornerbacks and also could figure in the equation.

The Rams are suddenly vulnerable at both offensive tackle spots
The Rams have been fortunate that the same five offensive linemen have started every game.
That could change this week.
Left tackle Andrew Whitworth and right tackle Rob Havenstein both suffered ankle injuries against the Eagles.
Whitworth left the game but returned. Havenstein did not.
Darrell Williams filled in for both.
Williams was in when former Rams defensive lineman Chris Long came off the left edge and stripped Goff of the ball.
Guard Rodger Saffold has experience at tackle, and guard Jamon Brown worked at tackle during the offseason.
Cooper Kupp has big-play capability
The rookie receiver faked out two would-be tacklers en route to a 64-yard gain.
Kupp finished with five catches for 118 yards and a touchdown.
They have 56 catches this season, a Rams rookie record.
There was excitement in the air when Mexican negotiators sat down 25 years ago with their counterparts from Canada and the United States to hammer out what would become the North American Free Trade Agreement.
“Negotiations were tough, but there was a consensus about the end game,” recalled Antonio Ortiz-Mena, a member of Mexico's negotiating team. “We knew we all really wanted this agreement.”
That sense of collaboration toward a common goal will be missing when Mexican officials arrive in Washington this week to begin rewriting the terms of the landmark deal that abolished duties on goods moving across North America.
The renegotiation process was triggered in April by President Trump, who has repeatedly blamed NAFTA for the hemorrhaging of U.S. manufacturing jobs, and whose chief trade representative says closing the roughly $60-billion trade gap with Mexico will be a top priority during the talks that begin Wednesday.
“The problem is, there's a sense [in Mexico] that victory for Trump will have to come at the expense of Mexico,” Ortiz-Mena said, noting that Trump's negotiators have threatened to pull out of the deal altogether if they don't get what they want. “They've said: ‘If we're not happy, we're withdrawing.'”
Despite that hostile backdrop and the fact that Mexico, like Canada, did not want to open up the treaty to changes, Mexican officials insist they will enter the negotiating room with clear goals, which, if achieved, could end up benefiting Mexico.
A list of objectives released by the government Aug. 2 called for incorporating energy, financial services and telecommunications into an updated agreement.
Those sectors were largely left out of the original trade deal because in Mexico they were still under government control when NAFTA took force in 1994. They have since been privatized, and Mexican officials and industry leaders hope to include provisions in the new deal that will encourage more foreign investment in those industries.
Mexican officials may also push for a guest worker program in the U.S. — a proposal likely to be fiercely opposed by labor-aligned members of the U.S. Congress — and to look for ways to include smaller companies in trade.
Those are the things Mexico hopes to achieve. Then there are the things it desperately wants to avoid.
Mexico will fiercely oppose any proposal to add tariffs to goods moving across the border — its economy secretary recently threatened to pull back on cooperation on migration and security matters if new taxes are imposed. Mexico also will seek to preserve the dispute resolution mechanism known as Chapter 19 — a tool U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said they want to eliminate.
Under Chapter 19, complaints about illegal subsidies or dumping — that's when a country exports a product at prices lower than what is charged in the domestic market — are heard by binational panels that issue binding decisions. The U.S. has frequently lost those cases, and wants the ability to independently sanction industries that it believes are violating fair trade rules. Mexico has said it is open to modify the chapter but not eliminating it.
Mexico will also be paying close attention to Lighthizer's stated efforts to strengthen the “rules of origin” that dictate how much North American content a product must have in order to cross borders duty-free.
One thing is certain. Whatever the deal is, it will have to appease Trump.
As was evident in the recently released transcript of their January phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, in which Trump acknowledged that making Mexico pay for a border wall was "the least important thing we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important,” Trump is focused on the appearance of victory.
“The [Mexican] negotiators understand that they must end up with something that President Trump can sell as a win,” said Pamela Starr, a professor of international relations at USC.
While the talks will be difficult — Lighthizer is known as a tough-nosed negotiator who advocates for “fair trade” as opposed to “free trade” — there is a palpable sense in Mexico that things could have been much worse.
After all, as recently as April, Trump was threatening to withdraw from NAFTA completely. (Many legal scholars believe Trump would need congressional approval to do so.)
But Lighthizer's July letter to Congress outlining the administration's intentions suggest Trump is now seeking a revision of NAFTA, rather than its destruction. Missing in the document was Trump's January threat of a 20% tax on imports from Mexico and other countries with which the U.S. has a trade deficit.
Mexico's economy, which saw the peso plummet after Trump's election, has largely recovered in part because many have faith that an agreement can be made.
“It's not as disastrous as people have feared,” said Ortiz-Mena, now a senior advisor at the international business consulting firm Albright Stonebridge Group. Still, they said, “it's difficult to brag about what you didn't lose.”
The trade talks will take place over several rounds of negotiations held in each of the three countries. The final agreement will have to be approved by the legislative or parliamentary branches of each country.
Experts say winning the approval of the U.S. Congress may prove as difficult as hammering out terms of the agreement with Canada and Mexico because some Republicans and labor-aligned Democrats don't like it.
Mexico's Chamber of Commerce has hired a top Washington lobbying firm to help, and Mexican firms are working with the CEOs of major U.S. businesses for an upcoming media campaign promoting U.S.-Mexico ties.
It's a replay of the intense public relations campaign waged in the early 1990s, when Mexican officials toured the interior of the U.S., talking up the agreement at town halls and to newspaper editorial boards. Back then, NAFTA proponents in all three countries faced strong fears back home that the deal would hurt local economies.
Eriberto Eddie Perez, father of two and husband to Debi Higgins, was the second of two men killed in workplace shootings Thursday, allegedly by Vernest James Griffin.
Investigators say they were shot multiple times in the back.
Its not yet clear what connection Griffin had with Perez or Aluminum Blanking, Inc. in Pontiac, where the shooting occurred.
Perez, 58, is being remembered as a family man with a strong religious faith. A vigil is being planned in their memory outside Aluminum Blanking, where Perez worked for 15 years. A time and date has not yet been set, but according to Rahim Harris of Pontiac, who is organizing the vigil, its expected to happen within the next couple days.

Information on funeral services is not yet available.
Laura Anderson released this statement on behalf of Aluminum Blanking:
On Thursday, Feb. 1, 2018, Aluminum Blanking Company tragically lost a valuable team member, Eddie Perez. Eddie was with the company 15 years and leaves behind a wife, son and daughter who were the light of their life.
In John, chapter 10, verse 10, Jesus tells us The thief does not come except to steal and to kill and to destroy. I have come that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly.
Yesterday, the enemy stole a husband, a father, a friend and a co-worker. But they did not win.
Eddie knows and loves Jesus, and Jesus came to give them life. And so they live.
Our thoughts and prayers are now with Eddies family and all who knew and cared about him. They will be greatly missed.

Salem residents are driving as far as Woodburn in search of bottled water following the city's announcement Tuesday that its drinking water supply is contaminated.
Those without the time or means to go out of town are temporarily out of luck.
Neither the city of Salem nor the Oregon Office of Emergency Management plan to coordinate water distribution points, OEM spokesperson Cory Grogan said.
More: Salem drinking water contaminated, children advised to avoid tap water
Officials are telling residents to keep calling local retailers.
“There should be a supply of water coming in to stores,” Grogan said. “It benefits them economically to be distributing water.”
Major retailers such as Costco and Roth's say they're expecting water shipments, but don't know if they will come in today or Thursday.
“We are out of water at the moment,” Costco manager Larry Kelley said.
Late Tuesday, Salem announced that an algae bloom discovered a week ago in Detroit Lake is producing low levels of toxins.
Children younger than 6, people with compromised immune systems, people receiving dialysis treatment, people with pre-existing liver conditions, pets, pregnant women or nursing mothers, or other sensitive people should not drink the water, the city said.
Bottled water should be used for drinking, making infant formula, making ice and preparing food and beverages for those groups.
Reports of price-gauging began appearing on social media by Wednesday morning.
Grogan said the Office of Emergency Management is allowing the city of Salem to coordinate the response to the water crisis.
"We don't get involved unless it becomes overwhelming," they said.
Neither city spokesperson Kenny Larson, nor Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who oversees OEM, could be reached for comment Wednesday morning.
The city expects to receive fresh test results on Thursday.

President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned an ultra-modern 220 Kv gas insulated substation to improve the power supply in Nairobi on Wednesday.
The substation, the first of its kind in East and Central Africa, will handle the power coming from the Olkaria Geothermal Power Station and will create an alternative power chain for the city.
“The KShs.13 billion project, will greatly improve the quality of power in Nairobi's City Centre, serving the Industrial area, Mombasa road, Upperhill, the entire Central Business District (CBD), Lower hill and Kilimani area,” said President Kenyatta when they spoke at the event at GIS station on Bunyala Road.
“It therefore creates additional contingency in electricity supply thus enhancing the reliability of power in this area,” added the President.

Gas Insulated Substations are high voltage substations in which the major structures are contained in a sealed environment. It is reliable, requires little maintenance and is compact thus requiring little space.
President Kenyatta said the improvement of power supply in the city is aimed at creating a conducive environment for business and industry so that they can in turn create more jobs for Kenyans.
“This initiative feeds into one of the key pillars of the Big Four Agenda, Enhancing Manufacturing, to create quality jobs for Kenyans,” said the President
They added that the Government will remain steadfast in supporting the concept of Build Kenya Buy Kenya, to guarantee increased job creation and growth of local industries.
They said the Government is committed to greatly increase the transmission and distribution network for power.
Since 2013, over 1400Km of transmission lines have been completed, with another 2300Km in progress. Furthermore, a total of 33,900 km of distribution lines and 69 new substations have been completed over the past five years.
“This has seen industries enjoy more stable power and households experiencing reduced power outages,” said the President.
President Kenyatta, who was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto and Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter, said the expanded national access to electricity has been achieved through various connectivity initiatives such as the Last Mile Connectivity Project, the electrification of public facilities and the Global Partnership on Output Based Aid (GPOBA) programme targeting people living in informal settlements.
“These programmes are a major pillar in our plan to sustain the rapid pace of electricity connections in the quest to achieve universal access to electricity by the year 2022,” said the President.
They said the Government will take measures to control vandalism, a major problem for Kenya's infrastructure development.
CS Keter had informed the President that vandalism is one of the big reasons costs of infrastructure development expands after initial plans.
President Kenyatta's Government has also invested heavily in power generation.
The proportion of geothermal capacity increased to 28.43% from 14.8% in 2013, significantly reducing dependence on generation from expensive diesel power plants.
The total number of customers connected stands at 6.7 million translating to a national electricity access of 74% against 27% in 2013.
President Kenyatta challenged Kenya Power to strive to become the biggest corporation in Kenya since it has the potential for that achievement.

Melbourne [Australia], Aug 14 (ANI): Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has revealed that they have been hitting the training track pretty hard in order to prepare themselves fully for the two-match Test series against Bangladesh beginning August 27 in Dhaka.
The 28-year-old insisted that they are leaving no stone unturned in their preparation as they are eyeing to cement their place in the Test side, having revived their career with a maiden century during the tour of India in March.
"I've probably gone the other way. Over the last month, I've hit the training track pretty hard and just tried to do everything humanly possible to be ready to go once I came up here," cricket.com.au quoted Maxwell as saying.
With Ashes series against England are also on the horizon, Maxwell admitted that they have to perform at their menacing best in the upcoming series.
Speaking ahead of the national team's pre-tour training camp in Darwin, Maxwell said, "I've been running a fair bit and batting as much as I can, as well as working on my bowling, and just trying to basically get ready for whatever cricket I have to come."
Maxwell's ability to play spin means they are most likely to be named in the Playing XI at the expense of medium-pacer Hilton Cartwright for the Two Tests.
Australia are slated to play a two-day warm-up game in Fatullah on August 22 and 23 before heading into the first Test.

The civil society has been fighting against the violation of the human rights alone, accusing the police force of having a bias towards the powerful violators of human rights.
In most of the cases the police force itself is accused of violating the rights of another.
It is unfortunate when an honest officer makes progress in regards to a case that immense political and bureaucratic pressure is placed on their head.
Dadu Shabir is a hardworking man who takes urgent action whenever a crime is reported and thus gains the support of much of the marginalised people.
Their well-wishers are unable to bring attention to their actions and display their support due to the fulfilment of the responsibility of earning a livelihood for their families.
The perpetrators on the other hand, due to access to resources and facilities, mislead the media and start protesting which eventually leads to sincere people like Dadi Shabir to be transferred.
It is duty of civil society to come out for countering unjust political pressure exerted on Dadu Shabir and other visionary officers otherwise this asymmetrical activism would not help in the creation of a peaceful society.

WINNIPEG — With a goal of growth, the Manitoba Moose say they struck success this season.
“I came in wanting my first taste of pro hockey and trying to develop my game,” rookie defenceman Nelson Nogier said. “I think I did a really good job at that.”

But despite the win, being sent home early still hurts.
“Every year, it doesn't get easy,” defenceman Kevin Czuczman said. “You go home and reflect.”
For the second straight season, the Moose will miss the playoffs. It's another year taken away from the fading careers of the team's seniors.
“It's difficult especially as an older guy,” forward Darren Kramer said. “Just career sake, it's important to make the playoffs and get to the post-season.”

Life with an AHL contract can be tough for veterans. It often means their NHL days are over and those of their career numbered.
“It's either adapt or die,” captain Patrice Cormier said.
“The quicker you adapt, the quicker you realize what you can bring.”
But it's not like they aren't needed. At least a dozen players skated with both the Moose and Winnipeg Jets this year – an achievement not possible without the old pros.
“It's a huge asset,” head coach Pascal Vincent said. “It's not something you can look at the stats and say they did this or that. It's beyond that.”
A skill helping to drive development.
In a recent interview to Swarajya Magazine, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referring to the internal security situation of India, asserted that the recurrent terrorist attacks common during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) are now history.
Well, the prime minister is partially correct. Yes, in absolute numbers, terrorist attacks have declined, coming to almost nil. As this data from the South Asia Terrorism Portal shows, post the 2008 Mumbai attack, such incidents in India's hinterland have progressively declined: From 11 in 2008 to nine in 2016, two in 2017 and nil in 2018 (thus far).
Statistics aside, in terms of scale, India has not seen a large-scale, mass-casualty terror attack such as the one in 2008 or the serial bomb blasts which shook the country prior to 2008 (barring the two blasts in 2011 in Mumbai and Delhi).
What's more, India's response to terror has improved with significant upgrades in technical intelligence capability of our security agencies, improved (if not perfect) border management, evolved inter-agency coordination and much strengthened counter-terrorism partnerships with key West Asian countries and Bangladesh.
Modi especially deserves credit for building on partnerships with the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh, which helped Indian security agencies nab some important mid-level terrorist commanders, critically weakening the ability of the Pakistan-based terrorist groups to mobilise resources and launch attacks on Indian soil.
In fact, rather than boasting about the surgical strikes' success — which still remains doubtful despite the video evidence — the Modi government should have talked up the above-mentioned successes, as these gains, though less glamourous, are far more effective and therefore real. This success of our security agencies is even more noteworthy in the face of increasing focus of the global terrorist groups Islamic State and Al-Qaeda and their persistent attempts to target India and Indian interests. So far, they have drawn a blank, which itself is a testament to the efforts of our security establishment.
The reason why Modi's claim on declining terrorist incidents is only partially true is because it overlooks the deteriorated security situation in the Valley. This was referred to by their party colleague, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav, who while announcing the party's separation from its erstwhile ally the People's Democratic Party (PDP) two weeks ago, said: “Terrorism, violence and radicalisation have risen and fundamental rights of the citizens and free speech are in danger in the Valley”.
There is data to support Madhav's assertion. As per the Ministry of Home Affairs' 2017-18 annual report, terrorist incidents in the Valley went up in the past few years: From 170 in 2013 to 208 in 2015 (the year of the BJP-PDP coalition) to 342 in 2017. As is well known by now, this has also been a result of surging number of local recruits to terrorist groups, giving the latter an undeniable advantage in carrying out terrorist attacks on security forces and civilians in various parts of Kashmir.
One can counter this argument by stating that comparing the hinterland to Jammu and Kashmir is like comparing apples and oranges. Yet, it is true that the groups which perpetuated the terrorist violence in hinterland and continue to do so in Kashmir are same: Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen (which actually reached near extinction in the years leading up to National Democratic Alliance rule, but has since then revived its position due to local recruits).
Further, the elements across the border in Pakistan, which support these groups remain. The religious charity networks which prop up these groups are also common, and the extremist propaganda too exploits common themes. Modi may have cleverly skirted the issue of Kashmir's security situation in their Swarajya interview, but the fact remains that if their government is claiming the credit for decline in terrorist incidents in the hinterland, then it also has to take the responsibility for the rising terrorist incidents in the Valley.
A woman is expected to be OK after getting stabbed in the leg early Monday morning.
Troopers arrested a woman who they say stabbed them
State police say it happened just after midnight in Hessel in Mackinac County.
They say the two women got in a fight, and one stabbed the other in the leg with a knife.
The victim was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
Troopers arrested the suspect who's now accused of assault with dangerous weapon and assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder.
Those in the area say the night was pretty chaotic.
“There were state police cars and the ambulance had gone through. I never dreamt it would be a stabbing,” says Wendi Smith, owner of Runway Bar. “It's a shock.”
The woman accused in the stabbing has yet to be charged.
'ANC would be more than happy to have De Lille'

The African National Congress (ANC) would welcome Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille with open arms should they ever leave or be expelled from the Democratic Alliance (DA).
That's according to the ANC's head of elections Fikile Mbalula.
Mbalula was responding to media on Monday as they were giving a briefing on the party's Western Cape election campaign plan for the 2019 polls.
Mbalula has also announced former Western Cape premier Ebrahim Rasool as the party's provincial elections chief.
Mbalula has warned, the DA should know very well not to throw away a "good lover" as the party tries to get rid of its own Mayor de Lille.
Mbalula says the ANC would be more than happy to have a person of De Lille's calibre in its rank and file.
“Patricia de Lille has given us a tough time in the metro and they have doubled the numbers for the DA. And then they have pursued an agenda that it seems the DA does not like. Why would I reject such a beautiful person?”
Speculation about De Lille's political future also came under the spotlight when they attended an Economic Freedom Fighters-organised memorial service for the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela two weeks ago.
The ANC hopes bringing back Ebrahim Rasool will help it win back the coloured and black vote, and De Lille could fit perfectly into the party's strategy to take back the province.

The amount of unjust control that institutes have over the students and all the exploitation it leads to should be a cause of concern for the authorities. The video of Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) Secretary-General Khurram Nawaz Gandapur went viral on social media in which they can be seen scolding and threatening a group of young girls for seeking permission to go out for an iftar party. Such a behaviour at any institute showcases the disregard they have for the students and the respect given to the student body. Nothing can justify such a behaviour, even if students need to be reprimanded for a certain behaviour it needs to be done with respect.
The girls posted the video of Mr Gandapur scolding them online and that created an outrage because no institution encourages such a behaviour. However, instead of being apologetic about their way of dealing with these students, the administration expelled them and have shut down the hostel. This decision completely negated the fact that the students had paid the fee for the entire semester and the amount was not being reimbursed. This is a gross violation of the rights of the students who have enroled in the program and have to face the financial loss because the authorities continue to manipulate them.
This precedent being set by educational institutes only goes to promote the exploitation of the customers, especially when there is no system of accountability. The fact that the future of these students is in the hands of those who have no regard for the number of resources invested in their education goes to show how nonchalant they are and their only preference is the moral policing of the students. People are rightfully demanding an apology because such a behaviour is simply unacceptable and must be reprimanded.
Since taking a low-cost flier on Teddy Bridgewater in the early days of free agency, the Jets traded a treasure trove of draft picks to draft Sam Darnold as the quarterback of the future.
Darnold is now being heralded as the long-awaited franchise savior, lending further credence to the notion that Bridgewater was signed primarily for the opportunity to flip a coveted asset for a draft pick once their surgically repaired knee proves to be fully rehabilitated.
Bridgewater is off to an impressive start with their new team, inspiring ESPN.com's Rich Cimini to declare that the quarterback's trade value is "trending upward."
This is the first peek at Bridgewater's progress since they lost backup duties to Sam Bradford late last season. The 2014 Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year and erstwhile quarterback of the future in Minnesota was deemed an afterthought as soon as Kirk Cousins was set free by the Redskins.
NFL Network's Tom Pelissero, a former Vikings beat reporter, checked in with their Minnesota sources to gauge the credibility of Bridgewater's burgeoning trade value.
Even though Bradford bypassed Bridgewater on the depth chart, Pelissero was told, it's no surprise to hear that the former Louisville star is shining in no-contact practices.
"He threw the football well [last season]," Pelissero reported on Tuesday's edition of NFL Up to the Minute. "Teammates talk about how Bridgewater's arm actually looked stronger than before they got hurt."
Vikings coach Mike Zimmer cautioned in late March that doctor's reviews of Bridgewater's knee didn't reflect what they witnessed on the practice field.
"He still has some recovery to do," Zimmer offered.
Taken in combination with Bridgewater's meager contract, Josh McCown's re-signing and the blockbuster deal that landed Darnold in the Big Apple, Zimmer's comments created an impression that lingering knee issues would sabotage Bridgewater's Jets career before it even got started.
Whereas the Vikings naturally harbored high expectations based on their lofty experiences with a pre-injury Bridgewater, however, there's no such baseline in Florham Park. Bridgewater is starting from scratch -- and opening a few eyes in the process.
In a touch of irony, Bridgewater figures to enter training camp on the trade block, rivaling former stand-in Bradford as the go-to target for any team that might lose its own starter.
"[Bridgewater] is very tradeable," Pelissero explained. "They only paid them a $500,000 bonus. Their salary for the season [is] $5.5 million in base salary."
Prior to the career-threatening injury, Bridgewater exhibited impressive accuracy, touch and improvisational ability to go with an intermediate-to-deep ball that was better than advertised. Since then, though, they have attempted just two NFL passes.
Who's going to surrender valuable draft capital for an unknown entity?
Until intrigued teams see their knee -- and psyche -- pass the crucial test against pressuring defenses in preseason action, they are unlikely to take the Jets' trade bait.
If you heard that boom on your morning commute... don't be alarmed!

SCOTT Ruscoe remains confident their TNS squad can continue to fight on all fronts this season.
Following the midweek Nathaniel MG Cup trip to Flint Town United the Saints will host Scottish League Two side Elgin Cities on Saturday (4.30pm).
“We want to win these cup competitions,” said Ruscoe. “We'll give it our best shot. We've got to almost plan for it backwards as we'll name a team and then look at it and who needs a rest from this weekend.”
Ruscoe is also targeting going one better in the Irn-Bru Cup after making the semi-final last season and insisted no stone has been left unturned in researching their third round opponents.
Ruscoe said: “We've had someone watching Elgin and we've had some good detailed reports. We've received some footage of their past few games too, so we'll go through that this week and probably present to the lads on Thursday.
“The players will know what they're coming up against. Elgin are currently sixth in the table and got a 2-2 draw last weekend.
“We know who their key players are and what they're like. We're looking forward to it. It's another game we can put our stamp on.”

ATHENS - Athens's half a million Muslims are set to get their first official mosque in more than a century.
The city has not had a formal mosque since it drove out occupying Ottomans in 1833, and Deputy Foreign Minister Ioannis Amanantidis told parliament last year that it was the only European capital "to be deprived of such a religious space".
For years Muslims have resorted to praying in hundreds of makeshift sites, in crowded basements or dark warehouses targeted by racist attackers.
In May, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared building a mosque long overdue. The government, they said, would push ahead "out of respect for the Muslim residents in our capital, but also because we are obliged to actively defend our values."
The new mosque - a 1,000 square meter building without a minaret, split over two levels - is expected to be ready in April in an old naval base in an industrial, rundown part of Athens.
"We need the mosque for our new generation, for our youth ... to feel equal in law, equal in society," said Greece's Muslim Association spokesperson Anna Stamou, a Greek who converted to Islam.
Friday prayers in the underground garage where they and their family went were recited in Arabic and Greek. Men knelt down to pray on its humid crimson carpet, ventilation pipes barely above their heads.
Plans to build a mosque began in 1890 with an act of parliament, but all fell through, including one timed for the 2004 Olympics. The latest effort split the ruling coalition and Tsipras's right-wing partners voted against a bill to speed up construction.
Critics say Athens, kept afloat by international funds since 2010, cannot spare the 800,000 euros to build it.
Golden Dawn, the ultranationalist party third in popularity in polls, says migrants are burdening state resources at a time of crisis. Others still associate mosques with Turkey, its Muslim neighbor and longstanding rival.
For months last year a dozen Greek nationalists occupied the mosque site and set up a homeless center, calling it "a hot spot for Greeks" drawing a contrast with centers on Greek islands for mainly Muslim refugees and migrants arriving from Turkey.
A law meant to prevent domestic violence cases created more work for police and prosecutors.
That's according to the city auditor who says changes need to be made.
In a new report, the auditor says the Honolulu Police Department and prosecutor's office lack certain things to successfully prosecute domestic violence cases.
So what are they recommending to make things better?
Authorities say a 30-year-old woman is being charged with hate crimes after police say they broke windows and left bacon at a Northern California mosque.
The Sacramento Bee reports that the Yolo County district attorney's office announced the arrest of Lauren Kirk-Coehlo of Davis on Tuesday.
 They are charged in the vandalism of the Davis Islamic Center last month, in which six windows and two bicycles were broken and bacon strips placed on door handles.
Eating pork products is forbidden in Islam.
Earlier this month in the region, Roseville's Tarbiya Institute was spray-painted with obscene and racist slurs, including “Muslim out.” The two communities are about 34 miles apart.
Roseville police say that also is being investigated as a hate crime, though there is no sign the two incidents are related.
Dozens of Dead Owls Found on Road in Idaho
It almost looks like they fell from the sky.
If only Harry Potter were real and here to help us, because this can't be a good omen. A stretch of Interstate 84 in southern Idaho was suddenly covered with the bodies of dozens of dead owls
I saw a bird on the side of the road — I thought it was a chicken. But then we saw more (road kill) and I saw the stripes on the feathers and it was not a chicken.
The sad scene was reported to KBOI 2News in Idaho over the weekend by Nichole Miller and Christina White of Boise. They, along with many other drivers who reported the same grisly sight, were driving on I-84 near Jerome when they began spotting the dead birds both on the highway and along the side of the road. The women counted at least 50 dead owls in a 20-mile stretch and believed that was just a small fraction of the total.
There was more and more and more.
There are about 200 species of owls living across the entire planet except for Antarctica and their unique eyes, faces and swivel heads has made them part of many cultural mythologies, whether they're alive or dead. Owls are considered bad omens and harbingers of death throughout Africa and Europe. Many Native American tribes saw owls the same way, but some – the Yakama for example – considered owls to be powerful totems that protected the forests. In real life, owls are probably the world's greatest flying rodent exterminators – experts say one single nest of barn owls (Tyto alba) can consume 3,000 rodents in a season.
While there have been rare instances of owls attacking humans, the real danger goes in the opposite direction as the mythology of bad luck, real-life human expansion, development and hunting (in Malaysia, owl is considered to be a bushmeat) has put many species on endangered lists, allowing rodents and other vermin to take over.
Is that the warning the dead owls are delivering in Idaho?
Mike Keckler, Idaho Fish and Game spokesperson, thinks it's a possibility. That particular stretch of the interstate is known for an abundance of owl-attracting rodents and speed limit of 80 miles-per-hour (128 kmph), which means car-owl encounters are probably occurring at up to 90+ mph – a speed that's fatal to owls.
This was confirmed in a thesis by Boise State University student Erin Arnold, who found that …
… one of the world's highest roadway mortality rates for barn owls occurs along Interstate 84 (I-84) in southern Idaho.
They recommended on-the-ground mitigation to reduce owl deaths – a simple change in the length and type of vegetation along the freeway would prevent rodents from hiding there and attracting owls who end becoming road kill instead of diners.
Will this save the owls from I-84? From humans in their speeding cars? In the words of J.K. Rowling,
Hey Jude movie review: Nivin Pauly, Trisha Krishnan-starrer has heart and humour but not enough depth
2.5/5
Jude is different. At 28, they are more socially awkward than a pubescent teen and easily bullied.  They are hardworking and, in their specific areas of interest, brilliant. They obsess about their routine. They refuse to tell lies even if their congenital honesty causes embarrassment to a family member. Their idea of frankness extends to telling people hurtful truths that need not be told. They have no friends.
Their loving mother Maria — a stay-at-home parent — worries about him. Their father Dominique (pronounced Dominic), who runs an antique store in Kochi, is forever exasperated with him. Their college-going younger sister Andrea tolerates them with condescending amusement.
On a trip to Goa with their Mum and Dad, Jude meets the noisy, music-loving Crystal Ann Chakkaraparambu and their father Sebastian. Crys runs a café and is the lead vocalist in a local band that performs at their restaurant and at weddings. Sebastian is a psychologist who, when not swimming in alcohol or betting on cricket matches, uses music as therapy for persons with mental/psychological issues, leads Tai Chi sessions in their front yard and hangs out with Crys.
Unlikely friendships are formed, and over time Jude begins to understand their own diffidence better. As they do, their family too starts seeing them with new eyes, not as an eccentric or difficult youngster, but as a unique individual with special problems and gifts.
Art-house director Shyamaprasad opts for a light touch in Hey Jude. In terms of its naturalistic, unmelodramatic narrative style, the film sits well with the likes of last year's Nivin Pauly-starrer Njandukalude Nattil Oridavela and other slice-of-life cinema that has been a hallmark of the Malayalam New Wave — if you wish to call it that — of the past decade or so. Pauly themselves has been one of the stars at the forefront of this movement that has earned massive box-office returns while defying many of the conventions of commercial cinema. In Hey Jude, they play the title character whose Asperger's Syndrome is staring back at viewers with any degree of awareness about the condition, long before they are diagnosed in the film.
Asperger's is part of an umbrella category of disorders called Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) marked by challenges with social skills, behaviour and communication. In Jude's case, what to a viewer comes across as endearing innocence is irritating to Dominique and Andrea. This leads to many comical situations. What sustains Hey Jude through its entire first half is the sensitivity with which Shyamaprasad portrays their interactions (even if Jude's actions are foreseeable to us while, oddly enough, the father who has known them all their life cannot seem to predict them).
The delicacy with which Hey Jude treads around its central character in its pre-interval portion is one of its many attractions. We are introduced to their multiple quirks with humour and affection, yet the storyteller is never patronising towards him.
Not everyone on the autism spectrum is a savant, but this expectation has been a widely held misconception about ASD ever since the global success of the Hollywood film Rain Man (1988) in which Dustin Hoffman played a mathematical genius with autism. Possibly because of this false impression arising from a film that otherwise had a huge role in awareness building around autism, and perhaps because I am currently also watching the US TV serial The Good Doctor, in which the protagonist is a genius medico with autism, frankly I have been longing to see a screen offering on someone with any disorder on the spectrum who is not a genius. Be that as it may, Hey Jude does still score — when assessed in this context — because it is not fixated on Jude's incredible knowledge of oceanography or their calculator brain, its focus throughout remains their confusion about their distinctive limitations.
That said, it defies believability that Maria and Dominique, who seem educated and certainly belong to a community and a state known for their high education levels (they are Malayali Anglo-Indians) would not have doggedly sought medical opinions about their unusual son in all these years. It appears that Maria's sounding board until the events of the film is their priest. Considering the compulsory educational qualifications required to be a Christian priest, it further defies believability that that gentleman would not have advised them to consult a doc about Jude.
Even if you buy this set of improbabilities, what is impossible to swallow is the extremely unintelligent behaviour of the doctor who does at last use the A word to the parents.
(Spoilers ahead)
The series of missteps in Hey Jude's second half begins with what can only be described as mind-boggling stupidity on the part of Dr Sebastian who not only leaves copious notes about Jude's Asperger's lying around where the young man could easily chance upon them, but even goes so far as to describe them as “abnormal” to their face.
It is also troubling that the film does not deem it fit to examine a point raised by Jude when they see that the doctor had, without their permission, viewed their intensely personal video diaries. Jude is unequivocal in their furious assertion that this is an invasion of privacy. By leaving that point hanging, the film suggests that it is not important enough. Before that, Maria and Dominique are shown not even batting an eyelid when they find the videos with Sebastian. It is as if intruding on the private space of an adult who is not considered “normal” is kosher.
By this time, a certain predictability has settled into the proceedings. That scene in which Jude finally overcomes their fear of water to save their Dad from drowning can be seen coming from a mile. I mean, c'mon, at a party filled with able-bodied adults, no one else jumps into the swimming pool when Dominique falls in, as if they all knew the passage had been written into the screenplay of their lives to give Jude a chance to cross this milestone.
(Spoiler alert ends)
Hey Jude then is a mixed bag. Nivin Pauly's remarkably restrained performance imbues the film with an all-pervasive charm that overrides its follies. The downplaying of their natural good looks, the precise way they say “crispy”, the ungainly manner in which they storm up a flight of steps to their room — there is not an iota of exaggeration in any of this, it is all just so.
One of the aforesaid follies lies in the greater depth and verve lent to the writing of Dominique rather than Jude. Although Jude is the lead, Dominique dominates the narrative and, played as they are with such gentle nuance by veteran actor Siddique, ends up being more memorable.
Hey Jude is the Malayalam debut of Telugu-Tamil superstar Trisha Krishnan who has made the same mistake now as with their 2010 Hindi debut Khatta Meetha: They have chosen to play second fiddle to a major male star already established in the industry they are just entering (earlier, Akshay Kumar) instead of opting for a film in which hero and hero get equal space. Krishnan looks beautiful here as always, but beyond bringing their innate charisma to the role, there is not much they can do with their sketchily outlined character or the rushed reference to Crys' bipolar disorder.
Aju Varghese in Hey Jude, on the other hand, gets a hilarious cameo to beat all cameos.
DoP Girish Gangadharan — whose work in Angamaly Diaries is still fresh in the mind — fills the film with glossy visuals.  They are on a roll when showing us the changing geographical landscape on the road trip from Kerala to Goa, though I wish that spectacular aerial shot of a pristine beach as the family enters Goa was not repeated as they leave. If the intent was to bookend Jude's stay, it does not make sense since their personal journey does not finish there. The dialogue writing though switches smoothly between Malayalam and English, as it would in this milieu in real life.
Hey Jude's music is an ode, witting or not, to the Beatles with whose song it shares its title. One of the most-loved bands of all time, The Beatles' works were distinguished by irresistible tunes and very basic lyrics. Each song here is hummable, but the words of at least two — 'Hey Don't Worry Jude' and 'Rock Rock' (well sung by Sayanora Philip) — are so rudimentary as to be amusing.
Still, the pleasantness of the melodies matches Hey Jude's overall tone: Sweet and affecting. This is the sort of film that made me want to put my hand on my heart and go, "Awwww".

Padmaavat: Karni Sena withdraws nationwide protest; film may release in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat
Jaipur: The Shri Rajput Karni Sena on Friday announced it has decided to take back its protest against the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmaavat, stating the movie glorifies the valour of the Rajputs.
Shri Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena's Mumbai leader Yogendra Singh Katar said that on the directions of organisation's national president, Sukhdev Singh Gogamadi, a few members watched the movie in Mumbai on Friday and found that that the movie glorifies the valour and sacrifice of Rajput and every Rajput will be feeling proud after watching the film.
There is no such objectionable scene between Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khilji and Queen Padmini of Mewar which hurts the sentiments of Rajputs, they said in a letter, declaring that the Karni Sena takes back their protest and will help the administration to release the film in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat as well as across all cinema houses in India.
The Karni Sena had been demanding a ban on the period film on the grounds that it "distorts" historical facts and projects queen Padmini in poor light.
Last month, Supreme Court also lifted the ban on the movie imposed by several states and directed them to ensure its release.
The film was released in theatres across India on January 25 amidst tight security and protest from various groups, including Karni Sena. However, some cinema hall owners decided not to screen the film in the wake of protests being carried allegedly by Karni Sena members in Gujarat and Haryana.

LAHORE - FIA has started inquiry into alleged corruption scam worth millions of rupees in Customs Intelligence.
Customs authorities have been trying to hush-up the issue but a former sepoy of the department drew the attention of FIA towards the matter. It also reflects from the official response of the Customs Intelligence to FIA investigators when they demanded record of the case but formers were reluctant to provide the same. Ultimately on interruption of the Lahore High Court, when it asked FIA to finalize the inquiry expeditiously, Customs authorities provided record to the agency.
There were 80 cases of embezzlement in which Customs Intelligence staff sold the precious goods to a private person and showed it in record a deal with Canteen Store Department (CSD) of armed forces. On counter check, the CSD management refused to accept any such purchase.
Customs Intelligence authorities registered a case against an intelligence officer Hameed for selling a single consignment to Zafar (a private person) and that consignment is worth more than Rs15 million. “There are about 79 such cases wherein 79 times consignments were sold to private persons in the name of CSD and nobody took notice of the irregularities,” said a customs officer while talking to this scribe.
Embezzlement started from the year 2011 and continued till 2018 but no officer bothered to check the working of Inspector Hameed who was posted as storekeeper for such a long period. Normally a person posted against any office is supposed to be transferred after three years but with whose backing Hameed remained posted on their seat for such a long time. This question is yet to be answered, said an officer posted at Customs Intelligence on condition of anonymity. When Customs Intelligence realised that the issue had been taken up by FIA, it immediately took action against Hameed and registered an FIR against them for only one consignment. After registration of case investigation was assigned to inspector Hamid Babar who arrested the accused and produced them in Customs court but did not seek physical remand of the accused for further detection of corruption. Accused was given in judicial custody by the court and no further inquiry was made by the investigation officer.
Similarly, an appraiser Saeed was arrested and their bail was cancelled by the Customs court but accused got interim bail from Lahore High Court. Another appraiser Amjad Khaliq was involved in case but they were exonerated during investigation.
Poor prosecution of the Customs Intelligence authorities could be gauged by the action against three accused among whom one had been given in judicial custody while other got interim bail from LHC and third one was exonerated during investigation. Customs Intelligence has failed to arrest the key accused Zafar who is the main beneficiary of the cases. Inspector Hamid Babar who is investigation officer in the said case, when contacted, said Zafar had gone underground so they could not arrest him. One former employee of Customs intelligence Amir alleged that blue eyed officials were posted in Customs intelligence for corruption purpose. They have filed applications to chairperson NAB, director FIA, chairperson FBR and Federal Tax Ombudsman (FTO) and all offices have taken up their applications and started inquiries into the matter. They claimed that Mushtaq Sargana was right hand of DG Customs Intelligence and influenced transfers and postings of the officials in Customs Intelligence. They believed that inspector Zulfiqar Dogar was arrested by the FIA red handed while taking bribe from an importer and a case was registered against them with FIA. But after some time, they were again posted at the same post due to reasons best known to the authorities concerned. Their other peers Masood Akhtar Hawaldar, Masood Iqbal, Akram and Zafar were helping them in their ‘business' matters. When contacted, Deputy Director Customs Intelligence Usman Tariq said that issue was unearthed by their department.
“We ourselves registered a case and arrested the officer allegedly involved in the embezzlement. They believed that corruption was committed during posting of former officers and they have no concern with it. About the posting of controversial officer inspector Zulfiqar Dogar they said, “No doubt a corruption case was registered against them with FIA but later on they were exonerated in that case and is posted agasint the current office on the orders of high ups”.

Amid controversy surrounding Harvey Weinstein, the Weinstein Co. has "decided to withdraw" from Outfest's Legacy Awards, where the company was set to be honored as a corporate trailblazer by the LGBTQ festival later this month.
The festival's executive director, Christopher Racster, said in a letter that after conversations with the company, the following message was received Friday morning:
"Because we wholeheartedly support Outfest and its mission to preserve LGBTQ cinema, we have decided to withdraw from The Legacy Awards at this time. We do not want to overshadow the extraordinary achievements of the other honorees."
Outfest's Legacy Awards, set for Oct. 22, is an annual fundraiser for the organization. It will continue, honoring Laverne Cox and Rita Moreno with trailblazer and ally awards, respectively.
"Both of these women have fought and stood up for the basic human rights of all people to be treated fairly, especially within a culture in Hollywood that has at times discriminated against them," Racster continued in their letter.
The Weinstein Co. was originally selected for the corporate honor "for its innovative portrayal of the LGBT community" in film, a previous news release said. It has released award-winning pictures such as "Carol," "The Imitation Game," "Philomena" and "Transamerica."
The funds from the gala, which started 12 years ago, support the Outfest UCLA Legacy Project, which preserves LGBTQ moving images.
The planned “High School Musical” TV series in the works at Disney's upcoming streaming service has found its writer, Variety has learned exclusively.
Tim Federle, who worked on the screenplay for the animated comedy “Ferdinand,” is attached to write and executive produce the series.
Federle is the author of a series of young adult novels that began with “Better Nate Than Ever” as well as several cocktail recipe books including “Tequila Mockingbird.” They co-wrote the libretto for the Broadway musical adaptation of “Tuck Everlasting” and won the Humanitas Prize for co-writing the screenplay for “Ferdinand.”  They are also writing the screenplay for an animated film, “Foster,” with the songwriting team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.  They are repped by CAA, Magnet Management, and Jackoway Tyerman.
The exact nature of the plot of the series is being kept under wraps. At this time, no one from the original films is attached to the project.
The original “High School Musical” film launched on Disney Channel in 2006. It proved to be the most successful Disney Channel original movie of all time, setting both ratings and DVD sales records. “High School Musical 2” followed in 2007, with the final entry, “High School Musical 3: Senior Year” being released theatrically in 2008. The franchise helped launch the careers of stars like Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, and Corbin Bleu. Kenny Ortega directed all three of the films, which were all written by Peter Barsocchini.
Disney announced in August that they would be ending their distribution deal with Netflix in order to launch their own branded streaming service. It will be home to content from across the company's vast library, including Disney, Marvel, “Star Wars,” and Pixar projects. In addition, should Disney complete its proposed $52.4 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox, it is likely that company's film and TV assets could find its way to the streaming service as well.
SYDNEY - Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce's political future was in doubt Monday after it emerged they were a dual citizen, placing the conservative government's slim parliamentary majority at risk.
Australia does not allow dual citizens to sit in parliament, with New Zealand confirming later Monday its citizenship was automatically granted to Joyce via their father.
The revelation has major implications for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's Liberal-National coalition government, which won national elections last year with 76 seats in the House of Representatives - a narrow one-seat majority.
Joyce has refused to step aside, instead referring the case to the High Court, saying that the solicitor-general was confident they would not be disqualified.
The obscure rule was little known until recently but several lawmakers have fallen victim to it in recent months, leaving parliamentarians scrambling to clarify their ancestral ties.
“Needless to say, I was shocked to receive this information,” Joyce told parliament after hearing they may be a dual citizen. “I've always been an Australian citizen born in (regional city) Tamworth. Neither me nor my parents had any reason to believe that I may be a citizen of any other country.” The dual citizenship crisis kicked off in July when the minor Greens party's co-deputy leader Scott Ludlam resigned after revealing they had dual Australian-New Zealand citizenship.
The crisis soon claimed other victims, including Canadian-born Greens senator Larissa Waters and Resources Minister Matt Canavan, who left cabinet after finding their mother signed them up to Italian citizenship in their 20s.
Joyce said Monday they had been contacted by the New Zealand High Commission last week to advise them that they “could be a citizen of New Zealand by descent”.
While Joyce - the leader of the Nationals party - was born in Australia, they told parliament their father was born in neighbouring New Zealand and moved to Australia in 1947.
A spokesperson for New Zealand Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne that there was no doubt about Joyce's status, telling AFP that “as far as New Zealand law goes, they are a New Zealand citizen under the Citizenship Act”.
“Mr Joyce was born to a New Zealand citizen father and even though (the father) migrated to Australia in the 1940s that citizenship remained and they passed on the right of citizenship ...to their children.”
They said citizenship was automatically granted and did not need an application.
Turnbull on Monday wrote to Labor opposition leader Bill Shorten to ask if their party wanted to refer any MPs over their citizenship status to the High Court so all the cases could be considered as a bloc, The Australian newspaper reported.
Canavan and minor party One Nation's Indian-born Malcolm Roberts have already had their elections referred to the court, which will decide if they had taken reasonable steps to renounce their foreign allegiances.
Almost half of Australia's 24-million population was born overseas or have at least one parent born overseas, according to last year's census. Indigenous people account for about three percent of the population.
Thousands of smiling, cheering football fans turned out for the biggest party Clemson coach Dabo Swinney has thrown yet at Death Valley to celebrate the school's first national championship in 35 years.
Gov. Nikki Haley issued a proclamation naming Saturday "Clemson Tigers National Football Championship Day."
Last year, more than 30,000 people showed up for Swinney's pizza party when Clemson was picked for its first College Football Playoff berth after the 2015 season. The gathering Saturday was expected to top that, with more than 50,000 fans expected along the parade route through town and into Memorial Stadium.
Gates at Memorial Stadium opened at 7 a.m., and fans in the stadium watched the parade from inside the stadium on the video boards.
The in-stadium celebration began at 10:30 a.m.
Clemson won the title with a 35-31 victory over defending national champ Alabama last Monday night. Deshaun Watson connected with Hunter Renfrow on a 2-yard TD pass with one second left.
Clemson last won the National Championship in 1981.

According to Wikipedia, a private or personal library is a library under the care of those who have private ownership over it and is usually only established for the use of a small number of people or even a single person.
It is one of the most important key to open the door of success.
Personal libraries to a student enriches them with the power of knowledge.
What is worth mentioning is the fact that it will create a learning environment.
Thus, increased creation of personal libraries is the need of the hour.
MOMEN RAHEEM,
Kech, January 24.
Cleveland Fire Brigade's annual winter Stay Safe and Warm campaign has received a national accolade and a £10,000 cash boost.
The campaign, now in its tenth year, has been given an Energy Impact Award from National Energy Action and British Gas, recognising and rewarding innovation and best practice.
The award, which comes with a £10,000 prize, will fund more heaters and blankets and other new equipment as well as help set-up up a “fuel bank” to provide an emergency fuel top-up for those in the greatest need.
Phil Lancaster, director of community protection at Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: “Little or no heating can be a matter of life and death and no one should be in that position.
“But we are here to help and this award is testament to the dedication and hard work of all those involved.
“This extra funding will go alongside the funding we already receive from our four local authorities, which allows us to provide this vital life-saving service.
“It is not just older people who are vulnerable and at risk of cold weather during the winter months. Every year we are alerted to a number of families who simply cannot afford to put their heating on and often their young children have to go to bed in their clothes to stay warm.
“We are ready to give any support that may be needed to ensure everyone stays safe and warm in in winter.”
Electric heaters, thermal blankets, flasks and fleecy mattress covers are available through the Stay Safe and Warm campaign and there is also advice on managing fuel bills and referrals for free boiler repairs or replacements where funding is available.
The campaign, which runs annually from October 1 to March 31, is led by Cleveland Fire Brigade and sees many agencies working together to provide advice and support include Age UK Teesside and Hartlepool Borough Council.

Education Minister Mitzie Hunter packed more bologna than was thought to be humanly possible into a short letter to the editor last week.
To call the letter disingenuous would be a kindness. It was full of unadulterated nonsense.
"Our government remains committed to students in rural Ontario." Some plans to close rural schools involve disrupting student education and busing youngsters as long as 90 minutes a day one way. Some commitment.
The minister goes on to say the government spends $1,000 more for each rural pupil compared to urban pupils. So what? Of course education in rural areas will be more expensive. It's the density thing.
Hunter then detail all the money that has been spent on rural education, the new schools that have been built and schools that have been renovated.
Thanks very much, but what about the schools that have been closed?
Hunter takes on the Ontario Conservative leader for demanding a moratorium on school closings.
Hunter: "We continue to see Patrick Brown's Conservatives wanting to restrict the local decision making power of school boards limiting a board's ability to prioritize student needs.
"He wants the decisions that impact local students and communities to be made at Queen's Park without giving the locally-elected trustees . . . the opportunity to have these important planning conversations."
However, Hunter fails to mention these are decisions within a framework of their ministry's making. Local decisions are dictated by funding models that come right out of their department.
Under those models, local boards close schools or lose money. The bureaucrats who run local boards also fall out of favour with their counterparts at Queen's Park if they don't get on the school closing bandwagon.
Of course, this is all about politics and the provincial election in June 2018. Hunter's Liberals are about as popular in rural Ontario as a drunk at a Women's Christian Temperance Union meeting.
Two schools in the Georgian Bay region have escaped the ministry's guillotine at least temporarily because their communities came up with plans to provide financial help.
Private industry is in involved. Local government is involved. A developer is involved.
Neither Hunter's ministry nor the local school board lifted a finger to help keep these schools open, even though the case for closing them was weak at best.
The fact these two schools have been saved was just announced. Hunter is expected to visit the schools in Paisley and Markdale Wednesday.
No reason for the visit has been announced, but if they claim any credit for their ministry they should be shown the route out of town.

Preview, the all-purpose image editing and viewing app that comes with macOS, is a perfectly serviceable tool for performing basic editing of PDF files. Using Preview you can add signatures, markup text, add comments, insert notes, crop images, and create stickies, but it's limited. There's no optical character recognition (OCR), some fillable forms don't work as well as they should, and you can't create fillable forms of your own, or edit text, other than performing basic redactions. For performing those kinds of tasks you need something more capable. SmileOnMyMac's PDFPenPro 10 ($125) is just such a tool. It's designed to make PDF documents, which, by design, are difficult and even impractical to edit, as fluid and easy to make changes to as any word processing and page layout document. What's new
PDFPenPro 10 includes about ten new features, among which are batch OCR, document watermarking, header and footer editing, better image resizing and editing tools, and better tools for selecting and creating line art and text. The app's batch OCR recognition is as easy as you'd hope it would be. Drag a pile of PDF files to an OCR Files window, click an Perform OCR button and you're off the races. You can go about your business, including editing other PDF files, and PDFPenPro will continue to perform OCR on your files in the background. OCR has always been a bit of a sticky wicket, but PDFPen does the job well and in almost no time. The app was able to recognize text in hundreds of pages of documents in a few short moments, making them searchable, editable, and correctable. Once the text was recognized, I was able to export files as a Word document. These exported documents, to my surprise, were mostly usable. They PDFPen Pro properly recognized paragraphs and sentences and the document text flowed appropriately from one line to the next. It wasn't perfect, there were odd section breaks in parts of documents, particularly around graphics, but it wasn't the hot mess that OCR'd PDF files usually become when you convert them to Word. There's no way you can edit that
As it happens, at nearly the same time I was asked to review PDFPenPro, I was also asked if I could edit a PDF document for a local theatre company I work with. The original InDesign document used to create the file was lost on a damaged hard drive. I honestly thought I'd have to recreate the document from scratch until I tried using PDFPenPro's new Precision Edit Tool, which made it possible to select, remove, resize, and edit graphics and text that were intermingled with each other. This tool was like magic and made fixing the document a delight. It turned an expected hours-long process into about 30 minutes of work. Form fields and full web pages

Fire crews will monitor fire affected areas right throughout the summer

A FIRE that burnt through 650 hectares of the Warby Ovens National Park is the biggest that's hit the bushland since the early 1990s.
Forest Fire Management Victoria and CFA contained the fire on Sunday night after three days of working to bring the incident under control.
The fire ignited on private property at about 2.20pm on Friday and was fanned by a south-westerly wind heading towards Pangerang Lookout.
A “critical” stage of the firefighting operation on Friday night was stopping the blaze from jumping Ridge Road, which was successfully achieved by crews.
Forest Fire Management Victoria took control of the incident on Friday night as it entered the national park.
Five strike teams of 25 CFA firefighters worked shifts around the clock since Friday and two helicopters have offered air support during the peaks of the fire.
Incident Control operations officer Dan McLaughlin from Parks Victoria said the incident reached an advice warning only for residents in the area and no evacuations were initiated, as of yesterday afternoon.
They said the Ridge Road control was critical to the efforts of firefighters and all personnel worked well to burn back from the road to meet the fire on Friday night.
“There were a couple of fall back points if it had of jumped the road, but we didn't have to resort to these,” Mr McLaughlin said.
“It is the largest fire in the Warbys since the early 90s, before the Boweya fire in December 2014 which burnt 200ha of the park.”
They said the main ridge line of the park is 10,000 hectares so the fire has burnt 6.5 per cent of that area.
“It was a fairly clean burn but the incident area will be monitored for the rest of summer to minimise the risk of flare ups,” they said.
An aerial line-scan of the fire ground on Saturday night detected a large number of hot-spots within the fire area which were the focus of efforts yesterday.
“Now that the back burning works have been completed, the focus turns to blacking-out hot spots and consolidating containment lines ahead of forecast warmer weather this week,” Mr McLaughlin said.
“Water-bombing aircraft and heavy machinery have been used effectively supporting on-ground crews to contain the spread of the fire.”
Mr McLaughlin warned of the fire danger this summer in the area despite recent rainfalls in the area and highlighted the dryness of the Warbys on the western side.
Parks Victoria will monitor the fire affected area right throughout summer.
Internal tracks and roads within the Park remain closed to the general public.
Investigators are still looking into how the fire started, but have ruled out it being suspiciously lit.

South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha on Monday raised the need to establish effective communication lines with North Korea to convey the international community's voice for the country's denuclearization."Opening effective communication channels should be pursued in order to deliver the international community's voice to the isolated and secluded North Korea," Kang said in an international forum on a "Nuclear-Free Korean Peninsula" hosted by the state-run Institute for Foreign Affairs and National Security."It's (also) crucial to arrange reunions of separated families between South and North Korea and restore a hotline between the military authorities," they also said, stressing the Moon Jae-in government's policy vision to increase engagement with the North."The South Korean government plans to start with contact (with North Korea) to achieve those specific tasks in the process of seeking a more meaningful inter-Korean relationship," said the foreign minister.North Korea's participation in the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea would be "a favorable opportunity" in that vein, they also noted.Kang said the issue of North Korea's nuclear weapons development entered "a new stage" with its long-range ballistic missile launch on Nov. 29 and its declaration of its completion of the state nuclear force. "North Korea's nuclear (weapons) and missiles have now become a direct threat to the whole world, not just a limited threat to the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia."She said the international community will never tolerate North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons and will strengthen diplomacy and pressure to bring the country to the negotiating table.At the core of South Korea's policy toward North Korea is "a solid South Korea-US (military) alliance," they stressed. The allies are currently in close consultation on ways to increase the frequency of the deployment of US strategic military assets on the Korean Peninsula and beef up South Korea's high-tech defense capabilities, Kang also noted.Colin Powell, a former US secretary of state, also called for continued diplomatic efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue."I am all for using diplomatic and peaceful means to get rid of nuclear weapons throughout the world, especially with respect to North Korea," they told the forum.Powell analyzed that the survival of its regime seemed to be "the most valuable thing" in its development of nuclear weapons. "They will do whatever is necessary to make sure the regime is sustained and this really is part of the background for solving the problem of nuclear weapons.""But to use such weapons against the US or against our friends and allies, if we suspect that such weapons are about to be used, we need to make sure Kim Jong-un understands that will be the destruction of their regime, beginning the very next day. ... I think they are too smart to want to commit suicide."Powell also said that China "has the ignition key to the North Korean car," by providing North Korea with energy and resources that keep the regime afloat."I think they have the ability to turn it off," they said, calling for a more active role by China in isolating the regime.Lee Do-hoon, South Korea's top envoy in negotiating North Korea's denuclearization, later said in the forum that the country will continue to seek opportunities for dialogue as it pursues a peaceful way out of the current nuclear deadlock."We will not forget that the ultimate purpose of the sanctions and pressure is to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. Under the dire circumstances, we will continue to seek opportunities for dialogue," Lee said."Considering the current situation in which North Korea has justified its nuclear and missile development with its security concerns, North Korean nuclear issues cannot be resolved based on sanctions and pressure alone. In the end, North Korean nuclear issues can only be resolved through dialogue and negotiations," the envoy said.There will be a window open for North Korea to discuss issues of "mutual concern" with South Korea if the regime participates in the upcoming Olympics, refrains from any further provocations and communicates its intent to engage in sincere dialogue, Lee suggested, adding that "North Korea must not let this valuable opportunity pass by."

Makenna Busse was voted NAL All-League First Team by the coaches of the Northern Athletic League. Larson said, “She definitely has to continue their career. She's an awesome athlete and person and I'm very blessed to have been able to coach (her) for the past three years.”
Busse finished the season first in points with 254 scored. They also led the team in rebounds with 257. Busse was the third highest player in steals with 76 for the season.
Winters was voted as Honorable Mention NAL All-League voted Carson.
McCoy was voted as an NAL All-League Player by the coaches of the league.
Each varsity girl received a certificate, a shirt with their Northern Section Champion title advertised as well as their names, and a homemade book with a collection of their memories from the 2016-2017 season.
Busse then took the microphone to carry on a tradition of acknowledging a junior on the team to lead the varsity girls for the following season.
Busse said, “Through this entire season, I've been looking for a junior to give this to. They have to give it 110 percent, they have to have a great attitude all the time, they can't be the player who looks back on a game and just dreads on it and they have to just push forward.”
Busse bestowed the award upon Dani Nevis.
Upon giving Nevis the ball used to symbolize the award, Busse told her, “When I give you this ball, I expect you to lead the team with everything next year.”
The girls ended a fantastic year knowing that the following year's teams will have big footsteps to fill, but the looks in each player's eyes proved that the Lady Grizz girls were up to the challenge.
Amazon.com Inc reported a profit near $2 billion, the largest in its history, as the online retailer drew millions of new customers to its Prime fast-shipping club for the holiday season and as changes to U.S. tax law added to its bottom line. Seattle-based Amazon is using fast shipping, television shows exclusive to its website and forays into new technology, such as its voice-controlled Alexa devices, to attract high-spending Prime members. Amazon said price cuts at Whole Foods Market, which it acquired for $13.7 billion last year, are helping it win grocery sales, too. The world's largest online retailer said net income more than doubled to $1.86 billion, or $3.75 per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Its profit received a provisional $789 million boost from the U.S. Republican tax bill passed in December. The company has become notorious for running on a low profit margin.

Fake news, Brexit and genitals: a Wolfgang Tillmans exhibition opening at the Tate Modern on Wednesday is an eclectic show that the edgy German artist says is as much about poetry and art as politics.“I want you to feel encouraged by the curiosity that I have for the world, to also not be afraid of the world and to not let fear be implanted in your brain,” the photographer said at a press preview.“The exhibition is not about politics. It is just as much about poetry, about art, about installation art.”Tillmans, who was the first photographer and non-British artist to win the prestigious Turner art prize in 2000, displays an impressive breadth of work encompassing videos, slideshows and even music.But politics is hard to escape in this show, starting with the posters they designed as part of their campaign to keep Britain within the European Union ahead of a referendum last year in which Brexit ultimately won.It is also at the heart of their “truth study centers,” a project which they started working on in 2005 but which has particular resonance now in an era of “post-truth” and fake news in political discourse.These centers consist of photographs, drawings, clipping from newspapers and magazines aimed at highlighting how information is often shaped to fit the viewpoint of those who present it.Tillmans “feels where things might go because they have an eye for the world,” Chris Dercon, the exhibition's lead curator explained.Dercon described the German artist as “a Renaissance man for the 21st century.”“He's adding something to the world. They want us to be an accomplice to the image. He‘s not taking pictures, they are making pictures.”He emphasized Tillmans's ability to mix old codes, such as still life, with a more modern approach.One such photograph is “Astro Crusto,” a still life photograph of lobsters, in the style of a 17th-century painting, only a fly has flown into the still.There is also a photograph of male genitals in the exhibition entitled “Nackt, 2” which echoes 19th century French artist Gustave Courbet's famous painting of a vagina called “L'Origine du monde” (The Origin of the World).The “Wolfgang Tillmans: 2017” exhibition runs until June 11.

ISLAMABAD - Rawalpindi Islamabad Sports Journalists Association (RISJA) beat Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) in a friendly floodlight cricket match played here at Jinnah Stadium to celebrate the Independence Day.
RISJA was led by Mohsin Ali, while Agha Amjedullah captained the PSB XI. It was festivity all-around as the families of sports journalist and PSB officers gathered in quite numbers to mark the occasion in style. Despite heavy rain continued to pour down, nobody was ready to leave the premises and after waiting for around two hours for rain to stop, it was decided by both captains to decide the fate of the match through the spin of coin.
Like last five years in a row, lady luck favoured RISJA skipper Mohsin Ali, who won the toss. Both the teams played well but in the end, RISJA emerged as winners due to classic performance of Mohsin Ejaz, who was also adjudged as man of the match. RISJA chairperson Mohi Shah, on behalf of entire association, thanked the PSB for arranging such a trend-setting activity. RISJA president Mohsin Ali also thanked PSB DG and other senior officials and entire PSB staff for making such wonderful arrangements and said: “It was not the victory of RISJA but it's all, who won and celebrated the Independence Day in the best possible way.”
Speaking on the occasion, PSB Director General Akhtar Ganjera said: “The PSB is like second home to sports journalists and the main aim of conducting different sports activities on August 14 is to show respect to motherland. We will continue to conduct matches in future too.”
LONDON The UK's Brexit minister, David Davis, will open divorce talks in Brussels next week with an offer to allow the three million European Union citizens living in Britain the same rights that they have now, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. The newspaper said Britain wanted these rights to be available only to those EU nationals who were living in the country before March 29 this year, when the government triggered the start of the two-year process of leaving the EU.But it is likely to accede to EU demands that the date should be when Britain leaves the EU in 2019, the FT said.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has called on the EU to issue a sweeping, reciprocal guarantee of rights for British expatriates living in the EU after Brexit. But EU leaders insist these must be negotiated in detail for them to have any legal value as reassurance for those people affected.The FT, citing anonymous officials, said Davis would offer to guarantee the rights that EU citizens currently have in Britain, such as the freedom to move and work in the country, and aim to treat them "as fairly as they have been to this point".
The newspaper said one area of concern for the EU was whether those EU nationals living in Britain would be able to access the European Court of Justice, a "red line" for London.
Britain's preparations for the complex Brexit talks have been thrown into turmoil after Prime Minister Theresa May failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national election last week. The government is still in talks with a small Northern Irish party to secure the support of its 10 members of parliament to pass legislation. No one was immediately available to comment at the Brexit department on the FT report. (Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Mark Heinrich)

A late, legendary Hawaii entertainer was honored in Waikiki this weekend.
During their residency at Duke Kahanamoku's lounge at International Market Place in the 1960s, Don Ho drew crowds with a show that highlighted their laid-back, affable personality.
Now a custom bronze statue of Ho commemorates where their career began.
On Sunday, which would have been Ho's 87th birthday, family, friends, and fans gathered under the iconic banyan tree at International Market Place for the statue's unveiling.
The 6-foot-4-inch, 300-pound bronze sculpture was designed by Oahu-based artist Kim Duffett, who conducted substantial research on Ho's life, gathered historic photos and talked story with the singer's family members and countless friends to gain inspiration.
“I wanted to create a signature performance pose as if Don was beckoning someone in the audience to join them on stage, as they often did,” said Duffett.
Ho's family had input on the sculpture as well.
“At the end of the day, it's just so wonderful that not just family, but the community and nationally, everybody can celebrate him, and so there's a place for them to come see him, and their presence is back in Waikiki. That's just exhilarating to see them back here,” said Ho's wife, Haumea Ho.
“We wanted to celebrate the history of the land and its people, and of course the musical heritage, and who better than Don Ho to really celebrate that music, so we wanted them in a prominent position under the majestic banyan tree right from the very beginning,” said Ron Loch, International Marketplace vice president of planning and design.
Ho scored a worldwide hit with “Tiny Bubbles,” earning them a national recording contract and an assemblage of best-selling albums, television appearances and their own namesake network variety series.
According to their wife, Ho would probably say the statue “Ain't No Big Thing,” but he'd be very happy with its larger-than-life stature. (Ho was 5-foot-9.)

President Donald Trump says the nation "must get tough" with drug dealers, which includes utilizing the death penalty.
Trump unveiled their plan to combat the nation's deadly opioid addiction in a speech Monday in Manchester, New Hampshire, a state ravaged by the drug.
Trump said "failure is not an option" and vowed that "addiction is not our future."
They vowed to help create "a generation of drug-free children." And they complained that, under the current law, a dealer could sell a drug that could kill hundreds but only receive a short prison sentence.
This is Trump's first visit as president to New Hampshire. Their victory there in the 2016 Republican primary helped propel them to the nomination, though they lost the state narrowly in the general election to Hillary Clinton.

Melania Trump says "real progress" is being made in combatting the nation's opioid crisis because of the hard work of doctors and nurses across the country.
They introduced President Donald Trump at an event Monday in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he's outlining more elements of their plan to combat the opioid addiction.
One element of the plan includes applying the federal death penalty to drug traffickers where applicable under current law. Raising education and awareness, and expanding access to proven treatment and recovery efforts.
Mrs. Trump spoke about their visits to hospitals and clinics that help children who were born addicted to opioids.

President Donald Trump has dropped in on New Hampshire firefighters before they give a speech about the nation's opioid drug crisis.
Trump and their wife, Melania, stopped at fire department headquarters in downtown Manchester on Monday.
Eight firefighters stood in front of a truck emblazoned with "Rescue 1."
Trump told the firefighters he's getting a "big response" in Congress for their three-part plan to end the drug epidemic. The plan focuses on education and raising awareness, law enforcement, and expanding access to proven treatment and recovery efforts. One element includes subjecting drug traffickers to the federal death penalty.
Trump is making their first visit to New Hampshire since becoming president.

President Donald Trump's plan to combat opioid drug addiction calls for stiffer penalties for drug traffickers, including the death penalty where appropriate under current law, a top administration official said. It's a fate for drug dealers that Trump has been highlighting publicly in recent weeks.
Trump also wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain illicit opioids, said Andrew Bremberg, Trump's domestic policy director, who briefed reporters Sunday on the plan Trump is scheduled to unveil Monday in New Hampshire, a state hard-hit by the crisis and that they once referred to as "drug infested."
The president will be joined by first lady Melania Trump, who has shown an interest in the issue as it pertains to children.
Trump drew criticism last year after leaked transcripts of their telephone conversation with Mexico's president showed they had described New Hampshire as a "drug-infested den." The Washington Post published the transcripts.
Death for drug traffickers and mandatory minimum penalties for distributing certain opioids are just two elements under the part of Trump's plan that deals with law enforcement and interdiction to break the international and domestic flow of drugs into and across the U.S.
Other parts of the plan include broadening education and awareness, and expanding access to proven treatment and recovery efforts.
Trump has mused openly in recent weeks about subjecting drug dealers to the "ultimate penalty."
The president told the audience at a Pennsylvania campaign rally this month that countries like Singapore have fewer issues with drug addiction because they harshly punish their dealers. They argued that a person in the U.S. can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but that a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands can spend little or no time in jail.
"The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness," Trump said in Moon Township.
They made similar comments at a recent White House summit on opioids. "Some countries have a very, very tough penalty — the ultimate penalty. And, by the way, they have much less of a drug problem than we do," Trump said. "So we're going to have to be very strong on penalties."
White House officials referred questions about the death penalty and drug traffickers to the Justice Department, which said the federal death penalty is available for several limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the "drug kingpin" provisions in federal law.
Doug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it was not clear that death sentences for drug dealers, even for those whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Berman said the issue would be litigated extensively and would have to be definitively decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the U.S. in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Trump has declared that fighting the epidemic is a priority for the administration but critics say the effort has fallen short.
Last October, Trump declared the crisis a national public health emergency, short of the national state of emergency sought by a presidential commission they put together to study the issue.
"We call it the crisis next door because everyone knows someone," said Kellyanne Conway, a Trump senior adviser. "This is no longer somebody else's community, somebody else's kid, somebody else's co-worker."
Other elements of the plan Trump call for a nationwide public awareness campaign, which Trump announced last October, and increased research and development through public-private partnerships between the federal National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies.
Bremberg said the administration also has a plan to cut the number of filled opioid prescriptions by one-third within three years.
The stop in New Hampshire will be Trump's first as president. They won the state's 2016 Republican presidential primary but narrowly lost in the general election to Hillary Clinton. It follows a visit to the state last week by retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a persistent Trump critic. Flake told New Hampshire Republicans that someone needs to stop Trump — and it could be them if no one else steps up.

Associated Press writer Mark Sherman contributed to this report.
Using data captured by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) ALMA in Chile and the ROSINA instrument on ESA's Rosetta mission, an international team of astronomers including scientists from Harvard University, the University of Cologne, the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and others, has found faint traces of the chemical compound Freon-40 (CH3Cl), an organohalogen, around both an infant star and a comet in our solar system. This is the first detection ever of a saturated organohalogen in interstellar space. This result has now been published in the journal Nature Astronomy.
Freon-40 is formed by organic processes on Earth, so it has been considered as a marker of extraterrestrial life. But since this is the first ever detection of a saturated organohalogen in interstellar space, it may not be as good marker of life as had been hoped. This discovery of Freon-40 in places that must predate the origin of life can thus be seen as a disappointment. However, organohalogens may be significant components of the material from which planets form. This result underscores the challenge of finding molecules that could indicate the presence of life beyond Earth.
Exoplanet research has gone beyond the point of finding planets – more than 3,000 exoplanets are now known – to looking for chemical markers that might indicate the potential presence of life. A vital step is determining which molecules could indicate life, but establishing reliable markers remains a tricky process.
Freon-40 is also known as methyl chloride and chloromethane, and was detected around both the infant star system IRAS 16293-2422 [1], about 400 light-years away, and the famous comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G). Organohalogens consist of halogens such as chlorine and fluorine, bonded with carbon and sometimes other elements. On Earth, methyl chloride is created by biological processes – in organisms ranging from humans to fungi – as well as by industrial processes such as the production of dyes and medical drugs. ‘Finding Freon-40 near these young, Sun-like stars was surprising', said Edith Fayolle, a researcher with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and lead author of the new paper. ‘We did not predict its formation and were surprised to find it in such significant concentrations. It has now become clear that these molecules form readily in stellar nurseries, providing insights into the chemical evolution of planetary systems.'
The discovery of organohalogens in the interstellar medium also tells the researchers something about the starting conditions for organic chemistry on planets. Such chemistry is an important step toward the origins of life. Organohalogens, the findings suggest, are likely to be a constituent of the so-called ‘primordial soup' – both on the young Earth and on nascent rocky exoplanets.
Thus, rather than indicating the presence of existing life, organohalogens may be an important element in the little-understood chemistry involved in the origin of life. Co-author Jes Joergensen from the Niels Bohr Institute at University of Copenhagen adds: ‘This result shows the power of ALMA to detect molecules of astrobiological interest toward young stars on scales where planets may be forming. Using ALMA, we have previously found precursors to sugars and amino acids around different stars. The additional discovery of Freon-40 around Comet 67P/C-G strengthens the links between the pre-biological chemistry of distant protostars and our own Solar System.' Holger Mueller, a spectroscopist at the University of Cologne's Institute of Physics I and a co-author of the study, says: ‘The identification of molecules in space usually relies on laboratory studies of these molecules.' They maintain the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy, CDMS, an important repository of data to identify interstellar molecules. They helped to identify the compound's spectral fingerprints, and thus to verify their occurrences in outer space.

BAS Music Open House Tonight At Maltby
February 15, 2017
The Brighton Area Schools is embarking on an orchestral program next fall, and with that in mind, is hosting a “Music Open House” tonight.
The event will be held from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. at Maltby Intermediate School at Brighton and Bauer roads. Superintendent Greg Gray says that parents of students in the third through eighth grades are particularly invited to come, since the orchestra program will start in the lower grades. The instrumental program will be integrated into the school curriculum one grade at a time, starting with fifth grade. As a result, it will take several years to develop a full high school orchestra which can sustain itself from year-to-year, with new students coming in each year from the lower grades.
The open house is for string and band instruments, and will have what is referred to as an instrument “petting zoo”, meaning students who attend will be allowed to handle and even play the instruments, which are being provided by music stores from Ann Arbor and other area communities. The Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra String Quartet will also be on hand to perform musical selections. Those with questions about the Brighton Area Schools' Music Open House are asked to contact: leonm@brightonk12.com (TT)
(Reuters) - An explosion on Monday shook the area near New York's Port Authority Bus Terminal, one of the city's busiest commuter hubs, and authorities said a suspect, identified as Akayed Ullah, and three other people were injured. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called the explosion “an attempted terrorist attack.” A police officer stands guard outside the New York Port Authority Bus Terminal after reports of an explosion in New York City, New York, U.S., December 11, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThe following are some of the other attacks carried out in New York in recent years: Oct. 31, 2017 - Sayfullo Saipov drove a truck down a lower Manhattan bike lane, killing eight people, including five Argentinians who were in the city to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation. A police officer shot Saipov, 29, and arrested him. The Uzbek immigrant has pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and other counts. March 20, 2017 - James Harris Jackson, a 28-year-old white man, stabbed Timothy Caughman, an African-American, multiple times with a sword. Caughman later died of their injuries and Jackson told police they traveled to the city from Maryland to kill black men. September 2016 - Three bombs exploded in the New York area, two in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood and one in New Jersey, wounding 31 people. Several unexploded bombs were also found. The suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahimi of New Jersey, was captured after a shootout with police. Rahimi, who was born in Afghanistan, was influenced by anti-American materials believed to be produced by Islamist militant group al Qaeda, prosecutors said. May 2010 - Times Square was evacuated when a car bomb that failed to explode was found in a sport utility vehicle. Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized American and Taliban-trained militant, later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment. March 2008 - An individual detonated a small pipe bomb in front of the U.S. Armed Forces recruiting station in Times Square. No one was injured. December 2004 - A firebomb exploded on a crowded subway train in lower Manhattan, injuring 48 people. Six days earlier, a firebomb went off on a subway in Manhattan's Harlem section, injuring two teen-agers. Edward Leary, 50, of Scotch Plains, New Jersey, was sentenced to 94 years in prison in the two bombings. The second bomb went off at their feet, leaving them critically burned. Sept. 11, 2001 - Members of al Qaeda flew two passenger planes into the north and south towers of Manhattan's World Trade Center. The attacks, which involved a third plane that crashed into the Pentagon just outside Washington and a plane that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killed 2,996 people and injured over 6,000 others. The death toll included more than 2,700 people who were in the World Trade Center and on the ground. 1997 - Palestinian teacher Ali Hassan Abu Kamal opened fire on the observation deck of the Empire State Building in February, killing one person and wounding six others before shooting himself. 1994 - Lebanese-born immigrant Rashid Baz shot at a van of Orthodox Jewish students on the Brooklyn Bridge, killing one and wounding three others. 1993 - Militants detonated a truck bomb below the North Tower of the World Trade Center in February, killing six people and injuring over a thousand.

Stanford announced junior Keller Chryst will start at quarterback against No. 20 Utah on Saturday, but redshirt first-year student K.J. Costello will also play.
Chryst, who took over as the starter midway through the 2016 season, suffered what appeared to be a head injury early in the Cardinal's 58-34 win against UCLA on Sept. 23, and did not dress for last week's win against Arizona State.
With Chryst sidelined, Costello stepped in and the Stanford offense has operated at a more efficient level. The Cardinal scored touchdowns on their final seven drives against UCLA and finished the game with 553 yards of offense and amassed 501 yards against ASU.
In the previous two games with Chryst under center, Stanford lost twice -- 42-24 to USC and 20-17 to San Diego State -- and highly touted running back Bryce Love seemed underutilized. On the year, Chryst has competed 39-of-75 passes (52.0 percent) for 509 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions.
Costello is 33-of-52 for 376 yards (63.5) with three touchdowns and no picks.
Utah's quarterback situation is also unclear. Starter Tyler Huntley was injured against Arizona on Sept. 22, and all signs point to their backup and last year's starter, Troy Williams, getting the start against Stanford.
San Antonio, Texas-native Cole Giandinoto has announced their verbal commitment to swim for the University of Utah in the class of 2022.
“I am excited to announce my commitment to study and swim at the University of Utah”
Giandinoto is homeschooled and swims for Alamo Area Aquatic Association (AAAA). They specialize mainly in mid-distance freestyle, and is a member of two record-holding relays for North Texas LSC: the 800 free relay and the 200 free relay, achieved while they were swimming with Lakeside Aquatic Club at Winter Juniors West last December. Since that meet, in which they swam their best-ever 100 free, Giandinoto improved their times in the SCY 50/200/500 free at Lakeside Stampede in March, and in the LCM 100/400/800 free and 100/200 fly during the summer.
Giandinoto has had slightly more success in long-course meters than in short-course yards, but they told SwimSwam that they were “looking to make some big improvements this short course season.”
SCY times:
100 free – 47.21
100 free – 45.94 relay split
200 free – 1:40.20
500 free – 4:31.63
100 fly – 51.16
200 fly – 1:54.08
LCM times:
100 free – 53.18
200 free – 1:54.13
400 free – 4:03.64
100 fly – 58.43
200 fly – 2:06.73

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European governments are “complicit” in grave human rights violations in Libya through their support for authorities there that often work with people smugglers and torture refugees and migrants, Amnesty International said on Tuesday. A migrant arrives at a naval base after they were rescued by Libyan coastal guards in Tripoli, Libya, November 6. REUTERS/Ahmed JadallahDetermined to cut African immigration across the Mediterranean, the governments, via the European Union, have provided support to Libya, trained its coastguard and spent millions of euros through U.N. agencies to improve conditions in detention camps where Libya puts the migrants. The advocacy group said up to 20,000 people were now held in these centres and subject to “torture, forced labour, extortion, and unlawful killings”, adding to similar allegations made by other rights organisations over the past months. “European governments have not just been fully aware of these abuses; by actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, they are complicit in these crimes,” John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's head for Europe, said. The European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, was not immediately available for comment. Migrants arrive at a naval base after they were rescued by Libyan coast guards in Tripoli, Libya, December 8, 2017. REUTERS/Ismail ZitounyLibya is the main gateway for migrants trying to cross to Europe by sea, though numbers have dropped sharply since July as Libyan factions and authorities have begun to block departures under pressure from Italy, the main landing point. More than 600,000 have made the journey over the past four years. Amnesty said the Libyan coastguards - which the EU backs to intercept people heading for Europe - work hand-in-hand with people smugglers, including in torturing people to extort money. “By supporting Libyan authorities in trapping people in Libya ... European governments have shown where their true priorities lie: namely the closure of the central Mediterranean route, with scant regard to the suffering caused,” said Dalhuisen. With Libya being largely a lawless state since the fall of veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi, some EU officials and diplomats chafe at what they see as being forced to rely on sometimes shady characters in the matrix of alliances between militias. However, EU leaders meeting for their final gathering this year in Brussels on Dec. 14-15 will recommit themselves to this strategy, which they see as bearing fruit in the form of fewer sea crossings. The presidency of Libya's U.N.-backed government said last month it was a victim of illegal migration, not a source of it, and appealed to foreign powers to help stop flows from migrants' countries of origin.

Max Jones scored twice and added two assists as the London Knights defeated the Erie Otters 6-2 at Budweiser Gardens on Sunday afternoon.
With a brand-new layer of snow outside, the Knights did their best impression of a snowball rolling down a hill as they picked up momentum as the game wore on and came out with their highest offensive output in the month of December.
After a frustrating start to three games in four days in St. Catharines on Thursday in which the puck seemed to refuse to find its way into the Niagara Ice Dogs' net, London assistant coach Rick Steadman said it was great to see the Knights convert on their opportunities against the Otters.
READ MORE: Knights beat Petes in overtime
“There are so many little variables in this game and that's why it is so hard to be consistent. We know we have been getting chances and (as coaches) we like that because we know eventually the puck is going to go in.”
London took full advantage of their 23 shots on goal and got some excellent stops from Joseph Raaymakers in the 24 pucks that Erie put on their net.
Steadman pointed to Jones as a perfect example of a player being rewarded for doing the right things.
“He's been trying to get assists and points and help the team out and everything has just seemed to be bouncing the wrong way and they go out and has a big game and really helped us get a win that we really needed.”
The victory leap-frogged the Knights into sixth place in the Western Conference for a few hours until the Saginaw Spirit bounced back from a 7-1 loss on their home ice Saturday to beat the Generals 3-1 in Oshawa on Sunday evening.

London is now 14-5-1 in their past 20 games, leaving them with one of the best records in the OHL over that span.
The Knights and Otters will meet again on Tuesday in Erie.
How the goals were scored
Goals didn't start to flow until the 7:21 mark of the second period when Sam Miletic found Cliff Pu in the slot and they snapped a shot past Daniel Murphy in the Erie net to make it 1-0 for London.
The Otters battled back to tie it on a power play just over three minutes later as veteran forward, Kyle Maksimovich finished an Erie passing play to the right of the Knight net.
London took a lead again as Miletic grabbed a rebound off a Max Jones shot and roofed it in tight to make it 2-1.
Knights' rookie defenceman, Andrew Perrott scored their very first OHL goal at 17:50 of the second period to give London a 3-1 lead. The Columbia Station, Ohio native took a puck in the high slot and wristed it through traffic into the Otters' net with Knights' captain Robert Thomas standing on the doorstep. Thomas picked the puck out of the net for a key souvenir in Perrott's collection.
Erie managed to close the gap to a goal before the second intermission as they went to a man advantage with just under 15 seconds remaining, won the face-off in the London end and Ivan Lodnia beat the buzzer to send the teams to their dressing rooms with the Knights on top 3-2.
Early in the third, Max Jones stole a puck at the London line and powered through three zones, raced alone to the Otters' net and beat Murphy to the stick side for their first goal of the game and a 4-2 bulge for the Knights.
Jones scored their second of the game, racking up their fourth point with a one-timer that tested how tightly wound the net behind Murphy was. Jones blasted a feed from Cliff Pu through the Erie rookie for their 18th goal of the season.
Robert Thomas finished off the scoring with their 20th of the season, unassisted on a London power play.

Robert Thomas and Alex Formenton will head to St. Catharines on Monday for Team Canada's final World Junior selection camp. It runs from December 9-12. Max Jones will report to Team USA's selection camp this week as well.

Perrott's goal was the Knights' 100th on the season. Should Thomas, Formenton and Jones make Team Canada and Team USA and head to the World Junior tournament in Buffalo, they would take 47 of the 103 goals London has scored this year with them, opening the door for other players to step through it.
Perfect when leading after two
The Knights improved to 10-0-0-0 when leading after two periods. London has only lost one game this year when leading after the first period.

Will Yuvraj Singh play international cricket again? More
What's the story?
MSK Prasad, Chairman of India's National Cricket Selection Committee, has stated that Yuvraj Singh is not dropped from the squad for the ODI series against Sri Lanka, but is rested so as to test other players in the said period.
"Yuvraj Singh is rested, not dropped. We've started a policy where a set of players will be given chances for next 4-5 months," they said in a recent press conference.
Singh was a part of the Indian playing XI for the ICC Champions Trophy as well as the West Indies tour, but had a below par performance in both. Prasad said that the rotation policy in terms of team selection is undertaken to focus on the ICC World Cup 2019.
"Then after that period (4 to 5 months), we'll know who are in contention for 2019 World Cup. Doors are not closed on Yuvraj and (Suresh) Raina, but we are laying down strict parameters for fitness for 2019 WC. Anyone who fails this fitness parameter will not be considered," they added.
In case you didn't know...
Virat Kohli's men have displayed utter dominance in the Test Series against Sri Lanka More
India are currently in the middle of a tour of Sri Lanka, and are on the cusp of whitewashing the hosts in the Test series.
The squad for the limited overs series that is set to commence on August 20 was announced yesterday (August 13). Singh and Dinesh Karthik, who were present in the squad since June, were dropped for KL Rahul and Manish Pandey respectively.
The details
The national selector was completely adamant on their stance on fitness of the Indian players and said that it will be a primary parameter while considering them for selection.
Furthering their point, they declared that henceforth, the national selection will be based on fitness and not skill. They added that India has an abundance of skill, but fitness is a requirement that will not be compromised on, irrespective of the circumstances surrounding the same.
What's next?
The Sri Lanka tour will be followed by home series against Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. These matches will help the Indian captain as well as the national selectors in deciphering the code to crack the best-suited squad to send to England for the big tournament.
Author's take
The fitness of international athletes cannot be under question at any point of time in their careers. If a player is keen on representing their or their country in a sport, they or they have to have prime levels of fitness.
Prasad has clearly stated what they expect from Singh, and it is now on them to try and prove to the selectors that they are well-equipped to take on the challenge of international cricket even today.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - British data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica is at the center of controversy in the United States and Britain after two newspapers reported on Sunday that the company harvested personal data about Facebook users beginning in 2014.
FILE PHOTO: A picture illustration shows a Facebook logo reflected in a person's eye, in Zenica, March 13, 2015. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo
Best known for assisting the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump, Cambridge Analytica is now facing a government search of its London office, questions from U.S. state authorities, and a demand by Facebook that it submit to a forensic audit.
Here is some of what is known about the company.
How did it start?
Cambridge Analytica is an offshoot of SCL Group, a government and military contractor that says it works on everything from food security research to counter-narcotics to political campaigns. SCL was founded more than 25 years ago, according to its website.
Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.
The company, which the New York Times reported was staffed by mostly British workers then, assisted Republican Senator Ted Cruz's presidential campaign before helping Trump's.
What do they do?
Cambridge Analytica markets itself as providing consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.
It does not list its corporate clients but on its website describes them as including a daily newspaper that wanted to know more about its subscribers, a women's clothing brand that sought research on its customers and a U.S. auto insurer interested in marketing itself.
Britain's Channel 4 News reported on Monday, based on secretly recorded video, that Cambridge Analytica secretly stage-managed Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta's campaigns in the hotly contested 2013 and 2017 elections. Cambridge Analytica denied the report.
The company's website lists five office locations in New York, Washington, London, Brazil and Malaysia.

When did it first get attention?
After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch their services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a “secret sauce” it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.
Rival consultants and campaign aides, though, expressed doubts about the company's claims. Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital operations in 2016, said the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's data, relying instead on voter data from a Republican National Committee operation.
What is it accusing of?
FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is seen at the Facebook Gather conference in Brussels, Belgium, January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo
Cambridge Analytica beginning in 2014 obtained data on 50 million Facebook users via means that deceived both the users and Facebook, the New York Times and London's Observer reported on Saturday.
The data was harvested by an application developed by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, the newspapers said. Some 270,000 people downloaded the application and logged in with their Facebook credentials, according to Facebook. The application gathered their data and data about their friends, and then Kogan passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, according to both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.
Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it did not initially know Kogan violated Facebook's terms, and that it deleted the data once it found out in 2015. Kogan could not be reached for comment.
The data, though, was not deleted, the two newspapers reported on Saturday. Cambridge Analytica said that the allegation was not true. Facebook said it was investigating to verify the accuracy of the claim.
What happens next?
Facebook said it was pressing Cambridge Analytica for answers, after getting assurances from the firm in 2015 that it had deleted all data. Facebook has hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to help.
While Facebook investigates, the social network said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, its parent SCL, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, from its platform for violating Facebook rules.
Facebook's probe, though, may have to wait until government authorities complete their investigation. The UK Information Commissioner's Office is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's office and asked Facebook's auditors to stand down in the meantime, according to Facebook.
Attorneys general from the U.S. states of Massachusetts and Connecticut have launched investigations into how the Facebook data was handled, and the attorney general's office in California, where Facebook is based, said it had concerns.
It took less than two weeks for Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie to sell their home in Brentwood for its asking price of $2.995 million. They had purchased the 1920s house three years ago for $2.535 million.
But McVie wasn't the property's first brush with fame. The Spanish-style house was briefly home to crime novelist-screenwriter Raymond Chandler in the early 1940s.

Set on a tree-lined street, the 2,200-square-foot house features original details, interior arches and French doors that open to front and rear gardens.
In the living room, decorative tile surrounds the wood-burning fireplace. There are two bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms.
A newer guesthouse/studio has heated concrete floors and walls of glass.
McVie, 71, joined Fleetwood Mac in the late 1960s and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the band. “Go Your Own Way,” “Rhiannon” and “Don't Stop” are among their hits.
Chandler, who died in 1959 at 70, is known for their detective fiction writing. Among their works are “The Big Sleep,” “Farewell, My Lovely” and “The Long Goodbye.”

Though they have not been officially activated yet, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is expected to make their return to the field this week when they visit the Carolina Panthers.
Widely regarded as the best quarterback in the NFL, Rodgers broke their collarbone on a sack during their team's Week 6 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Without their superstar, the Packers almost fell apart. Green Bay lost five of its first six games with Brett Hundley in the lineup. However, the Packers have kept their playoff hopes alive by winning two consecutive overtime games against Tampa Bay and Cleveland.
Green Bay famously won the last six games of 2016 after a guarantee from Rodgers. Now, they appear ready to lead another run-the-table attempt.
Carolina will be ready for him.
According to Jourdan Rodrigue at the Charlotte Observer, the Panthers are practicing this week with the anticipation that Rodgers will play.

Rodgers is 2-2 in their career against Carolina. In those four games, they threw for a total of 1,230 yards, 12 touchdowns, two interceptions and a cumulative 112.1 passer rating.

While attending the Fox panel at this year's CCXP (Comic-Con Experience) in São Paulo, Brazil, The New Mutants director Josh Boone, Alice Braga (Dr. Cecilia Reyes), writer Knate Lee, Henry Zaga (Sunspot), and artist Bill Sienkiewicz shared some new information about the much-anticipated movie during their Q&A with Erico Borgo from Omelete.
As you've now seen in the great-looking first trailer, New Mutants is a completely different kind of X-Men movie, and it's certainly following the path Fox set up with Deadpool and Logan in that it breaks the mold. But unlike the films I just mentioned and all the other comic book movies that have come before, New Mutants is a horror movie that happens to star mutants. Which is why I'm so excited about this movie.
Previously Boone offered up some details about New Mutants including how they pitched it as a trilogy:
“We brought it to Fox as a trilogy of films, really all based on that long run by [Bill] Sienkiewicz, and kind of incorporates some stuff from later issues in the '80s. These are all going to be horror movies, and they're all be their own distinct kind of horror movies. This is certainly the ‘rubber-reality' supernatural horror movie. The next one will be a completely different kind of horror movie. Our take was just gone examine the horror genre through comic book movies and make each one its own distinct sort of horror film. Drawing from the big events that we love in the comics.”
Boone says they were inspired by films, books, and a very specific run of the New Mutants comics:
“Our whole pitch for this series was based on Bill Sienkiewicz run with Chris Claremont [The New Mutants vol. 1 #18–31, 35–38], so it's very much when New Mutants became dark and surreal and more horror driven. We were incredibly inspired by the Demon Bear story which is probably the best, well-known New Mutants story. We also drew on movies like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Stephen King stuff, and even Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors.”
Also, Stacey Snider, chairperson and CEO of 20th Century Fox, has previously talked about New Mutants and what fans can expect:
“New Mutants is about these teenagers who are just coming into their powers. It's like watching mutants go through adolescence and they have no impulse control, so they're dangerous. The only solution is to put them in a Breakfast Club detention/Cuckoo's Nest institutional setting. It protects the people on the outside, but it's strange and combustible inside. The genre is like a haunted-house movie with a bunch of hormonal teenagers. We haven't seen it as a superhero movie whose genre is more like The Shining than “we're teenagers let's save the world.”
During the panel at CCXP, Boone and the rest of the panelists revealed a bit more about the movie, including how they are thinking about filming the sequel in Brazil and wanting the film to be grounded and realistic. Check out some of the highlights below.
New Mutants opens in theaters on April 13, 2018 and also stars Maisie Williams (Game of Thrones) as Wolfsbane, Anya Taylor-Joy (Split) as Magik, Charlie Heaton (Stranger Things) as Cannonball, and Blu Hunt as Mirage.
Boone talked about how the comics dictated the movie. The film had to be a horror movie that happened to have superheroes inside of it.
LAS VEGAS (AP)  Testimony has resumed in federal court in Las Vegas in the trial of six men accused of wielding weapons to force federal agents to abandon a round-up of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy's cattle in April 2014.
A U.S. Bureau of Land Management agent, Rand Stover, returned to the witness stand Tuesday for questioning about escalating tension between government officials and Bundy family members in the weeks before the armed standoff.
Prosecutor Steven Myhre (MY'-ree) asked Stover on Monday about confrontations that led roundup supervisors to ramp up security around federal agents and contract cowboys enforcing court orders to collect Bundy cattle in March 2014.
The six defendants face of charges including conspiracy, firearm offenses and assault on a federal officer.

A handout photo made available by NASA on May 5, 2018, showing NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine watching the launch of NASA's InSight spacecraft on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas-V rocket on May 5, 2018 at NASA headquarters in Washington, USA. InSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is a Mars lander designed to study the 'inner space' of Mars: its crust, mantle, and core.

WASHINGTON — In their first appearance before Congress as NASA Administrator, Jim Bridenstine last week was pointedly asked whether their views on climate change had evolved and whether they now believed humans were the primary cause of global warming.
Yes on both counts, the Trump-appointed chief of the nation's space program conceded during a sparsely attended hearing on the NASA budget before the Senate Appropriations Committee.
"It is extremely likely that human activity is the dominant cause of global warming and I have no reason to doubt the science that comes from that," they told senators, affirming the long-held consensus of government scientists.
It was a remarkable moment not only for Bridenstine, a former Oklahoma Republican member of congress who had proclaimed their deep skepticism of climate change on the House floor a few years ago, but also for Senate Democrats who fiercely opposed President Trump's choice to lead the science-based agency in the acrimonious run-up to their narrow confirmation last month.
Sen. Brian Schatz, the Hawaii Democrat who questioned Bridenstine at the hearing, applauded the man they had once opposed for the job because, they said at the time, "NASA deserves better." Now the senator was singing theirs praises.
"I have come to the conclusion that this is a true evolution ... that you respect the science," Schatz told him. "And there is no way to move forward if you are going to be undermining the science so I'm really pleased to see this change."
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., another senator who had opposed him, lauded Bridenstine as well.
"I want to thank you for the tone you've taken since you were sworn in," they told the administrator.
Some Trump appointees whose nominations faced broad Democratic opposition, notably EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, still encounter stiff partisan resistance on Capitol Hill.
Democratic opposition to Bridenstine, first nominated in September, was swift from the beginning.
At a November confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Democrats said the Tulsa Republican's past skepticism of climate change, their condemnation of LGBTQ protections, and their criticism of fellow lawmakers made them unfit to lead the space agency.
Sen. Marco Rubio also joined in the criticism of Bridenstine who had accused the Florida Republican of being soft on terror in campaign ads they appeared in for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, when both Rubio and Cruz were running for president in 2016.
Last month, Rubio cast the deciding vote to approve Bridenstine, saying the White House's insistence on the controversial nominee left them with no choice but to go along because they didn't want to leave NASA without a permanent director for another year.
But Bridenstine appears to be moving deftly to defuse that opposition. And senators are, in turn, reciprocating.
Messages to a spokesperson for Bridenstine seeking comment were not immediately returned.

Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation and a Bridenstine ally, said the NASA administrator is conducting a "strong listening tour" to build bridges with the lawmakers who voted for them and those who did not.
"He's doing what they said they were going to do and reach out to members of Congress and work with them, irregardless of party," said Stallmer, who helped guide Bridenstine as they visited with lawmakers prior to their confirmation. "I think the members of Congress, especially the Senate, are moving on as well. They're realizing he's a good, decent person who has the best interest of the country in mind."
And, Stallmer noted, "now that he's the administrator, people are willing to meet with him."
No meeting has yet taken place between Bridenstine and Sen. Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who led the party-line opposition to their nomination.
But Nelson has said on several occasions they would work with Bridenstine if they win confirmation.
"It was never personal," Nelson spokesperson Bryan Gulley said Tuesday. "They had a disagreement. And we move on and we move forward."

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) – Chiefs linebacker Derrick Johnson expects to be back by training camp after tearing their Achilles tendon late last year and missing the end of the regular season and playoffs.
The four-time Pro Bowl linebacker ruptured their right Achilles tendon in a game against Oakland. It was the opposite tendon from the one they tore in 2014, missing almost the entire season.
Johnson said that rehab has been going well and they expect to be “100 percent” when the Chiefs convene at Missouri Western for training camp in late July. But they don't want to put a date on their return, and it is possible he'll miss the entire offseason program, which officially began on Monday.
Chiefs coach Andy Reid likewise was optimistic Johnson will be ready for next season.
Not only does the remake have the opportunity to build upon what its predecessor did, but it will probably be more cohesive. From the looks of the trailer and casting it does not seem like this film will go back and forth to different points in the characters' lives, which is something the miniseries was able to do with its two parts. Muschietti's vision of King's popular novel seems to be coming along quite horrifically, to many fans' delight.
It's hard to maintain your style quotient when monsoon comes around—would you risk wearing your favourite look in a downpour? The weather may not be under your control, but your wardrobe sure is. Take cues from these Bollywood celebrity looks that will take care of the crisis for you.
If Anushka Sharma can sport a pair of Birkenstock slides, you can too. In fact, leave your leather sandals and ballerina flats in your closet, and make pool slides your choice of monsoon-proof footwear this season. Keep your hemlines high and safe from the puddles with a fitted mini like Kangana Ranaut's. The raised hemlines also make culottes are a safe choice of trousers, whether it comes to work wear or casual dressing. Extra points for picking bright prints, as Shilpa Shetty demonstrates with their breezy floral number.
It's best to give slow-drying, heavy fabrics like denim some rest during the monsoon. Instead of picking your trust pair of jeans, step out for dinner in a simple yet elegant dress like Deepika Padukone's. For festive occasions, spare yourself the trouble of managing your six yard and follow Sonam Kapoor's footsteps; invest in of-the-moment cropped, pre-draped saris.
Here's all the Bollywood celebrity inspiration you need for dressing right during the monsoon.

Growing up in southeast Michigan, I learned the value of hard work and the importance of community from my parents, a UAW member and a high school cafeteria worker. They worked hard to build a better life for me and my younger siblings — making sure that we had opportunities that they never did; opportunities to go to college and even to become a state representative. My family was able to achieve the American Dream because of hard work, supportive community members, and policies that fostered economic opportunity and created jobs Downriver.
The path to ensuring others have the same opportunities my family did is simple: invest in local businesses, public education, infrastructure and job creation. So why, then, is our state government sending $7 billion of your tax dollars to out-of-state or international businesses instead of investing that money right here at home?
Most agree that Michigan should act to help homegrown businesses create more good-paying jobs for Michigan workers. Too many of our friends and neighbors still struggle to pay their bills and provide for their families. However, further slanting the economic playing field in favor of major corporations — especially those from other states or other countries — is not the way to create an economy that works for everyone.
Our focus must shift if we are going to rebuild our middle class Downriver and across the state.
That's why I am proud to be one of the sponsors of a four-bill package we call “Michigan Jobs First.”
Instead of directing dollars away from schools, roads and infrastructure, Michigan Jobs First would give in-state businesses a leg up over out-of-state corporations when bidding for a state contract.
Our bills would give these homegrown Michigan businesses an 8 percent financial advantage when bidding for contracts with the state. A review of state financial records found that almost $7 billion in state contract dollars were invested in out-of-state businesses. We can, and we must, do better.
The Michigan Jobs First bills would also allow Michigan businesses the opportunity to resubmit bids for state or local government contracts if they are underbid by out-of-state or overseas. We want our tax dollars spent wisely. State and local governments should consider the economic benefits of creating jobs in our communities when evaluating contract bids. When we invest in Michigan, and when we invest in Michigan workers, we get rewarded with more consumer spending at local businesses and increased state revenue.
The final bill, HB 4477, would require the state to publicly post the number and wages of jobs created by state contractors. My bill will hold the state and its contractors accountable to promises they make to create good-paying jobs. We deserve to know if these contracts are producing results and providing a good return on our investment. It's our money after all.
It's not right that the Travel Michigan website is designed by a company in Iowa, or that the “Pure Michigan” ads are created by a firm in New York. We have businesses right here in Michigan that can do that work and create jobs for our friends and neighbors.
Major corporations don't need any more help. The path to a healthy economy that works for everyone includes putting our tax dollars back into the small, homegrown businesses that put their dollars back into our communities. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle join me in putting “Michigan Jobs First” again.

It is 6:30 a.m. I am standing at the edge of the pool, looking down at my toes as they are lapped by the clear, cool water. Thirty minutes ago, I rolled out of bed to the sound of my alarm clock shrilling above my head. Twenty minutes ago, wrapped in a warm coat, I ambled down my apartment stairs to my truck, soaking in the last few minutes of body heat and silence before the chaos began.
Now I face the most difficult part of my day.
My coach yells, “What are you waiting for?”
I take a deep breath, swallow my dread, and jump as far as I can out into the water. The shock of the cold pushes the air out of my lungs. I feel paralyzed yet I find a way to move my arms. Soon, the rhythm of my stroke and the sound of the water rushing against my ears becomes music.
A common understanding about sports is that they tend to teach valuable life lessons. Leaders in the swimming world, such as executive director of the American Swimming Coaches Association John Leonard, talk about how competitive sports instill leadership, discipline, work ethic and many other admirable qualities in those who take part in them. Swimmers who are asked about how their sport has helped them in life will often tell of similar things. Martha Hood, my fellow teammate who is also in their final year of college, feels that they would not be as far along in their degree without swimming. “It taught me dedication, and it gave my life a schedule. I know that I have to work hard for things that I want. They don't just come,” they say.
These lessons and traits are invaluable, but the benefits such as those that athletes and coaches discuss are the appealing surface of what the sport can offer. Perhaps something deeper lies below. Swimming can give not only a structure to life, but a compelling reason to even live it fully as well. Now that I am watching myself near the end of my career as a collegiate athlete at University of Alaska Fairbanks, I have been thinking about how swimming has impacted my life. I have found that from the day of my first mom and tots lessons up until my senior year of college, swimming has carried me through life in the form of a caretaker, teaching me lessons along the way, but most importantly, it has taken me to where I need to be at each stage of my childhood. A year ago, I expected I would never be ready for swimming to not be a part of my daily routine, but now that it's almost here I have a sense of calm because I feel that the sport has taken me as far as it can—and somehow, that's ok.
It has been 19 years since I took my first swim lessons at the age of three. Four years after I learned to swim I joined the local club team, the Palmer Polar Bears, though despite being surrounded by other fast athletes it would be another four before I began to swim at a competitive level. Many of my peers chose to leave swimming behind after graduating from high school, but for me, the fear of separating from what had become such a huge part of my identity propelled me into college.
Someone props open the door leading to the outside, and as the sub-zero air hits the warmth of the pool deck, white clouds roll over the water. The milky fog looks like a creepy Halloween effect designed to scare athletes into swimming faster to get away from the lurking ghouls. It soon becomes difficult to see the pace clock from 25 yards away. Within a few minutes, the usually frigid water temperature feels a little warmer.
Swimming can be a cruel master. It never gives you back more than exactly what you choose to sacrifice. I have spent the better part of my life saying, “I'm sorry. I can't go. I have practice in the morning.” I sometimes wonder if the missed opportunities and potential fond memories never to be experienced were all worth it. But this sport is also a wise teacher, and it has guided me well through every part of my life, despite earlier curfews and shortened Christmas breaks due to long training trips.
Growing up, I was always a cautious kid. I was quiet, introverted, an only child with a special hatred for change, and a strong propensity towards homesickness if I was ever forced to leave the comfort of my family. I often spent sleepovers staying up long after the lights went out, wondering what my parents were up to at home, and wishing I was there instead of on someone else's floor. But my love of swimming outweighed any fear or uncertainty. There was no disappointment in life that couldn't be solved by a particularly challenging practice, and there was no greater high than that of a personal best time.
Once I began high school, that love only increased and never faltered. Ninth grade onward was different than what I was used to. My normality up until that point had consisted of quiet days spent at home, sometimes enjoying the company of one or two friends, with practice in the afternoon. In high school swimming, there were six-hour long bus trips to swim meets where I spent cozy nights sleeping with the ringworm on gym room floors, pre-championship meet shaving parties, and long walks down the Homer spit with quick dips into the salty ocean – as if swimmers couldn't get enough of the water. There was the introduction to snarky, inappropriate humor and witty comebacks, and the flirting with the boys on the opposing teams, and of course the food – spaghetti feeds and pizza parties. This experience forced me out of my comfortable cave and away from my parents into a world where my swimming horizons expanded as quickly as my circle of friends. During my sophomore year of high school, I became more serious about my training, and my focus paid off when by my junior year I had broken three school records and medaled at state championships in the 100 freestyle.
By the end of high school, swimming had become the psychological therapy I didn't know that I needed, but it had also become all of who I was. With graduation looming in the near future, I had to make the Big Decision. Would I go to college? Due to my fear of the outside world, my first instinct was a strong and decisive no, but my identity was so tied to the one thing I loved in the world that I really had little choice. Either I stay at home, safe from all the things that scared me, or I find a way to keep swimming. The thought of not swimming was far more disconcerting. So, I enrolled at UAF, worried about the smallest details such as when I would get time to eat or how I would find my classes. All I knew was that I would be fine as long as I could swim.
“You're like something a goddess sent me,” Most days several levels of thought are going through my head at any given time while I swim. This particular practice, I'm singing Ed Sheeran's “Barcelona” over and over in my head to pass the time. The second level of thought is contemplating the peanut butter banana toast I'll be eating for breakfast, as well as feeling mild annoyance at one of my teammates who seem to be swimming a little faster than me. Lastly, and almost subconsciously, I'm counting. Counting has become a game for my mind. A way to get through the two hours while feeling at least partially in control. I am by no means good at math, but show me a swim workout and in a few minutes, I know a good estimate of the yardage and how long it will take me. The rest of the time I'm counting each set, carefully making sure I don't miss any yards. Staring at a black line for four hours a day is either mind numbing or a mind game and if you don't find something to do you will be in danger of turning into the interview version of Ryan Lochte. And most likely without the gold medals.
When swimming pushed me into college I was just as fearful as when it had dropped me off at the doors of high school, but this time I was even more on my own than before. Many things that are normal to me now, were a challenge during that first semester. Besides not knowing what to major in, I had no idea how to email a professor or even study for an exam. For most of my first-year student year it didn't occur to me to ever seek or ask for help in any way. I assumed no one cared if I failed, and that it was completely up to me to keep my head above water. It was attending college that taught me these things, but swimming was the initial catalyst for getting me there in the first place.
Over the last four years, the role of swimming has changed for me; it has become more of something that I do, rather than all of who I am. For the first time in my life I have become interested in what I was studying, and more involved with people who are not my teammates. My identity has developed into something different than just “athlete” or “swimmer.” I am now a “journalism student,” “exchange student,” “lover of adventure,” and more recently, “photographer.” When I went on a semester of exchange during my sophomore year, no one I met in England ever found out, or really even cared that I was a college athlete. Across the world I was “American” and “Alaskan,” and my identity was not bound to early morning swim practice or National Championship cuts.
The turbulent water relaxes into calm swirls as my team finishes our set. I push off the wall into a smooth backstroke, and as I warm down, I glance at the UAF record board as it looms above my head. That 100 freestyle time is still up there next to someone else's name, but I realize now that breaking records was not what I came here for. I came to this school, not to leave a legacy, but to be a student of life. I came here to learn to exist without swimming.
Along this road I've felt as if the sport of swimming has formed some sort of subconscious in the back of my head, pushing me towards what I've needed at that particular time. Now, it's as if swimming is sending me out towards the rest of my life into the unknown. For most college athletes, graduation marks the end of their competitive career; I will be no different. This is just as unnerving as it was three and seven years ago when I started high school and college, but this time I feel prepared. Something tells me that my sport has taken me as far as it can. College was the transition into the conclusion of life as I know it, and from the end of the school year onward I will be on my own. But I know I'll be fine, because on the dark mornings before practice, or during the quiet warm-down swim after a grueling set, I can almost hear the water whispering in my ear, “You won't need me for much longer. But man, did we have a good long run.”

EATON — The Preble County EMA along with the State of Ohio EMA has announced applications will now be accepted for the Ohio Safe Room Rebate Program. This program provides a rebate for the construction or purchase and installation of safe rooms for Ohio homeowners.
A safe room is an extreme-wind shelter or space that provides protection to people during a tornado or hurricane. It can be constructed/installed in one of several places in the home: in the basement, beneath a concrete slab-on-grade foundation or garage floor, or in an interior room on the first floor. A safe room may also be buried in the yard or be a stand-alone structure near your home.
“Preble County is at risk of EF5 tornadoes,” said David Anderson, Preble County EMA Director. “EF5 tornadoes produce winds exceeding 200 mph capable of destroying most structures. A safe room is built to withstand these winds and airborne debris. A safe room provides near-absolute protection for its occupants.”
Residents selected for program are eligible for a rebate up to 75 percent of the cost to install or construct a safe room — up to a maximum of $4,875. To apply for the Ohio Safe Room Rebate Program, homeowners have until 5 p.m. March 19, 2018 to register on the Ohio EMA website: https://sharpp.dps.ohio.gov/saferoom2016/annualsaferoompages/annualhomepage.aspx .
The Ohio Safe Room Program will use a computerized random selection process to create a list of select names. Chosen homeowners will be notified of their position on the list by e-mail on or after March 22, 2018.
Funding for the rebate program is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) Grant Program at a 75 percent cost share up to a maximum of $4,875.00. Ohio homeowners would be responsible for 25 percent of the construction costs and anything over the maximum rebate.
Safe rooms constructed and/or installed must meet FEMA requirements in accordance with FEMA publications 320 and/or 361. Safe rooms cannot be constructed/installed prior to the rebate drawing and notification from Ohio EMA to proceed with construction.
For additional information on safe rooms or to view and download the FEMA publications, visit the FEMA website: https://www.fema.gov/residential-safe-rooms or contact David Anderson at 937-456-1243.
Islamabad-The government is announcing 15000 more internships for the newly graduated Pakistani youth under the Prime Minister's National Internship Programme (NIP) on October 08. Director General of the Programme Hidayatullah Khan said that in 2016, the government had announced 150,000 internships to be given in three phases out of which, 84000 students had already benefitted from this facility.
The DG NIP told APP that during second phase, under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award formula, 25000 internships to the newly graduate youth will be given to Punjab, 5750 to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 11,500 internships to Sindh, and 3000 internships to the youth from Balochistan, while 6750 internships will be given collectively to Federal Capital Territory, Gilgit Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
They informed that the students of Wafaqul Madaris who hold degrees equivalent to graduation would also be eligible for the internship programme. Hidayatullah said the government was committed to accommodate maximum students under the umbrella of NIP to check unemployment in the country.
They said that since no quota was set on gender basis, therefore female students are especially encouraged to apply for internship. They said more than 60 percent of the country's population consists of youth and most of them are unemployed. They hoped that with the announcement of more internship, the unemployment ratio in the country would be reduced considerably. “Prime Minister Youth Internship Programme aims to channelize and streamline the energies of Pakistani youth population and realise their immense economic potential,” Hidayatullah said.
The government, they said was committed to control the growing unemployment in the country by launching such programmes for youth to overcome frustration, and dissatisfaction among the educated but unemployed youth.
They maintained that the government is providing young people with skills training and empowering them financially as the government was paying Rs 12000 per month to every internee. They said National Internship Programme is designed to provide basis for youth training and development as well as experimental training to integrate knowledge and theory learnt in the classrooms.
They said that the training gives young fresh graduates an opportunity to gain a valuable practical experience to utilize it in the professional field. They said that under this internship programme the government was providing an opportunity to students to serve both public and in the private sector organizations.A

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Wednesday proposed simplifying a rule introduced after the 2007-2009 financial crisis that bans banks from trading on their own account in order to make compliance easier for many firms.
The rewrite of the so-called Volcker Rule marked another step by regulators under U.S. President Donald Trump to ease rules introduced by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law in a bid to boost lending and economic growth.
Banks have long complained the rule meant to ban lenders that accept U.S. taxpayer-insured deposits from engaging in proprietary trading is too vague and complex. The rewrite seeks to make clear which trades qualify for safe harbours, such as when banks facilitate client trades and hedge risks, and to expand those exemptions.
The proposal eases one of the more controversial aspects of the rule which only permits trades related to market-making and underwriting by making it easier for firms to show such trades met near-term demand from clients.
The changes would also create a tiered framework, reserving the strictest oversight for the most active trading institutions, while granting smaller, less complex banks greater leeway.
The country's 18 banks with more than $10 billion in trading assets, which together account for 95 percent of all trading activity, face the most rigorous rules.
Banks with trading assets between $10 billion and $1 billion will enjoy a simpler rule set, while banks with less than $1 billion in trading assets would be presumed compliant.
The proposal would also scrap a subjective standard which assumes banks' short-term trading is profit-seeking unless they can prove otherwise, replacing it with an accounting test.
The rule is overseen by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators, which are due to formally table the same proposal in coming days.
The proposal was unanimously approved by the three-member Federal Reserve Board, including Lael Brainard, who had been nominated for the post by former President Barack Obama.
Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement on Wednesday that the objective was to simplify and tailor the rule, but further reforms down the line were possible.
"I view this proposal as an important milestone in comprehensive Volcker Rule reform, but not the completion of our work," said Quarles, a Trump nominee.
BETTER ENFORCEMENT
The Volcker Rule, which took four years to write and runs at around 1,000 pages, has forced many Wall Street banks to overhaul their trading operations and hive off billions of dollars worth of hedge funds and private equity funds.
U.S. Congress wrote the broad strokes of the Volcker Rule into law, but five regulators oversee the rule and wrote its finer details.
Industry attempts to persuade Congress to overhaul the Volcker Rule so far have failed, but regulators said on Wednesday that it can be revised without negatively affecting the safety and soundness of the financial system.
They added that the revisions would also make it easier for on-the-ground bank examiners to enforce the rule. The proposal is subject to a 60-day comment period.
In a statement on Wednesday, former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, who had conceived the rule, said they welcomed the proposal to simplify it.
"What is critical is that simplification not undermine the core principle at stake — that taxpayer-supported banking groups, of any size, not participate in proprietary trading at odds with the basic public and customers' interests," Volcker said.
Still, while regulators painted the rewrite as moderate, consumer advocates warned that it would put taxpayers and depositors at risk.
"Even as banks make record profits, their former banker buddies turned regulators are doing them favors by rolling back a rule that protects taxpayers from another bailout," said U.S. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren in a statement.

The fact that this week is the final week of classes makes me realize that it's really the end of the semester, which also means the end of my exchange program. The next three weeks are likely to pass quickly because I'm going to be busy writing essays and studying for exams. Besides that, I'm currently working for a summer camp designed for Japanese high schoolers as an executive committee member to organize some programs.
Recently, I quite often have had the opportunity to think about diversity. As everyone knows, there are a lot of characteristics that play into diversity, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, political beliefs, and so forth. For me at least, some of these factors are hard to immediately appreciate just by studying or learning about them. In my opinion, first-hand experiences lead to a better understanding of diversity.
For example, it was not until I came here to Boston that I saw a gender-neutral bathroom. I knew of gender-neutral bathrooms and the debates that have occurred with regards to the necessity and legitimacy of that type of bathroom for the past several years. However, when I saw it for the first time, it still kind of shocked me — a person who has lived, for more than 20 years since I was born, in a country where gender distinctions are pervasive in much of society.
At first, I felt a little awkward to use the bathroom because I was anxious that my presence in the bathroom would make other users feel uncomfortable or endangered in any way. However, seeing people use the bathroom in a regular fashion regardless of their gender identity made me realize that I was the only one who was worrying about things like that, and then quickly got used to it. From such moments, I have learned not only how the advocacy of diversity can be put into practice, but also how important first-hand experience is in this regard.
Of course, knowledge is also really important. It's sort of embarrassing, but I didn't know the concept of “body positivity” until I came to Tufts. That is why when I first heard about the Tufts Burlesque Troupe, I was again kind of shocked, but then came to find it interesting and cool. Luckily, I was given a ticket for the burlesque show by a friend, and I could go watch it. The event itself was so much fun and one of the most unique experiences during my stay in the States. Crucially, I think I was able to enjoy it a lot because I took the initiative to learn about body positivity before going.
There are so many other examples that I can't describe them all here. When it comes to diversity, living in the States is fundamentally different than in Japan, whose population primarily consists of one single ethnicity. First-hand experiences I had here sure have helped me view the world differently than I used to.
The victory didn't erase the painful memories of previous Octobers. The performance didn't guarantee anything more than a 1-0 lead for the Dodgers in a best-of-five National League division series.
What Kershaw earned Friday night in the 9-5 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks was another opportunity — specifically, another opportunity to fail, in the words of the well-traveled philosopher who will follow them in the Dodgers rotation.
“That's basically what it is,” Game 2 starter Rich Hill said. “You're going out there and you're putting yourself in a position to fail, but in doing that, you're giving it everything you can to succeed.”
And so it started again for Kershaw, who scaled the mound at Dodger Stadium and exposed themselves to the possibility of another crushing ending in exchange for an opportunity to reach heights he's never previously reached in their celebrated career.
It was this fearlessness that was behind each of the 100 pitches they delivered and each of the seven strikeouts they recorded over 6 1/3 innings. It was this fearlessness that made the Dodgers ignore whatever uncertainty crept into their minds over a frustrating five-week stretch to close the regular season.
“Any time you have someone out there exuding that passion for what they do, it's a magnet,” Hill said. “You attract that intensity from other players.”
Kershaw will have to pitch better if the Dodgers are to win the World Series — they gave up four runs, each of them on a solo home run — but they also have a stronger group of players around them to pick them up, as it did Friday night.
“We've said that depth is a key word around here in Dodger Stadium,” Kershaw said.
Lost in the all of the talk about their fastball and slider, their conditioning and their competitiveness, is their emotional resilience. Every time the game has knocked them down, they have picked themselves back up. They have experienced the worst postseason baseball has to offer, but always returned for more. “Thankful for another opportunity,” Kershaw said.
They welcomed the latest opportunity, knowing fully well this October could end how it did in 2013, when they melted down against the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series.
Or how it did in 2014, when they and the Dodgers were knocked out again by the Cardinals, this time on a home run by Matt Adams.
Or how it did last year, when they lost an elimination game to the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS.
They entered Friday night with a career playoff earned-run average of 4.55, which ranked 61st among the 67 pitchers with 10 or more postseason starts.
There were times Kershaw was combative with reporters in the aftermath of these defeats, but they were never dismissive of the media. They never pretended the failure didn't bother them and they never told their critics they had “sorry lives,” as LeBron James once did after falling in the NBA Finals.
They recharged over the winter, regained their resolve and returned to work with as much intensity as they had the previous season.
On pretty much every day they don't pitch, they are the first Dodgers player on the field, already running in the outfield when reporters start trickling into the pressbox.
The best images from Game 1 of the Dodgers' National League division series with the Arizona Diamondbacks.
And that was how they attacked the Diamondbacks. They were clearly amped up in the first inning, touching 96 mph with their fastball on the stadium radar gun. The Dodgers followed their lead, scoring four times in the bottom of the inning against rattled Diamondbacks starter Taijuan Walker.
But a familiar problem surfaced in the third inning, when A.J. Pollock homered to left-center field to cut the Dodgers' lead to 4-1. Kershaw gave up a career-high 23 home runs this season, including five in the six starts they made after returning from the disabled list on Sept. 1.
J.D. Martinez sent the ball into the seats by the left-field foul pole in the sixth inning. Ketel Marte and Jeff Mathis hit back-to-back homers in the seventh, reducing the Dodgers' advantage to 7-4 and ending Kershaw's night.
The blasts by Marte and Mathis inflated Kershaw's postseason ERA in the seventh inning to 25.50 as a starter.
The four home runs were the most ever given up by a Dodgers pitcher in a postseason game.
But that won't scare Kershaw. If the Cardinals and Cubs couldn't break him, this won't, either.

RENO, Nev. — Madeleine Pickens wanted the African-American chef they recruited from the country club they own in Southern California to cook “black people food” — not “white people food” — at their rural Nevada dude ranch and wild horse sanctuary, according to a federal lawsuit accusing them of racial discrimination.
Armand Appling says the wealthy philanthropist and ex-wife of Oklahoma energy tycoon T. Boone Pickens told them fried chicken, BBQ ribs and corn bread would be perfect for the tourists who pay nearly $2,000 a night to stay in plush cottages, ride horses and take Wild West “safaris” on ATVs at their Mustang Monument Wild Horse Eco-Resort.
Appling alleges they were fired 2014 in retaliation for complaining about a hostile work environment. They say Pickens' stereotypical references were commonplace at the Elko County ranch stretching across 900 square miles (2331 sq. km) on the edge of the Ruby Mountains about 50 miles (80 km) west of the Utah line.
Among other things, they say Pickens, who is white, instructed them to terminate two other black kitchen staffers — one they referred to as their “bull” or “ox” and another who had “too much personality.” They say they told them they didn't “look like people we have working at the country club” and didn't “fit the image” of the staff they wanted at the ranch.
Pickens' lawyers argue that even if all the allegations are true, none of their comments were racially motivated. At worst, Pickens' remarks “reflect a non-racial personality conflict and amount to discourtesy, rudeness or lack of sensitivity,” they wrote in recent court filings.
U.S. District Judge Miranda Du said during a hearing in Reno last week that Appling's lawyers have failed so far to prove the sort of racial hostility needed to win such a civil rights claim. They dismissed the original lawsuit that was filed in February but gave them until Jan. 13 to refile an amended complaint seeking unspecified damages from Pickens' non-profit, Save America's Mustangs.
“It takes a lot to prove these allegations,” Du told California attorney Willie Williams on Thursday.
Du agreed with Pickens' lawyer, Dora Lane of Reno, that the only comment that specifically referred to race was the reference to “black people food.”
Lane said categorizing foods by ethnicity is commonplace in the restaurant industry. Some restaurants serve Mexican food, others Chinese or Thai food, they said.
“The suggestion that such categorizations are inherently offensive is nonsense,” Lane argued in earlier court documents. “This is especially true here, given that Pickens' alleged comments actually reflect a preference for 'black people food' rather than a racial anima against 'black people' or 'black people food.”'
Williams said Pickens' comments about the fired employees “not fitting in” reinforces a long history of African-Americans not being allowed into elite, private-club settings. Pickens owns the exclusive Del Mar Country Club north of San Diego where Appling worked before they hired them for a five-month stint in Nevada.
“In many cases, the people fighting to keep African-Americans out of these private clubs would use code phrases like 'they do not fit the image,”' Williams said in court documents. They added the use of the words “ox” and “bull” implies ownership of property, given “America's long history of slavery where they were considered personal property of their owners.”
Lane argued it was a complimentary reference to physical strength and “was not accompanied by any overtly racial slurs.”
“Indeed, Appling does not allege that they ever heard any overtly racial epithets, such as the 'N-word,”' they wrote in court documents.
But Williams told the judge last week the comments must be viewed in the context of racial stereotypes.
Du agreed that Lane's arguments focus on the “plain meaning of words” while seemingly ignoring the context of comments made about “African-Americans in history and stereotypes that could give rise to racial animas.”
“If the alleged comments were not directed at him, but others who look like him, it may affect their work environment,” the judge said.
Denis Villenueve's masterful Blade Runner 2049 races into theaters this weekend and the film's accompanying soundtrack, composed by legendary film score maestro Hans Zimmer, is now streaming in full.
The score was composed in tandem by Zimmer and their longtime collaborator Benjamin Wallfisch. The duo was brought in somewhat later in the production process, after the score's initial composer, Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson, ceased involvement due to creative differences.
Villeneuve explained their decision to replace Jóhannsson with Zimmer in an interview with Al Arabiya. “The thing I will say is that making movies is a laboratory,” they explained. “The movie needed something different, and I needed to go back to something closer to [the original film's composer] Vangelis. Jóhann and I decided that I will need to go in another direction — that's what I will say.”
The decision seemingly paid off, as Clint Worthington notes in their review of the film: “[Zimmer and Wallfisch] lean heavily on Vangelis' original 1982 score for inspiration, but 2049 is refreshingly light on incidental music, mostly allowing the booming, immersive sound design to take center stage.”
In additional to Zimmer and Wallfisch's original compositions, the soundtrack features songs by Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, and Lauren Daigle.
