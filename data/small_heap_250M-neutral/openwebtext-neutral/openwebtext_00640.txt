When Donald Trump decided that fake-news publisher and alt-right nazi Steve Bannon would be their White House Chief Strategist, they presumably chose that role so that the overwhelmingly controversial Bannon wouldn't have to go through Senate confirmation hearings, which would have been a firestorm for the ages. But now that Trump has subsequently also picked Bannon for the National Security Council, it turns out he'll be unwittingly feeding Bannon to the Senate wolves after all.
Impeach Trump Now
According to section (a)(6) of federal statute 50 U.S. Code 3021, a civilian like Steve Bannon will in fact need to go through Senate confirmation and approval in order to serve on the National Security Council because they don't fit into any of the five listed pre-approved categories. That obscure law, which has remained obscure because no president has ever tried to put a political hack on the NSC until now, was dug up by MSNBC analyst Jonathan Alter late on Monday night. This sets up a remarkable showdown if Trump goes ahead with the Bannon pick, because few in either party have shown any affinity or trust for the guy – and they'll have limitless material for embarrassing him.

If Bannon goes through a Senate confirmation, it will give Senators the opportunity to grill them about their former role running fake-news white nationalist site Breitbart, and the chance to hammer them about the allegations that they beat their wife. And it will pull back the curtain on the mysterious Bannon, who is believed to be acting as de facto president in the Trump administration. If all 48 Democrats vote against him, it will require just three Republicans to do the same. Considering just how deeply Bannon is distrusted, along with the strong belief that they should not be taking the place of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the NSC, it's likely that Bannon will be rejected by the Senate.
Trump went out of their way to make sure Steve Bannon didn't have to go through Senate confirmation the first time around. So it's a given that Trump simply didn't realize Bannon would need Senate approval for the National Security Council. Now that this law has been unearthed, there's a decent chance Bannon will be withdrawn. They would still have their role as Chief Strategist and puppet master. But it would mark yet another embarrassing body blow to Trump's out of control administration and their pet Nazi.
Not My President • Impeach Trump Now
Phil Rawlins wants you to know that Orlando City's front office is not in a state of disarray no matter how it might appear from the outside looking in.
They want you to know that the perceived turmoil is not turmoil at all but typical transition that many sports franchises go through during the offseason when hirings and firings traditionally take place.
They want you to know popular head coach Adrian Heath's job is safe despite the fact that team general manager Paul McDonough recently departed after being demoted and one of Heath's trusted assistant coaches — Ian Fuller — was fired after the season.
And, mostly, Rawlins wants you know that owner Flávio Augusto da Silva is not turning into a Brazilian Jerry Jones — the perpetually meddlesome owner of the Dallas Cowboys.
"People are putting two and two together and making seven," says Rawlins, the beloved founder and team president of Orlando City. "What we are doing is being misconstrued. There are a lot of conspiracy theories out there."
First things first: Rawlins and Orlando City obviously deserve the benefit of the doubt considering they have done just about everything right in bringing MLS to Central Florida and making fútbol matter in this football-fanatical region. But there's no doubt they made a monumental blunder when they demoted McDonough, the respected GM, to bring in Portuguese soccer executive Armando Carneiro, who suddenly and mysteriously departed several days ago for what Rawlins called "personal reasons."
Carneiro will go down as Orlando City's version of Orlando Magic draft pick Fran Vazquez, the power forward who was drafted out of Spain and infamously never showed up to play for the Magic. It's been said Carneiro was on the job with Orlando City for less than two months, but there was never an introductory press conference or even a public sighting. Question: Did they ever really exist or was they soccer's Sidd Finch?
McDonough being supplanted by Carneiro raised some eyebrows for a number of reasons. First and foremost, McDonough, who has since departed Orlando to become the director of operations for the start-up MLS franchise in Atlanta, was integral in putting together a roster that, by most accounts, was an expansion success. Secondly, there was the perception that Carneiro, who had no experience as an MLS executive, was hired mainly because of their friendship with Augusto da Silva.
Rawlins contends Augusto da Silva has always taken part in management decisions and is not overly intrusive or overbearing. But they are the man who owns the team and writes the checks and has a right to run their business any way they see fit.
"Flávio has been always been involved [in the decision-making,]" Rawlins says. "Our decisions are made by the board of directors and there's been no change in that. Flávio is exerting no more influence, pressure or strength than they ever has."
Asked why the board of directors is making moves like demoting McDonough and firing Fuller after a relatively successful first season in the league, Rawlins says the season wasn't as successful as management envisioned.
"We went into our first season and said very clearly that our goal was to make the playoffs," Rawlins said. "A lot of people thought was just crazy talk, but that was our belief and vision. We're accustomed to making the playoffs and winning championships. We did it in the minors and we wanted to maintain that same level and make a mark in our first year in MLS.
"We had a good first season, but we didn't meet our goals. We want to insure that we build upon that first season and are more successful in 2016."
I have to admit, I love the fact that Orlando City's ownership is not satisfied with "almost" making the playoffs even in their first season. And the good news for City fans is that Carneiro's mysterious departure has no effect on whether the team wins or loses next season. In fact, their sudden exit might be a blessing in that that Rawlins and Heath, who were essentially Orlando's front office in the ultra-successful minor league days, are now once again in charge of personnel.
But still there is a philosophical question that has yet to be answered:
If a general manager is hired and nobody ever sees them or hears them then was they ever really hired in the first place?

HOUSTON -- James Harden and the Houston Rockets got a lift from two unlikely sources on Wednesday night.
Harden scored 26 points on 10-for-31 shooting in Houston's 102-89 victory over the Sacramento Kings, and Donatas Motiejunas and Isaiah Canaan each stepped up for the Rockets.
"We kept breathing, our defense just kept grinding away and grinded out some stops," Houston coach Kevin McHale said.
Harden also had eight assists and seven rebounds in Houston's third straight win, and Motiejunas and Canaan each set a career high for points.
Canaan made six 3-pointers and scored 24 points, and Motiejunas had 21 points. Canaan was averaging 8.1 points coming into the night, and Motiejunas was averaging 6.6 points.
The Rockets, who committed just four turnovers, scored 32 points off of Sacramento's 21 turnovers.
"You can't beat good teams and yourself in the same game, and we did that tonight, which is too bad," Kings coach Michael Malone said.
DeMarcus Cousins had 29 points and 17 rebounds for the Kings (9-6), and Ben McLemore and Omri Casspi each scored 14.
Houston played without center Dwight Howard (knee) and point guard Patrick Beverley (hamstring), while Sacramento was without Rudy Gay (right Achilles injury) and Darren Collison (quad contusion).
Sacramento had a scary moment late in the third quarter when Cousins went down, grabbing at a knee in apparent pain. The entire Kings bench, staff and players, walked onto the court toward the far corner where Cousins was located, but they slowly got up with a slight limp and remained in the game.
"To see them go down and grab their knee was very disconcerting," Malone said. "He's a load and we can't afford to lose him."
The Rockets held Sacramento to just 39 points in the second half.
"That's hard to do because Cousins is a handful," McHale said.
Lacking its main inside presence in Howard, Houston went 12 for 35 from 3-point range. The Rockets reached double-digits in made 3-pointers in all but three of their games this season, including four straight.
The Rockets out together a strong start, leading 37-19 at the end of the first quarter. Harden had 12 points and five assists in the opening period.
The Kings stepped up their defense in the second, allowing just 20 points and closing to 57-50 at the break.
Sacramento went 22 for 28 at the free-throw line, while Houston was just 6 for 15. The Kings and Rockets began the night ranked first and fourth in free-throw attempts per game, respectively.
The Rockets have won six of eight since a loss to Golden State ended a 6-0 run to open the season.
---
TIP-INS
Kings: Jason Thompson had 11 boards, and Sacramento outrebounded the undersized Rockets 48-41. The Kings entered the game ranked third in the league in rebounds per game.
Rockets: Howard missed their fourth straight game with a sprained knee. Beverley has missed four games with the lingering hamstring injury. ... F Terrence Jones missed their 11th straight game with nerve damage in their left leg. McHale hinted before the game that all three starters would remain sidelined Friday.
UP NEXT
Kings: Visit San Antonio on Friday.
Rockets: Host the Clippers on Friday for the finale of a five-game homestand.
CANAAN FROM 3
Canaan went 6 for 10 from 3-point range and is 25 for 59 from long range on the season.
"Once you see a couple go down, you believe the next one is going to fall and if it does, the next one, you got to take that one, too," Canaan said.
CASSPI'S RETURN
Casspi returned to Houston, where they played last season before being traded in July. Before the game, McHale spoke glowingly of Casspi's brief tenure in Houston, and Casspi's admiration was mutual.
"It was a life-changing experience from a basketball perspective to play for coach McHale," Casspi said. "He taught me how to play the game the right way. I learned a lot."
In America's Heartland, A Power Company Leads Charge For Electric Cars
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrea Hsu/NPR Andrea Hsu/NPR
In the world of electric cars, there's a chicken-and-egg problem: More people might buy electric vehicles, or EVs, if they were confident there would always be a charger nearby. And businesses might install more chargers if there were more EVs on the road.
Now, utilities are stepping forward to solve this problem, and not just in California or the Northeast. A $20 million project launched two years ago by investor-owned Kansas City Power & Light, whose service area straddles the Kansas-Missouri border, has turned a Midwestern metropolitan area into one of the fastest-growing electric vehicle markets in the country.

"There's a little movement afoot here in the middle of flyover country," says Chuck Caisley, KCP&L's vice president for marketing and public affairs. "We're awfully excited about the prospect of this kind of transportation, and so we wanted to be catalytic to that."
At a time when Caisley estimates there were only 400 to 500 electric cars in the area, KCP&L announced it would install 1,000 charging stations throughout its service territory of more than 800,000 customers.
The stations are going up at workplaces, in apartment garages, at grocery stores, in city parking lots and malls, and near the baseball and football stadiums. The idea is to allow people to charge their cars as they do their cell phones, plugging in as they go about their daily lives.
For the first couple years, charging at the Clean Charge Network is free — and will remain free until at least this summer.
On a recent day, Sara and Adam Foote parked their car at a charging station in a public garage in Leawood, Kan., while they went for a drink. In the hour or so they spent in the bar, they added about 25 miles of charge to their Nissan Leaf, which they purchased 15 months ago.
"We've adapted our lifestyle, but I'd say that the charging stations — the abundance of them in Kansas City, has definitely made it very easy for us," Sara Foote says.
For KCP&L, this project is about clean energy and clean air, but it's also about selling more electricity without having to build more power plants. Caisley says KCP&L's power grid, which was built to work on hot summer days when air-conditioning use is at a maximum, is underutilized 80 percent of the time. Customers have already paid for the electrical grid and the power plants. A dramatic increase in electricity use would drive down KCP&L's per-unit cost, and could mean lower power bills for its customers.
"When you turn on an additional TV in your home, that's not enough to change that equation," Caisley says. "But when you talk about a segment [the auto industry] that's as much as 25 to 30 percent of the entire economy, and electrifying it, you're talking about a significant amount of increased electricity use, which means we're now using that infrastructure that customers have paid for so much more efficiently."
Caisley adds that the electricity the company is selling is getting cleaner all the time. Fossil fuels generate a declining share of the area's electricity. Nuclear and renewables account for nearly half of it.
"We just happen to sit in the Saudi Arabia equivalent of wind," they say.
KCP&L asked utility regulators in Missouri and Kansas for permission to add a 2- to 3-cent monthly fee to customers' bills to help pay for the installation and maintenance of the charging stations. Missouri regulators have yet to rule. Kansas regulators said no. They said the utility failed to prove a need for such an extensive network of charging stations, and they said KCP&L didn't make a compelling argument for why it should be taking the lead.

"We think KCP&L is certainly free to roll out whatever Clean Car Network program they want. The question becomes whether or not they impose the costs on a captive consumer. Our take on that is, simply not," says David Nickel, consumer counsel with the Kansas Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board, the state agency that represents the interests of utility customers.
A version of this played out on a much larger scale in California a few years ago. Initial regulatory resistance there gave way to a legislative mandate to provide charging infrastructure.
Despite the Kansas ruling, KCP&L has moved forward with money from its investors. The company has built 850 of the 1,000 charging stations it has planned.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrea Hsu/NPR Andrea Hsu/NPR
Overseeing this is Larry Kinder, founder and CEO of LilyPad EV. Their company sells, installs and maintains charging stations for customers all over the country. KCP&L is their biggest customer by far.
From their home office in Overland Park, Kan., Kinder can monitor the stations their company has sold to see when they're in use and how long they're in use. Here's one measure of their abundance: At about 9 a.m. one weekday, only about 75 cars were charging at those 850 stations. But what Kinder has learned is: If you build it, they will come, and sometimes, very quickly.
Recently, a new charging station was installed outside an office building, and not two minutes after Kinder put it on the network, it was in use.
"Now, that was an employee who was sitting in their office, watching the electrician do the installation. They ran out, moved their electric car, plugged in and charged their car up," Kinder says. "It was wonderful."
Kinder, who has driven EVs since before they were sold commercially, says he's already thinking about what's needed next. For road trips, uninterrupted by long charging stops, there's a need for fast chargers that can add, say, 90 miles of range in a half-hour. Those are much more expensive to install. KCP&L and other companies have begun to invest along highway corridors.
"We're a little beyond Wild, Wild West, but I think not everything's laid out," Kinder says. "This is all still evolving. It will all still be evolving for 10 years, or more."
Introduction
A friend of mine has been playing the board game Chutes and Ladders recently with their son. The game is pretty simple: starting off of the board (effectively on “square zero”), each player in turn rolls a die (actually, spins a spinner) and– if possible– moves forward the indicated number of squares in serpentine fashion on the board shown below:
If a player lands on the tail of an arrow, they continue along the arrow to the indicated square, ending their turn there. (“Chutes” are arrows leading backward, and “ladders” are arrows leading forward.) The first player to land exactly on square 100 wins the game.
My friend emailed me with the question, “What is the expected number of turns before the game is over?” I think this is a nice problem for students, since it yields to the usual two-pronged attack of (1) computer simulation and (2) “cocktail napkin” derivation of an exact solution.
This is certainly not a new problem. See the references at the end of this post for just a few past analyses of the game as a Markov chain. My goal here is to provide an intuitive derivation of the exact expected length of the game as a solution to a system of linear equations, while staying away from the more sophisticated machinery of Markov chains, fundamental matrices, etc., that younger students may not be familiar with.
Unbounded vs. infinite
Before getting to the exact solution, though, it is worth addressing a comment in the referenced DataGenetics blog post about Monte Carlo simulation of the game:
“Whilst the chances of a game running and running are essentially negligible (constantly landing on snakes [i.e., chutes] and going around in circles), there is a theoretical chance that the main game loop could be executing forever. This is bad, and will lock up your code. Any smart developer implementing an algorithm like this would program a counter that is incremented on each dice roll. This counter would be checked, and if it exceeds a defined threshold, the loop should be exited.”
I strongly disagree with this. The valid concern is that there is no fixed bound on how many turns a particular simulated game might take; that is, for any chosen positive integer , there is a positive probability that the game will require at least turns, due to repeatedly falling backward down chutes. However, the probability is zero that the game will execute forever; we can be certain that the game will always eventually terminate. There is a difference between unbounded and infinite execution time. In fact, such explicit “safety clamping” of the allowed number of moves implicitly changes the answer, modifying the resulting probability distribution (and thus the expected value) of the number of moves, albeit by an admittedly small amount.
There are situations where games can take an infinitely long time to finish– Chutes and Ladders just isn't one of them. For example, in this multi-round card game, everything is fine as long as . And even when , the game is still guaranteed to finish, although the expected number of rounds is infinite. But when , there is a positive probability that the game never finishes, and indeed continues “forever.”
Recursive expected values
To see how to analyze Chutes and Ladders, first consider the following simpler problem: how many times should you expect to flip a fair coin until it first comes up heads? Let be this desired expected value. Then considering the two possible outcomes of the first flip, either:
It comes up heads, in which case we are done after a single flip; or
It comes up tails… in which case we are right back where we started, and so should expect to need additional flips (plus the one we just “spent”).
That is,
Solving yields . More generally, if P(success) is , the expected number of trials until the first success is .
Solution
We can apply this same idea to Chutes and Ladders. Let be the expected number of turns needed to finish the game (i.e., reach square 100), starting from square , where (so that is the value we really want). Then
where is the number of the square reached from square by rolling — which is usually just equal to , but this function also “encodes” the configuration of chutes and ladders on the board, as well as the requirement of landing exactly on square 100 to end the game.
So we have a system of 100 linear equations in 100 unknowns, which we can now talk the computer into solving for us (in Python):
import numpy as np n, m = 100, 6 chutes = {1: 38, 4: 14, 9: 31, 16: 6, 21: 42, 28: 84, 36: 44, 48: 26, 49: 11, 51: 67, 56: 53, 62: 19, 64: 60, 71: 91, 80: 100, 87: 24, 93: 73, 95: 75, 98: 78} A = np.eye(n) b = np.ones(n) for i in range(n): for j in range(1, m + 1): k = i if i + j > n else chutes.get(i + j, i + j) if k < n: A[i][k] -= 1.0 / m x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
Results
The following figure shows all of the resulting values . For example, the expected number of turns to complete the game from the start is .
Note that we can easily analyze the “house rule” used in the DataGenetics post– allowing a player to win even when “overshooting” square 100– simply by changing the k=i in line 12 to k=n. The result is a modest reduction in game length, to about 36.1931 turns. (Edit: However, this is not the whole story. See this subsequent post addressing the fact that the game involves multiple players.)

Fish Can plant-based feeds make aquaculture sustainable? Some scientists are replacing sardines and anchovies with soybeans and corn as food for farmed fish.
In a capacious warehouse northeast of downtown Bozeman, Montana, a lanky scientist named Rick Barrows leans over a blue tank teeming with rainbow trout. The fish thrash expectantly at the arrival of human visitors, and Barrows smiles behind their scrub-brush mustache. “You go to the poultry nutrition conference, and there are 4,000 people there,” they say wryly. “You go to the U.S. fish nutrition conference, and there are 30.”
Rick Barrows is a U.S. Department of Agriculture fish nutritionist — an esoteric occupation, true, but a vital one. Here at the Bozeman Fish Technology Center, a century-old federal facility tucked into a patchwork of ranchlands, Barrows is changing how the world produces its seafood.
Aquaculture is the fastest-growing form of food production in the world, at around 8 percent per year; the World Bank projects that two-thirds of our fish will come from farms by 2030. From a sustainability standpoint, that might be good news: Because they're cold-blooded and water-dwelling, fish don't have to heat their bodies or support their own weight. That means they can devote calories to packing on muscle, making them a more efficient source of protein than four-legged livestock. “Aquaculture is most likely to meet the growing demand for animal products with the least demand on ecosystems,” one Conservation International official told The Guardian in 2011. Steve Ausmus, Agriculture Research Service
But aquaculture carries plenty of ecological baggage. Perhaps its greatest irony is that growing fish on farms has traditionally required extracting other fish from the sea. Well over half the global harvest of so-called forage fish — the small silver creatures, like sardines, menhaden and anchovies, that form the bedrock of marine ecosystems — gets ground into fishmeal and fish oil to feed bigger farmed species, like salmon. The West is hardly immune to the repercussions. Pacific sardines have experienced a nearly decade-long collapse, starving brown pelicans and California sea lions and prompting federal managers to close the fishery in July 2015. While sardine stocks are notoriously prone to natural boom-bust cycles, fishing pressure appears to have exacerbated this crash.
To avert ecological harm — and defray rising costs — fish farmers have lately begun reducing the proportion of fishmeal in aquaculture feed, replacing ground-up sardines and anchovies with soybeans and corn. The challenge is that many delectable fish, such as salmon and trout, are carnivores, ill-adapted to subsisting on vegetable matter. Thanks in large part to Rick Barrows, however, some companies are already raising carnivorous fish on all-plant diets. For over two decades, Barrows has been developing vegetarian feeds for species such as salmon, cobia, walleye and, most of all, trout.
“We consider rainbow trout the white rat of the aquaculture world: They grow fast and they're inexpensive to obtain,” Barrows says as their fish churn the surface. “We use trout to develop basic dietary knowledge that we apply to other species.”
The future of seafood, in other words, is being developed with the help of freshwater fish, 600 miles from the nearest ocean.
From one perspective, farming carnivorous fish doesn't make much sense. The planet is swimming with herbivores and omnivores that require less protein-dense meals. Tilapia, which flourishes on a chickenfeed-like corn diet, is the country's fourth most-eaten form of seafood, though its popularity hasn't come without environmental consequences, such as pollution and ecosystem invasions.
But carnivores have a crucial physiological advantage over their plant-eating counterparts. "It's hard to catch your meal if you're a carnivore — you have to chase after it,” says Mike Rust, aquaculture science coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As an evolutionary consequence, carnivores “have machinery designed to get every last nutrient out of what they eat.”
From a sustainability standpoint, that digestive efficiency is a major advantage. The trick, then, isn't to turn carnivores into herbivores; it's to make plant foods behave like fishmeal.
Barrow leads me to another vast room in the USDA complex, this one packed with an obstacle course of humming equipment, a maze of ovens and chutes and glowing green lights. A rich vegetative aroma, reminiscent of a brewery, wafts in the close air; food pellets crunch underfoot. This is where the alchemy happens, where Barrows and their team transform vegetation into something with a nutritional profile that approximates meat.
“This is a smaller version of what the food production industry uses,” says Jason Frost, a technician with the drooping mustache of a 19th century saloonkeeper. “Cat food, dog food, all kinds of cereals.” Indeed, the fragrant brown nuggets that fill one row of garbage cans would look perfectly at home floating in a bowl of milk.
Converting vegetation into viable aquaculture feed, however, is not easy. Fishmeal is rich in minerals, like iron and selenium, and amino acids, like lysine, that plants lack. Excluding just one crucial constituent can be disastrous: Without zinc, for instance, trout develop cataracts. Moreover, soy and other crops are packed with so-called anti-nutrients, defense compounds that cause inflammation in fish's small intestines. And even if you assemble all the right components, it's worthless if the fish can't actually digest it. Carnivorous fish lack the enzymes to break down the cellular walls of most microalgae, for instance, though Barrows can overcome that by supplementing feeds with the proper enzymes.
To create a well-balanced feed, Barrows' team tests as many as 50 ingredients each year, blending and tweaking like a mixologist. Most concoctions begin with soy, though not all; some manufacturers prefer to keep their feeds free of genetically modified organisms, and it's hard to find non-GMO soy. Corn, algae, even black-fly larvae find their way into Barrows' creations. They also supplement some feeds with trimmings from an Oregon fish-processing plant, waste that would otherwise be discarded. Barrow has developed vegetarian diets for nine species altogether, including tricky marine carnivores like white seabass and yellowtail.
Rick Barrows
Still, obstacles remain. Vegetarian feeds generally cost more, though the gap has narrowed in recent years as fishmeal's price has climbed. And plant-based feeds aren't always ecologically pure. “The question I would ask is, are you cutting down rainforest in Brazil to grow the soybeans?” says Geoff Shester, California program director for the marine conservation group Oceana. While Oceana supports the aquaculture industry's move toward plant-based feed, it argues that sustainably harvested forage fish, fed to humans instead of animals, is the best solution to the piscivore's dilemma. As Shester puts it: “We prefer foodwebs to feedlots.”
The Technology Center's most exciting feeds, therefore, may be the ones that repurpose agricultural waste. One product incorporates pistachios discarded by farmers — “nuts that are too big, too small, too green, too light,” Barrows explains. Working with a company called Adaptive Bioresources, Barrows has figured out how to process the pistachios into meal that's high in nutritious omega-3s and contains around 55 percent protein, allowing it to supplant fishmeal. According to John Hamilton, the company's owner, pistachio-raised salmon and trout raised are already entering the market. Pistachio trees are wildly profitable, and California's farmers have ramped up their planting, despite drought. “As the price for waste almonds comes down, we'll be looking at those, too,” Hamilton says.
Though these discarded pistachios could someday impact U.S. salmon farming, they'll never be abundant enough to affect, say, Chile's farms. Still, they're a reminder that creativity offers big dividends. Barrows and another company, Montana Microbial, have made similar use of unwanted malting barley, a key ingredient in beer. Brewers generally desire barley with a low protein content, in the 11 to 13 percent range; any higher and the beer turns cloudy. In dry years, however, the crop often exceeds that threshold, creating a product that's substandard for beer, but suitable for fish. The brewer's loss is the fish farmer's gain.
While Barrows fiddles with their food, their collaborators in Idaho are refining the other side of the equation: the fish themselves.
Back in 2000, Ron Hardy, director of the University of Idaho's Aquaculture Research Institute, began breeding a trout that's better at processing plant-based diets. It was a long process: Rainbow trout take two years to reach sexual maturity, and the first three generations that Hardy raised couldn't grow as quickly on Barrows' soy-based meal as their fishmeal-eating cousins could.
But by around 2008 — generation four — the soy-munching trout families began catching up. These days, Hardy is studying their seventh generation, and some of the soy-eaters have taken a slight lead. Hardy's fish reach two pounds in just nine months, twice as fast as when the research began. Just as important, they retain the nutritional benefits of conventional fish. At least for rainbow trout, then, the grand dream of efficiently raising a plant-fed piscine crop has already been achieved.
Steve Ausmus, Agriculture Research Service
And these fish of the future are already infiltrating the supply chain. At some Idaho trout farms, a quarter of the crop is composed of Hardy's trout. An added bonus, for finicky American consumers, is that veggie-fed trout taste less fishy. (Hardy, who developed a taste for potent flavors while teaching in Thailand, finds this mystifying. “People in the U.S. would rather eat bland fish that they can gussy up with sauce and seasoning,” they say, incredulous.)
A critical question remains unanswered: Why are these seventh-generation trout so proficient at turning plants into muscle? Are they more metabolically efficient? More tolerant of anti-nutrients? One intriguing clue is that plant-selected trout avoid gut inflammation, a condition that can impede growth, perhaps because trout bred for plant consumption have different microbial communities living in their guts. Just as fecal transplants have been used to help humans suffering from intestinal disorders like Crohn's disease, Hardy speculates that researchers might eventually develop probiotics from the microbiomes of soy-fed trout that could help other fish better digest plant-based feed.
Back in Bozeman, Barrows guides me down a narrow hallway, one wall checkered with plastic bags bursting with feed — black feeds made of soldier fly larvae, green algae feeds, yellow corn feeds, brown soy feeds, and so on. To be sure, these myriad stocks aren't panaceas: Poultry and pigs gobble down a third of the world's fishmeal and fish oil, meaning that improvements in aquaculture can only achieve so much. And as Oceana's Shester points out, the aquaculture industry's recent efficiency gains haven't kept up with the world's growing demand. We're getting better at raising fish, but we're also raising more of them.
But while Barrows' feeds may not save the seas by themselves, they could help alleviate the pressure on the world's precious forage fish stocks. The Bozeman Fish Technology Center's colorful food wall is proof of possibility, a mosaic ode to dietary diversity and experimentation. The old truism that fish farming requires wild fish is, well, no longer true — or at least it doesn't have to be.
“Aquaculture's biggest strength is its biggest weakness,” Barrows muses. “With poultry, you've only got chickens and turkeys. But there are over 200 species of fish being cultured around the world — you've got guys working on trout, catfish, cobia, and so on. That dilutes the research somewhat. But it also makes for a very exciting environment.”

Supernatural stars Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Mark Sheppard, and Misha Collins joined executive producers Jeremy Carver and Andrew Dabb at Comic-Con over the weekend to promote the return of the series this fall. The panel took place in Hall H, where fans almost brought Jared Padalecki to tears with a touching tribute to the actor and their work. Hours later, Padalecki posted a thank-you message to fans on Facebook.
While FanBolt wasn't in the Hall H panel, we were in the press room – which was full of teases for the upcoming 11th season. Check out a few highlights and quotes that we heard in the press room. There are spoilers below.
Supernatural Comic-Con 2015 Highlights
Ackles will be directing episode 3 of Season 11, and Padalecki had nothing but good things to say about Ackles as a director. Ackles also said that the Winchesters' target for this season will be to fight save humanity instead of each other.
Ever wonder why we never see Sam or Dean with facial hair? Despite the fact that living on the road so much, Padalecki says that you won't see that because FBI agents and police officers wouldn't have them – so neither can Sam and Dean.
Padalecki also talked about how difficult it was to film the finale episode of Season 10, saying that it was very powerful for him.
In regards to Sheppard, the actor insists Crowley is dead in the series, though press knew better. The likelihood of them no longer being on the show, but being brought to Comic-Con anyways, would be unlikely. Sheppard teased that they would be at Comic-Con regardless. Padalecki did say that Crowley is dealing with their own problems in hell – which actually humanizes the character a bit.
EP Andrew Dabb also commented on Crowley's death saying that they are dead, and they're all pretty happy about it. But that the character will go through an experience that no one else has gone through and the fans will really like it (in episode 1 of Season 11).
Dabb also said that Death has been in prison before and that people kept dying, but he's a cosmic being. The repercussions will play out over the course of the season. The Darkness is a Big Bad. Its a different point of view than other bad guys we've had. (Dabb called The Darkness a “her,” then corrected to say “it.”).
Dabb also commented on Cas, saying that they will be an important ally, but the stakes are very clear.
Collins talked some about GISHWES which registration closes for in one week. They also mentioned that William Shatner is super serious about their team, which is why there's a “Shatner clause” that states that should a celebrity team win, a non-celebrity team will get to go on the grand prize trip with Collins.
EP Jeremy Carver teased us about the consequences of Death being dead and if a bigger evil can possibly top what happened at the end of last season. What we could get out of them is that The Darkness is a cool character with pre-biblical mythology. The boys will be caught in the middle, and the mythology will open up again – building up to a pretty epic place and forcing the brothers to take stock and say “we've done a lot of saving each other at the cost of the greater good.”
As far as the arch of Season 11? It will be that you can't outrun your past. Sam and Dean will have to rely on a lot of folks from the old days to step in and help out. A lot of alliances that you don't expect.
Some other fun facts we got out of Carver:
Episode 4 – filmed entirely in the Impala.
Richard Speight is going to direct an episode.
Going to learn than Sam had an imaginary friend as a child, and that they're actually a thing.
We'll have more coverage coming from our Supernatural interviews! Stay tuned for full video interviews!
Supernatural returns for its 11th Season on October 7th on The CW!

After getting benched for the entire third period in the Columbus Blue Jackets' loss to the Dallas Stars on Tuesday night, there was talk that center Ryan Johansen will be a healthy scratch on Thursday at Arizona.
So this is going to go one of two ways for Johansen – who had 71 points in 82 games last season – and the Blue Jackets: They take it personally, has no time for John Tortorella's antics, and demands out; or this tough love eventually leads to Johansen becoming a better player or, at the very least, one that Tortorella can stomach.
The latter option is, frankly, the more likely one.
Scroll to continue with content Ad
Johansen needs to work on several aspects of their game. They can make lazy passes. Their turnovers can be egregious and costly. They need to be better in their own end, as this tourism-masquerading-as-defense in an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Kings shows us:
But the “tough love” scenario is also the most likely because Tortorella is practiced in the art of butting heads with young offensive stars, not backing down and getting results.
Two words: Vincent Lecavalier.
They were stripped of their Tampa Bay Lightning captaincy for being “too young” in 2001-02, Tortorella's first full season as head coach. As punishment for a training camp holdout, Lecavalier was benched in their first game of that season. Lecavalier later made a trade demand; it didn't happen.
The tough love would continue. In Dec. 2003, they benched Lecavalier in the third period of a 1-1 tie (remember those?) against the Boston Bruins. Vinny was, like Johansen is, 23 years old. Vinny was, like Johansen is, coming off the best offensive season of their young career, with 33 goals and 45 assists in 80 games. And they were benched, for their defensive lapses.
Story continues
There was shock and awe about it. If Twitter was around, there would have been the same fantasy-trade scenarios we're seeing for Ry-Jo.
But you know what? Lecavalier will tell you that while they and Torts aren't exactly exchanging holiday cards, that tough love made them a better player and made them a better leader.
In Johansen's case, Tortorella has been clear with what he's looking for since they took the Blue Jackets' gig. From NHL.com, Torts said:
“It's the little things you do as you're trying to become a pro, because Joey has a lot to learn as far as what it is to be a pro. I say that and that shouldn't surprise anybody because he's still a fairly young man in this game. The points are great. That's great. But I don't judge them on the points. I watch their game and we're going through a teaching process. We're trying to get the right type of foundation on what it is to be a pro and what's the definition of competing, what's the definition of hardness, what is the definition of engagement. It's all those things. He's right in the middle of it with us."
"Well, Joey is a little older right now and has been in the League a little longer, but I went through a process with Vinny Lecavalier out in Tampa. I think it's very similar, although Joey is a little bit older. It's my job to make sure that not only him, but everybody is accountable in all these different areas.”
And just like Jay Feaster had Torts' back in Tampa, Blue Jackets management supports them with Johansen.
There's no question that going hard on players like Lecavalier and Johansen has undercurrents of grandstanding for Tortorella. It's a message to the rest of the roster that no matter how big your profile, contract or point total is, you're as accountable as the guy on the fourth line.
That's the ancillary benefit. The primary one is getting your best young players to mature into leaders in every aspect, and Lecavalier has said you're either on board with Tortorella's methods or you're not.
From TampaBay.com, in June 2008, Vinny said:
"Everybody knows how Torts is, and after a few years you get to understand it a little more. But he's very demanding on young players, and I don't think everybody takes them the same way, which is normal. Everybody reacts differently to different situations. Some guys don't react well to that."
How Johansen reacts to it will say a lot about where they are as an NHL player ... and where in the NHL he'll play.
Hey, anyone can get traded. Even guys with Blue Jackets themed basketball courts.

(CNN) Hours after President Donald Trump told reporters to expect a "big surprise" on the stalled Senate health care bill, one Republican lawmaker slammed the bill, invoking the "do no harm" principle.
During an interview with CNN's Don Lemon, Rep. Pete King said Wednesday that "it's wrong to pass something for the sake of passing it."
King argued that Congress should work on passing a smaller health care package.
"I want to do it in a way that we're not hurting anyone," King said. "And if it takes it two, three, four, five years to do it, fine. If we don't repeal all of it, hey, that's democracy."
The New York lawmaker voted for the House health care bill, but has come out against the Senate bill.

In South Korea, Old Law Leads To New Crackdown
toggle caption Courtesy Park Jong-kun
Park Jong-kun's Twitter profile picture shows them inspecting a bottle of Johnnie Walker whisky against a backdrop of the North Korean flag.
The 24-year-old South Korean photographer thought it would be funny, a visual parody of North Korea's news programs. But it turns out this profile picture could violate South Korea's strict six-decade-old National Security Law, which punishes those who "praise, disseminate or cooperate with anti-state groups" if such acts endanger democracy and national security.
The law was originally enforced in 1948 to protect the country from its wartime enemy, North Korea. But the Korean War has never formally ended, so the legislation remains on the books. And in today's Internet age, a government crackdown is leading to fears of a new wave of South Korean-style McCarthyism.
Freedom Of Expression At Issue
In Park's case, the content of their Twitter feed also caught the authorities' attention.
"I retweeted tweets from a North Korean Twitter account. My intention was to lampoon North Korea's leaders for a joke," they say. "But it looked like I was praising North Korean propaganda, so that caused big trouble. The police then raided my photography studio."
During the 10-hour search, police found a book issued by a North Korean publishing house. Owning this without having prior clearance could also violate the National Security Law.
The police interrogated Park on five occasions — for five hours at a time — about their political beliefs. The friend who lent them the North Korean book was also investigated.

Park says the whole process has left them physically and mentally exhausted, and they are seeking treatment for stress.  They are still waiting to hear whether he'll be prosecuted. Today they think the National Security Law is, in a word, evil.
"Even though I disagree with North Korean communism, I'm interested in North Korean culture," says Park. "I have a right to know about it, to express my freedom."
They have come to their own conclusions about the use of the National Security Law, saying, "The biggest problem regarding the National Security Law is that they are using it to try to restrict freedom of expression."
The North Korean government set up its own Twitter and YouTube accounts last year. In December, the South Korean Justice Ministry announced that those who forward Twitter postings from North Korea or even comment on these using "retweet" or "reply" functions could face punishment.
At the time, a Justice Ministry official was quoted as saying the measure was taken in response to North Korea's attacks on the South Korean navy ship Cheonan in March 2010 and on Yeonpyeong island in November 2010.
Last year, South Korea's top court found that even owning propaganda music whose titles praise the North Korean leadership is in violation of the law. It upheld a two-year jail term, suspended for four years, given to a woman simply for owning 14 North Korean songs on a USB stick.
Enforcement Of National Security Law
Unauthorized trips to the North are also forbidden. Last year, Han Sang-ryol, a South Korean pastor, was arrested shouting pro-unification slogans as they crossed over the DMZ, after spending two unauthorized months in the North.
Before 2008, the law wasn't used against people talking about North Korean issues. But afterwards many more people were investigated, and not just left-wingers, but also ordinary people talking about North Korea online. I think the government is using the National Security Law to restrict progressive political thought.
In that time, they also criticized South Korea's leadership and praised North Korea's leaders.  They are now serving three years in a South Korean jail. Their wife, the Rev. Lee Gang-sil, says they knew what would happen to him.
"My husband knew they would go to jail," they say. "So we weren't surprised."
But they say there are problems with the law.
"The problem of the National Security Law is that it's too broad and too flexible and totally depends on your interpretation," they say.
Recently, the number of National Security Law cases under investigation has soared. From 2005 through 2009, the prosecutor's office investigated an average of 58 cases a year.
In 2010, that figure jumped to 97. And this year it will be higher still, according to Yoon Ji-Hye from the Korean Alliance of Progressive Movements, which advises those who fall foul of these laws. They believe there have already been 150 cases investigated in the year to August. According to Yoon, the implementation of the law changed drastically after the conservative government of President Lee Myung-bak came to power in 2008.
"Before 2008, the law wasn't used against people talking about North Korean issues," says Yoon. "But afterwards many more people were investigated, and not just left-wingers, but also ordinary people talking about North Korea online. I think the government is using the National Security Law to restrict progressive political thought."
Despite being among the world's most wired countries, South Korea is increasing its censorship of the Internet. In 2008, the police filed 1,793 requests to block pro-North Korea websites. Last year, that figure was 80,449, according to the National Police Agency, as reported in the South Korean media.
"I think North Korea is clearly learning the ropes here in terms of their ability to use the Internet," says Hahm Chai-bong, the director of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. "On the other hand, clearly the conservative government has been given the mandate to be more conservative, especially on issues pertaining to North Korea. That's why it was elected in a landslide three years ago."
President: Law Still Necessary
In a recent interview with NPR, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak defended the government's use of the National Security Law, saying it was still necessary.
We have been facing for the last 60-plus years one of the world's most well-armed and most belligerent countries [North Korea]. And if you consider that fact, and if you are someone living in such a country every day, then you will understand the need to have such laws that will allow us to maintain our way of life.
"For any country that is divided like Korea, I'm sure that those people in such countries will understand the necessity of having such a law," they said. "You have to always remember the very special and unique circumstances in which Korea is in today. We have been facing for the last 60-plus years one of the world's most well-armed and most belligerent countries. And if you consider that fact, and if you are someone living in such a country every day, then you will understand the need to have such laws that will allow us to maintain our way of life."
"Of course, in the future, when our relationship between the two Koreas begins to improve fundamentally, then accordingly we will look into these laws and determine whether they are still needed or not," they added.
But Lee did acknowledge the differences of opinion, saying with a chuckle, "I recall when I was in college, I would be the one who would call for the abolishment of such laws."
Recently, a vocal critic of the law, Park Won-soon, was elected mayor of Seoul, raising the possibility of renewed debate on the controversial law.
But for years, South Korea has made national security a priority despite criticism from human-rights groups who say freedoms are being compromised. Recently, the United Nations rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, called for a revision to one "vague" article within the law. Even South Korea's close ally, the U.S., has called for the law to be amended to prevent abuse. The concern is that in the very act of protecting itself from its northern neighbor, South Korea could be risking its freedoms.
Rated 5 out of 5 by skippermsg from Has many features that meet my requirements I like the manual option it gives me control of the exercise via controlling the resistance. I use it three times a week for cardio and warm up to a 35 min streaching program. It is helping me and I don't have to leave my house plus I am on my own schedule. The AD7 does not take up a lot of floor space so it is stationary a plus. It generates a gentle breeze I like and it makes little noise. I am 83 and the AD7 is helping me stay physically fit thru the winter months and prepared for the spring yard work.
Rated 5 out of 5 by Diane917 from Great Versatile Piece of Equipment I bought this a couple of months ago and I love it. I had an earlier Airdyne that I used for years and enjoyed until I had to give it away. This model is superior to that one. It still fans you as you exercise, which I loved, to keep you cool. It is much quieter than the original. It is also better ergonomically, I feel. It really allows you to use as an elliptical, arms only or bike. I am glad I got it.
Rated 5 out of 5 by kermie from Excellent workout you can control without turning knobs Dr. told me I have a torn meniscus in my knew and shouldn't run. Since I love to exercise, I got this bike. After resting my knee for 3 months and starting slow on the bike, I am now biking 3 days a week AND slowly running again--woohoo, no surgery!!
Rated 5 out of 5 by ChetMS from Blowing in the wind? You can buy a fan guard that stops the wind from blowing on you while you exercise. They are not that expensive...a few bucks here really makes this bike a winner in the exercise market.
Rated 5 out of 5 by NellG from Great exercise machine! Bought the AD7 Airdyne last July and decided to try it out for a couple of months before reviewing it. Very easy to assemble. The ride is smooth, the pedals and the seat are comfortable to use. I have been using it 5-6 times a week and I am impressed! I used to go to the gym for spinning class. With this bike, I get workout at home.
Rated 5 out of 5 by Reneenay from Perfect!! I tore my meniscus in my left knee and had surgery. My doctor recommended an exercise bike. This bike is perfect. Adjustable seat height and fan are my favorite features
I don't think a person can ever really grasp the concept of ‘petite' in a car context until they've been up close to a Lotus Elan. It's a ballet dancer with wheels. And with a purity and simplicity to the styling, it leads up to a great big question: how comfortable are you in a sports car with all of the macho aggression removed? As it turns out, I'm very happy indeed. And in something as far from a muscle car as an electron microscope is from a hammer, this comes as something of a surprise.
First launched at the Earls Court motor show in 1963, the Elan was originally a convertible. It cost £1,499, though Lotus would knock off a few hundred quid and deliver it in pieces to those who preferred to assemble it themselves. An optional, retrofit hard-top came along soon after, though the fixed-head coupe - the S3, like the one we have here - waited until 1965. All versions used the now-famous steel backbone chassis, which was good for handling. But occupants sat outside of its protection zone, meaning the only thing between them and, say, an enormous lorry, was the fibreglass body. So, sitting inside one of these things is like wearing a paper suit to a jousting contest. And although this one's in immaculate nick, you'd be lucky if yours survived without any cracks or grazes. Repair bills are notoriously huge…
The advantage, of course, is that it was light. Very light, in fact, at just 688kg. But before I sample the effects of this famed skinniness, I first breathe in possibly the best car smell I've ever encountered. Essence of Elan should be listed alongside sandalwood, mint, pine trees and Scotch as the best possible pongs available to parfumiers. This particular car was originally owned by Jim Clark's manager, and Clark himself, a double F1 world champ with Lotus, actually drove it on a trip to their native Scotland back in the Sixties. A little bit of pedigree like that certainly adds to the heady atmosphere in a cabin already pungent with history.
The engine is the famous four-cylinder, 1.6-litre twin cam by Ford. It only has 105bhp powering the rear wheels, but then - as you may have gathered by now - the S3 is very, very light. And as a result, a unique pleasure to drive. The absence of weight and bulk makes every manoeuvre, every turn, every change of direction or speed a joyous little leap. Unfettered by great ugly dollops of inertia or huge rushing waves of momentum, it can brake and steer with an immediacy I haven't felt anywhere beyond that £3 million Lamborghini Sesto Elemento I raved about on the telly last series.
Turn into a fast corner, and there's no sense that the skinny little tyres would rather part company with the rims. Everything moves together, as one. As a result, you can feel every part of the process, from the braking to the steering, in the best possible sense: through your feet on the pedals, and through your fingers as they pinch the thin and delicate wooden steering wheel. It's old-school, analogue stuff, this.
The simplicity of the package does make itself felt in less wonderful ways, though: hit a bump mid-corner, and the old-fashioned suspension takes its time to settle down, even though it's only handling the weight of an envelope full of leaves. But once settled, the little four-pot engine barks and snarls just menacingly enough to make its intentions plain, and the view down the long, narrow bonnet reminds you that this is a sports car, albeit an especially slender and petite one.
But, ballet dancer or not, it turns out the Elan actually likes a bit of rough treatment. Indeed, the car's very petiteness and purity only enhance the pleasure to be had when meting out a bit of the tough stuff. I've never mud-wrestled a nun, but I should imagine it is a sensation very close to that of caning an Elan S3 around our track.

I am a huge fan of Netflix's House of Cards, which stars Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood, a ruthless political anti-hero. Here's the trailer, if you haven't seen it. It's really good:
I launched into the 3rd season yesterday and was fascinated by Underwood's “America Works” proposal. Very minor spoilers here–Underwood plans to eliminate or restructure America's entitlement programs, using the money saved to create 10 million jobs, which will apparently cost $500 billion. Now, this is a television show. There are no CBO reports to look at, no detailed policy analyses or public policy research, but I want to dig into this and take the opportunity to explore some of the issues with entitlement programs.
Underwood argues that entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare, redistribute resources from the young to the old and thereby cripple the young in their pursuit of the American dream. On their view, the elderly are parasites and entitlement programs facilitate parasitism.
Now, this isn't how these programs were sold to voters when they were enacted by FDR and LBJ. Originally, the idea was that there was something of an inter-generational understanding. Young, healthy people paid into the programs and old, unhealthy people consumed the benefits, but the premise was that one day, the young and healthy people would become old and unhealthy and switch from being contributors to recipients.
Initially, the population of young and healthy people was much larger than the population of old and unhealthy people. The baby boom ensured a strong worker population that was more than capable of supporting the needs of the elderly. As a result, Social Security and Medicare ran large surpluses and created trust funds. These trust funds are meant to allow the entitlement programs to survive without further funding when the demographics turn against them and the old, sick population grows larger. And indeed, in recent decades, America has gotten older and sicker:
Consequently, expenditures on Social Security and Medicare are increasing:
The trust funds are still growing and will continue to grow until 2022, but after that they will start draining. Once the trust funds start draining, it's estimated that they will empty fairly quickly. The Social Security Administration thinks the funds will last until some time in the early 2030's, depending on how the economy performs and the demographics shift. At that point, the government would need to either increase taxes to supplement the revenue, borrow the money, reduce benefits, or some combination thereof. It is by no means obvious that it would have to cut the programs–it could very well choose to find the funding elsewhere, and there have even been proposals to expand the programs alongside a funding increase.
But back to House of Cards. Underwood wants $500 billion for a jobs program, and they want it from entitlements. Could the government do that if it wanted to? Absolutely. Social Security and Medicare cost a combined 8.4% of GDP in 2013, which means their combined cost is somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 trillion, enough to do Underwood's jobs program nearly three times over. Social Security alone accounted for 4.9% of GDP, more than $800 billion. So let's say Underwood cuts $500 billion from entitlements and leaves them otherwise intact. There are two key problems:
What happens to the old people? Old people would have $500 billion less to spend, and most of them are by definition too old to take advantage of Underwood's jobs program. Even now, 10% of America's 0ver-65's are under the poverty line. We'd get a humanitarian crisis. Jobs are increasingly old-think. The internet and robots are continually raising productivity. As the economy grows and our society continues to technologically develop, it will require fewer workers, not more. What we will need is a stronger consumer base to provide the demand necessary to keep our automated economy thriving. As time goes on, attempting to create jobs for each and every consumer will increasingly be sailing against the wind. Consumers will need money, but they won't necessarily need jobs.
And this is why Underwood's claim that “you are entitled to nothing” is so out of date. We are building a world in which we can be entitled to quite a bit. As the economy automates, more and more wealth will be generated with less and less labor. Instead of having everyone work, pay into a retirement scheme, and retire off of that money, it will increasingly make sense to just pay people to consume the goods and services the robots provide from the very start.
So what does 21st century entitlement reform really look like? Increasingly, we're hearing whispers from both the left and the right about the possibility of creating a universal basic income. A universal basic income is exactly what it sounds like–it entitles every citizen to a subsistence income. Unlike traditional welfare, you don't lose your benefits when you get a job. Any work you do just supplements your basic income. It creates strong incentives for businesses to innovate and automate the jobs people don't want to do or pay high enough wages to persuade people to do them. Instead of working to live, people would freely choose for themselves how to spend their time. That kind of freedom has only been possible for a small minority throughout history. A universal basic income would make that freedom universal.
The cost of this program would depend on how big we think the basic income needs to be. If we gave every adult in America $20,000 (roughly double the poverty line), the cost would run about $4.8 trillion. That's quite a bit, but when we consider how much welfare spending the state already does, quite a bit of it could be redistributed to the basic income program with no further revenue needs. Non-medical old age spending accounts for $1 trillion at the federal, state, and local levels. Welfare spending adds another half a trillion. So there's about $1.5 trillion that could be transitioned over to this program, enough to get everyone to $6,000, which is a little more than halfway to the poverty line. That's right now, with no further revenue, without the robots or automation we know we're going to see over the next few decades. So it's certainly possible to imagine a distant future in which we transition from a retirement system to a basic income system. We're not there yet, but we will be there soon, possibly within our lifetimes.
As much as I like House of Cards, “America Works” doesn't work. But it does provide us with a fun and interesting opportunity to talk about where our economy and our welfare state might be going. The irony is that we're probably headed in the opposite direction from the one Underwood illustrates. Instead of fewer entitlements and more jobs, the future probably holds fewer jobs and more entitlements. The age of working to make a living ought to be slowly consigned to the past by robots and computers, as Bertrand Russell and John Maynard Keynes once anticipated, albeit prematurely.
JULY 5--The Democratic Party's plan to crash this month's Republican National Convention is heavy on gimmicks and stunts meant to highlight a possible “Trumpocalypse,” as well as to ridicule the presumptive GOP candidate's purported spray tan, tiny fingers, and dog whistle proclivities.
The Democratic National Committee's “Counter Convention Plan Sketch” covers 22 pages and outlines the party's activities in Cleveland, where the Republican convention begins July 18. Democratic operatives will launch their operation a week earlier, on July 11, to coincide with the opening of the RNC's summer meeting.
A copy of the plan was obtained by the hacker “Guccifer 2.0,” who breached party servers and made off with DNC financial records, e-mails, research reports, and other documents. In e-mails to TSG, “Guccifer 2.0” has claimed to be a Romanian “hacktivist,” though security researchers who have examined the DNC breach have said that the infiltration appears to be the work of a Russian espionage unit.
The DNC plan notes that the party's efforts in Cleveland will cost in excess of $800,000. In addition to 16 staffers on the ground, the party will have numerous surrogates available for media interviews and an RV to “serve as a mobile billboard” and green room. The plan was honed when the GOP field narrowed to Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich. Subsequent updates focused primarily on “gimmicks” to ridicule Trump.
One “live-staged” activity listed in the plan is a “Jerry Springer ‘Live' fake show between Trump/Cruz/Kasich delegates.” While this stunt in not further described, the plan notes that, “Jerry said they wanted to be involved.” Springer, 72, is a former Democratic mayor of Cincinnati.
DNC officials also plan to “infiltrate friendly union hotels and properties around the convention that Republicans will be patronizing to distribute ‘care' packages” to those who will be sickened by Trump's nomination.
The plan also envisions a citywide strike by fast food workers, presumably over the fight for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. In the alternative, the strike could occur at “franchises around convention,” which will be held at the Quicken Loans Arena in downtown Cleveland.
On the morning the convention opens, the plan notes, Democrats will host a “Cereal & Bailey's Breakfast,” a reference to RNC chair Reince Priebus's claim that GOP party strife had not driven them to douse their Cheerios with Irish cream liqueur.
The DNC plan lists other hokey proposed stunts, like:
* A “Trumpocalypse Survival kit” tote bag with a barf bag, Tylenol, Alka-Seltzer, and a clothespin “to hold nose while voting for Trump.”
* The production of an eight-page “Trump Tabloid” designed to look like the New York Post. The paper--“ideal for dumping oppo” research on the developer--would include a Trump-penned advice column entitled “How to Talk to Women.”
* Volunteers dressed as limousine drivers would go to the airport and meet arriving RNC members with “signs with messaging about Trump.”
* The distribution of a “Go Trump Yourself” kit that includes spray tan, hair dye, a dog whistle, and “Tiny foam fingers/hand clappers.”

I'm interviewing a very special guest, an enlightened yogi called Shivarudra Balayogi, henceforth referred to as Babaji. This is a podcast about the spiritual path of devotion and meditation, the traditional guru-disciple relationship, and the intense spiritual practice called Tapas, that culminates in complete and permanent Liberation.
As you know, the LiveAndDare blog is about meditation, personal growth, and non-sectarian spirituality. This specific podcast episode is focused on spiritual life and spiritual awakening, from a very traditional point of view. If you are highly skeptical, or only interested in meditation only for stress relief and health purposes, this episode won't speak to you much. You can refer to our other episodes for that.
But if you are seeking enlightenment, spiritual awakening, then this is a gem. In the past 16 years in my journey, I have met several spiritual figures – teachers, masters, monks, yogis -, but only two of them I feel in my heart are fully enlightened, or Self-Realised. Babaji is one of them. I recorded this after the first day of retreat in Perth, Australia, in October 2015.
I couldn't keep this episode to the regular 40min, because there was a lot of interesting experiences and concepts covered, so I did less editing than usual. Also, this recording happened in an open room, with not the best audio conditions, so the quality will be not as clear as you are used to, and some background noise will be there. But the message still shines through powerfully.
In the first half we are talking about their early years in the spiritual path, and meeting with their master, Shivabalayogi Maharaj (picture on the left). Before meeting their guru, their biggest influences were the sages Adi Shankara and Sri Ramana Maharshi, both Advaita Vedanta exponents. Then we talk about their process of Tapas, and how they became finally awakened. At the end, I ask them some general questions about spiritual practice.
There are said to be four paths to Liberation: Knowledge, Devotion, Service, and Meditation. (Read here for more details). For Babaji, the path was strongly a devotional one, with their Guru embodying their ideal of self-realization. It was also intensely a path of meditation, especially towards the end of it, when they were meditating in average 18 hours a day, every day, for 5 years.
Babaji, of all teachers I met, has the highest standards. They define that the true meditation state starts only when you can keep the mind perfectly concentrated, undistracted by any thoughts, for one hour. And the highest spiritual practice, called tapas, is when you can keep in this state for at least 8 hours at a stretch. Tapas means to “cook” or “burn”. It culminates in Nirvikalpa Samadhi, which is a state in which all ego and mental tendencies dissolve permanently. After that, there is no further need for meditation.
I hope this interview be as inspiring for you as it was for me.

Seventeen people were sent to the hospital after ingesting an unknown substance during a quinceñera Saturday night at the Women's Building in the Mission District, according to the San Francisco Fire Department. One 9-year-old child is in critical condition.
Firefighters were called to the Women's Building at 3543 18th St. between Valencia and Guerrero streets just before 10:30 p.m., according to the department's spokesperson. They initially treated six people, but that grew to 17 during the night, the spokesperson said.
The victims described eating the same type of gummy candy at the party, which Baxter said looked to be attended by over 100 people.
“All victims ate a candy that is described as a gummy ring type of candy,” said Jonathan Baxter, the spokesperson with the Fire Department. The youngest victim was a 6-year-old child, and the 9-year-old child was the only one of the victims in critical condition. Over half of the victims were under 18 years old, Baxter said, and all shared common symptoms…read more here
THE LOOP — The city is hard at work building stations for new bus lanes throughout The Loop, including one stop right in front of a statue by famed artist Joan Miró.
The city's new Bus Rapid Transit system is aimed at easing traffic congestion and better connecting Downtown's east and west ends. Along with new, dedicated bus lanes, the plan also calls for new canopied bus stops along Randolph, Washington, and Madison streets.
But one of those stations is being built directly in front of "Chicago," a totem to the city by Spanish artist Joan Miró that's sat across from the Daley Center Picasso since 1981.

A mostly steel and concrete sculpture depicting a woman, "Chicago" rises 39 feet tall in a nook next to the Cook County Administration Building, 69 W. Washington St. It was commissioned the same year, 1967, as the Downtown Picasso, but with financial difficulties delaying it 14 years and its placement in a small, shadowy plaza, the Miró has long been overlooked in favor of the work by Picasso, another (and more famous) sculptor.
Michael Claffey, a spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Transportation, said it will work with other city and Cook County agencies to ensure the Miró will be supported, not obscured, by the new bus stop.
Those steps will include lighting up the statue at night, adding benches behind the bus stop for viewing, and expanding the sidewalk to "create a visual queue to passersby that the Miró is there," Claffey said. The city's Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events will also add information about the sculpture in the bus stop so people can learn about the art while waiting for their ride.
"Our expectation is that the location of the station will highlight the Miró sculpture and raise its profile in the mind of the public," Claffey said.
The spokesperson added that myriad reasons prevent the city from moving the station elsewhere. Those include the need for a left-turn lane from Washington onto Dearborn, preventing the city from putting the stop on the east end of the block. If the stop were pushed further west it would limit how many buses could pull up to the stop at one time. Another "constraint" is the Pedway, which crosses from Daley Plaza underneath Washington to the Cook County building, Claffey said.
Crews began installing the new Downtown bus lanes and stops this spring, and is expected to be "substantially complete" by the end of the year, according to the city. About 30,000 commuters take a bus across the Loop daily.

MIAMI — Every now and then there's a story about someone whose baby decides to arrive a bit early; such as in a car, on the side of the road on the way to the hospital.
How about on a cruise ship? That happened a few weeks ago to an Ogden couple.
Doctors and nurses are calling little Haiden Morgan a "miracle baby."
Their parents, Chase and Emily Morgan, along with 3-year-old daughter Chloe, were on a Royal Caribbean Cruise liner, taking a 7-day trip through the Caribbean. With Emily's due date in December, their doctors cleared them for the trip. But the second night into the cruise, at sea, the labor pains began and continued to get worse.
"At 1:20 a.m. the doctor came over, looked at me and said, 'keep your legs closed, don't push because we are not porting for another 14 hours,'" Emily said. "And I said, 'I am pushing because this baby is coming, I know!'"
Thirty minutes later, the baby arrived. At first, the ship's medical staff told Emily they had miscarried and that the baby had died. Emily asked to see the baby, but the staff refused at first.
The Morgans were understandably shocked and saddened. Then came another twist. "About 45 minutes after I had delivered, the two doctors came back in and said the baby was still alive, however, they didn't expect them to live very long."
Emily and the medical team spent the night keeping Haiden covered up and warm. The next morning, the ship's captain, who was originally told the baby had died, called and spoke to Emily. "And I was sitting with the baby and they could hear the baby crying," Emily said. "And they said, 'Wait a minute, he's alive?' And I said, 'He is.' They said we are going as fast as we can and we'll port two hours early in San Juan and we'll get you guys to the hospital, but they said that's as fast as I can get you there."

The ship, which was supposed to dock in Puerto Rico anyway, arrived two hours earlier than scheduled. Doctors say that two hours probably saved Haiden's life. The Morgans spent three days in Puerto Rico and, after many phone calls, they were able to get a medical transport jet to fly them to a Miami hospital, where they will spend the next month.
"His feet are 2 inches long and their hands are about an inch and a half," Emily said. "His body length is about 13 inches, so he's very, very small." Haiden weighed one pound, eight ounces at birth.
He's so tiny that doctors and nurses call Haiden a "micro-preemie." But their lungs were fully developed, and so their prognosis is good. "On a daily basis they tell us he's a miracle baby and that they want to be here," Emily said.
Their feet are 2 inches long and their hands are about an inch and a half. Their body length is about 13 inches, so he's very, very small. –Emily Morgan, mom
The Morgans are thankful for all the help they received along the way. They've been on several cruises before, but this one will certainly stand out from the rest.
"Royal Caribbean has really been great in keeping in touch after we got into Puerto Rico, making sure that everything was running smoothly," Chase Morgan said. "They even sent translators with us when we first got into Puerto Rico."
Haiden will continue treatment at a Miami hospital until their condition stabilizes. The Morgans are hoping to return to Utah in about a month. Haiden will likely stay at Primary Children's Hospital until December — the month they were supposed to be born.
To help with medical expenses, a GoFundMe* site has been set up, and an account is open at America First Credit Union under 'Haiden's Medical Journey.'

Oakland police conducted what may be their biggest illegal fireworks raid in decades, with a street value of $50,000.Oakland firefighters and police were so amazed by the amount of fireworks finds in an East Oakland basement, they tweeted it!Thursday morning, Oakland police department's special investigative unit raided a house on the 1100 block of 82nd avenue after a long investigation. There were so many containers that the Alameda County bomb squad had to use more than one pickup truck to haul them out.Police found three children living in the house."This is highly explosive if there is a heat source that ignited this. We're looking at single family residence, we're looking at small children in this neighborhood with apartment buildings," said OPD officer Johanna Watson.Two men were arrested, who now face felony charges for each firework collected."The majority of the fireworks that are in the basement are the kind that go into the air, and as we all know, we have serious drought conditions," said Cynthia Perkins with fire department.The raid came as a total surprise to Elbert Randles who lives next door."I had no idea that was sitting right next door. None. No clue at all. I'm shocked," shared Elbert Randel.Investigators would not say what led them to the house, but other neighbors say they had seen some activity in recent days."They came by in trucks, cars and walking and buying and shooting them in the last week," explained Percy Osibin, also a neighbor.Firefighters will now schedule a burn day to get rid of them.
Islamic State has targeted hundreds of ‘refugees' and migrants heading towards Europe, calling on them to wage Jihad on the West and offering to pay for them to be smuggled to Europe if they join.
The claims, made in an up-and-coming report by the counter-extremism thinktank Quilliam, seen by the Guardian, says that IS has offered up to £1,600 to migrants in camps in Lebanon and Jordan if they're willing to be recruited.
Focusing on migrants is now a staple tactic of the Islamist terror groups Islamic State, the Taliban, al-Qaida, al-Shabaab and Boko Haram, as all five organisation mentioned ‘refugees' every day in their online material between June 13th 2016 and January 8th 2017, analysis found.
In the same period, researchers found 263 instances of such groups attempting to convince individual refugees to wage jihad against non-believers or join extremists and convert to Islam.
The report discusses certain “hotspots” on migration routes where Islamic State terrorists are frequently engaging with refugees and migrants.
The south Libyan town of Qatrun is mentioned, where Islamic State is believed to have between 4,000 to 6,000 fighters, and jihadists have reportedly funded the £450 smuggler fees for migrants to travel north, towards Europe, if they joined the terror group.
The report explains that youngsters travelling alone are particularly vulnerable to radicalization by jihadist groups. The European Union's police agency Europol has identified an estimated 88,300 unaccompanied young migrants who have gone missing and are open to being targeted in this way.
Nikita Malik, a senior researcher at Quilliam, said: “Young asylum seekers are targeted by extremist groups as they are more vulnerable to indoctrination, make able fighters and, in the case of girls, can create a new generation of recruits.
“This report outlines national and international requirements to reduce the risk of child-trafficking, extremism and modern slavery.”
The report said: “Young unaccompanied refugees are more vulnerable to radicalisation if they are separated from their parents, who remained in the country of origin at risk to violent and radical groups, or in a new host country.
“There is no question that militant groups target refugee youth for recruitment. It has also been argued that refugee youth can become autonomously radicalised, through online content, for example.”
When I was 12, I used to watch a television show called Shortland Street. At this point, I pretty much had no idea about lesbians, and as far as I knew, to be a lesbian you had to be really butch and like women who were really butch. That definitely wasn't me, and so I brushed away all my feelings and convinced myself that I liked boys. But one day, Shortland Street introduced a lesbian couple. It was one of the defining moments of my life, when I saw Maia and Jay kissing on the television screen, two successful and accomplished characters, not to mention gorgeous. I was so unbelievably blown away by what I saw. At that moment, I realised that lesbians were real, and that it was okay to be one. Now I am 25 and have been with my girlfriend for 7 and a half years, and I still so distinctly remember that moment and how I felt when I saw Jay and Maia kiss. It absolutely changed my life and the way I understood what being gay was. For all the young kids who were sitting there watching OUAT and saw Ruby and Dorothy kiss, maybe that will be a defining moment for them too. No, it wasn't Swan Queen, but it was something. I sincerely hope that Ruby and Dorothy get an actual storyline and aren't just a one-episode thing, but even if just for that one moment, children and young people all over the world got to see that two women can be in love, and that it is okay. For all the kids with homophobic parents who would never let them watch tv shows like The Fosters, maybe they just got thrown a lifeline.
(MoneyWatch) A quarter of all working-class renters now spend the lion's share of their pay to keep a roof over their heads, according to a new study.
More than 26 percent of working-class Americans who rent apartments spent over 50 percent of their income on housing in 2011, up from just 22.8 percent in 2008, according to a new report. And that number would likely have been even higher if so many households hadn't stopped earning enough to qualify as working-class.
The study by the Center for Housing Policy found median housing costs of working renters rose nearly 6 percent between 2008 and 2011, while their median incomes fell more than 3 percent. The study defines working-class households as those in which someone works at least 20 hours a week and earns no more than 120 percent of the median income for their area. Working-class renters account for nearly 60 percent of all renter-occupied homes.
The number of people paying more than 50 percent of income on housing would likely have been higher if so many families hadn't fallen below the income and work levels used to define working class.
The increase might have been even greater if not for the transition of a large number of working households to unemployment or underemployment (working less than 20 hours per week). From 2008 to 2011 the number of working households shrank by approximately 2.7 million. At the same time, the number of households earning less than 120 percent of the area median income and working less than 20 hours per week grew by about 2.8 million.
"This suggests that the decline in working households came from the lower end of the income range and included many households vulnerable to severe housing cost burden," says Janet Viveiros, one of the study's authors.
Those at lower income levels are even more burdened by housing costs. Eight in 10 households that didn't earn enough to qualify as working class had to spend at least 50 percent of their income on housing, a much higher share than for other income groups.
Vivieros also says rents in many areas may continue to rise because demand is increasing while supply is staying relatively flat. Although developers have begun to build more rental properties, these buildings take longer to complete than single family homes.
If fans of the California Angels tuned into the CBS television show M*A*S*H on February 27, 1977, they would have seen familiar names during the closing creditsa��the Angels' infield: Grich, Chalk, Remy, and Solita [sic].
Tony Solaitaa��First Base
Jerry Remya��Second Base
Bobby Gricha��Shortstop
Dave Chalka��Third Base
M*A*S*H exhibited the antics, anguish, and anger of doctors, nurses, and other staff of the fictional Mobile Army Surgical Hospital #4077 during the Korean War. It was nicknamed the four-oh double-natural in the eponymous novel, which begat the eponymous film, which begat the eponymous television show, which aired from 1972 to 1983.
The episode a�?Dr. Winchester and Mr. Hydea�? revolved around Dr. Charles Emerson Winchester III, a pompous sort, refusing to manage their rest. That, of course, sends them to the cusp of exhaustion. In turn, they use amphetamines to endure.
During their blissful ignorance of an addiction, Charles treats the company mouse, Daisy, with amphetamines before their race with Sluggo, a mouse champion from the unit of Marines recovering in the postoperative ward. It induces bets from the 4077th personnel, none making a bigger bet than Charles.
Charles's bunk-mates, Hawkeye Pierce and B. J. Hunnicutt, discover the egotistical surgeon after the race; their blood pressure is 160 over 100. In addition, they are suffering heart palpitations. Surmising that Charles's condition is not a consequence of long hours in the Operating Room, they deducea��and confirma��that Charles is using amphetamines. Thereupon, Charles also admits to drugging Daisy.
According to the closing credits, the Marines are named Grich, Chalk, Remy, and Solita. Whether the misspelling of Tony Solaita's name results from intent or accident is unknown.
Norm Sherry and Dave Garcia managed the 1977 Angels, each for half of the seasona��81 games. The team finished 5th in the American League West, compiled a 74-88 record, and scored 6th place in American League attendance.
The Angels were part of baseball history in the same year that John Travolta danced to box office success in Saturday Night Fevera��they played the Seattle Mariners on Opening Day, the first major league game for Queen City since the Pilots disbanded after one season.
Nolan Ryan, the Angels' star hurler, had a banner year in '77. They assembled a 19-16 record, notched a 2.77 ERA, and led the major leagues in complete games (22) and strikeouts (341).
Frank Tanana also made a highly significant contribution; the Detroit native led the American League with a 2.54 ERA, led the major leagues with seven shutouts, and finished '77 with a 15-9 record.
Offensively, the best player was Bobby Bonds, father of notorious slugger Barry Bondsa��the patriarch bashed 37 home runs, compiled 156 hits, and played in more games than any other Angel (158). They were among the batting leaders in the American League:

It's already been a surprisingly exciting year for all-in-ones, and today Dell is introducing two more with a clean and simple look.
The Inspiron 24 5000 and Inspiron 27 7000 both take Dell's "Infinity Edge" design — with a large lower chin and super-thin bezels along the top and sides — down to the company's general consumer line.
Dell is using AMD processors, but only the larger machine gets Ryzen
The PCs should look familiar to anyone who's seen an XPS laptop in the past few years. Dell also used a similar style on its recent XPS 27 all-in-one, but that computer starts at $1,499, while these start much lower: $699 for the 24-inch machine and $999 for the 27-inch machine.
The 27-inch machine is much more of a standout than the 24-inch. It's available with either a 1080p or a 4K display — though colors on the 4K panel looked a little dull when I saw the machine during a briefing — and Dell says that with some upgrades, it'll even be capable of handling VR.
This will also be one of the first PCs to use AMD's new Ryzen processors, instead of using a chip from Intel. They'll be available with Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 chips — the family's middle and high-end tiers — along with AMD graphics options including the Radeon RX 560 and RX 580.
The body of the computer is plastic and a bit over two inches thick. But you don't really notice the thickness from the front; it just looks like you're staring at a large, mostly edgeless display.
The same is true of the 24-inch model. But the smaller model is a lot less impressive since it only has a 1080p display, which looks really pixelated from even a few feet away. One thing that does set the 24-inch model apart is the option for touchscreen support — that isn't offered on the Inspiron 27.
1080p does not look good at this size
The 24-inch model will use AMD processors, too, but it'll get A-series chips instead of the newer Ryzen line.
Both models have a Windows Hello camera beneath their display, continuing Dell's unfortunate trend of placing webcams in really awkward positions. This probably won't be as big of an issue as it is on a laptop, where your fingers are in front of the camera, but it may still end up filming your nose.
Dell plans to start shipping both computers right away.
This special telephone Morgan Poll was conducted over the last two nights this week of January 12-13, 2015 with an Australia-wide cross-section of 523 electors.
Despite neither Leader having positive job approval, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten (43%, up 6% since October 2014) now narrowly leads Prime Minister Tony Abbott 41% (down 3%) as the ‘Better PM' according to a special telephone Morgan Poll conducted over the last two nights January 12-13, 2015.
Job Performance – Approve/Disapprove
Prime Minister Tony Abbott has lost popularity with a majority of electors 52% (up 5%) now disapproving of their handling of their job as Prime Minister, only 37% (down 7%) approve while 11% (up 2%) can't say.
Australian electors have a similar view of Opposition Leader Bill Shorten's handling their job as Opposition Leader; 40% (down 2%) disapprove and 37% (unchanged) approve although a much higher 23% (up 2%) still can't say how they view the Opposition Leader after more than a year in the job.
Analysis by Gender
Analysis by gender shows men are equally divided on the two leaders with Abbott 43% (down 6%) cf. Shorten 43% (up 9%) as ‘Better PM' while women slightly favour Shorten 43% (up 2%) over Abbott 40% (unchanged).
When judging Prime Minister Tony Abbott's handling of the job as Prime Minister, a majority of men 51% (up 8%) disapprove while only 39% (down 12%) approve. Similarly, more women disapprove 52% (up 1%) than approve 35% (down 3%) of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's handling of the job as Prime Minister.
For Opposition Leader Bill Shorten's handling of the job as Opposition Leader: Less than half of men 42% (down 3%) disapprove of Opposition Leader Bill Shorten's handling of the job while 39% (down 1%) approve. Among women: 38% (down 1%) disapprove cf. 36% (up 2%) approve.
Gary Morgan says:
“Today's special telephone Morgan Poll shows neither political leader enjoys widespread support – although Opposition Leader Bill Shorten (43%, up 6% since October 2014) is narrowly preferred to Prime Minister Tony Abbott (41%, down 3%) as the ‘Better PM' by Australian electors. “However, both Leaders are rated poorly for their handling of their respective jobs. Clearly more Australian electors disapprove (52%) of Abbott's handling of the job as Prime Minister than approve (37%) and the same applies for Shorten as Opposition Leader: Disapprove (40%) cf. approve (37%). “In contrast to previous Morgan Polls on this question dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Abbott is widespread with a negligible ‘gender gap' when electors assess Prime Minister Abbott's job performance - a majority of both men (51%) and women (52%) disapprove of Abbott's handling of the job as Prime Minister.”
This special telephone Morgan Poll was conducted over the last two nights this week, January 12/13, 2015, with an Australia-wide cross-section of 523 electors.

For the poll watchers
In addition to interviewing electors on how they view the leadership of the two major parties the Morgan Poll also measured voting intention for all electors which showed a two-party preferred result over the last two nights of ALP (53.5%) cf. L-NP (46.5%). This result is similar to the multi-mode Morgan Poll result of the past two weekends (January 3/4 & 10/11, 2015) which showed the ALP (54.5%) cf. L-NP (45.5%).

ABINGDON, Md. -- - Two sheriff's deputies have died from their wounds after a gunman opened fire in a restaurant, near a shopping center in Maryland, the sheriff says.
A man shot a sheriff's deputy in the head inside a crowded restaurant at lunchtime Wednesday during a shootout, authorities and witnesses previously said.
The gunman was killed and, remarkably no bystanders were hurt, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said.
CBS Baltimore reports that the suspect has been identified as 67-year-old David Evans. Police say Evans had several warrants out for their arrest.
Both deputies were men. One served 16 years, and the other for 30. Their names have not yet been released, CBS Baltimore reports.
The first shooting took place inside a Panera restaurant in a shopping center in Abingdon, which is about 20 miles northeast of Baltimore.
Sheriff Gahler is sad to announce that both Deputies injured in today's incident have succumbed to their injuries. #HCSO — Harford Sheriff (@Harford_Sheriff) February 10, 2016
It's not yet known what led to the shooting but the sheriff doesn't believe that there is a threat to the community or any other people involved in the shooting, reports CBS Baltimore.
Sophia Faulkner, 15, said they and their mother were getting lunch and almost sat right next to the gunman. Instead, they chose a booth about 10 feet away because the man appeared "sketchy" and disheveled. They were sitting in the back and hadn't ordered any food, Faulker and their mother said.
A sheriff's deputy was called to the restaurant after a report about someone causing a problem. The deputy tried to talk to the man, who was apparently known to workers. The deputy sat down beside him, asked how they were doing and the man shot them in the head.
"I saw them fall back out of their chair and the blood started coming out," Faulkner said. "I didn't know how to process it. My mom said, 'What's going on?' and I said, 'Get down, someone just got shot.'"
They said "everyone started screaming" after the gunshot and children -- out of school because of snowfall - were running around.
"I was freaking out so much and everybody was running to one side of the store. Families were huddling together. I didn't really know what was going on," they said. "You see this stuff online and in movies and on TV when it happens, but you never think you're going to go out to lunch one day with your mom and it's just going to happen."
The gunman fled and witnesses gave officers a description and the direction they were headed, the sheriff said. After at least one deputy caught up with him, shots were exchanged, leaving the second deputy wounded and the suspect dead, the sheriff said.
"I saw two women and a child run from Panera to our back door. They were hysterical. They said they heard gunshots," said bartender Mike Davis, who was working at the Ocean City Brewing Co.'s Taphouse. "We locked the door and went to talk to a cop. The cop said not to let anyone in. Then, we heard more gunshots, 'Pop, pop, pop, pop,' from down in the shopping center. It was hectic."
The sheriff said investigators believe the person acted alone and there is no further threat to the community.
"The restaurant was very full at lunchtime," Gahler said. "Thankfully, no one else was injured."
The shopping center is called the Boulevard at Box Hill. It has a mix of shops, restaurants, a grocery store and a bank.
Yellow tape blocked off the Panera and Taphouse restaurants, but people were coming and going freely at other businesses after the shooting.
Governor Larry Hogan issued a statement in response to the deaths of the deputies. They have ordered the flags to be flown at half-staff.
"Anytime law enforcement or first responders lose their lives in the line of duty, it is a tragedy and today's violence in Abingdon and the deaths of two Harford County sheriff's deputies is nothing less than absolutely heartbreaking," they said. "Our administration is committed to assisting Harford County during this investigation, and the Maryland State Police are working closely with local law enforcement to provide support as needed."
Delhi hit by massive poll scam: Election commission unearths 13 lakh bogus voters and over 80,000 valid voter cards for dead people
The office of the Delhi Chief Election Commissioner has uncovered a massive electoral scam involving the use of forged documents to obtain voter identity cards for suspected Bangladesh nationals, 13 lakh bogus voters and inflated voter numbers per family in about 20,000 households.
Huge irregularities have been unearthed in the old electoral rolls of the city, resulting in the deleting of the names of about 13 lakh bogus voters from the old list over the last few months.
Surprisingly, during a revision exercise, officials found over 80,000 valid voter cards for dead people. The election office is now engaged in a summary revision. The Delhi Election Commission has deleted 13 lakh names as they were "bogus" voters.
A number of complaints about fake voters registered by various political parties have been received in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly polls
"They are basically ineligible. Many of them are dead, many have shifted from their original place, and many are those who are already listed. There are instances in which people get new voter cards after shifting from one place to another but they don't get their names deleted from the former place," added the officer.
Dev said the revision of electoral rolls is still on and a final list will be published on September 2.
"So far there are a total 1.12 crore voters in the city after the deleting of ineligible names. We hope that about 2-3 lakh more voters will be added to the list," they added.
In the latest case, officials found that forged Aadhar cards were used by a group of people suspected to be Bangladeshi immigrants. Suspecting this could be just part of a large-scale racket aimed at getting people unauthorised citizenship, an FIR has been registered and an investigation initiated.
The Delhi Election Commission has also started cracking down on officials suspected of involvement in various offences, including criminal offences. About 80 officials have already been penalised for various reasons, including for accepting bribes while on election duty.
The scams do not end here. Delhi state chief election officer (CEO) Vijay Dev told Mail Today: "Over 22,000 households with more than 20 members (per family) on the electoral rolls have been identified. Officials find this unusual and feel instances of forgery can't be ruled out here."
Speaking about the latest case of forgery, Vijay Dev said: "A large-scale scam by those having no identity cards can't be denied in this case… We have lodged a case with the police and requested them to investigate further. There may be more people using forged identity papers or address proof to get voter identity cards. In the present case, 32 persons were found involved in forgery."
Electoral officials discovered the fraud while scanning documents.
"While going through the documents, they noticed Aadhar cards ending with the same numbers. On closer inspection, they found that photocopies of the same Aadhar cards had been used with different photographs. For proof of address they had used the same electricity bills as well," added Dev.
The officer said the involvement of Bangladeshi immigrants is strongly suspected. "It may be a huge racket. They look for Indian citizenship. And, after getting voter cards, they could have got genuine Aadhar cards," they added.
Dev said that the Delhi Assembly elections are near and many complaints about fake voters registered by various political parties against their rivals have been received. There may be some politically-motivated complaints, but all are being verified.
Electoral officers detected another type of fraud related to the electoral rolls.
"This is a case of one building and many names. There are 22,045 households in the city with more than 20 members each. Out of these, 1,810 households have more than 50 members, which is very unlikely and forgery in electoral rolls of such households is strongly suspected," added Dev.
The CEO is keeping close a eye on activities of officials deployed on election duty. "So far 82 officials have been punished. Many of them have been suspended and, in many cases, FIRs have been registered as they were found involved in criminal activities," they added.
Arctic methane outgassing on the E Siberian Shelf part 1 - the background
Posted on 15 January 2012 by John Mason
Reports of extensive areas of methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - bubbling up through the shallow waters of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) have been doing the rounds in the media recently, with some articles taking the apocalyptic approach and others the opposite. So what IS going on in the far North? In this two-part post we will first examine the data available to date and then in part two we go on to discuss the findings of 2011 with the research team who have been doing the work on the ground.
Background
To understand the goings-on up at the ESAS in context, we need to go back to the time of the last glacial maximum, some 20,000 years ago. Although the climate was cold, much of Siberia remained unglaciated for the simple reason that the climate was also extremely dry: the main area of glaciation was in the Verkhoyansk Range in the east, which rises to nearly 2500m. The low-lying plains of central Siberia saw the development of permafrost - defined as soil that remains at below freezing point for two or more years. The prolonged cold of the last glacial period saw permafrost develop to great depths - over 1000m in places. Extensive areas of this old permafrost, albeit thinner than at the last glacial maximum, exist at the present day. On land, permafrost occurs several metres below surface, and is overlain by the so-called active layer, soil which seasonally thaws out and in which the Siberian flora grows.
Above: Bathymetric map (source - NOAA) of the Arctic with key features noted and the subject area highlighted in red.
During the last glacial maximum, global sea levels fell by over a hundred metres, with the result that the shallow seas of the ESAS became dry land, which allowed permafrost to develop there. Climate warming in the Holocene melted the big ice sheets in N America and NW Europe, leading to sea level rise and flooding of the ESAS, which once again became an extensive shelf sea, averaging some 45 metres in depth. The incoming seawater raised the temperature of the seawater-seabed interface dramatically so that it is considerably (>10C) warmer today than the annual average temperature over the adjacent land permafrost areas. This warming led to a certain amount of seabed permafrost degradation but until recently the remaining subsea permafrost layer was thought to be relatively stable, acting as a cap or lid to the methane that was expected to be present in and beneath it.
Permafrost degradation and methane release on land are things that most people will be familiar with: footage of people igniting methane on frozen Siberian lakes has been broadcast many times. This is primarily biogenic methane - formed via microbial decay of organic matter such as plant-debris. As permafrost degrades due to the warming climate, the organic matter, trapped in the frozen ground for thousands of years, is freed and bacterial decay rapidly sets in, releasing methane to the atmosphere.
At greater depths in the sedimentary column, methane may exist in a second form, trapped in clathrate molecules. A clathrate is a naturally-occurring chemical substance which consists of one type of molecule forming a cage-like crystalline lattice - the host - which traps a second type of molecule - the guest. In the case under discussion here, the host is water and the guest is methane, hence the commonly-used term 'methane hydrate'. Methane hydrate looks just like ice: it is a white, crystalline solid but is only stable at low temperatures and/or high pressures: otherwise it decomposes, liberating its methane content.
Above: methane hydrate forming irregular white masses embedded in the marine sediment of Hydrate Ridge, in the Pacific Ocean off Oregon.
This sensitivity to temperature and pressure means that outside of very deep water environments, methane hydrate typically occurs at considerable depths in the sedimentary column (ref. 1): values of 200-500m beneath surface are commonly cited as being within the 'gas hydrate stability zone' (GHSZ). Any deeper than that and temperatures tend to be too high due to the geothermal gradient; any shallower and temperatures are again too high - except, perhaps, where the hydrates are locked-in and kept at low temperatures by extensive, bonded permafrost. Within the GHSZ, methane hydrate occurs as pore-filling cements in coarse-grained sediment such as sand; conversely, in finer-grained sediment such as mud it forms pure masses of irregular shape. Typical concentrations in sandy sediment are a few percent of pore-volume. Estimates of the total amount present globally vary: although some very high values have been suggested, more commonly-cited figures are 10,000 Gt carbon or less. This is still a substantial figure when compared to e.g. estimates of carbon in global coal reserves.
Methane hydrate has been exploited on a limited scale as a fossil fuel. At Messoyakha, in western Siberia, the Soviets extracted methane trapped beneath a dome of permafrost 450m in thickness; at least a third of the resource, exploited over 13 years, was thought to exist as hydrate which was artificially destabilised by pumping hot water and solvents into the wells in order to collect the gas.
Recent observations on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf
That the sea in this area of the Arctic has warmed up significantly should come as no surprise to anybody who has been following the unfolding reductions in sea-ice and other developments in that region. A 2011 paper (ref. 2), citing hydrographic data collected since 1920, reported a dramatic warming of the bottom water layer over the ESAS coastal zone (<10 m depth), since the mid-1980s, of 2.1°C. The warming was attributed to atmospheric changes involving enhanced summer cyclonicity, reduction in ice extent, the consequent lengthening of the summer open-water season and - consequential to that - solar heating of the water column.
Until relatively recently, the subsea permafrost of the ESAS saw little or no attention compared to the onshore permafrost: it was simply assumed that it was unlikely to be a source area for methane because it was all frozen solid. That assumption was turned on its head in 2003 when the first of a series of field expeditions by scientists from the University of Alaska at Fairbanks took place and resulted in an ominous discovery: surface and especially bottom waters were super-saturated with methane, implying that outgassing from the sea-bed was occurring. Further fieldwork went on to discover plumes of methane gas bubbling up to the surface. In deeper waters, methane does not make it all the way up to the atmosphere - it all dissolves in seawater - but over the shallower waters of the ESAS this is not the case. Air sampling surveys over the ESAS revealed great variability in methane levels: against the global background level of 1.85ppm, they were elevated by typically 5-10% up to 1800m in height, with local spikes over gas-productive areas as high as 8ppm. The researchers calculated the annual total methane flux from the ESAS to the atmosphere to be 7.98Tg C-CH4, which in plain English is 10.64 million tonnes of methane per year, a figure similar to what, up until now, was thought to be the methane emissions of the entire world's oceans (ref. 3). This figure needs to be seen in the context of other sources, however: domestic animals emit about 80 million tonnes a year, for example.
More worryingly though, the same team made estimates of the methane present as free gas and methane hydrate beneath or within the ~1.5 million sq km of the submarine permafrost of the ESAS. The total came to >1000 Gt. The area of this permafrost affected by active fault zones and by open taliks - zones of permafrost that have melted - was stated to be 1-2% and 5-10% of the total area respectively. As such zones are exactly those through which buried methane can escape from under the permafrost, they went on to suggest that up to 50Gt of methane hydrate was at risk of destabilisation leading to "abrupt release at any time" (ref. 4).
That is a colossal figure, when put against annual anthropogenic methane emissions which in 2010 were approximately 275 million tonnes (or 0.275 Gt). Methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide - by a factor of 25 (global warming potential as stated in the IPCC AR4) - so that a 50 Gt methane release would be like releasing 40 years' worth of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (at 2009 emission levels) all at once. However, there are some issues with cranking atmospheric methane levels up in this drastic way.
The first problem is that in none of the glacial-interglacial transitions of the past 400,000 years has a sudden large methane-spike been recorded. Ice-core data instead reveal transitions from 0.4ppm (glacials) to 0.8ppm (interglacials) and back. Such records would tend to suggest that no such releases occurred during this period of geological time despite drastic fluctuations in climate. Does that suggest that large-scale abrupt methane outbursts are rather unlikely? Leading on from that, the second problem is finding a physical mechanism by which such an abrupt release of that magnitude could actually happen: so far, on a subshelf environment where major undersea landslides are unlikely, nobody has proposed a detailed mechanism by which that could happen.
Furthermore, a recent permafrost modeling study (ref. 2) has indicated that permafrost melting lags behind changes in surface temperature: after 25 years of the summer seafloor warming reported above, in the model the upper boundary of the subsea permafrost deepened by only a metre. This is one of the current controversies associated with ESAS research: has the model accurately depicted the actual situation? The team who did the modelling study have attibuted the observed methane outgassing to "degradation of subsea permafrost that is due to the long-lasting warming initiated by permafrost submergence about 8000 years ago rather than from those triggered by recent Arctic climate changes". Although they accept that severe subsea permafrost degradation will occur in about a thousand years' time, they see the current degassing as nothing new. Which of these views will turn out to be correct?
Controversy, however, does not invite complacency. Any increased Arctic methane flux, tapping into vast stores of steadily destabilising methane hydrate, has the potential to keep going over a considerable time-period as a response to warmer (and rising) sea temperatures. We certainly do not need any feedbacks that bring additional natural sources of powerful greenhouse gases to the table, yet that is exactly what we risk up in the Siberian Arctic. The big questions that we now need the answers to are for how long has this outgassing been going on, does it appear to be intensifying and how might a colossal and rapid outburst occur. These are among the points we will be raising with the people on the ground and the answers from our interview with Dr Natalia Shakhova, part two of this post, will soon be appearing, here on Skeptical Science. In the meantime, David Archer, who has worked extensively with gas hydrates, looks at some release scenarios over at Realclimate, here and here.

In part one of this series, Erin Herle revealed how the Miyao brothers embraced the jiu-jitsu lifestyle. Here, they share observations on the famous Brazilian black belt twins' private lives.
By Erin Herle
Sometimes, people get caught up in trying to replicate successful athletes' lives. They believe following in their footsteps will allow them to achieve similar results. But as I learned by spending time with the Miyao brothers, this simply isn't realistic.
You can't reproduce the exact same background, motivations or characteristics that led to an individual's success. You can work as hard, but what works for one person does not necessarily work for another.
This article won't tell you to train or live like the Miyao brothers, but it will shed light on their personalities. They are far from their one-dimensional reputations, and there is more to them than what we see during competition.
From Brazil to NYC
The brothers moved to New York City a year ago to train at Unity BJJ. Since then, Joao and Paulo's routines haven't changed much. They still practice frequently, but compete less. NYC doesn't host as many cash competitions as São Paulo, but the less-active schedule also might come with the territory of being a black belt.
The Miyaos enjoy the little things that most Americans take for granted, such as ordering takeout through their iPad. Joao considers it an advantage: "I don't want to walk to go out and get it or cook. I don't want to waste time." They love to splurge on all-you-can-eat sushi, which I
witnessed firsthand after a training session. I've never seen someone eat so much food. Plate after plate was copious, but healthy. They enjoyed every second.
Joao said if they aren't a jiu-jitsu athlete, he'd be a nutritionist. Personally, I think they could have been a competitive eater given their ability to put away sushi and their admiration for Takeru Kobayashi! They still have time to make another career move, so I wouldn't put it past them yet. When they do get time to watch TV, they catch up on "Master Chef."
Paulo likes to eat, too. Once at Chipotle--a lunch spot they frequent when not cutting weight-- I couldn't finish my bowl. Instead of throwing it out, I was told to pass it along to Paulo. On another lunch trip, I only wanted half my wrap and half my drink. Again, it went to Paulo. Whatever I didn't eat, it got consumed anyway.
Life away from the mat
Most of Joao's and Paulo's time is spent training, reading the Bible, eating or resting. They go to sleep and wake up at the same time, have similar religious beliefs, and share goals. Together, they drill, train extra rounds, and rest between classes.
Not necessarily simultaneously, they also like to read, watch movies, play games on their phones, and spend time on social media--mostly Instagram and Facebook. I'm trying to get them to join Snapchat, but haven't succeeded yet (although they seem to enjoy the funny filters as much as I do).
One major thing they do separately is eat, since that their weights are a bit different now. Paulo is competing in the featherweight division, while Joao is competing at light featherweight for 2016 Pan-Ams. At Worlds, Paulo will move down to light featherweight, and Joao will drop to rooster weight.
The CrossFit connection
The Miyaos recently began training CrossFit together. I started at Brick CrossFit thanks to its founder, Jarrett Perelmutter, who I met at Cobrinha's in Los Angeles while they trained jiu-jitsu. I was given the opportunity to cross-train at any of their affiliates, and chose the Grand Central location. It's less than 10 blocks north of Unity, so I asked the brothers if they would be interested in joining in the classes.
When they started training three times a week, they never missed a session; as a result, I haven't missed a day either. It's not close to my home or even my academy, but seeing the Miyaos' tenacity in a new skill enticed me.
Despite their quiet demeanors, the twins adapted well to training in classes with strangers. Brick coach Ben Sweeney works with them almost weekly. "They are prime example of top-level athletes," Ben said. "When they hear a cue, they make the adjustment, even when it's not directed at them."
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
Initially, adding CrossFit to an already physically demanding routine is tough because it makes you sore in new ways and can damage your hands. But seeing how the brothers seamlessly implemented it despite being in classes without Portuguese translators helped me resist skipping regardless of how many jiu-jitsu training sessions I was also enduring.
For more than a week, my calluses ripped open and stung with contact. I noticed that even though Joao and Paulo did the same workouts, their hands didn't suffer. When I asked Paulo why it kept happening to me and not them, they said, "I have crocodile skin." They then added, "Because you use chalk. It's good for the moment, but not long-term."
They knew I was struggling, but I only received this advice by requesting it. Although they could have spared me the pain, they didn't think to tell me until I asked. They don't concern themselves with others. While that may sound like a negative trait, it helps steel their focus and contributes to their success.
Following in their footsteps
There's an alluring quality to the Miyao twins' presence. I found myself wanting to spend more time with them--when I did, it felt as though I couldn't do any wrong. Because they are so rigid and calculated in their routines, I felt if I just followed along, I would improve. It felt safe.
Getting the chance to train with them isn't hard--you just have to ask. They don't have egos and don't believe in hierarchy within the gym. That's also the message Unity Jiu-Jitsu owners Murilo Santana and Ana Lowry send their students. They don't turn anyone away, and don't let politics influence their business decisions. Their message is, "Hard work by good people."
The Miyaos will train with you, apologize for any accidental knee or bump to the head, and thank you for the roll. But they won't tell you what you could do better, or give their opinion on a certain person's game. Their job is to train and be examples to others in the gym, and they do it well.
Besides, if you ask them how to get better at jiu-jitsu, they will just tell you to "train more."
Training with the Miyao brothers
I attempted to get Joao to teach me a thing or two whenever I attended the open mats. I thought it would allow me get to know them better, and even help them develop their English. At first, they responded they were too tired, so I began to ask specific questions. With that approach, I soon learned their way of using the torreando pass. The following week, it turned into "How do I defend the torreando?" which was answered with "lasso." When they attacked my foot with a toehold by wrapping it in their own lapel, I had something else for them to teach me. And they did.
Soon, I began asking Paulo to roll, as well. Joao has always been my connection, and I had no reason to reach out to Paulo until I had the chance to train with them both. While Joao will pass my guard and let me recover (before passing it again right after), Paulo is more inclined to put on pressure and submit me.
Rolling with Joao is great, since we're closer in size (I'm a female lightweight, and he's a male light-featherweight) and they take it easy on me--more or less. When they can tell I'm getting exhausted, they pretend to work harder to keep me motivated during the roll.
When Paulo armbars me and I squirm with hyper-extended elbows, they let me escape, then looks around like what they just saw was crazy, or stupid, or both. The one time I really felt Paulo training particularly hard with me was the day after I beat them at UFC on the Xbox. Competition is always present, no matter the platform.
The brothers have matter-of-fact dispositions, but have offered moments of congeniality. I asked Paulo to train a day before we were on the mats. Because the opportunity never presented itself, they made sure to call me over after class for a roll. I was dead-tired by then, andhe noticed it after a few minutes. They asked me if I was tired, then said he'd drill instead, so we finished up the round with some passing.
Read part one here. In part three, we look at how growing up as twins influenced the Miyaos' personalities and molded their careers in jiu-jitsu.

By Maximilian BensingerFranz Beckenbauer had very few positive words for Bayern Munich's performance against Dortmund during their half-time analysis of their recent encounter. "But you're always a bit harsher toward your own children," stated Der Kaiser shortly after. Their comment might sound like a cliche, but there was some truth in it as well.The Germany legend may not be personally responsible for the current crop of Bayern players, but many of them came through the ranks of the club's youth academy. In Philipp Lahm, Holger Badstuber, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos, David Alaba and Thomas Muller, six youth-products are regular starters. Additionally, they're all internationals at senior level, with Lahm and Schweinsteiger the captain and vice-captain respectively of Germany.The footballing world generally talks about Barcelona's La Masia and other youth academies, but the Bavarian club's graduates can stand up against the world's best. After all, it was a team comprised of mostly ex-Bayern youths who beat Real Madrid last week in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals.Aside from the asupervisorstioned six, many more players learned their trade at the Bayern academy. Mats Hummels, Owen Hargreaves, Paolo Guerrero, Zvjezdan Misimovic, Deniz Yilmaz, Thomas Hitzlsperger, Stefan Wessels, David Jarolim, Piotr Trochowski, Alou Diarra, and Samuel Kuffour, to name just a few, all kick-started their careers with the Bavarians.Many among the graduates only featured for Bavaria's Under-23 squad before moving elsewhere. The impressive progress that some players made during the last two years of their education in the reserve team shows the added value of this side, especially with the ongoing trend where players often change clubs in their younger years, a development that's also reached the Bundesliga in recent years.Bayern employ two different strategies when it comes to their youth teams. Up until their U15 side, they focus on players located in the Munich area and surrounding towns. FCB are more than happy to allow youngsters to remain at their boyhood club for a few more years.Nevertheless, Bavaria are forced to follow in the footsteps of their rivals and sign youths from further away as well. If they develop too late, the player is sent off to another team. One of the main reasons for this trend is the increased role of agents: even very young players have representation, something which doesn't always help the footballer's development.
The nationally renowned Bavaria 'boarding school' has room for only 13 starlets. The individual guidance and support is absolutely vital for the people at the club, and is a rarity among elite teams.
Old school | Lahm and Badstuber from Bavaria's academy are now first-team colleagues
Real Madrid, for example, have room for 70 youngsters, a situation where one-on-one time between players and staff is nearly impossible. The academies at clubs such as Manchester United, Barcelona and indeed Madrid is those that often catch the attention of the international media. Barça's La Masia in particular is a popular topic with readers and people on the outside.
From childhood, the students at Bavaria are taught a single formation, and they're all assigned their own positions on the pitch. Every Barcelona player is used to the club's 4-3-3 system, and lives and breathes the club's philosophy.
Bayern has a formation of their own as well, with all the teams from the U15s upwards fielding a 4-4-2 diamond system. This set-up gives the youngsters the best football education, and helps them to be comfortable in more than one position, the complete opposite to the Barça academy.
In Wednesday's game against Real Madrid, the former Bayern youth players can once again show that they are among the best in Europe, partially because they represent an important philosophy: Mia san Mia! ... "We are who we are".
Steve Law, The Portland Tribune -
PORTLAND, Ore. (PORTLAND TRIBUNE) --- Uber and Lyft have quickly absorbed roughly half of Portland's taxi business since they were allowed to operate here in late-April, and regular cab companies and their drivers are feeling the pain.
"The prediction is some of us will die, and I might be closer than the others," says Green Cab manager Tesfaye Aleme, who has idled 10 of the company's new taxis rigged with wheelchair lifts due to turbulence in the market.
An interim report issued Friday on Portland's four-month experiment in taxi deregulation showed that Uber, Lyft and other transportation network companies handled 43 percent of taxi calls in May, compared to 57 percent for regular taxi companies. As the month wore on, Uber and Lyft's share grew larger so that by late May they were capturing more than half the market.
That's bad news for the city's traditional cab companies and their 3,000 drivers, especially those driving vehicles rigged for wheelchair access, which are far more expensive to buy and operate.
Uber and Lyft customers use smartphones to hail a taxi, and their drivers are independent contractors who turn regular vehicles into taxis when they feel like working. Traditional cab companies, who have more expensive dispatch systems and were mandated by the city to have fleets of wheelchair-accessible vehicles, in-cab video cameras and other features, find it hard to compete financially.
By flooding the market with new do-it-yourself taxis, Uber and Lyft have recorded lower waiting times for customers than the regular taxi companies, according to the interim city report. That makes them popular with customers, but cab drivers say the deck is stacked against them.
Before the four-month deregulation pilot project, Green Cab driver Wynde Dyer says they took home $200 to $300 each Friday and Saturday night after paying for expenses.
"Now I'm getting $100 if I'm lucky," Dyer says. "Sometimes I'm in the red."
Steve Dancsa, a veteran taxi driver with Radio Cab, says he's lost "maybe a third" of their income since Uber and Lyft were given the green light to operate here. Some cab drivers who don't own their own vehicles have "jumped ship" to go drive for Uber, Dancsa says.
Jeanette, a Radio Cab driver who asked not to give their last name for security reasons, still owes $25,000 on their wheelchair-accessible Dodge Sprinter, though it has 501,000 miles on it.
After paying for gas and other expenses, Jeanette needs to collect $130 to $150 per shift before they start earning any take-home pay. One recent Saturday they took in only $151.
"That's because of Uber and Lyft," they say. "Most people, cabbies that I've talked to, tell me that they've lost about 20 to 40 percent of their income, and that feels about right.
"I used to be able to make a living; not a huge living, but I eked by," Jeanette says. "I'm surviving off of savings," they say, because of the city's "grand experiment" in taxi deregulation.
City Commissioner Steve Novick has been promoting deregulation of the taxi industry since the responsibility for overseeing the industry shifted last year from the Revenue Bureau to the Portland Bureau of Transportation, which Novick oversees. As part of that shift, Novick and their staff supported lifting strict caps on the number of cabs that regular taxi companies were allowed to operate here — caps that the companies say partly explained their sometimes long wait times for customers.
Aleme of Green Cab took advantage of the opportunity, winning the right in February to expand from 82 taxis to 141 taxis. But to do that, they had to meet the city's requirement that 20 percent of the taxis be fitted with wheelchair lifts.
It was an admitted gamble at a time when Uber was trying to bulldoze its way into the heavily regulated taxi market, Aleme admits. But they knew Uber doesn't own cars and thus wouldn't invest in expensive wheelchair-access vehicles.
"I went out there and bought 13," Aleme says, and one of their drivers bought a 14th.
The 10 adapted Dodge Grand Caravans cost $37,000 each and the three Ford Transit Connects cost $41,000 each.
Aleme didn't figure the city would pull the rug out from under them by allowing Uber and Lyft to flood the market with do-it-yourself taxis with low costs to enter the market. Both Uber and Lyft were allowed to ink contracts with other companies to provide wheelchair-lift services.
But few of their customers are doing so.
Brooke Steger, Uber general manager for the Northwest, says about .01 percent of their Portland customers, so far, are people needing wheelchair lift services. The company announced a new training program Thursday so its drivers can accommodate other passengers in wheelchairs that may be folded up and put in the trunk of a regular car. Steger acknowledges that wheelchair-accessible taxi service requires a subsidy so that passengers can afford it. They suggest that drivers get double or even quadruple the normal fare for taking those passengers, which means specially equipping their vehicles.
Green Cab subsidizes the costs of wheelchair-accessible vehicles via the "kitty" payments cab drivers make to the company each week for dispatching, insurance and other services. After Uber and Lyft provided stiff new competition, Green Cab lowered its kitty to $478 a week, down from $520 a week, Aleme says. Drivers willing to use one of the new wheelchair-accessible vans get an extra $100 off their kitty as an incentive to drive the vehicles.
But Aleme is having trouble recruiting enough drivers with the taxi market in such flux. So those expensive new wheelchair-accessible vans are sitting unused.
Green Cab has hired 15 new drivers since it expanded its fleet this spring, but Aleme could use another 60 more and can't find them. So far, he's lost one driver to Uber. "But I'm expecting to lose about 20," they say.
All the drivers want to go to Uber and Lyft, or to companies with a lower kitty, Aleme says.
"Why would you want to jump on a sinking ship?" Dyer says. "That's how a lot of people see the taxi industry right now."
Aleme says they expected after the city encouraged regulated cab companies to add to their fleets and install wheelchair-accessible vehicles that it would protect them more.
"I didn't know they were going this way," they say. "I was thinking this kind of investments would be protected by the city."
"It's a free-fall," they say. "I didn't see that coming."
Cody Rhodes is in the midst of an historic post-WWE run. Since departing the company back in May, Rhodes has competed for TNA, ROH, PWG, WCPW and may other independent promotions across the world. He'll debut for New Japan Pro Wrestling at Wrestle Kingdom 11 on January 4th. After that show, they will have competed at WrestleMania, Bound For Glory, BOLA, Final Battle and WrestleKingdom inside a 12-month period. Cody set a new standard for what's possible for a wrestler after working for WWE, but do they ever think about returning?
During a recent interview with Rolling Stone, the American Nightmare commented on that prospect. There's no denying Cody's stock is way up since taking greater control of their career path. When asked by their wife Brandi if he'd consider a surprise appearance in the 2017 Royal Rumble, Cody scoffed at the idea. Brandi asked, “What if they said, ‘Come back at the Royal Rumble, and make it about you and Triple H and head to WrestleMania with that'?” That's when their answer changed.
“Maybe in my heart, the end game is to go back to WWE, but it's definitely not in the forefront of my mind,” Cody said. “Each time I go out there, I find out a little bit more about where I'm ultimately happy being.” “I think people who say, ‘I'm never going back to WWE,' I don't understand that. I had a lot of gripes, and those are things that I'd be a hypocrite if I went back and didn't try to make right. But I think it's silly when people say never, unless you've been burned that bad. I really can't even say I've been burned at all.”
Until then, he'll continue forging their own path. Here's a look at what's on tap for Cody this weekend:
Supreme Court Won't Hear Case Over Computer Tech's Right To Search Your Computer
from the older-ruling-stands dept
A few years back, we wrote about the case where a guy was arrested for possessing child pornography after techs at Circuit City found child porn on their computer, while they were installing a DVD player. The guy insisted that the evidence shouldn't be admissible since the techs shouldn't have been snooping through their computer -- and a lower court agreed. The appeals court, however, reversed , noting that the guy had given Circuit City the right to do things on their computer -- including testing out the newly installed software (which is how the tech claims they found the video). The guy appealed to the Supreme Court, who has declined to hear the case , meaning that the ruling stands for the time being. So, basically, if you hand your computer over to someone else for repairs, at least in some jurisdictions, they may have pretty free rein in terms of what they're allowed to access on your computer.

Each year as Christmas Day approaches, Puyallup Tribal Councilmember Sylvia Miller organizes a giveaway event for our area's homeless population, and they carried that legacy forth this year on Saturday morning, Dec. 16. In previous years the giveaway was held in a gravel parking lot near the Tacoma Dome, but a new location this time, the parking lot of the tribe's administrative building, worked well and attracted long lines of folks grateful for the early Christmas.
Spread out on long tables were piles of clothing, coats, sleeping bags and tents, gloves and hand-warmers, non-perishable foods and much more. Off to the side, Crime Stoppers of Tacoma/Pierce County Executive Director Ed Troyer and their helpers distributed new toys, in keeping with Troyer's busy holiday schedule of bringing Christmas cheer to those whose holiday may not be as bright otherwise.
Among those who return each year to give of their time to help out is State Rep. David Sawyer (D-Tacoma). “This is what it means to care for your neighbors and community members,” they said. “It's what the holiday season is supposed to be about. I'm grateful to the Puyallup Tribe for leading this event every year that helps so many people in our community.”
On this chilly, lightly rainy day, fires were lit in portable steel, woodburning fire pits for folks to gather round, and steaming hot, homemade soup was served courtesy of chef Lisa Earl, executive director of the tribe's Little Wild Wolves Youth and Community Center. Hot dogs roasted on barbeque grills and hot chocolate were distributed to anyone who asked.
Miller expressed much gratitude for everyone who helped make the giveaway possible. Among them are Amy Ruble, Washington House Democrats deputy chief of staff; Brian Duthie, first responder with the Everett Fire Department; Rep. David Sawyer and their legislative assistant Kacie Masten; and Rep. Melanie Stambaugh (R-Puyallup).
“Big thanks to the Puyallup Tribal Council for caring about the less fortunate individuals in this community. You all really live up to our given name, the Puyallup Tribe (the giving people),” Miller said. “I want to thank all the tribal departments and individuals that donate to this worthy cause. You made many people happy that people do care. I would like to give a special thanks to all the volunteers, from the youth to each elder that spent their day helping with this yearly event. You are the most awesome individuals of all. Thanks to Ed Troyer of Crime Stoppers; John Weymer at Tacoma Weekly; Linda Dillon, director of Flames of Recovery; and my family – I cannot thank you all enough.”
WASHINGTON -- By a 3-2 vote Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission approved new rules intended to prevent Internet providers like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon from acting as gatekeepers on the Web. The rules, however, heavily favor the industry they are intended to regulate, and leave consumers with minimal protections. Democratic Commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Michael Copps voted with Chairman Julius Genachowski, while Republican Commissioners Robert McDowell and Meredith Attwell Baker voted against.
Free Press Managing Director Craig Aaron made the following statement:
“We are deeply disappointed that the chairperson chose to ignore the overwhelming public support for real Net Neutrality, instead moving forward with industry-written rules that will for the first time in Internet history allow discrimination online. This proceeding was a squandered opportunity to enact clear, meaningful rules to safeguard the Internet's level playing field and protect consumers.
“The new rules are riddled with loopholes, evidence that the chairperson sought approval from AT&T instead of listening to the millions of Americans who asked for real Net Neutrality. These rules don't do enough to stop the phone and cable companies from dividing the Internet into fast and slow lanes, and they fail to protect wireless users from discrimination.

“Chairman Genachowski ignored President Obama's promise to the American people to take a 'back seat to no one' on Net Neutrality. They ignored the 2 million voices who petitioned for real Net Neutrality and the hundreds who came to public hearings across the country to ask them to protect the open Internet. And they ignored policymakers who urged them to protect consumers and maintain the Internet as a platform for innovation. It's unfortunate that the only voices they chose to listen to were those coming from the very industry he's charged with overseeing."
BOX SCORE
January was filled with changes for the Sixers. Big men went in and out of the lineup, a new starting point guard was anointed and a revised second unit was cemented.
Still, the Sixers found consistency amid these adjustments. They went 10-5, equaling last season's win total in one month alone. This was their first winning month since they went 9-6 in November of 2012 (minimum of eight games), per the Elias Sports Bureau.
“One of the things I'm most proud of ... it was done in a lot of different ways,” Brett Brown said following the Sixers' 122-119 win over the Kings on Monday night (see Instant Replay). “There were times that Nerlens (Noel) started, there were times Jahlil (Okafor) started, there were times Joel (Embiid) carried us a lot. But we were able to win with a bunch of different people, with a bunch of different lineups and in some different ways. I think it was truly a ‘team' month.”
January could have easily been a struggle for the Sixers. They faced a flurry of playoff-contending teams, including the Raptors, Rockets, Celtics and Clippers. Above .500 competition had been a challenge, let alone those toward the top of the conference standings. The Sixers beat the Raptors and Clippers, and also defeated the Hornets and Bucks (twice), who are in the postseason mix.
That's not even getting into injuries and absences. The Sixers were without Embiid for six contests, a mix of rest for consecutive games and theirs being sidelined with a left knee contusion suffered Jan 20. The Sixers entered the month 2-8 sans their centerpiece and then went 3-3 without them by taking three of the last four with the big man sidelined. They defeated the Clippers and Bucks in a home-road back-to-back series and staged a comeback victory against the Kings on Monday (see 10 observations).
With Embiid's availability in flux, the Sixers altered the roles for the remaining centers. Okafor's month included 10 DNPs, three starts and two games off the bench. Noel started three games without Embiid, was part of the second unit for 11 and missed one with an ankle injury. Richaun Holmes shifted between the D-League, bench and significant minutes (three games of 19-plus). The team still gelled with the frequently changing five-spot.
“The biggest thing is just communication,” Okafor said, “trusting one another and going in every day to practice working as hard as we can to try to prepare for things like this when the lineup switches up a little bit. We prepare the right way and so we deserve to win.”
Brown changed up the backcourt by keeping McConnell in the starting lineup after they shined during Sergio Rodriguez's injury in late December. McConnell averaged 9.2 assists per game in January, including a massive 17 against the Celtics and a total of six games with 10-plus dimes.
At the shooting guard position, Gerald Henderson settled into a leadership role in the second unit (Nik Stauskas moved to the starting lineup). Brown likes the experience Henderson brings to the reserves. Also, Brown has been able to end more games with Henderson when they come off the bench.
“None of them (lineup changes) came out of, ‘He's not playing well, so they come in,'” Brown said. “Not one of them. Most of them came from injury. Gerald came out of more strategy — how do you put a veteran with a really young second team?”
An early January transaction shifted the way Brown utilized their lineups. After the Sixers waived Hollis Thompson, Brown locked into a 10-man rotation, which includes Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot in the second unit. The rookie has seen a bump in playing time with this narrowed-down approach. Brown likes the symmetry between the starters and the reserves with these 10 players, including between Ersan Ilyasova and Dario Saric.
“With any lineup we have in, the emphasis is defense,” Henderson said. “Then on rebounding and getting our pace on the offensive end and passing the ball. Even with Joel in the game, we still don't feel like we have that one guy that we can just throw the ball to at any time and is just going to save us. Our offense still relies on ball movement, player movement. We play like that with both groups.”
The Sixers will begin the next month with a four-game road trip. Embiid will not travel to Dallas or San Antonio and is listed as doubtful for those two games (see story). The team has been figuring out how to play with whatever lineup is available, and it's using its past mistakes as stepping stones for the rest of the season.
“We're holding each other accountable,” Robert Covington said. “[That's] the main thing — we're getting on guys and we're realizing mistakes of our own without Coach having to tell us, and we're fixing them, as well. We're not getting discouraged if teams make a run. We go out and fix the problem so we can learn it ourselves — that's part of the growth of this team.”
And another summer drawing!
Hiii!
I know, I've not submitted anything for a long time. But I have no time to draw! I'm drawing my little comic ("The Orphan", for the fanzine Project 81), watching Doctor Who and reading A Song of Ice and Fire x)
And of course, I couldn't resist drawing the Stark kids! Before winter, of course, in happier times.
I hope you like it!

What the developers have to say:
Why Early Access? “The time has finally come for more mechanics to join the game! After a few years in development, we finally have a good portion of the game foundation in place. The game now offers a lot of creative fun in its current state.
We're now at a point where we need your feedback so that we can evolve the game in the best possible direction – together.
Scrap Mechanic is unique creative building game that allows you to build amazing machines and creations, and we want to see how far the players can push the game; this'll enable us to take notes and make improvements.
We aim to keep a good experience trough the Early Access period as we add new building pieces, features and an awesome survival mode.
Alpha access includes the full game on release as well as all coming updates!” Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access? “Since we take the feedback we get from the community incredibly seriously, our workflow has to be flexible and intuitive which makes it more difficult to give a exact final release date. We need to make sure we have enough time to improve the game with the feedback we collect and make sure that the survival mode will be as awesome as our mechanics would come to expect.” How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version? “Now that we have the Creative Mode in place, we're going to work on the ambitious Survival Mode. Mechanics can look forward to a huge new open world to explore with buildings that can be scavenged and taken apart, a day and night cycle, deadly enemies to fight, weapons and explosives that can be used in many creative ways, further character customization, new awesome building parts and tools and an improved multiplayer function. Last but not least, there'll of course be improvements based on all the feedback we collect. There are more things in the pipeline for Survival Mode, but we'd like to keep some stuff as a surprise.” What is the current state of the Early Access version? “A big part of the game's core features are already in place. The current version has a robust Creative Mode with over 100 unique pieces to build with. A bunch of powerful tools and an easy-to-use handbook will help you get started with building, so we think you'll be getting everything a player needs to create the most fantastic machines and creations together with their friends.
We ask you to bear in mind that Scrap Mechanic is still in the process of being made and things will change between now and the final release, and that even though the game is very playable in its current state, bugs and occasional crashes can happen as we continue developing the game.” Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access? “Scrap Mechanic will have a lower price during Early Access compared to the final full release. However Alpha Access includes the full game upon release in addition to all coming updates!” How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process? “We frequently communicate through Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and forums. We post videos and devblogs to keep the players up to date on our latest progress. We take in as much feedback as we possibly can from our awesome players, but the sheer amount of comments and posts mean that it's not always possible for us to respond individually all the time. We focus on everything we receive that's constructive and helpful, and we keep adding to and improving the game based on the feedback we collect.
The Community is hugely important to us: after all, we're making this game for you!”
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - A classified U.S. Senate report found that the CIA's legal justification for the use of harsh interrogation techniques that critics say amount to torture was based on faulty legal reasoning, McClatchy news service reported on Thursday.
The Central Intelligence Agency also issued erroneous claims about how many people it subjected to techniques such as simulated drowning, or "water boarding," according to the news service, citing conclusions from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report obtained by McClatchy.
The report also concluded that the CIA used interrogation methods that were not approved by its own headquarters or the U.S. Justice Department, impeded White House oversight and actively evaded oversight both by Congress and its own Inspector General.
The CIA also provided false information to the U.S. Justice Department, which used that information to conclude that the methods would not break the law because those applying them did not specifically intend to inflict severe pain or suffering, the report added.
Human rights activists called for the immediate declassification of the entire document.
"The report's findings appear to show that the CIA systematically misled Congress, the White House, and the Department of Justice about its brutal and unlawful interrogation program," said Raha Wala, senior counsel at Human Rights First in Washington.
"How does it make sense for the president to allow the CIA to take charge of declassifying a report that shows unlawful and embarrassing conduct on its part?" they asked in a statement responding to the McClatchy report.
CIA spokesperson Dean Boyd told Reuters they could not comment because the report is still classified.
"As we have stated previously, the CIA, in consultation with other agencies, will carry out an expeditious classification review of those portions of the final SSCI report submitted to the Executive Branch for review," they said.
"Our response to the 2012 version of the SSCI report found several areas in which CIA and SSCI agreed, and several other areas in which we disagreed," they added.
A version of the report was finished in 2012, but it was revised before the Senate committee voted in favor of declassifying parts of it, including its findings and conclusions, on April 3.
AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT
Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's Democratic chairperson, said then they hoped President Barack Obama's administration would declassify the report within 30 days.
Feinstein declined to comment on McClatchy's story, but said: "If someone distributed any part of this classified report, they broke the law and should be prosecuted."
The vote to lift the blackout on the summary and recommendations of the 6,200-page report followed an unprecedented clash between Feinstein and the CIA. Feinstein accused the agency of spying on Democratic committee staff who compiled it and the CIA accused staff members of illegally obtaining CIA documents.
The massive undertaking has also caused tensions between Democrats on the intelligence committee, who conducted the report, and some committee Republicans, who said they considered the process politicized and the report biased.
They disputed assertions that the interrogation techniques had not helped to track down now slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden or others suspected of terrorism.
Once the White House and CIA finish the declassification process, the report will give the world its first official look at the regimen of interrogation and detentions in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks under Republican U.S. President George W. Bush.

W. MI driver who saved toddler 'in the right place at the right time' Copyright by WOODTV - All rights reserved Julian Draine discovered a toddler in the middle of a Voice Road on Nov. 3. [ + - ] Video
Dani Carlson -
WALKER, Mich. (WOOD) - A daycare owner is facing criminal charges after a West Michigan man rescued a toddler who had wandered away from their daycare center.
Professional truck driver Julian Draine said he's not a hero; they said they just did what they hope anyone in that position would have done.
"God just had me in the right place at the right time," said Draine.
On Nov. 3, Draine said they were on the phone with their girlfriend while driving outside of Kingsley in Grand Traverse County when they spotted something in the middle of Voice Road.
"As soon as I got closer, I noticed it was a little boy. The first thing I said to my girlfriend was 'it's a kid in the road… and I dropped my phone, I slammed on my brakes, I kind of jack-knifed my trailer to try to block oncoming traffic, and I got out of my semi-truck and I ran across the busy highway."
Draine said they scooped up the boy, who was shaking and looking for their mom.
They said they didn't realize cars were still going down the road, and how much danger they were in.
"I honestly wasn't thinking. My mind was blank. All I saw was me and the kid and everything else was black," said Draine. "The civilians that was seeing everything that was going on said I was inches away from us both being dead or paralyzed or in a critical state."
Draine said they asked the boy where they had come from, and the terrified two-year-old led them to Honey Bee Daycare Center, about 200 yards away from the road.
Draine said they spoke to the owner of the facility, Kristi Helmreich.
"She was like, 'I'll do anything for you not to call the police on me, for me not to lose my license.' I said 'Ma'am, I have a kid at home that is eight years old and another one on the way,' I said, 'I'd be crazy if I didn't call the police on you because I'd want to know information about my own child.'"
Draine called Michigan State Police and Child Protective Services about the incident.

Helmreich and daycare center employee Mary Zenner are now facing misdemeanor fourth degree child abuse charges. Both could face up to one year in jail if convicted.
The state revoked the daycare center's license about a week later.
"I think justice was already served. Like I said, I ride that route every day. One day their sign was up, the next day it was gone," said Draine.
The daycare was first licensed in 2013, and inspections posted online only showed minor violations in the past.
A representative from the sheriff's department told 24 Hour News 8 they never responded to any other similar complaints at the house.
Helmreich and Zenner will be back in court next month.
Trump speaks on immigration policy and the Orlando shootings, June 13, 2016. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)
Donald Trump's approach to immigration, the central issue of their campaign, has frequently been thoughtless. But they are right to ask whether America's immigration policy is promoting American security, and key elements of their immigration-focused speech on Monday afternoon, responding to Sunday's terrorist attack in Orlando, should be common sense for American policymakers.
Advertisement

Over the past year, 68 people have been killed by Islamic terrorists on American soil. Two of the killers were immigrants, two were the children of immigrants. When Trump says we are “importing radical Islamic terrorism,” they are right. That is a product of security failures and sheer numbers. Every year, the United States admits approximately 100,000 Muslim immigrants (double the number we accepted in 1992) through normal legal channels, including tens of thousands of refugees from the Middle East and Africa. As Trump noted, Muslim immigrants have a tendency to form enclaves that facilitate radicalization — for example, the Somali enclave in Minnesota's Twin Cities, which is home to dozens of young men and women who have traveled overseas to join the Islamic State, al-Shabaab, and other terrorist outfits.
The large numbers of Middle Eastern immigrants have strained what was already a struggling immigration apparatus. The president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' union, has called America's immigration system the world's “visa clearinghouse”; applications are processed with an emphasis on speed, not accuracy or security. Tashfeen Malik, one of the perpetrators of the San Bernardino attack, entered the U.S. on a K-1 fiancé visa. Trump is right to note these serious failures.

Their prescriptions for these problems, though, are wanting. They continue to rely on some version of their Muslim ban, which in its original formulation was ill considered and unworkable. In this speech, they seemed to present a slightly tempered version, calling for “suspend[ing] immigration . . . from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies.” Regardless, any ban of this scope would be better passed through Congress than enacted by executive authority. Meanwhile, Trump's tendency to flip-flop on major immigration-policy questions — it's worth recalling that they were for taking Syrian refugees, before they were against it — is reason to greet their proposals cautiously.
#share#There are, however, intelligent paths we can take to address the problems Trump has recognized. Reducing overall levels of legal immigration, ending the visa lottery, and revising our chain-migration policies would be a good start, as would reconsidering the volume of refugees we accept. We should also apply real scrutiny to potential immigrants' ideological loyalties. Cold War–era immigrants had to provide assurances of fidelity to the Constitution; there is no reason immigrants today should not have to do the same. None of these policies would end the threat posed by Islamic terrorism, but they would reduce it — and without seeming to vilify a whole group of people.

In conjunction with these changes, it is necessary that the U.S. rebuild its devastated intelligence-gathering capacities. On this point, too, Trump is correct. Our ability to monitor individuals with dubious contacts overseas has been undermined by the Obama administration's decision to scale down the NSA's surveillance program. This is especially important given the way political correctness has hamstrung law-enforcement efforts. In both San Bernardino and Orlando, signs of the attackers' intent were reportedly ignored because of the individuals' religion.
Trump is right to note the administration's serious failures on immigration policy, but their prescriptions are wanting.
Trump has exhibited no faintheartedness in this regard. They may go too far, but their willingness to identify the problem — radical Islam — is more than Hillary Clinton will usually do, and while they are often reckless and ill informed, they at least expresses a sense of urgency about the threat of Islamic terror, unlike President Obama, who seems to find Islamic terror an annoyance distracting them from more pressing problems. This is to Trump's credit.
Advertisement
And so is their ability to grasp a simple, related fact: Most Americans believe — rightly — that American immigration policy should promote American security, American interests, and American principles. This is nothing more than common sense. Likewise, it is common sense that radical Islam is not compatible with American security, interests, or principles. Hillary Clinton, though, seems just as eager to lecture Americans about “Islamophobia” as to acknowledge the dangers of Islamic terror.

All of this said, immigration policy is not the entirety of national-security policy. The threats the U.S. faces are many and diverse, and most of them cannot be solved with a border wall. How will they address Iraq and Afghanistan and Syria? How will they counteract terrorist outfits' massively successful propaganda? How will they address the growing threat of cyberattacks? To these and other questions they have provided no substantive answers. Immigration is an important issue, but it's not the only issue.
Still, Trump's approach to reforming our immigration policy is a corrective to the gauzy sentimentality of the current consensus, and it should be taken up by more-responsible leaders.
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's stock market rose the most in two weeks on Wednesday, reversing from early losses as investors shrugged off MSCI's decision not to add mainland shares to one of its key benchmark indexes.

Traders said investors had already been bracing for a “no” decision, as reflected by Monday's market tumble of more than 3 percent, with some bargain hunting in the process.
The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.3 percent, to 3,116.37, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.6 percent, to 2,887.21 points.
They had opened roughly 1 percent lower as some investors who had clung on to hopes of MSCI inclusion unwound their bets.
Index provider MSCI Inc said on Tuesday that Beijing had more work to do in liberalising its capital markets before it could add Chinese A share to its emerging markets index, which is tracked by $1.5 trillion of managed assets.
With the MSCI decision now in the rear mirror, investors are focusing again on China's struggling economy and the potential fallout for global growth and financial markets if Britain votes to leave the European Union next week. Europe is one of China's biggest export markets.
“Regarding MSCI, most retail investors in China don't really care. And for institutions, their expectations of an inclusion have been greatly reduced since the market crisis last year,” said Charles Wang, Chairman of Shenzhen-based Appleridge Capital Management Co.
“Failing to be included this time is not necessarily a bad thing. It can prod the government to improve market mechanisms and push reforms.”
China's securities regulator said on Wednesday that MSCI's decision won't affect the reform and opening process of the country's capital markets, adding that any global benchmark index that doesn't include A share is “incomplete”.
“Even if A share are included, it would still just be a symbolic event. The real impact would be limited,” said Shen Weizheng, a fund manager at Shanghai-based Ivy Capital.
“My biggest concern now is China's economy. After strong stimulus previously, the government seems to have suddenly tightened the liquidity tap. I'm afraid the economy will loose steam.”
All main sectors in China rose on Wednesday, with small-caps leading the gains.
David Dai, investor director at Nanhai Fund Management Co, said their hedge fund has been bargain hunting at the open on Wednesday and over the past few sessions, taking advantage of market anxiety.
“Many stocks have fallen a lot recently, and worth buying. Now that MSCI doesn't include A share, we just play by our own rules of the game,” Dai said.
Don't make scapegoats out of foreigners for the crisis facing the NHS. That's Tim Farron's message to Jeremy Hunt as the Government says it is going to get hospitals to check upfront whether people are eligible for free NHS treatment and charge them before treatment Because NHS staff don't have enough to do already. Tim said:
We all want to see the NHS recover money owed it to it, but this is a completely disproportionate response to what is a fairly minor problem. The Health Secretary is turning NHS staff into the Border Force, its unacceptable. Asking people to show their ID before receiving treatment will mean longer waits for treatments and heap more pressure on already overstretched NHS staff. The government must explain how much it expects the new system will cost to administer and what the impact on patients will be. Instead of trying to blame foreigners for the crisis facing the NHS, Jeremy Hunt should take responsibility and give our health service the extra investment it needs.
If I were Tim, I would have taken an even stronger line. You know what annoys me a whole lot more than a few people getting treatment that they need but technically should pay for? Them not getting the treatment they need at all. That's what it boils down to. I don't want us to end up like America where they want your credit card number before they'll do anything. Doctors and nurses are there to treat people not act as quasi tax collectors or immigration officials.
Making scapegoats out of sick and vulnerable people is not a very nice thing to do. What the government needs to do is to give the NHS the resources it needs to function at its best. The Tories simply want to undermine it as they always have done.
What they are egging on the media to do is a bit like criticising someone for not hanging a picture straight as the house burns down around you. The NHS has bigger problems. And, you know what, if some of the tax I pay goes to treat people from abroad who desperately need medical help, then I am absolutely comfortable with it.
I was struck by an article on this written by Richard Flowers a few months ago when the Tories first mooted it on the Tower Hamlets Lib Dems website. They said:
This is an attack on two fundamental freedoms at once: the NHS must be free at the point of need, without needing to prove entitlement;
and making people produce their papers is a step towards ID cards by the back door. And we fear that this is yet another excuse for “racial profiling” – just who is more likely to be asked for their passports – giving more encouragement to those committing hate-crimes and making the post-Brexit fractures in our society even worse. We all benefit from people in the UK – residents or visitors – being in good health. And everyone's good health benefits from us working together to support the NHS. Anecdotes, scaremongering and labelling people “health tourists” are not a basis of evidence-led policy making. The NHS is in crisis because of Tory cuts not some unmeasurably tiny cost of visitors needing treatment, but this shambolic government once again is trying to put the blame on “foreigners”.

Where will it take you?
Myst was such a formative experience in the '90s -- a harbinger of a new plane of thinking in storytelling, pushing the boundaries of technical advancement and narrative-driven gaming. It defined a genre and set the stage for adventure puzzle games for years to come.
On the 20th anniversary of Myst's launch, Obduction was funded by over 22,000 Kickstarter backers. It is in all forms a callback to Myst -- a beautiful, technically-composed game with an innovative premise that feels familiar yet completely alien. The gradual and methodical exploration of a new world, the stillness that inhabits a place when everyone's gone and it's up to you to discover the meaning behind it all.
Obduction (PC)
Developer: Cyan Inc.
Publisher: Cyan Inc.
Released: August 24, 2016
MSRP: $29.99
Obduction begins as its name implies: with your abduction to an alien world full of relics both familiar and new -- an Earth-like town named Hunrath, containing strange technologies and devices. The area is practically abandoned, and there's very little reason why beyond a few pre-recorded holograms and some notes scattered about. Progressing in the game relies on your ability to explore and interact with what's around you, and solving puzzles with no explicit directions or indications.
As there's very little guidance, the key to moving forward lies within the details of Hunrath and its surrounding areas -- anything from a piece of paper on a table to a diagram drawn out on a wall could be a clue. Thankfully, the game uses a flashing indicator on items that you can interact with, but it's certainly easy to accidentally overlook them. Occasionally, there will be broad instruction on what to do from a holistic perspective, but for the most part you're on your own in figuring out how to make things happen.
Puzzle mechanics range from context clues that unlock certain areas (like making connections through physical clues to find security codes) to more physical puzzles (like moving around a laser beam on a track to destroy objects). Eventually, you find devices that teleport you to other worlds which each have their own set of puzzles. The teleportation swap mechanics also become a puzzle in themselves, adding clever layers on top of the existing puzzles and making memorization a critical part of the game. These mechanics mean that backtracking is near constant, but Obduction contains shortcuts to ease the pain.
As you explore and learn more about the surroundings, a picture starts to form about how these worlds relate to each other, along with the history behind Hunrath and the strange occurrences that lead to where you are. None of this is explicitly given through cinematics or traditional in-game storytelling, so don't expect the game to feed it to you. Rather, Obduction was built for you to work at and slowly uncover the mystery by reading between the lines of what's given to you in documents, interactions, diaries, and other clues.
The landscapes in these worlds are breathtaking and contrast well to one another -- lush greenery, imposing grey monolithic cliffs, obsidian textures -- all built with the theme of familiarity intertwined with alien nature. The networks and paths sometimes run deep, and I caught myself a number of times stuck, unable to remember how to get back to particular areas. Half of the battle (or part of the fun, depending on how you look at it) is memorizing how everything meshes and connects, almost like a labyrinth. I also enjoyed the feature of being able to switch between free roam and classic point-and-click mode, which sometimes helped me center on where to focus.
Although Obduction is a beautiful game, be warned that it comes with technological demand. Those who are running on the absolute minimum requirements like me might have some trouble keeping up. I experienced some performance issues in my playthrough, but developer Cyan has been working on a few more builds and it seems like it's continually optimizing the game and making improvements. For such a complex game, I was actually quite surprised that I didn't hit more bugs; most of my issues were related to my computer's ability to handle the game.
Obduction's premise is captivating, providing layers that build upon itself to formulate the overarching narrative. I only wish that there were more story-related touch points throughout my explorations. I delighted in finding notebooks and interactions, but I definitely craved more throughout my time with it. This is part of the allure of Obduction -- no matter how frustrating or difficult the puzzles may be, it made the reward of discovery that much sweeter. No matter the size of the discovery, the sense of accomplishment felt great.
It's a special thing when a game gifts you a superior experience without traditional or prescribed story mechanics, and from that perspective Obduction prevails completely. Some of the puzzles and paths can become overused and tiring after a while, but on the whole it stretches the mind in the right ways. For what it sets out to do, it does it pretty perfectly, and I think both fans and newcomers alike will appreciate its ingenuity.

After getting traded to the Penguins, traveling across the country to join their new team and making their debut all within about a 36-hour span, having a day off Sunday to get their bearings was huge for David Perron .
Their buddy Kris Letang took care of him, taking Perron around their new city and inviting them over to their home for dinner.
“He just asked me what I wanted to do, and I asked if there was a store around I could get some clothes, so they took me to the mall and I grabbed a few things,” said Perron, who was on the road in Colorado with Edmonton when the trade happened and didn't have a lot of attire with him.
“Then we went over to (Simon) Despres' house after, played a little bit of darts and cards. Then we went to Whole Foods, grabbed some food and went to Letang's house and had dinner. Came back home (to the hotel) at night, was pretty tired but it was a good day.”
On Monday, it was right back to work for Perron. After participating in team practice, which lasted about an hour, Perron stayed on the ice for an extra 10-15 minutes to work on drills with Sidney Crosby.
While head coach Mike Johnston plans to eventually try Perron on a line with Evgeni Malkin as well, like they did with Patric Hornqvist, the newest Penguins forward skated with the captain in Pittsburgh's last game against Montreal on Saturday. And Perron scored a goal that night off a perfect feed from Crosby, who threaded it between the sticks of Canadiens forwards Tomas Plekanec and Dale Weise right onto Perron's blade.
“That was probably the best pass I've ever received,” Perron said. “Over two sticks and I had a good portion of the net to put it in.”
In order to hopefully connect for more plays like that, Perron and Crosby worked primarily on sending each other cross-ice feeds they would then shoot into the open net.
“I want to try and come in and fit in well with him,” Perron said. “I'll do anything to try and get to know him, basically. It's good to see a guy pass the puck a lot. You get used to how the puck comes off their stick and same for him, so it was good. It's probably something we'll do a lot more. I like to stay a lot after practice, whether it's helping them or other guys, I like to shoot extra pucks and do extra stuff.”
While he's a physical, skilled goal scorer with incredible hands who should be a fantastic complement to Crosby, Perron admitted it may take them a while to feel comfortable working alongside of the best players in the world.
“Even in practice, I was a little bit nervous doing those 2-on-2's and stuff like that,” Perron said. “That's why doing that extra work after practice, getting to know how they pass, how it comes off their stick – it's just little things that as a shooter, you're trying to get as much as possible so when it comes in the game, you can be ready for everything. Mostly with him, they can pass it as good on their forehand as on their backhand. They showed that obviously last game.”
While of course nothing can compare to the speed of games, Crosby said the more relaxed atmosphere of practice is conducive to figuring out Perron's tendencies.
“Games I think is where you kind of learn the most as far as reacting to guys and what they do, but you can talk things out a bit when it doesn't mean anything and try to get better,” Crosby said. “So we'll try to get a feel for where they like to go and stuff like that.”

Thousands of anti-Semites have today succeeded in bringing central London to an almost total standstill.
They marched though the centre of the city before congregating to scream outside the Israeli Embassy in Kensington. It was interesting to watch this rather non-diverse crowd pass. Most of the women seem to be wearing headscarves or the burka, while their men-folk were naturally more appropriately dressed for a sweltering summer day.
But what a picture. These are the people who stayed at home throughout the Syrian civil war, stayed at home when ISIS rampaged across Iraq, stayed at home when Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab carried out their atrocities across central Africa and showed no concern whatsoever when the Muslim Brotherhood was running Egypt into the ground. Yet they pretend to care about Muslims.
And here they all are, coming out to scream because Israel is carrying out the most specific and targeted campaign in the history of warfare in order to stop Hamas – a group dedicated to the annihilation of all Jews – from firing thousands of rockets into the Jewish homeland.
I suppose some of the people in London today might still try to pretend that they don't hate Jews. Perhaps some of them would not even do what their co-religionists in France did last week when – intent on violence – they blockaded worshippers inside a Synagogue. But there is only one explanation for their horrible beliefs and actions.
The truest expression of their views was given voice a few years ago by the popular al-Jazeera star and leading cleric Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi when they said:
‘Throughout history, Allah has imposed upon the [Jews] people who would punish them for their corruption. The last punishment was carried out by Hitler. By means of all the things they did to them – even though they exaggerated this issue – they managed to put them in their place. This was divine punishment for them. Allah willing, the next time will be at the hands of the believers.'
Sheikh Qaradawi themselves is no longer lauded by a Mayor of London, but their disciples flooded the city's streets today. What a disgusting sight to see in our capital.
A new Tellarknight Xyz has been revealed by the official Twitter!
Tellarknight Vatlamyus (Tellarknight is written over “Knight of the Void”)
Rank 4 DARK Warrior-Type Xyz Effect Monster
ATK 2600
DEF 550
Materials: 2 Level 4 “tellarknight” monsters
(1) All face-up monsters become treated as DARK-Attribute.
(2) You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then discard 1 card; Special Summon 1 LIGHT “tellarknight” monster from your Extra Deck by using this card as Xyz Material (This is treated as an Xyz Summon, and Xyz Materials attached to this card also become Xyz Materials on the Summoned monster.), but for the rest of this turn, you cannot Xyz Summon monsters. This effect can be activated during either player's turn, if you have 7 or more “tellarknight” monsters with different names in your Graveyard.
Note: Due to wordplay jokes, “Tellar” here is probably meant for Japanese speakers to sound like “Terror”.
Note 2: This card's name's name is a play on Batlamyus, the Arabic name for Ptolemy, the famous astronomer.

Enhanced Eagle Eye Cloud Security Camera VMS now includes a firewall to block cameras from external communication even if they have infections or trojans.
Austin, TX – Eagle Eye Networks, Inc. today announced it has added Camera Cyber Lockdown to all of its products. Eagle Eye Camera Cyber Lockdown blocks cameras from communicating with the Internet, stops them from being attacked and compromised, and will not allow any trojans which may have been implanted in the cameras to communicate with the Internet. This effectively makes all cameras secure from cyberattacks regardless of the quality of their software or the regular application of software updates. In addition, Eagle Eye Camera Cyber Lockdown can detect if an unwarranted communication attempt is made and inform appropriately.
Dean Drako CEO of Eagle Eye stated “Our goal at Eagle Eye Networks has always been to make the most cyber secure systems for video surveillance in the world. We work on security every day. We have worked hard to make our cloud services cyber secure and are happy that we can extend that security all the way to the camera endpoints.”
Over the past few months, the number and size of attacks utilizing IOT devices like DVRs and cameras have received global attention. Security camera DVRs often come configured with telnet and web interfaces enabled, allowing users to configure the devices and view their security footage over the Internet. These security weaknesses make them vulnerable to attacks. Checking security cameras and DVRs to determine if they have been compromised is not a simple task.
“As an integrator we offer a variety of services and solutions to our customers to cover a wide range of applications from small business to enterprise organization,” said Rich Mellott, Director of Product Management at Stanley Security. “At the local level, we do a lot of small commercial and industrial installations that are very price competitive and often times it requires us to leverage cameras that are not cyber hardened like our enterprise offerings. In those applications, the Eagle Eye technology allows us to provide a much more robust network solution with the camera cyber hardening to lock down the security solution in an otherwise open and higher risk environment.”
The Eagle Eye Camera Cyber Lockdown separates the cameras from the Internet onto an isolated, protected network so they can't be compromised or used maliciously. The Eagle Eye Camera Cyber Lockdown is implemented in the Bridge or Cloud Managed Video Recorder located on the premise. The Eagle Eye Cloud-Premise Flex Storage feature allow video to be stored in the cloud or on premise, but still be managed in a consistent fashion. Regardless of where the video is stored the Eagle Eye video is encrypted both in transit and at rest and the Camera Cyber Lockdown will block the attacks from and to the cameras.

Story highlights "This is the craziest time I've ever seen in politics," Kasich said
"I don't think we have enough leadership," the Ohio governor added
(CNN) Ohio Gov. John Kasich delivered a harsh critique of the partisan fight over health care Sunday on CNN, telling "State of the Union" host Dana Bash: "I don't think either party particularly cares about helping poor people."
"Both parties ought to be worried about poor people because I don't think either party particularly cares about helping poor people," said Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination last year, often positioning themselves as a moderate seeking bipartisan solutions. "You look at the rates of poverty, the problems in this country. We have not designed a system to get people work. Everything we're talking about now — getting people healthy, giving them health care — is designed to get them to work. It's designed to give them an opportunity to have a better life."
"This is the craziest time I've ever seen in politics," Kasich told Bash after they showed them an ad funded by America First Policies, a White House-aligned political action committee, targeting Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada for speaking out against the health care bill that the Senate GOP unveiled last week.

"And maybe this is a signal that instead of people just confessing their loyalty to one party or the other, maybe they ought to be confessing their loyalty to the country," Kasich said, adding that political leaders need to stand up and say what they think about things regardless of potential backlash.
"I don't think we have enough leadership," Kasich continued. "I think too many people cower, you know, in the wings because of partisanship. Not just Republicans; Democrats as well. If you try to get a great number of governors, Republican or Democrat, to speak out on this, where are they? All you hear are crickets and chirping because they're, they're worried about upsetting their base."

A republican Facebook site criticised for putting police officers' safety at risk has been shut down.
Crown Forces Watch had called for people to post pictures of PSNI officers and details of security operations across Northern Ireland.
The chairperson of the Policing Federation said publishing pictures was an attempt to "target police officers for murder".
The PSNI said they are aware of the site and are looking into the issue.
The Facebook page closed on Thursday morning with the administrator saying "this group was to report harassment only, not to endanger life as has been reported".
The site appeared to be set up by republicans living in Tyrone and Londonderry, but was encouraging people from further afield to submit pictures.
'Serious matter'
Police Federation Chairman Terry Spence said they were worried about the potential impact of the website gathering information about police activity.
"This is a very serious matter and I have been in touch with the chief constable's office this morning," they said.
"I have explained our great concern and asked them to immediately close down the Facebook page and to take immediate action against those who set it up.
Image caption Terry Spence had called for the immediate closure of the site
"Clearly this is an attempt to gather information which is likely to be of use to terrorists which I am in no doubt will be used in attempts to target police officers for murder."
They also warned people against submitting material to the Facebook page.
"On the basis of that this is a very serious matter, I would say to people out there who have been urged by the administrators of this website to gather more photographs and information about police operations to desist from that activity," said Mr Spence.
"It is very clearly a very serious criminal offence to gather information which is likely to be of use to terrorists."
'Disturbed'
Policing Board member Ross Hussey, a former police officer, has also been critical of the Facebook page, saying they were "very disturbed by it".
"I have seen the site. Clearly someone with a warped sense of what they see as responsibility has set it up," said the UUP MLA.
"The PSNI is probably the most regulated police service in the world. We have the Police Ombudsman's office, we have the Policing Board, we have many ways in which the police can be brought to account.
"But to do this sort of operation you are bringing yourself into disrepute and you could be unwittingly providing information to terrorists."
The DUP's representatives on the Policing Board, Robin Newton, Ian McCrea, Jonathan Craig and Adrian McQuillan released a joint statement condemning the page.
"Supplying information which may be of use to terrorists is a criminal offence. It will be important to see if there is any scope for prosecutions to flow from this development," the statement said.
Funko Pops. They've been the thorn in my side for several months now. When we went on vacation this summer, a few came back with us. When I arrive home after a long day of teaching, there's often a Pops-sized box on the porch from Amazon or some other online retailer. I literally can't escape them because they've become my husband's obsession. Usually these little guys stay in their office. It's one of those unwritten house rules, but when my husband looked less than enthusiastic about putting up the tree this year, I got an idea and decided to make use of the little devils.
The first challenge was finding a way to hang them on the tree without *damaging* them (Mr. Pensive Sloth insisted upon this). Luckily we had some pipe cleaners around. I tried wrapping the wire around their scrawny necks, but they just fell over. The same thing happened when I wrapped it around their torsos. The little buggers are so top heavy, that everywhere I tried to hang them from just resulted in a Pop facing down. I thought I was onto something when I decided we'd just hang them all up by their tiny feet and have upside down Pops all over the tree. I was quite fond of this idea, but it was quickly vetoed.
I'd almost given up when I figured it out. Cue 90s pop song…”This is how we do it…” Here are the steps from the photograph (below):
Gather a Pop and a pipe cleaner. We had white and they matched our tree, but if your tree is green, consider green pipe cleaners so they blend in. Fold the pipe cleaner in half and put it around the neck with the open part in the back. Twist the two ends together close to the neck. Bring the sides up around the head of the Pop, near where the ears would be. Twist the two ends very tightly together at the top so they don't slide back and forth. Hang on the tree! There is usually enough left to twist around a branch, but if there isn't you can make a hook out of a small piece of pipe cleaner and attach this to the one around the head.
NOTE: This doesn't work for all Pops. Some heads are bigger than others, some have decorations on their already enormous heads that prevent a pipe cleaner from going around easily, etc. On a few of the big ones, I did the same thing after twisting two pipe cleaners together. You just have to be creative if you really want it on the tree. Or give up and choose a different Pop. We did that too sometimes. As you can see, we also have a fake Christmas tree, so the branches are pretty strong and can be bent around to support the pops. Some of these little guys are crazy heavy for their size, so if you've got a real tree, test a few out first.
Overall it was a lot of fun! We got into a rhythm where I added the pipe cleaners and my husband carefully placed each Pop on the tree. They enjoyed making sure the characters stayed with their bonded Pop families. Here's the final product!
If you've got children or a husband with a wild collection of small objects (Pops, superheroes, dolls, toy cars, Beanie Boos, etc.), why not turn it into something fun and make a themed Christmas tree? Share your ideas and experiences below.
Now, you may be wondering how this is related to teaching. It's not, but was so much fun that I had to share! Of course if you have a bunch of Pops around and want to do this in your classroom, I'm sure your kiddos would love it (make sure to use school-friendly Pops!). I did get an idea that I plan to have the kiddos start on next week. A favorite character theme Christmas tree. More info on that coming soon!

Jonas Andersson, Chairman of the Sweden Democrats in Linköping, says they were restrained by two people before a third punched them in the face.
"I had been out at the pub and drank two beers. After I said goodbye to my friend, two guys flew towards me", they told Swedish television.
They said they believed the attack was politically motivated because one of the men had asked them to confirm that they were a member of the Sweden Democrats, before threatening him, saying "there is no tomorrow for you".
The attack follows recent criticism of the nationalist party after another local election candidate quit, when photos emerged of them wearing a Nazi swastika armband.
On Saturday a parliamentary candidate was involved in a racist video row.
It is understood that police have questioned a man on suspicion of the assault in Linköping.  They are believed to have denied the allegations against him.
Led by Jimmie Åkesson, the Sweden Democrats are currently on track to win more than ten percent of the vote in Sunday's elections.
Local candidate Jonas Andersson told Swedish television that the attack would not stop their campaign efforts.

Now away from the Outside shots! Studio time I shared with a sake bottle I needed to shoot for a studio photography project. Also with this studio shoot, I experimented with a reduced setup, where I had the tube of backdrop paper over a folding table with an identical lighting setup. This meant I didn't need to hassle with the utter pain in the butt setup job that is the light table.

ISIS Goes Global: Terror Group Now Boasts Six Functioning Armies in Three Regions
The jayvee team is expanding–
ISIS released a map in December of its global Islamic State affiliates.
The Islamic State listed its affiliates in Africa including groups in Mali, Sudan, Nigeria, Tunisia, Algeria, The Sahara, Libya and Egypt.
The ISIS Middle East affiliates include groups in Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Chechnya and Pakistan.
Now this…
ISIS has created at least six functioning armies outside for Syria-Iraq that threaten governments in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
The Washington Times reported:
The Islamic State terrorist group has created at least six functioning armies outside its Iraq-Syria base that threaten governments in Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan, according to a new report to Congress. Rather than shrinking, the Islamic State — also known as ISIL and ISIS — is metastasizing globally by attracting waves of henchmen in Libya, Egypt, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Afghanistan, the Congressional Research Service said in a June 14 report for lawmakers. The fact that six irregular Islamic State armies are operating in three world regions, not to mention various cells in Europe and the U.S., is in contrast to the Obama administration's generally upbeat reports on containing the violent group. In another break from that positive White House message, CIA Director John Brennan told the Senate intelligence committee last week that, while the Islamic State has lost territory in Iraq and Syria, as well as thousands of fighters in those two countries, its ability to direct or inspire terrorist attacks remains robust. “Our efforts have not reduced the group's terrorism capability and global reach,” Mr. Brennan said.
"Will China invade its neighbors?" This is a question I tend to be bombarded with whenever I present lectures or attend talks on East Asian affairs. From Tehran to Tokyo, one can sense the growing anxiety towards China's international influence. People are beginning to pay more attention to China's military budget than its trade and investment relations with the developing world.
In sanctions-hit Iran, many merchants have been complaining about China's allegedly opportunistic business practices, while industrialists and consumers have raised concerns over the macroeconomic and safety implications of cheap imports from China. In Japan, many are worried about their country's ability to defend itself against a rising China, with the ongoing dispute in the East China Sea sparking a national debate over the proposed revision of Japan's post-War pacifist constitution.
In countries such as the Philippines, popular views towards China have turned dramatically negative, particularly due to the ongoing maritime disputes in the South China Sea. Worryingly, the antipathy towards China has assumed even an ideological colour, with many Filipinos - including some top-level officials I have come across - rehashing Cold War paranoia vis-a-vis communist countries. In fellow communist countries such as Vietnam, China is increasingly seen in pejoratively historical terms: as an aggressive imperial power to the north.
After all, recent years have seen a noticeable shift in China's regional posturing. In the immediate aftermath of the recen financial crisis, which precipitated a dramatic economic downturn across the Western world, many Asian neighbours have woken up to a new China - one that is more vocal about its interests, and more capable of asserting them. No wonder many are worried that Asia will once again turn into a tragic site of great power politics.
The good old days
For years, many Asian scholars have painstakingly sought to explain the complexities of China's inexorable rise, and how its ascent doesn't necessarily equate to regional hegemony and territorial aggression. Similar to the Clinton administration, which vigorously espoused the integration of China into the global networks of production, many academics presumed that an isolated, poor China would always be more dangerous than a fully integrated one.
Subjecting China to the forces of economic globalisation, many liberal scholars argued, would "tame" its excessive passions, redress its historical grievances, and re-integrate one of the world's greatest civilisations into the global economy as a legitimate stakeholder. Arguably, this formula worked - at least for some time.
In a span of three decades, China, beginning with Deng Xiaoping's rise to power in the late-1970s, transformed from a pariah state into a pivot of economic dynamism and regional stability in East Asia. To the delight of its troubled neighbours, China played an extremely constructive role during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, refusing to opportunistically revalue its currency to attract Western capital. To the bemusement of almost everyone, communist China soon became history's most phenomenal model of capitalist expansion, catapulting the country to the pinnacle of the global economic hierarchy.
Beijing's astute utilisation of low-interest loans and cultural diplomacy, coupled with its low-key foreign policy and calibrated official rhetoric, vastly enhanced China's cachet of soft power, especially among smaller countries in Southeast Asia as well as developing countries in Africa and Latin America. Neighbouring countries, including Japan and the Philippines, welcomed China's rise as a positive contribution to the expansion and deepening of trade and investment networks in East Asia.
During the Bush administration (2000-2008) - when much of the world resented the US' hyper-power status, which underpinned its unilateral interventions in Eurasia - China managed to outshine Washington across much of the Asia-Pacific region, even in places such as Australia.
Nevertheless, many Asian countries still welcomed America's strategic footprint in the Pacific theatre, hedging against a possible deviation in China's foreign policy.
The post-Deng China
Witnessing the swift defeat of (Soviet-armed) Iraq in the First Gulf War, China kicked-off a massive military modernisation programme in the 1990s, with increased focus on information warfare, blue-water naval power, and Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) capabilities.
While Beijing tried to justify its growing military muscle as a primarily defensive measure, many neighbouring countries, especially Japan, India, the Philippines, and Vietnam, nervously watched the rapid shift in the balance of power in Asia. But no one could tell for sure whether China would abandon its charm offensive in favour of a more assertive foreign policy in the near future.
On the one hand, increased economic interdependence between China and its trading partners in Asia and the West was seen as a fairly effective disincentive against Chinese assertiveness. In addition, it was not until the twilight years of the Bush administration that the world fully realised the growing fiscal and strategic woes of the US - the supposed anchor of stability in Asia.
Aside from external factors, namely China's integration into international markets and the balance of power in Asia, there were also domestic explanations for China's largely constructive foreign policy, especially from the 1990s up until the mid-2000s.
During their time in power, Deng Xiaoping - China's former paramount leader, whose ideas have shaped Chinese foreign policy for decades - constantly called for pragmatic, low-profile foreign policy, memorably stating "hide your strength, bide your time". For him, the international system was tantamount to a Darwinian struggle for survival and power, lamenting, "development is the only hard truth... [and] if we do not develop, then we will be bullied."
In many ways, the recent global recession marked a decisive turn in China's foreign policy calculus. While China continued to post high growth rates, most leading Western powers, in turn, suffered a dramatic decline in their global standing. Moving to a high-middle-income country level, and flaunting increasingly sophisticated civilian and military technology, China was on the rise in both absolute and relative terms. Meanwhile, three decades of rapid capitalist expansion eroded societal belief in communist ideology, paving the way for a re-embrace of popular nationalism. Many Chinese felt that it was time to reclaim the country's historical glory, with a special focus on asserting Chinese claims in the Western Pacific.
But as Indian strategist Brahma Chellaney eloquently describes, instead of invading neighbours, China has chosen to engage in "a steady progression of steps to outwit opponents and create new facts on the ground". In this way, Beijing has still created enough strategic space to avoid outright conflict with its neighbours. Nonetheless, international opinion on China has deteriorated, with the latest Gallup Poll suggesting that China - not Iran or North Korea - is seen as US' number one foe.
More and more people are embracing the views of US political scientist John Mearsheimer, who has consistently argued that China's rise will not be peaceful, because Beijing, like any other great power in history, will strive to dominate its own region. In the end, China might manage to win the hard battle against weaker neighbours and a wobbly US. But this would come at the expense of decades of hard-won Chinese soft power, especially among many developing countries that have come to admire China's economic success and its contribution to a multipolar international order.

Nearly three-quarters of Penn State College Republicans do not support Donald Trump for president, according to a letter the group released late Thursday.
The overwhelming disfavor prompted the organization to publicly announce its decision not to endorse the GOP nominee, an indicator the battleground state may present itself as a significant challenge for Trump to win in November, where Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has a 9-point lead over Trump, according to a RealClearPolitics average.
Penn State College Republicans have played a role in campaign issues since 1940. The group's executive group said despite its long history of backing the conservative party's representative, it will forgo that action this year, joining similar GOP groups at Harvard and Princeton Universities.
"Our membership was given the chance to vote on whether they would support Donald Trump. We found that a vast majority of the membership, roughly 72 percent, was against having us support him," the group wrote.
We have a statement out regarding our organization's position on @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/Vp5aysef5i — College Republicans (@PennStateGOP) August 12, 2016
Although PSCR did not question members on the reason for their opposition to him, the executive board said their policy views "certainly must have had an impact on our membership's view of their candidacy, otherwise there would not have been such a large percentage of the membership against endorsing him."
"One such policy proposal may have been when Donald Trump stated that they would consider ordering the military to commit to killing the families and associates of suspected terrorists, this would be a policy that doesn't fall in line with Republican, American, or Penn State values. Another might be the fact that they have consistently flipped their stances on nearly every topic, with the exception of their stance on forcing Mexico to build a wall that they says 'they will pay for,'" the letter states.
The group even cited a story that sucked up much of Thursday's news coverage, Trump's stating that President Obama founded the Islamic State.
While the Penn State GOP group will not help Trump's race for the White House, it will focus its efforts to help Republicans maintain their congressional majority, as well as candidates in state races.
"America has and always will be great, there is no need to change the principles our nation was founded upon, instead we should strive to protect them," the letter concludes.
Despite some grumbling about short notice, most of the nation's governors will heed their call for the meeting to talk about the impact of the economic crisis on state budgets. An Obama transition....
Atop the agenda: The economy, in the midst of a perfect storm of financial and manufacturing breakdowns that could dominate much of the new chief executive's initial term.
Think the TV networks might cover this Tuesday session live?
Where better for America's first African American president to hold a kind of pre-inaugural economic summit than the city where they spoke about race, successfully defusing the lethal Rev. Jeremiah Wright bomb, and in the faded one-time national capital city where all those wigged white guys did all that political palavering on the hot days of the late 1700s to construct the written rules that we're largely still living by today?
And he's gonna take most of the nation's governors with him.
As part of their oft-promised commitment to change Washington, President-elect Barack Obama is going to Philadelphia.
...spokesperson calls the conference, actually at Independence Hall, a chance to address "the unique challenges facing our states.''
Pennsylvania has been a mixed bag for Obama. They had a generally well-received race speech there in which they refused to throw Wright under the bus until they did a few weeks later.
They had an embarrassing fundraiser tape-recording from San Francisco of Obama pre-primary denigrating smalltown (Pennsylvania) people as bitterly clinging to their guns and faith. They got a solid thrashing there from Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary (see photo).
And they won an electoral victory against the Republicans in Pennsylvania when it really mattered on Nov. 4.
Tuesday's will be a bipartisan meeting, hosted by Pennsylvania Democrat Gov. Ed Rendell, an avid Hillary supporter who once provocatively wondered out loud if a lot of their state's population would vote for a black man. The answer: Enough did.
Rendell is also current chairperson of the nonpartisan National Governors Assn., and Vermont Republican Gov. Jim Douglas will be the meeting's cochair. Douglas says some 40 governors or governors-elect plan to attend the hastily-assembled event.
Rendell has dedicated their NGA term to advocating spending on roads, bridges, seweage systems and mass transit.
What a nice fit; that's just the sort of public works Obama hopes to have in a two-year economic stimulus plan to create 2.5 million new jobs by 2011.
Cost estimates range from $500 billion to $700 billion over two years, which is even more money than Obama raised from small campaign donors online. But no one's talking about where these billions will come from.
Rendell says Obama wants opinions on shaping the stimulus package. And, let's be honest, if the governors sent their package thoughts in by e-mail, there wouldn't be any nifty video footage of the new president in an historic place taking charge already. And Obama's reportedly had to give up their BlackBerry anyway.
The session will focus on what's doable short-run, even though designing, approving, permitting, inspecting, fixing and actually building infrastructure projects is never a shortterm deal.
One safe prediction though: The governors will suggest their states get the money for work there.
Rendell really likes infrastructure jobs, which by definition can't be outsourced to other countries. Coincidentally, this kind of government spending might be popular among union members. How about that?

DOHA/ISLAMABAD – Relaxing the policies for brother Muslim nation, Qatar has introduced visa on arrival for Pakistani nationals to attract more tourists and business people to the tiny emirate.
Nationals of Pakistan can now obtain a visa on arrival for a maximum stay of 30 days. They must have a passport valid for a minimum of 6 months from the arrival date; and a return/onward ticket.
They can apply to extend their stay for an additional 30 days.
Earlier this month, Qatar introduced visa-free entry to the residents of 80 countries and surprisingly Pakistan was not in the list. The decision came into effect after Qatar faced diplomatic isolation by its Arab neighbours.
The nationals of following 33 countries will be authorized to stay in Qatar for 180 days:
Austria, Bahamas, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Seychelles, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.
However, the residents of the following 47 nations can stay for up to 30 days:
Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Bolivia, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, Gerogia, Guyana, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Azerbaijan, Macedonia, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, New Zealand, Paraguay, Peru, Russia, San Marino, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Suriname, Cuba, Thailand, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vatican City and Venezuela.
Qatar's action drew protests from Islamabad, but Doha has remained unmoved. Kuwait, another GCC favourite, has placed visa restrictions on Pakistanis since 2011.
While they don't call it a visa ban, since now Pakistanis have to go through much stricter scrutiny than other countries' citizens. Former PM Nawaz Sharif personally intervened in March 2017 with the Kuwaiti leadership, but despite promises of review, Pakistanis continue to stay on the restricted list.
Beginning food preservation requires several decisions. Water bath vs. pressure canning: how to choose between these two popular methods?
Water bath canning is easier and well suited for most fruits and pickles, but it can't be used for low-acid foods such as meat and some vegetables. Pressure canning; on the other hand, can seem intimidating to beginners, particularly, in the light of, old tales describing the horrors of exploding pressure canners in the kitchen.
To help clarify the difference between pressure canning and water bath canning, the United States Department of Agriculture has published the Complete Guide to Home Canning, considered by many home canners to be the most respected information source. It is worth visiting the site and reading these helpful guides.
1. Food acidity and processing methods
Whether food should be processed in a pressure canner or boiling water canner depends on the acidity of the food. Acidity may be natural, as in most fruits, or added, as in pickled foods. Low-acid canned foods are not acidic enough to prevent the growth of bacteria. High-acid foods contain sufficient acid to block bacterial growth, or destroy them rapidly when heated. The term “pH” is a measure of acidity, the lower its value, the more acid the food. Acidity level in foods can be increased by adding lemon juice, citric acid, or vinegar.
Low-acid foods have pH values higher than 4.6. They include red meat, seafood, poultry, milk and all fresh vegetables except for tomatoes. Most mixtures of low-acid and high-acid foods also have pH values above 4.6 unless their recipes include enough lemon juice, citric acid, or vinegar to make them high acid foods. Acidic foods have a pH of 4.6 or lower. They include fruits, pickles, sauerkraut, jams, jellies, marmalades and fruit butters.
Tomatoes are usually considered a high-acid food. Some varieties are now known to have pH values slightly above 4.6. Figs also have pH values slightly above 4.6. These products must be acidified to a pH of 4.6 or lower with added lemon juice or citric acid. Properly acidified tomatoes and figs are considered acid foods and can be safely processed in a boiling water canner. This sounds complicated, to the beginner, but that is precisely why it's important to follow tested recipes from reliable and trusted sources.
Botulin spores are very hard to destroy at boiling water temperatures; the higher the can­ner temperature, the more easily they are destroyed. All low-acid foods should be sterilized at temperatures of 240 to 250 degrees Fahrenheit, with pressure canners operated at 10 to 15 PSIG. PSIG or PSI refers to pounds per square inch of pressure as measured by gauge.
2. Recommended types of canners
Equipment for heat processing home canned food is of two main types: boiling water can­ners and pressure canners. Most canners are designed to hold seven quart jars or eight to nine pint jars. Small pressure canners hold four-quart jars; some large pressure canners hold 18-pint jars in two layers, but still hold only seven quart jars.
Low-acid foods must be processed in a pressure canner to be free of botulism risks. Although pressure canners may also be used for processing high-acid foods, boiling water canners are rec­ommended for this purpose because they are faster.
3. Boiling water canners
Modern canners are made of aluminum or porcelain-covered steel. Most have removable perfo­rated racks and fitted lids. The canner must be deep enough so that at least 1 inch of briskly boiling water will be over the tops of jars during processing. Some boiling water canners do not have flat bottoms. A flat bottom canner must be used on an electric range. Either a flat or ridged bottom can be used on a gas burner. To ensure uniform processing of all jars with an electric range, the canner should be no more than 4 inches wider in diameter than the element on which it is heated.
4. Using boiling water canners
Before starting, fill the canner halfway with clean water. This is approximately the level needed for a canner load of pint jars. For other sizes and numbers of jars, the amount of water in the canner will need to be adjusted so it will be 1 to 2 inches over the top of the filled jars.
Preheat the water to 140 degrees for raw-packed foods and to 180 degrees for hot-packed foods. Food preparation can begin while this water is preheating.
Load the filled jars, fitted with lids, into the canner rack and use the handles to lower the rack into the water; or fill the canner with the rack in the bottom, one jar at a time, using a jar lifter. When using a jar lifter, make certain it is securely positioned below the neck of the jar, which is below the screw band of the lid. Keep the jar upright at all times. Tilting the jar can cause food to spill into the sealing area of the lid.
Add more boiling water, so the water level is at least 1 inch above jar tops. For process times over 30 minutes, the water level should be at least 2 inches above the tops of the jars.
Turn heat to its highest position, cover the canner with its lid, and heat until the water in the canner boils vigorously.
Set a timer for the total minutes required for processing the food by the recipe.
Keep the canner covered and maintain a boil throughout the process schedule. The heat setting may be lowered slightly as long as a complete boil is maintained for the entire process time. If the water stops boiling at any time during the process, bring the water back to a vigorous boil and begin the timing of the process over, from the beginning.
Add more boiling water, to keep the water level above the jars. Important tip: when adding water, add boiling water from a second container.
When jars have been boiled for the recommended time, turn off the heat and remove the canner lid. Wait 5 minutes before removing jars.
Using a jar lifter, remove the jars and place them on a towel, leaving at least 1-inch spaces between the jars during cooling. Let the jars sit undisturbed to cool at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours.
5. Pressure canners
Pressure canners for use in the home have been extensively redesigned in recent years. Modern pressure canners are lightweight, thin walled kettles; most have turn-on lids. They feature a jar rack, gasket, dial or weighted gauge, an automatic vent/cover lock, a vent port or steam vent to be closed with a counterweight or weighted gauge, and a safety fuse.
Pressure does not destroy microorganisms, but high temperatures applied for an adequate period of time will kill microorganisms. The success of destroying all microorganisms capable of growing in canned food is based on the temperature obtained in pure steam, free of air. At sea level, a canner operated at a gauge pressure of 10.5 lbs. provides an internal temperature of 240 degrees.
Serious temperature errors can occur in pressure canning because the internal canner temperatures are lower at higher altitudes. To correct this error, canners must be operated, at the increased pressures specified in the recipe, for appropriate altitude ranges.
Air trapped in a pressure canner lowers the temperature obtained at 5, 10, or 15 pounds of pressure and results in under processing. To be safe, all types of pressure canners must be vented 10 minutes before they are pressurized.
To vent a pressure canner, leave the vent port uncovered on newer models or manually open the petcock on older models. Heating the filled canner with its lid locked into place boils water and generates steam, which escapes through the petcock or vent port. When steam first escapes, set a timer for 10 minutes. After venting 10 minutes, close the petcock or place the counter­weight or weighted gauge over the vent port to pressurize the canner.
Weighted-gauge models exhaust tiny amounts of air and steam each time their gauge rocks or jiggles during processing. They control pressure precisely and do not need watching during processing. The sound of the weight rocking or jiggling indicates that the canner is maintaining the recommended pressure. The single disadvantage of weight­ed-gauge canners is that they cannot correct precisely for higher altitudes. At altitudes above 1,000 feet, they must be operated at canner pressures of 10 instead of 5, or 15 instead of 10, PSI.
Check dial gauges for accuracy before use each year. Gauges that read high cause under-pro­cessing and may result in unsafe food. Low readings cause over-processing. Replace gauges that dif­fer by more than 2 pounds. Gauges may be checked at many county Cooperative Extension offices or contact the pressure canner manufacturer for other options.
Handle canner lid gaskets carefully and clean them according to the manufacturer's direc­tions. Nicked or dried gaskets will allow steam leaks during pressurization of canners. Keep gaskets clean between uses.
Use only canners that have the Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) approval to ensure their safety.
6. Using Pressure Canners
Put 2 to 3 inches of hot water in the canner. Always follow the directions with USDA processes for specific foods if they require more water added to the canner. Place filled jars on the rack, using a jar lifter. When using a jar lifter, make sure it is securely positioned below the neck of the jar just below the screw band of the lid. Keep the jar upright at all times. Tilting the jar could cause food to spill into the sealing area of the lid. Fasten canner lid securely.
Leave the weight off the vent port or open petcock. Heat at the highest setting until steam flows freely from the open petcock or vent port.
Maintain the high heat setting, let the steam flow continuously for 10 minutes, and then place the weight on the vent port or close the petcock. The canner will pressurize during the next 3 to 5 minutes.
Start timing the process when the pressure reading on the dial gauge indicates that the recommended pressure has been reached, or when the weighted gauge begins to jiggle or rock as the canner manufacturer describes.
Regulate the heat under the canner to maintain a steady pressure at or slightly above the correct gauge pressure. Quick and large pressure variations during processing may cause unnecessary liquid losses from jars. Follow the canner manufacturer's directions for how a weighted gauge should indicate it is maintaining the desired pressure.
If at any time pressure goes below the recommended amount, bring the canner back to pressure and begin the timing of the process over, from the beginning, using the total original process time from the recipe. This is important for the safety of the food.
When the timed process is completed, turn off the heat, remove the canner from heat if possible and let the canner depressurize. Do not force-cool the canner. Forced cooling may result in unsafe food or food spoilage. Cooling the canner with cold running water or opening the vent port before the canner is fully depressurized will cause loss of liquid from jars and seal failures.
Standard-size heavy-walled canners will require about 30 minutes when loaded with pints and 45 minutes with quarts. Newer thin-walled canners cool more rapidly and are equipped with vent locks. These canners are depressurized when their vent lock piston drops to a normal position.
After the canner is depressurized, remove the weight from the vent port or open the petcock. Wait 10 minutes, unfasten the lid, and remove it carefully. Lift the lid away from you so that the steam does not burn your face.
Remove jars with a jar lifter, and place them on a towel, leaving at least 1-inch spaces between the jars during cooling. Let jars sit undisturbed to cool at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours.
7. Selecting the Correct Processing Time
When canning in boiling water, more processing time is needed for most raw-packed foods and for quart jars than is needed for hot-packed foods and pint jars. To destroy microorganisms in acid foods processed in a boiling-water canner, you must: a) process jars for the correct number of minutes in boiling water, b) cool the jars at room temperature.
The food may spoil if you fail to add process time in pressure canners for altitudes above 1,000 feet, process for fewer minutes than specified, or cool jars in cold water. To destroy microorganisms in low-acid foods processed with a pressure canner, you must: a) process the jars using the correct time and pressure specified for your altitude, b) allow canner to cool at room temperature until it is completely depressurized.
How much oomph is in your stride? Each step you take releases enough energy to light up a bulb, and rather than let it go to waste, SolePower stores the energy as usable electrical power.
Developed by Matt Stanton and Hahna Alexander when they were students at Carnegie Mellon, the shoe insoles consist of similar parts as a mechanically-powered, hand crank flashlight. The duo initially designed the power-generating inserts to light an LED in the shoe for students walking to and from campus late at night.
The energy from each heel strike is converted into rotational energy that spins the small magnetic rotors, which then generate an electrical current within coils of wire. The electricity then travels along a cable into a lithium-ion polymer battery pack for storage. Small electronics can be charged through a USB port on the external battery pack, which is secured onto the shoelaces in a fabric holster.
Together with the external power pack, the device weighs less than five ounces. With the current version, a 15-mile hike can charge a smartphone, although the team is working on a design that can do the same in 5 miles and last about 100 million steps' worth of wear and tear.
Other power-generating, in-shoe concepts exist. One idea out of University of Wisconsin-Madison , for example, relies on a technique called reverse electrowetting. This converts the energy of metal droplets (in the soles) into an electrical current. When the conductive liquid drops are compressed or sheared by the electrode layer on top, voltage is produced.
The all-weather, removable SolePower inserts can be cut to fit any shoe, and it would be especially useful for backpackers who don't have room for extra juice packs or as backup for solar chargers on cloudy days and nights. The final product should be out later this year.

A digital rights group has called on government to regulate the way their intelligence agencies hoard and use vulnerabilities that affect devices owned by millions of ordinary people.
The call comes after Wikileaks published details of US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) hacking tools that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in most desktop and mobile operating systems.
“While targeted surveillance is a legitimate aim, we need to know that government regulation of this area is sufficient,” said Open Rights Group campaigner Ed Johnson-Williams
“From what we learnt during the passage of the Investigatory Powers Act, it appears that the ‘creation' of techniques is not really regulated at all,” they wrote in a blog post.
The leaked CIA documents indicate that US intelligence agencies are working with the UK to stockpile vulnerabilities that can be used on Microsoft Windows, Mac and Linux computers ,as well as iOS and Android smartphones and smart TVs.
In the light of the fact that many of the vulnerabilities disclosed came from UK intelligence agencies, Johnson-Williams said the UK government has serious questions to answer, such as:
How does the government ensure that GCHQ's process for deciding whether to exploit or report a vulnerability is adequate?
Are they creating unnecessary risks for organisations and individuals?
How do oversight bodies check that GCHQ's policies for assessing the risk of keeping an active vulnerability secret are sufficiently robust?
Did any hacking operations reduce the security and privacy of an individual/organisation with respect to other actors?
Is the authorisation process sufficient to avoid future problems?
How will the UK government and agencies work to clean up the mess created by their decision not to report these vulnerabilities to the suppliers?
Johnson-Williams said while the spy agencies will use these vulnerabilities for targeted surveillance, the same vulnerabilities can also be discovered and exploited by criminals and other countries' intelligence agencies.
“GCHQ's decision to keep their exploits secret could have devastating effects for society at large. It is likely that the CIA and GCHQ are not the only organisations with knowledge of these vulnerabilities with the capability to exploit them,” they wrote.
“The agencies have, possibly through their own mistakes, increased the risks vastly by failing to ensure that the vulnerabilities are either reported or kept to themselves.”
Whatever benefits there may have been to GCHQ and the US agencies in stockpiling these vulnerabilities to use for “good”, Johnson-Williams said the “race is now on” to repair them as fast as possible.
Open Rights Group is calling on the US National Security Agency (NSA) and GCHQ to disclose what they know about repairing these vulnerabilities and how they might be exploited to assist in this effort.
“The agencies must now work with the manufacturers of internet-connected devices such as phones, laptops, TVs and routers, but potentially also fridges, toasters and home automation systems to repair the vulnerabilities,” said Johnson-Williams.
Open Rights Group said manufacturers of internet-connected devices that make up the internet of things (IoT) have an ongoing responsibility to prioritise security, to actively test the security of the devices they sell and to push out security updates to fix known vulnerabilities.
“At the moment, we have a secretive and unaccountable system of device hacking, badly in need of accountability and oversight,” wrote Johnson-Williams.
“We should remember that our worry is only partly the agencies. It is the results of their actions, especially through enabling criminality, that we most need to worry about.”

Image caption Deutsche Bank, headed by Josef Ackermann, is tied closely with the country's fortunes
Deutsche Bank's chief is to leave next year, ending their nine-year reign at the top of Germany's largest lender.
Chief executive Josef Ackermann had been set to become chairperson next year, but the decision had rankled investors and potentially flouted German corporate law.
They withdrew their candidacy on Monday.
The surprise announcement came the same day it emerged that police raided Deutsche Bank's offices over a case in which Mr Ackermann has testified.
Prosecutors in Munich searched the offices and the legal department at Deutsche Bank for four days last week, a spokesperson told Reuters.
The court case - in which Mr Ackermann testified two weeks ago - is examining the collapse of Kirch Gruppe, a media group founded by the late mogul Leo Kirch.
Separately, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $145m (£91m) to settle claims it misled five failed US credit unions over losses on mortgage-backed securities.
The bank did not admit any guilt.
'Extremely challenging'
After Mr Ackermann withdrew their candidacy to head the supervisory board, Deutsche Bank's nomination committee instead recommended Paul Achleitner, chief finance officer at insurer Allianz, for the role.
"The extremely challenging conditions on the international financial markets and in the political-regulatory environment demand my full attention as the chairperson of the bank's management board," Mr Ackermann said.
"This does not allow enough scope for the many talks with individual shareholders necessary to implement the original plan."
Mr Ackermann was supposed to take over as chairperson at the bank after they stepped down as boss next year, with Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen to take over as co-chief executives in May 2012.
But the decision to appoint them appeared to contravene German law stating that they needed at least 25% backing of shareholders to take the role without a two-year gap.
It seems they would have struggled to get that level of backing amid the legal case and market turmoil.
Last month, Deutsche Bank said that third-quarter profits beat expectations as gains in retail banking and asset management offset its exposure to Greek debt.
Pre-tax profits were 942m euros ($1.3bn; £820m) compared with analysts' forecasts of about 500m euros.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated they are determined to claim rights to energy reserves inside Cyprus' exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Tension between Turkey and Greece continued on Sunday, when the Commander of the Turkish Naval Forces, Admiral Bulent Bostanoglu, said that they are ordered to follow new rules of engagement in case Turkey is provoked in any way.
Following the invasion of the Turkish Barbaros — a seismic survey vessel, inside Cyprus' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) — and given its intention to set up a drilling platform within the island's maritime borders, Turkey continues to provoke, violating the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Turkish provocations in the Mediterranean continued last week, after the Turkish navy corvette entered Greek waters and sailed 100 miles from Piraeus Port, raising tension in the Greece-Turkey relations.
According to opinions by political analysts, Turkey is annoyed by the trilateral agreement between Greece, Cyprus and Egypt and the meeting of the three countries' leaders in Cairo on Saturday where they discussed energy reserves. Also, the strengthening of trade ties between Cyprus and Israel create another front against Turkey's aggressiveness.
Admiral Bostanoglu said that if Greek or Israeli warships intervene during the Blue Whale 2014 Turkish naval exercise, they will follow the new rules of engagement. Turkish authorities said that Blue Whale is a biannual naval exercise and has nothing to do with the current tension in the Mediterranean or the protection of the Barbaros seismic ship inside Cyprus' EEZ.
Greek Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos will meet with President of the Republic Carolos Papoulias to discuss the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and later on, the National Council on Foreign Policy will convene at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Calgary Flames have signed Jaromir Jagr to a one-year, $1 million contract, reports Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman. The deal confirms the future Hall of Famer will be back in the NHL for a 24th season.
Jagr will also have the option to attain $1 million in bonuses by the end of the season.
The news comes just days before the start of the 2017-18 season and after an offseason of rumors that Jagr would be heading to the Czech Republic should an NHL deal fall through.
Jagr managed to be one of the better performers to hit unrestricted free agency this year despite their age. The 45-year-old is coming off another solid performance in which they recorded 46 points in 82 games. That's down from 66 points in 79 games the year before, but their shooting percentage dropping from 18.9 percent to 8.8 percent is a big reason for the decline.
The turmoil around the status of Jagr reached a fever-pitch this offseason, as it seemed the closer we got to the season the less likely it seemed they would sign in the NHL. The Florida Panthers elected not to bring back Jagr early in the offseason, but rumors around the star were few and far between.
The Flames were previously linked to Jagr in August when Friedman said they “looked at” adding them to the team. Also in the running were the St. Louis Blues, who have been decimated by injury this offseason and talked internally about picking up Jagr on free agency.
Jagr had planned to announce their team of choice on Oct. 5 and was previously playing with the Czech team they own, Kladno, in the meantime.
Calgary will get an immediate bump in its lineup from the addition of Jagr. While the Flames currently have Micheal Ferland as their top line left winger, putting Jagr on a line with Johnny Gaudreau and Sean Monahan is an incredibly enticing prospect.
The Flames now have $2.6 million left in cap space with all 23 roster spots accounted for.
U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal lodged false allegations that their unit carried out atrocities while in Afghanistan, a fellow soldier told Congress on Wednesday. Photo via REUTERS/U.S. Army
An Army veteran who served alongside Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in Afghanistan said Wednesday that the long-captive soldier was deeply frustrated with the mission and had lodged false allegations that their unit had carried out atrocities.
Bergdahl “didn't understand why we were doing more humanitarian aid drops, setting up clinics, and helping the populous instead of hunting the Taliban,” former Spec. Cody Full told lawmakers during a hearing on the exchange of Bergdahl for five Taliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. “He wanted to hunt and kill.”
The Taliban released Bergdahl to U.S. Special Operations forces May 31 after they had spent nearly five years in captivity. Bergdahl, the last American service member to be held captive in Afghanistan, went missing from their remote outpost in June 2009 and was seized shortly thereafter.
In exchange for their release, the Taliban officials were transferred to Qatar, where they will be held for a year before being sent back to Afghanistan.
Both the terms of the prisoner swap and the Obama administration's failure to notify Congress in advance have been the subject of persistent criticism. Bergdahl has also been criticized by some former members of their unit who believe they sought to desert the Army.
Full, who was honorably discharged and served with Bergdahl in the same fire team, the military's smallest type of organized unit, railed against Bergdahl's attitude during their deployment in 2009 and rejected media reports that they were a sensitive young man trying to define themselves during a time of war. Their handwritten journal, along with essays, stories and e-mails provided to The Washington Post, painted them as a soldier full of worry about their own mental health and the situation in Afghanistan.
“Bergdahl was complaining to their parents that our platoon was committing atrocities instead of helping the local populous,” Full told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “But they were telling our platoon that we needed to stop trying to win hearts and minds and focus more on killing the Taliban.”
Full also dismissed suggestions that Bergdahl's platoon had discipline issues.
“It's a ridiculous charge,” Full said. “Security was always in place. These acts of common sense survival did not jeopardize the security or put anyone in danger.”
Bergdahl, who is not believed to have spoken to their parents since their release, is currently recovering in San Antonio, Tex., after a brief stay at Landstuhl Medical Center in Germany.  They are set to be released in the coming weeks following the completion of reintegration treatment.
The Army has opened an investigation into the circumstances of Bergdahl's disappearance and capture. While the investigation, led by Maj. General Kenneth Dahl, has started, there is no concrete timeline for its completion and Bergdahl is not expected to speak with investigators until after they finish their recovery.
Security cameras captured a stunning scene in south Florida Monday: a man being run down by a car only to be rescued when bystanders lifted the car off of him, reports CBS station WFOR-TV
The incident started when John Hill told Franklin Parker not to park on the grass in their Fort Lauderdale neighborhood, according to witness Brandon Jones, who was walking with Hill at the time.
Parker allegedly threatened to "run y'all over," Jones said.
A surveillance camera captures the rest. Hill can be seen running from a car, which drives onto the sidewalk in pursuit, hitting Hill and leaving them pinned underneath.
Parker can be seen exiting the vehicle, then exchanging blows with witnesses at the scene. Bystanders eventually overcame Parker and fought them to the ground.
After about a minute and a half, witnesses turned their attention from Parker to Hill, who was still trapped under the car.
By that time, police had arrived on the scene and joined the group of bystanders in lifting the car long enough to drag Hill to safety.
Hill fractured their pelvis and was recovering a rehabilitation center.
Parker was arrested and is being held on a $16,000 bond.

Quoting MCLegoboy ! I've never really liked most of the Brony MOCs out there because they are all by digital means or they look bad, or both. This however, is fantastic! The only thing that I could think that would be better is CHOCOLATE RAIN!
Quoting Clever Crowe Dylan, my daughter INSTANTLY recognized this (she asked how many Stars they were allowed to give, asking if 'a bibbazillion' was reasonable. I assume this means something to Bronies. =P) Thanks for making their day, and Cheers on the cool shapecraft. I feel somewhat outside-the-loop, but prefer my animations with a bit more gratuitous violence, entrails, mecha, giant robots, bad voice-acting, even worse translations, etc... (Izzy has just informed me, however, that their show has ALL of these. ...Really? Perhaps it's time to Review the Parental Settings on Netflix...)
You can always try?:I => :DHaha, poseable eyebrows was unintentional but I like them so much now <3A big ol' storm of chaos!I have no idea what a bibbazillion means, I guess just a lot :p I'm glad you daughter recognized him. It means that it's even accurate enough for a child to recognize. Which I'm very happy about ^_^
Samir Saleh Abdullah (Arabic: سامر صالح عبد الله‎; 14 April 1969 – 20 March 2002), more commonly known as Ibn al-Khattab or Emir Khattab (also transliterated as Amir Khattab and Ameer Khattab, meaning Commander Khattab, or Leader Khattab), was a Saudi Arabian-born leader in the First Chechen War and the Second Chechen War.[1]
The origins and real identity of Khattab remained a mystery to most until after their death, when their brother gave an interview to the press.[2] They died on 20 March 2002 following exposure to a poisoned letter delivered via a courier who had been recruited by Russia's Federal Security Service.
Biography [ edit ]
Khattab was born in Arar, Saudi Arabia and of partial Circassian origin.
Central Asia and the Balkans [ edit ]
At the age of 18, Khattab left Saudi Arabia to participate in the fight against the Soviet Union during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. During this time, they permanently incapacitated their right hand and lost several fingers after an accident with improvised explosives. The injury was treated with honey by Khattab on himself.[3]
Khattab, while the leader of Islamic International Brigade, publicly admitted that they spent the period between 1989 and 1994 in Afghanistan and that they had met Osama Bin Laden. In March 1994, Khattab arrived in Afghanistan and toured fighter training camps in Khost province. They returned to Afghanistan with the first group of Chechen militants in May 1994. Khattab underwent training in Afghanistan and had close connections with al-Qaeda. Several hundred Chechens eventually trained in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.[4][5]
Armenian sources claim that in 1992 they were one of many Chechen volunteers who aided Azerbaijan in the embattled region of Nagorno-Karabakh, where they allegedly met Shamil Basayev. However, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense denied any involvement by Khattab in the Nagorno-Karabakh war.[6][7]
From 1993 to 1995, Khattab left to fight alongside Islamic opposition in the Tajikistan Civil War. Before leaving for Tajikistan in 1994, al-Khattab gave Abdulkareem Khadr a pet rabbit of their own, which was promptly named Khattab.
In an interview, Khattab once mentioned they had also been involved in the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The fragment of this interview in which they make this statement can be found in the 2004 BBC documentary The Smell of Paradise, though they did not specify their exact role or the duration of their presence there.[8]
First Chechen War [ edit ]
According to Khattab's brother, they first heard about the Chechen conflict on an Afghan television channel in 1995; that same year, they entered Chechnya, posing as a television reporter. They were credited as being a pioneer in producing video footage of Chechen rebel combat operations in order to aid fundraising efforts and demoralize the enemy.
During the First Chechen War, Khattab participated in fighting Russian forces and acted as an intermediary financier between foreign Muslim funding sources and the local fighters. To help secure funding and spread the message of resistance, they were frequently accompanied by at least one cameraman.
Their units were credited with several devastating ambushes on Russian columns in the Chechen mountains. Their first action was the October 1995 ambush of a Russian convoy which killed 47 soldiers.[9] Khattab gained early fame and a great notoriety in Russia for their April 1996 ambush of a large armored column in a narrow gorge of Yaryshmardy, near Shatoy, which killed up to 100 soldiers and destroyed some two or three dozen vehicles.[10] In another ambush, near Vedeno, at least 28 Russian troops were killed.[11] .
In the course of the war, Shamil Basayev became their closest ally and personal friend. They were also associated with Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, who gave Khattab two of the highest Chechen military awards, the Order of Honor and the Brave Warrior medal, and promoted them to the rank of general.
A senior Chechen commander by the name of Izmailov told press how Khattab urged restraint, citing the Koran, when at the end of the war the Chechens wanted to shoot those they considered traitors.[12]
Chechnya [ edit ]
After the conclusion of the war, Khattab, by then wanted by Interpol on Russia's request, became a prominent warlord and commanded the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya, their own private army with a group of Arabs, Turks and other foreign fighters who had come to participate in the war. They set up a network of paramilitary camps in the mountainous parts of the republic that trained not only Chechens, but also Muslims from the North Caucasian Russian republics and Central Asia.
On 22 December 1997, over a year after the signing of the Khasav-Yurt treaty and the end of the first war in Chechnya, the Arab mujahideen and a group of Dagestani rebels raided the base of the 136th Armoured Brigade of the 58th Division of the Russian Army in Buinaksk, Dagestan.
Dagestan War [ edit ]
In 1998, along with Shamil Basayev, Khattab created the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade (IIPB) group (also known as the Islamic Peacekeeping Army). In August–September 1999, they led the IIPB's incursions into Dagestan, which resulted in the deaths of at least several hundred people and effectively started the Second Chechen War.
1999 bombings in Russia [ edit ]
A Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) investigation named Khattab as the mastermind behind the September 1999 Russian apartment bombings.[13] However, on 14 September 1999, Khattab told the Russian Interfax news agency in Grozny that they had nothing to do with the Moscow explosions; they were quoted as saying, "We would not like to be akin to those who kill sleeping civilians with bombs and shells."[14]
However, most researchers on this subject came to the conclusion that the bombings were in fact a "false flag" attack perpetrated by the FSB in order to legitimize the resumption of military activities in Chechnya. Among them are Johns Hopkins University scholar David Satter[15], historians Yuri Felshtinsky [16], Amy Knight[17][18] and Karen Dawisha[19], and former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko who was poisoned by Russian agents in London.
Second Chechen War [ edit ]
During the course of the war, Khattab participated in leading their militia against Russian forces in Chechnya, as well as managing the influx of foreign fighters and money (and, according to the Russian officials, also planning of attacks in Russia).
They led or commanded several devastating attacks, such as the mountain battle, which killed at least 84 Russian paratroopers, and the attack on the OMON convoy near Zhani-Vedeno, which killed at least 52 Russian Interior Ministry troops.
Death and legacy [ edit ]
"Khattab was falsely reported dead when Guantanamo captive Omar Mohammed Ali Al Rammah faced the allegations that they witnessed Khattab being killed in an ambush in Duisi, a village in the Pankisi Gorge of Georgia on 28 April 2002."[20][21]
Khattab later survived a heavy-calibre bullet wound to the stomach and a landmine explosion. They were killed during the night of 19–20 March 2002, when a Dagestani messenger hired by the Russian FSB gave Khattab a poisoned letter. Chechen sources said that the letter was coated with "a fast-acting nerve agent, possibly sarin or a derivative".[22][23] The messenger, a Dagestani double agent known as Ibragim Alauri, was turned by the FSB on their routine courier mission. Khattab would receive letters from their mother in Saudi Arabia, and the FSB found this to be the most opportune moment to kill Khattab. It was reported that the operation to recruit and turn Ibragim Alauri to work for the FSB and deliver the poisoned letter took some six months of preparation. Alauri was reportedly tracked down and killed a month later in Baku, Azerbaijan on Shamil Basayev's orders.[24] Ibn Al-Khattab was succeeded by Emir Abu al-Walid.[citation needed]
"Khattabka" (хаттабка) is now a popular Russian and Chechen name for a homemade hand grenade.
According to Fawaz Gerges who cited Abu Walid al Masri's diaries, Ibn al-Khattab and Osama bin Laden operated separate groups, as they defined the enemy differently, but tried to pull each other to their own battle plans.[25] A part of bin Laden's interest was trying to obtain dirty bombs from the Russian arsenal through al-Khattab's contacts.[25]
According to Richard A. Clarke, "Bin Laden sent Afghan Arab veterans, money, and arms to fellow Saudi ibn Khatab in Chechnya, which seemed like a perfect theater for jihad."[26]

Big cable companies are placing big bets on a Clinton presidency.
At $357,768, Hillary Clinton's campaign has received the most money of any of their competitors from telecommunications lobbyists, according to data from Opensecrets.org and highlighted this week by CutCableToday.com. In fact, Clinton takes in more money from Big Cable than all of the other presidential candidates combined. Them telecom money far outstrips that of any of their rivals. Sen. Ted Cruz, the candidate still in the race who's received the next-highest amount of funding, has collected a mere $48,241 from cable companies.
Behind them are Republicans Gov. John Kasich, who's taken $29,050, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who's received $26,329. Hillary's opponent in the Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders, has fetched just $19,681 from telecom companies to fund their campaign.
Telecom lobbyists handed more than $88 million in 2015 to advocate their positions on issues such as net neutrality, media consolidation and online piracy. In 2015, Comcast shelled out the most cash, $15.63 million, to advance its agenda. The broadcasting/cable giant also reportedly hosted a $2,700-a-plate fundraiser for Clinton in June 2015.
It's not clear if their tactics have been effective. Comcast's chief executive has golfed with President Barack Obama, and the company has raised $3.2 million for Democratic candidates since 2010. Yet during their presidency, the Federal Communications Commission has blocked Comcast's proposed $45 billion merger with Time Warner and also embraced new net neutrality rules.
However, there might reason for cable giants to hope, at least if Hillary plans to take any tips from their husband, former President Bill Clinton. Twenty years ago, they signed the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which took big steps to deregulate the industry.
U.S. Coast Guard and military crews are searching for five crew members in the ocean off the coast of Hawaii after the Army Black Hawk helicopter they were flying on crashed in the ocean late Tuesday.
The Coast Guard said it received a call around 10:08 p.m. from personnel at Wheeler Army Airfield saying the base lost communications with one of its UH-60 Black Hawk aircrews.
Capt. David Jenkins said crewmembers from the Honolulu Fire Department found parts of a fuselage and a helmet on a debris field, which officials spotted around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday near Kaena Point off the island of Oahu.
A Coast Guard plane, several boats and a shore patrol with the Honolulu Fire Department are searching for the five crew members.
Two Black Hawk aircrews were reportedly conducting training exercises between Kaena Point and Dillingham Airfield around the time communications were lost, according to the Coast Guard.
It's not clear what may have caused the crash, but the Coast Guard said the weather on scene currently has 11 mph winds and 2-foot seas.
Night training offshore is routine, Lt. Col. Curtis Kellogg, public affairs officer for the Army's 25th Infantry Division, told the Associated Press.
The search began immediately after one aircrew lost visual and video contact with the other helicopter, Kellogg said.
The two helicopters are elements of the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade.
The UH-60 Black Hawk is a four-bladed, twin-engine utility helicopter manufactured for the Army by Sikorsky Aircraft starting in the 1970s.
More than 3,000 Black Hawk aircraft are in service around the world, according to Sikorsky's parent company Lockheed Martin. The U.S. Army owns 2,300 of them.
Kaena Point is northwest of Honolulu.

Aside from the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze, or the creaking of a bough in a winter gale, a tree's character may best be described as 'the strong and silent type' -- but, as so often is the case with such personalities, they just might have the most hauntingly beautiful stories to tell.
For nearly a century, dendrochronologists have practiced reading tree-rings for clues about the lives of trees. And though the field of study has helped immensely to shed light on historic growth cycles for scientists, it's all been rather dry and clinical. But now, thanks to a special turntable designed to read tree-rings like tracks on an LP, a tree's biography can now actually be heard as its discography.
German artist Bartholomäus Traubeck recently debuted a record-player they developed which is capable of digitally reading tree-slices and translating them into surprisingly moving piano music. Tree-rings, of course, considered to be annual records of a tree's growth rate -- which in turn offer clues to the hardships and fruitful periods experienced over the life of the tree.
A description of Traubeck's project, fittingly entitled 'Years', from Creative Applications:
A tree's year rings are analysed for their strength, thickness and rate of growth. This data serves as basis for a generative process that outputs piano music based on the year ring data. Those are analyzed for their thickness and growth rate and are then mapped to a scale which is again defined by the overall appearance of the wood (ranging from dark to light and from strong texture to light texture). The foundation for the music is certainly found in the defined ruleset of programming and hardware setup, but the data acquired from every tree interprets this ruleset very differently.
Like any great composition, the sounds produced from reading tree-rings are both aesthetically beautiful while at the same time a strangely ethereal glimpse into the otherwise silent life of our planet's most essential organisms. And likewise, when presented in such a visceral way, it becomes difficult to imagine Earth's pristine forests as merely places where life can thrive, and not as quiet musicians recording, in their own way, what it means to be alive.
This holiday season, a lot of attention has shifted to low-wage workers who are still struggling to make ends meet despite having paying jobs.
And in recent weeks, with the endorsement of President Obama, raising the federal minimum wage is gaining steam as the next big political issue for Democrats.
Republicans, however, are still by and large opposed to the idea. But one wealthy conservative wants to change all that.
Enter Ron Unz, Silicon Valley millionaire, publisher of libertarian magazine The American Conservative, theoretical physicist by training, enemy of bilingual education and former Republican candidate for governor of California.
On Tuesday, Unz submitted paperwork in California to get a relatively aggressive minimum wage hike on the ballot that would raise the state's minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2016.
They reason that there's at least one big conservative reason Republicans should back their proposal: It ends corporate welfare for large companies like Walmart and McDonald's by ending the low wages that force many of their employees onto the food stamp rolls.

ABC News spoke to Unz about their plans and why they believe conservatives would be smart to jump on their bandwagon. The interview has been edited for length and clarity:
ABC News: What are you trying to do here?
Ron Unz: The initiative is targeted for the November 2014 ballot. If it passed early in 2015, the minimum wage in California will go up to $10 an hour; early in 2016 it would be raised to $12 an hour. In other words, the initiative in a couple of stages would raise the minimum wage of all California workers to $12 an hour. (Editor's note: California legislators have already approved a minimum wage hike that would incrementally raise it to $10 an hour by 2016.)
Who did you vote for in the last election?
To be honest, I didn't like either candidate, Obama or Romney. I think I may have written in Ron Paul's name.
Do you consider yourself to be a conservative?
I generally consider myself more of a conservative. I come from a scientific background. So I try to sort of look at things on a case-by-case basis and take whatever position seems to make the most sense to me. Many times those positions are conservative, but sometimes they're not. If people want to call me a conservative that's fine, and if people claim I'm not a true conservative, that's also fine.
What's behind your advocacy on the minimum wage?
One aspect of the minimum wage rise, which I think is underappreciated, is [that] it would function as a massive stimulus package, a government stimulus package. If the minimum wage nationwide were raised to $12 an hour, probably between $150 billion and $175 billion a year would go into the pockets of the lower-wage families that spend every dollar they earn. It would cause a tremendous boost in economic demand.
Another important factor: One of the strange things in our society right now is that we have all these low-wage workers who are getting $7.50, $8 or $9 an hour, and because they earn such small wages, the government subsidizes them with billions or tens of billions of dollars of social welfare spending that comes from the taxpayer.
It's a classic example of businesses' privatizing the benefits of their workers while socializing the costs. Forcing the taxpayers to supplement the salary of their own employees.
Is there a political reason why Republicans should raise the minimum wage?
Absolutely. There's been a massive influx of impoverished immigrant workers, which depresses the wages of American workers. The best way of preventing that is a much higher minimum wage.
The reason that businesses hire them is that they're willing to work at such a cheap rate. They're willing to undercut American wages. If the minimum wage were much higher -- say, $12 an hour -- a lot of businesses would hire Americans.
But wouldn't companies still hire illegal immigrants and pay them under the table in order to pay them the lower wages they're willing to work for?
Obviously, some of that would happen. The vast majority of illegal immigrants right now earn above the minimum wage.
Do you plan to reach out to Walmart?
I'm certainly planning to.
Are you going to spend your own money to help get this on the ballot?

Illegal immigrants are kidnapping children and bringing them across the border, hoping to appear to be families so they can take advantage of lax enforcement policies, the Obama administration told a federal appeals court this week.
Leon Fresco, a deputy assistant attorney general who handles immigration cases, made the stunning claim as they defended the administration's policy of detaining illegal immigrant parents and children caught traveling together as they jump the border. After a federal judge last year ordered the families quickly released, Mr. Fresco said it's served as an enticement for kidnapping.
“When people now know that when I come as a family unit, I won't be apprehended and detained — we now have people being abducted so that they can be deemed as family units, so that they can avoid detention,” Mr. Fresco told the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
They did not back up that claim in court, and did not respond to a follow-up email seeking comment. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that handles detention and deportation, declined to comment, citing the ongoing case, while Customs and Border Protection, which guards the border, did not respond to a request for comment.
But Peter Schey, the lawyer who argued in court on behalf of the families, and is in touch with hundreds of families as part of the lawsuit, said there's no evidence to back up Mr. Fresco's claim.
“We know zero instances of that, and there's zero support for that anywhere in the record,” they said. “If they know of any such instances, I would think they would bring the actual instances to the attention of the court.”
How to treat the illegal immigrant families is just one of the thorny questions raised by the surge of illegal immigrants fleeing Central America over the last few years.
Most of the attention has gone to the unaccompanied minors who have arrived by the tens of thousands. Under a 1990s-era legal agreement known as the Flores settlement, the children are required to be quickly processed and released to social workers, and eventually placed with family or other sponsors.
But even more of the Central American illegal immigrants are now coming as family units — a parent and children traveling together — and the rules for handling them are hotly debated.
The Obama administration opened several new detention facilities to hold the families, hoping to quickly deport them, sending a message back to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that the journey north would be for naught.
Mr. Schey and other immigrant rights advocates, however, challenged the detention, arguing the families were being held in jail-like facilities unsuitable for children. They argued the Flores agreement required better treatment.
Last year, Judge Dolly M. Gee agreed, and ordered all of the children quickly processed and released. In cases where they came with a parent, they said it usually made sense to release the parent too, because that was in the best interests of the children.
The Obama administration warned that would lead to a new surge of illegal immigration, and the numbers bear that out, with fiscal year 2016 on track to set a record for family units caught trying to jump the border.
Mr. Fresco, arguing to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday, said the Flores agreement was only supposed to apply to unaccompanied minors, not to those who arrive as part of a family. They said that was the understanding for more than a decade, and immigrant rights activists have only recently sought a new interpretation.
But Judge Andrew D. Hurwitz said the agreement seems clear.
“On the face of the agreement, it sure seems to apply to all minors,” they said.
Still, they said Judge Gee's order pushing all mothers to be released along with their children goes beyond the Flores settlement's wording. They wondered if there wasn't a middle ground that prohibited the government from treating mothers with children worse than other illegal immigrants, but stopped short of ordering their quick release.
“Our only concern, and the court's only concern, was that they were treating the mothers in a way that they weren't treating anybody else in the United States,” Mr. Schey told the judges.
Immigration policy has become ever more fragmented under President Obama, and both sides of the debate are increasingly turning to the federal courts to try to sort it out.
In Texas, a federal judge last month ordered Justice Department lawyers to undergo remedial ethics training after they decided the lawyers repeatedly misled their court about Mr. Obama's 2014 deportation amnesty, known as deferred action.
On Tuesday, however, Judge Andrew S. Hanen stayed their own order, saying they wanted the Justice Department to suggest its own punishment.
They also stayed their order that would have forced the administration to turn over the names of some 50,000 illegal immigrants who were approved for three-year work permits and stays of deportation under the 2014 policy.
Judge Hanen has set a new hearing for the end of August to revisit the issue.
By then, the Supreme Court is likely to have ruled on the legality of the overall amnesty program.

A Toronto teacher says their Grade 8 students are unhappy that a three-day graduation trip to a nature camp in Bancroft, Ont., next month was cancelled due to the school board's safety concerns over activities such as swimming and archery.
Lenny Chiro, who teaches at Amesbury Middle School, was preparing their class for the annual trip to Camp Walden when the school board cancelled it, citing safety concerns.
"It's confusing why at the last moment we're told that we're not in compliance with safety rules, when the facility that we're going to has an exemplary track record and is extremely well supervised," Chiro said Friday in an interview with CBC Radio's Metro Morning.
Chiro said Amesbury's Grade 8 students have been making the trip to Camp Walden for seven years as a fun way to mark graduation from middle school.
They described Camp Walden as an exclusive facility that reduces its rates for the school to make the trip possible, at a cost of $150 per student.
Chiro said they were making final preparations for the June 10 trip when the school board's superintendent asked for proof that safety requirements about activities such as swimming and archery had been met.
Without sufficient proof, students would be unable to take part in many of the camp's activities. The students decided that without the activities, the trip would not be worth the cost.
"There weren't many [activities] left except 'swat the mosquito,'" said Chiro. "As a result, all those activities were taken out of the trip. And basically the students decided, 'No, this is not worth us going on this trip.'"
Instead, the students go on a one-day trip to Niagara Falls.
Twins Rosie (left) and Ruby Formosa (right) who were born joined at the abdomen and shared part of the intestine (Picture: PA Wire)
Conjoined twin sisters who doctor said had a slim chance of survival are now preparing for their first day at school.
Rosie and Ruby Formosa underwent life-saving surgery after they were born joined at the abdomen – sharing part of the intestine.
Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital told parents, Angela and Daniel Formosa, their chances of survival were low.
But following a successful procedure, the four-year-olds are now packing their rucksacks and preparing their uniform for the start of school in September.
Angela, from Bexleyheath in Kent, thought they would never see the day.
Doctors were not sure what it was connecting the babies (Picture: PA)
They said: ‘Four years ago it wasn't in my mind that this would ever happen.'
It was touch and go for the girls after doctors couldn't tell what was connecting them.

‘It was heartbreaking really – I was already worried that they were monoamniotic (where twins share an amniotic sac), and conjoined was the worst-case scenario,' they said.
The twins were born at University College Hospital in London by caesarean section when Angela was 34 weeks pregnant.
Within a couple of hours of being born, they were taken to Great Ormond for emergency surgery because of an intestinal blockage.
The twins are now both healthy and are excited about starting school (Picture: PA Wire)
It wasn't until the surgery that doctors could see what was going on.
The operation to separate them took five hours and the girls were well enough to go home at three weeks old.
Now the two are excited to start their first day at school.
Angela said: ‘They are very similar, they are very bubbly little girls, they are very headstrong and very determined.'
The Formosa family are supporting the hospital's charity through it's Back To School Campaign – which is celebrating all of the children who are able to go to school thanks to care at the hospital.
Chip Kelly won't be the offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars.
The former San Francisco 49ers head coach interviewed for the position, but the Jaguars decided to retain Nathaniel Hackett, the team announced Wednesday evening.
"After taking over as the play-caller in 2016, the offensive unit made a significant jump under the direction of Nathaniel Hackett," Jaguars Executive Vice President of Football Operations Tom Coughlin said in a statement Wednesday. "Nathaniel comes from a coaching family and is truly ardent about the game of football, which is contagious to their players and the assistants. They have a long history of working alongside Coach Marrone and we are fortunate to have them on our coaching staff."
Kelly was thought to be the frontrunner for the position because of their history with Coughlin, the former coach of the New York Giants. Coughlin tried to hire Kelly when they were with the Giants. Instead, it was Hackett's history with first-year Jaguars coach Doug Marrone that may have proved decisive.
Hackett was the team's offensive coordinator for the second half of the 2016 season after former coach Gus Bradley fired Greg Olson and promoted Hackett. Hackett served as offensive coordinator when Marrone was the head coach of the Buffalo Bills from 2012-2013 and under Marrone at Syracuse University in 2011-2012. Marrone was named the Jaguars interim coach after Bradley was fired in 2016.
The Jaguars, who finished the season with a 3-13 record, decided to keep their major coaching hires in-house. They promoted their offensive line coach to head coach and retained their offensive and defensive coordinators.
Kelly also interviewed for the Jaguars head coach position, but the team promoted Marrone.
Kelly was fired by the 49ers after just one season. The 49ers posted a 2-14 record and lost a franchise-record 13-consecutive games during the 2016 season.

Will the Florida Panthers buy out the worst contract on their payroll?
The year was 2013, and the Chicago Blackhawks were in game 6 of the Stanley Cup final against the Boston Bruins. Chicago was tied with the Bruins at two goals a piece with 58.4 seconds left in the third period. One goal would give the Blackhawks the Stanley Cup, and Dave Bolland would answer the call.
Dave Bolland was selected 32nd overall in the 2004 NHL draft by the Chicago Blackhawks, who were under the management of current Florida Panthers general manager, Dale Tallon at that time. Bolland would be shipped down to Chicago's AHL team, The Rockford Ice Hogs for their first professional season. Bolland would be called up in 2006 and play for the Blackhawks until their Stanley Cup winning goal. Just days after the 2013 season ended. Bolland was sent to the Toronto Maple Leafs for three draft picks and would play 23 games in the 2014 season, which was shortened by an ankle injury, registering only 12 points for the Leafs before their contract expired.
Enter the Florida Panthers, who made the decision to pick up the free agent, who signed along with five other players, those being Jussi Jokinen, Willie Mitchell, Derek Mackenzie, Al Montoya and Shawn Thornton on July 1st of 2014. Mitchell, Montoya and Thornton would sign two year contracts, Mackenzie would sign for three years and Jussi Jokinen would sign for four years. The five year deal offered by Dale Tallon would be the one that left everyone scratching their heads.
Bolland's deal is one that most likely haunts Tallon to this day. Tallon would cut Dave Bolland a five-year deal that totaled 27.5 million dollars costing the Florida Panthers 5.5 million dollars per year on their cap hit. Bolland, to date, has produced a total of 7 goals in 78 games since signing with Florida and has been inactive since December, when they were sent to the Portland Pirates on a conditioning stint. During their time in Portland, they suffered a lower body injury which ended their season and possibly their NHL career.
With the 2016 season closing fast and three of the five players Bolland signed alongside in 2014 due for resigning, the Panthers are left with the option of leaving Bolland's contract intact and keep paying the 5 million dollars per year until 2020 and letting go of a member of the Florida roster to free agency, or opt for the buyout which will cost 1.833 million dollars per season on the Panthers salary cap until 2023 and potentially keep the talent pool intact going into 2017.
With Bolland's contract gone, the Panthers would free up 3.667 million per year to sign some of the recently acquired talent such as Jiri Hudler, or Teddy Purcell or have the option of pursuing some of the other talent that will become available once the 2016 season ends. While the Florida Panthers remain tight-lipped about what they plan to do, one has to assume they will most likely pursue a buyout option.
Every day, tens of thousands of Turkish citizens are walking to demand justice. We began in Ankara on 15 June and we are marching to Istanbul, walking for almost 20km (13 miles) every day. We are demanding justice and the rule of law for everyone living in Turkey.
This is a long journey – 432km. The walkers have endured heavy rains on the mountains and scorching heat along the plains. Our numbers have already exceeded 40,000, and we expect tens of thousands more to join us over the coming days. A chant resonates in my ear all day long: “Hak, hukuk, adalet” – rights, law and justice.
Regardless of our political views, we are united under one single cause: justice. We walk peacefully. We do not respond to the laying of bullets on the road in front of us, or the manure dumped on our camping sites. When bullies try to provoke us with insults we respond only with applause. Our peaceful but steely determination is our greatest asset.
There is no precedent for this in our republic's history, brought on by a regime which seeks mainly to protect itself
Last July, Turkey suffered an attempted coup. But a second, more insidious coup took place five days later, when the Justice and Development party (AKP) government declared a state of emergency, suspending the rule of law and parliamentary democracy. Since then Turkey has been ruled by decree. The government has sacked around 105,000 civil servants without any proper explanation. It has arrested large numbers of academics, journalists, and even members of parliament, on politically motivated charges. Fear has started to reign in our society.
To make things worse, in April the government sponsored a referendum to give the president sweeping new powers. Although the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said the referendum was conducted unfairly and unlawfully, and short of the standards set by the Council of Europe, the AKP used it to consolidate its one-man authoritarian rule, making the state of emergency permanent.
Injustice, arbitrariness and discrimination have become defining features of the AKP regime. That is why we are demanding justice first. The “right to justice” is a basic human right. It encapsulates the cardinal principles of rule of law: independent courts and judiciary, the right to a fair trial and equal access to the law for all citizens.
The authoritarian regime has stripped away this right from Turkish citizens. Our country's highest court has declared itself powerless and incompetent to review the legality of the laws decreed by the government. Judges who attempt to be independent and impartial face immediate removal and criminal indictment. Lawyers who represent political opponents of the regime face the prospect of arrest. On Wednesday, the director of Amnesty International Turkey and several other prominent human rights activists were detained without cause. Our prisons are at capacity: criminals are being released early to make way for political dissidents and journalists. Where individuals are investigated or indicted, their families too can lose their legal rights. Collective punishment has re-emerged.
The new authoritarianism in Turkey is characterised by a parliament that has only limited powers of legislation, by newspapers that misrepresent the facts and often amount to a government-sponsored megaphone that smears any opposition, by courts that merely sign off decisions taken elsewhere, and by expensive government rallies sponsored by state funds. Meanwhile, public demonstrations are almost always prohibited by law – this is despite the fact that the right to protest injustice is recognised by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is a crisis, with no precedent in our republic's history, brought on by an authoritarian regime that seeks mainly to protect itself.
We are not alone. The world is seeing a rise of extremists, illiberal populists and dictators. There are important differences in the degree of oppression, but there are also commonalities. Dictators learn from one another. They conspire together against democracies. They ruin their countries and force their people to seek refuge abroad. How should liberal democrats respond? We need to develop and share internationally new democratic means to challenge the powers of illiberal populists and the new generation of dictators.

The only principled response to this authoritarian challenge is to renew and strengthen our commitment to democratic values. And that must come from words and deeds that instil hope. Hope is contagious. I see it grow every day on the tired but resolute faces of those who walk beside me. Solidarity breeds courage. Soon hundreds of thousands will join us.
As our numbers grow, so does our collective sense of courage. Our walk indicates our determination to defend freedom of expression and our right to peaceful demonstration in Turkey. We are walking to remind those who choose to rule by decree and intimidation that ours is a social contract: we, as citizens, submit to the authority of the state in exchange for the protection of our rights.
We are walking to restore that contract; we are walking to restore democracy, justice and our hard-earned fundamental freedoms. We are walking to lift the deceptive veil of “democracy” from what is in fact a harsh authoritarian regime. Our march will end at the gates of the prison in Istanbul that houses so many of this regime's victims. But we hope it will mark the beginning of a new societal movement for justice, one that will resonate beyond Turkey's borders.
On Tuesday, the US Director of the National Counter-terrorism Center Nicholas J. Rasmussen said they believed Hizballah was planning attacks in the US.
"It is our assessment that Hizballah is determined to give itself a potential homeland option as a critical component of its terrorism playbook," they told a press conference.
Hizballah were a key focus for US anti-terror efforts until the 11 September attacks in 2011, which saw the CIA's efforts focus primarily fall on Salafi-jihadi organisations such as al-Qaeda and later the Islamic State group.
With the proliferation of Iranian-backed militias in the region - such as Hizballah and the Fatimiyoun Brigades in Syria and the Hashd al-Shaabi in Iraq - some analysts have warned of a new threat to US allies and civilians from these armed groups.
Bad memories
The 1983 bombing of a Marines barracks in Beirut was the single biggest death toll in one day for US forces since the Second World War and led to a withdrawal of US forces out of war-torn Lebanon.

It is believed to have been carried out by Hizballah with Syrian and Iranian regime support.
On Tuesday, Israel's far-right Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman described Lebanon's army as an "inseparable part" of Hizballah.
The Lebanese movement's leader Hassan Nasrallah has ramped up rhetoric against the US in recent months saying its actions were "aiding" the Islamic State group.
Iran has also seen a resurgence of conservative attempts to reassert control in the Tehran regime following a recent detente in relations with the US.
Hizballah and Iran have been key backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime with pro-Damascus forces winning back key areas in the country from opposition forces.
Hizballah's role in the war has been key and given it better supply links with backers Syria and Iran, more battlefield experience for its fighters, and new weaponry, analysts have said.
Israel has warned of Iran and Hizballah's presence in southern Syria launching air strikes on militants during the six-year war in the country.
Ben Rattray knew they were on to something big when the website they founded, Change.org, managed to get the South African government to acknowledge for the first time the scourge of "corrective rape," a heinous crime meant to "cure" lesbians of their sexual orientation. In 2010 a rape victim from a township started a petition on Change.org that eventually got 170,000 signatures. In March 2011 the South African parliament formed a national task force to stop the abuses. "There's almost no person in the country who has seemingly less power than this [South African] woman, but they run the most effective campaign on this issue in history," Rattray says.
The 32-year-old law school dropout runs one of the biggest sites on the Web for anyone seeking to pressure politicians, corporations or others with a public shame campaign. Change.org is best known for helping Trayvon Martin's parents get the man who shot them arrested, ending Bank of America's $5 monthly checking account fees and helping Bettina Siegel get the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban "pink slime" from school lunches. But the site's greater impact may be the thousands of lesser-known petitions--15,000 are created monthly--started by everyday Joes who blast their call for signatures through their e-mail directories and social networks. Responding to one of these petitions is the ultimate in armchair slacktivism. Check a box because a friend of a friend tells you to, and you have done something good for the day. Change.org now has 20 million members and is adding 2 million a month.
The service is free, and with a name like Change.org the company even sounds like a not-for-profit. But it's not. It was founded in 2007 and spent the better part of two years flailing around for a profitable business model until Rattray hit upon a clever approach. Change.org charges groups for the privilege of sponsoring petitions that are matched to users who have similar interests. For example, when a person signs a petition about education and clicks "submit," a box pops up and shows five sponsored petitions on education to also sign. If a user leaves a box checked that says "Keep me updated on this campaign and others," the sponsor can then send e-mails directly to that person. It's not clear from the check box that your e-mail address is being sold to a not-for-profit. Rattray says an imminent site redesign will make the company's business model more transparent. Change.org has 300 paying clients, including Sierra Club, Credo Wireless and Amnesty International, and its revenue so far this year is $15 million.
Some of the petitioners FORBES spoke with didn't know Change was a for-profit. Rattray says the .org connotes the company's social mission, and it is a certified B Corporation, which means a social mission is written into its bylaws. But they acknowledge the messaging could be better and plans to improve it: "We need to be better about telling that combination."
They came into this business by accident. In high school they were student body president, homecoming king and track star, then went to Stanford with no real ambitions beyond a career in investment banking. Then in their senior year at college their brother came out as gay and told them that there weren't enough people like them willing to "stand up or speak out" on issues. Rattray decided to launch Change.org on the eve of starting law school at NYU. The company tried building social networking and fundraising tools for nonprofits. It later added bloggers to write about human rights issues, which started to draw more traffic and showed the power of personal stories. In the spring of 2009 Rattray hit upon the idea of charging not-for-profits for access to potential donors. In late 2010 it opened the petition tool to the public and began to attract a massive audience.
Anyone can create a petition, including "astroturf" causes backed by big companies, though Rattray says not many companies have done so. Change.org has a staff that selects petitions for home page and e-mail promotion and campaign support, but it asserts its neutrality. This hasn't stopped it from becoming a target for political strong-arming. Earlier this year Change.org succumbed to pressure from labor unions and declined to renew ad contracts with two education reform groups, Stand for Children and StudentsFirst (headed by Michelle Rhee, the former schools chancellor of Washington, D.C.), because they favor reforms some see as antiunion. Stand for Children and StudentsFirst were baffled, saying they hadn't broken any of Change's terms of service. Rattray says Change.org plans to release new policies in October clarifying who can and cannot advertise on the site.
This is the central growth challenge for software firms selling into the politics industry. How do you expand your customer base when doing business with one faction makes you an enemy of the other? The startup NationBuilder, founded by liberal documentary filmmaker Jim Gilliam and Mark Zuckerberg's college roommate Joe Green, sells software primarily to help political campaigns manage their campaigns, but it came under fire from fellow progressives recently when it signed the Republican State Leadership Committee as a customer. Raven Brooks, head of the liberal Netroots Nation, called on similar groups to not use NationBuilder, accusing it of giving away tools to the opposition.
With cynicism about government at an alltime high, Rattray says they can keep growing by keeping the stories personal. The petitions that catch fire on Change.org are almost always tied to human drama and not about tackling abstract challenges such as health care or immigration reform. In 2004 Cally Houck's two daughters were killed in a car accident after renting a PT Cruiser that had been recalled for power-steering problems. Federal law prohibits the sale of recalled cars but not the rental of them. In February Houck mounted a campaign and got 162,000 signatures on Change.org. In September U.S. senators reached a deal on legislation banning the rental of recalled cars; the law is expected to pass.
Then there was 8th grader Abby Goldberg, 13, of Greyslake, Ill., who tried to get their town to ban plastic bags as part of a school project. In June they found out the state legislature was considering a bill that would make it illegal for towns to ban plastic bags, and they started a Change.org petition directed at Governor Pat Quinn (“Governor Quinn: Don't Let Big Plastic Bully Me!”). They garnered 150,000 signatures. In August, Quinn called Goldberg personally to say they had changed their mind and would veto the bill.
John Lauer, a seasonal firefighter in Custer, S.D., started a petition in May calling on President Obama to make seasonal firefighters eligible for government health care plans. They were denied coverage as temporary workers. Six weeks later they got a call from Change.org, asking to promote their petition. They agreed, having 1,000 signatures at the time. After returning from a fire several days later they checked the site: It had 94,000 signatures (and eventually got 126,000). In July President Obama directed federal agencies to make health care available to these firefighters.
"I don't think anyone is surprised at what I'm doing: the successful application of my skills in an ambitious way," says Rattray. "The surprise is that it wasn't applied to banking but to a social business for good."

“Age of Adaline” and the faith-based “Little Boy” will test “Furious 7” at the box office this weekend, and it could very well be another victory lap for Universal's hot car blockbuster.
The sci-fi tale “Ex Machina” from A24 is expanding and is a wild card, but if “Furious 7” keeps half of its audience from last weekend it will win its fourth consecutive weekend with around $15 million. Sony's family comedy “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2” is back for its second weekend and will be in the mix as well.
Lionsgate's fantasy romance “Age of Adaline,” which stars Blake Lively as a young woman who doesn't age, is looking at the mid-teen millions in debut. The Open Road Films drama “Little Boy,” the tale of a 7-year-old willing to do whatever it takes to get their father home from World War II, will take in less than that, so it will be a subdued weekend.
It is very much the calm before the storm, however. Disney and Marvel's “Avengers: The Age of Ultron” will kick off the summer season next week, and is expected to challenge the $207 million opening weekend record set by the original “Avengers” in 2012.

A fast start isn't critical for either “Age of Adaline” or “Little Boy,” both of which skew toward mature audiences and will depend on word of mouth to help them play against the summer super sequels.
“Age of Adaline” co-stars Harrison Ford and Ellen Burstyn, who will play a daughter meeting a younger version of their mother for the second straight film, on the heels of “Interstellar.” Lee Toland Krieger directed from a screenplay by J. Mills Goodloe and Savlador Paskowitz.
The reviews are pretty good (70 percent positive on Rotten Tomatoes), but its social media profile is negligible.

Lakeshore Entertainment and Sidney Kimmell Entertainment co-financed and co-produced for a modest $30 million. It will be in roughly 2,900 theaters for Lionsgate.
“Little Boy” stars Emma Watson, Tom Wilkinson, Jakob Skavali and Michael Rappoport and is directed by Alejandro Gome Monteverde, who co-wrote with Pepe Portillo. While it doesn't have any A-listers, it does have Kevin James of “Blart” fame in a more nuanced role as a doctor.
Mark Burnett and Roma Downey executive produced the story of a young man (Skavali) with “faith the size of a mustard seed.”
It hasn't been reviewed by critics but has received a good bit of exposure with Open Road mounting an aggressive grassroots campaign with groups representing the target demos, It has been well-received by Christian groups, American Association of Retired Persons screening crowds and a number of celebrities, including Tony Bennett, Eva Longoria and the singer Jewel, as well as the Mexican-American fans of the director and screenwriter.

Leo Severino is the producer on “Little Boy,” which has a $20 million production budget and comes from Metanoia Films and Santa Fe Films. It will be in roughly 1,000 theaters.
A24 is taking it sexy cyborg sci-fi tale “Ex Machina” wide after two impressive weeks in limited release. It averaged nearly $6o,000 on four screens in its first week and more than $2o,000 on 39 last weekend.
The British import is up to $1.2 million domestically and is at more than $7 million overseas, thanks to strong run in the U.K. for Universal.
Written and directed by Alex Garland, “Ex Machina” stars Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander.
Forcing law enforcement to release a cause of death for "You Got Served!" process server Shawn Lucas, the website Heavy reports that the Office of Chief Medical Examiner in Washington D.C. has responded to its queries by stating that Lucas died of an overdose of the powerful and deadly opiate fentanyl.
On July 1, 2016, Lucas served papers on the Democratic National Committee in a lawsuit alleging election-rigging against Bernie Sanders. One month later they were found dead, with no cause of death determination released for months.
With no known history of hard-drug usage or problems with prescription drugs, the DC examiner nevertheless ruled the death of the apparently healthy 38-year old Lucas as an "accident." According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Between 2000 and 2017 there have been thousands of known deaths from fentanyl overdose. The synthetic drug is particularly dangerous as a result of a property it possesses of tending to slow down and even completely stop breathing.
Lucas, who is an official civil process server in the state of Florida, filmed themselves with the help of a cameraman serving the papers on the DNC. Lucas then posted the visit to DNC headquarters on Youtube, which immediately went viral. Lucas said to their Youtube audience: "That was probably the most satisfying thing I've ever done."
The lawsuit named DNC Chairman and Clinton ally Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and other DNC officials, and was filed on behalf of 121 plaintiffs who had donated to the DNC. The plaintiffs alleged that the committee perpetrated fraud by scheming to ensure the nomination of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. DNC emails made public by Wikileaks later confirmed the suspicions of donors. The complaint alleges:
"Despite there being every indication that the 2016 Democratic primary would be contested by multiple candidates, including Sanders, the DNC Memo makes no mention of any Democratic candidate except Clinton, and builds the DNC's election strategy on the assumption that Clinton will be the nominee, with no doubts attached."
Clinton won the Democratic nomination but went on to lose the general election. Head-to-head polls between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump taken before the general election consistently showed Sanders better equipped to beat Trump, with double-digit leads in poll after poll while Trump closed the gap with Clinton to neck-and-neck.
So it appears the rumors that the Louisville basketball team will be donning new camo uniforms this March are true.
My first reaction is...well I'm not really sure what that is. Is it the shorts? Is it part of the jersey? I suppose it's anyone's guess, because all that really looks like is part of an unfinished SB Nation logo.
Apparently, the final product is going to look something like this on the left:
I'm not the biggest fan (read: I f'ing hate it), but let's remember how anti the infra-red almost all of us were a year ago. Winning makes anything cool, and if this team win big in March then we'll all be looking for ways to score camo compression jerseys for ourselves.
Also, if there's a saving grace to any of this, it's the fact that we're all about to be privy to Camo Compression Logan Baumann. There's always a reason to be excited.
Michael Socha is expected to join the mothership when it is officially renewed for season four.
Once Upon a Time is expected to add a familiar face to its stable of core characters.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland star Michael Socha is poised to join ABC's flagship series when the fairy-tale drama is officially renewed for a fourth season, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.
Socha plays Will Scarlet/Knave of Hearts in the Wonderland spinoff. On Friday, ABC canceled the 13-episode series -- originally intended to bridge the gap between Once seasons -- and announced that Thursday's closer would also serve as its final episode.

The news comes two days after Once said goodbye to series regular Michael Raymond-James, whose character Neal was killed off after a two-season run.
"The aftershocks of that will probably be felt for some time amongst our characters and how they deal with all the things going on," Once executive producer Adam Horowitz told THR. "We want to deal with it in a real way and let our characters and our audience mourn the character."
EW first reported the news.
Socha is repped by Artists Partnership in the U.K. and Kritzer Levine Wilkins Griffin Nilon Entertainment.

Texas Republicans are flocking to the polls, but the increased turnout doesn't necessarily add up to a sure-fire win for home-state presidential hopeful Ted Cruz."There's no way around it that [Donald] Trump's presence in Texas has complicated things for Ted Cruz in a negative way," said Jim Henson,Early voting numbers for the state's largest 15 counties, released by the secretary of state's office, show nearly double the number of voters in some counties, compared to early turnout during the 2008 and 2012 presidential primaries. By the end of early voting on Friday, more than 658,000 Republicans had cast ballots in their party's primary election.That's more than double the 303,000 who voted early in 2008, the most recent year in which the state had a competitive primary that was early in the voting.About 448,000 Democrats submitted early ballots this year.The state's top voting officials expect those numbers to continue growing on Super Tuesday, as Texans cast their first votes in what has become a nasty presidential primary battle."We don't make predictions about what turnout will be," said Alicia Pierce, a spokesperson for Secretary of State Carlos Cascos. But, they added, "there will be a large number of voters coming out to vote."In other words, if you're planning to vote between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Tuesday, scope out your polling place and get there early.In other states, the primary election has resulted in long lines and late returns. If you're planning to stay up for the results, a nap might be in order. And remember, the voting party isn't over until El Pasoans cast their ballots, and they're an hour behind on Mountain Standard Time.Republican voter turnout has been on the uptick in recent years, so the fact more GOP voters are getting to the polls for this race, isn't terribly surprising, Henson said.But, if the trend produces an "extraordinarily high" turnout, it could spell trouble for Cruz, for whom a homestate win in absolutely crucial."One of the problems for Cruz is he's still having to manage the residue of pre-Trump expectations in a post-Trump world," Henson said.In the earlier primary states, Trumpmania has driven increased turnout. As a result, he's nailed down 82 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the party's nomination. Cruz is in a remote second with 17.Texas has 155 delegates up for grabs - the most of any of the dozen or so states that go to the polls on Super Tuesday - and the junior senator is working hard to secure them.They're doled out proportionally (not winner take all), so there's no expectation that Cruz will get the whole delegate kitty from Texas. The question is how many they can keep from Trump. And the more people who turn out to the polls, particularly first-time voters, the higher the chances more delegates flip to the billionaire of reality-TV fame who has thrown this race into disarray."It shouldn't be surprising that Donald Trump has scrambled the race here just as they have elsewhere," Henson said. "That doesn't mean that Cruz is going to lose, but it's kind of ridiculous to think the magnitude of Trump's success does not eat into Cruz's margins."It's not only Cruz who's worried about the Trump effect, said Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak. In races further down the ballot, many incumbents and their challengers are sweating what the anti-establishment bent of unfamiliar voters might mean on Election Day."It's added a real variable and a level of uncertainty," they said.The new pool of voters also presents a challenge for the Texas GOP after the polls close, in figuring out how to keep those new voters coming back."They love the fact that they have huge growth and record turnout," Mackowiak. "These are new voters we can hopefully keep."No matter the turnout, Mackowiak said they were certain Cruz will win Texas. A solid performance here won't likely launch Cruz ahead of Trump, but it could help them battle Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for the first spot in Trump's shadow."We'll see," Mackowiak said. "It's going to be fascinating result."
Watford are poised to announce their fifth summer signing after agreeing a deal to sign Etienne Capoue from Tottenham Hotspur.
There has been extensive speculation linking the midfielder with a move to Vicarage Road and the Watford Observer understands all terms have now been agreed and Capoue's switch is set to be confirmed early next week.
The 26-year-old will follow Sebastian Prodl, Giedrius Arlauskis, Matej Vydra and Jose Holebas in moving to Vicarage Road as Watford continues the process of building a squad strong enough to enable them to survive in the Premier League.
It has been reported the Hornets made a bid of £5.7 million for Capoue and if this is what has been accepted by Spurs, it would shatter the club's transfer record of £3.25 million paid for Nathan Ellington in 2007.
Capoue moved to White Hart Lane for £9 million two years ago but since then has made just 19 Premier League starts plus a further five appearances off the bench, scoring one goal. Their last appearance for Spurs came in January's 2-1 FA Cup defeat at the hands of Leicester City.
Prior to their move to north London, Capoue enjoyed six years with Toulouse and won the first of their seven French caps against Uruguay in a friendly August 2012.
Capoue may not be the only Spurs player to move to Vicarage Road as Watford continues to be heavily linked with Benjamin Stambouli.
Another defensively minded midfielder, the 24-year-old joined Tottenham at the start of last season from Montpellier.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and their counterparts in Paris, London and Madrid took to the New York Times op-ed page Tuesday morning to pose a flawed argument against default encryption of mobile phones, a service being commercialized and implemented gradually by Apple and Google.
The op-ed misstated the extent of the obstacles to law enforcement, understating the many other ways officials bearing warrants can still collect the information they need or want — even when confronted with an encrypted, password-protected device.
The authors failed to acknowledge the value to normal people of protecting their private data from thieves, hackers and government dragnets.
And they demanded — in the name of the “safety of our communities” — a magical, mathematically impossible scenario in which communications are safeguarded from everyone except law enforcement.
Apple and Google are attempting to provide strong, reliable and user-friendly encrypted systems for their customers. A user who has installed iOS 8 on an iPhone automatically encrypts text messages, photos, contacts, call history and other sensitive data simply by using a passcode.
Android devices also include a system that encrypts downloaded files, application data, and other data with a PIN or passcode. But contrary to what the op-ed stated, that is not the default setting for most Android phones.
It's true that when law enforcement asks for information that is encrypted with the user's passcode, Apple and Google cannot actually deliver it. But that's typically not the whole story.
For one: Apple, for instance, copies a lot of that data onto its own cloud servers during Wi-Fi backups, where the company can in fact access it and turn it over to law enforcement.
Plenty of other data is still available from the phone companies: SMS text messages, phone numbers called and phone calls received, and location information.
And then there's the ability to break in. Responding to Tuesday's op-ed, ACLU technologist Christopher Soghoian tweeted: “If law enforcement can't hack the hundreds of millions of Android phones running out-of-date, vulnerable software, they're not trying.”
Following the rollout of iOS 8, Lee Reiber, a cell phone forensics expert at AccessData, told Mashable that “As secure as the device can be, there's always going to be some vulnerability that can be located and exploited.” Reiber said it's “cat and mouse.”
The authors of the op-ed launched their argument by citing an Evanston murder investigation that they claimed was stymied by law enforcement's inability to access the data on two phones that were found at the scene.
Unlike the laughably pathetic examples FBI Director James Comey cited in October in their argument against encryption of mobile devices, the Evanston case does actually appear to feature the rare combination of factors in which data on the phone might indeed have helped the investigation.
Ray C. Owens was shot and killed in their car in broad daylight in Evanston, Illinois, in June. Police found two phones near their body. They belonged to Owens — not the killer.
One was an iPhone 6 running on Apple's iOS 8 operating system, the other a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge running on Google's Android operating system. When investigators served search warrants on Apple and Google to unlock the phones, the companies said they were unable to, because both had been password-protected.
According to Commander Joseph Dugan of the Evanston Police Department, investigators were able to obtain records of the calls to and from the phones, but those records did not prove useful. By contrast, interviews with people who knew Owens suggested that they communicated mainly through text messages — the kind that travel as encrypted data — and had made plans to meet someone shortly before they were shot.
The information on their phone was not backed up automatically on Apple's servers — apparently because they didn't use Wi-Fi, which backups require.
And the gun recovered two blocks away when a man fleeing police dropped it was not the gun that fired the fatal bullets, Dugan said.
So the Evanston police were stymied. “There doesn't appear to be anything coming in the near future as far as charging anyone,” Dugan told The Intercept.
But Dugan also wasn't as quick to lay the blame solely on the encrypted phones. “I don't know if getting in there, getting the information, would solve the case,” they said, “but it definitely would give us more investigative leads to follow up on.”
The op-ed's conclusion calls for an “appropriate balance between the marginal benefits of full-disk encryption and the need for local law enforcement to solve and prosecute crimes.”
But experts say there's either a doorway in or there isn't. And if there is, lots of other people, including criminals, can use it too.

Hall of Famer Andre Reed has said, “F–k Bon Jovi.” Hall of Famer Jim Kelly is considering a different arrangement.
With the individual efforts of Kelly and rocker Jon Bon Jovi not producing much success when it comes to purchasing the Bills, the two parties have considered a last-ditch effort to win the franchise.
According to Tim Graham of the Buffalo News, Kelly and Bon Jovi have had conversations about joining forces.
Kelly and bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach reportedly have met with the trust responsible for selling the team, in the hopes of being matched with a group that has the cash to make the purchase. It's unclear whether a Bon Jovi-Kelly arrangement would include Gundlach.
Even without him, an expanded collection of big-name partial owners runs the risk of too many voices steering the organization. Bon Jovi presumably teamed up with a pair of Toronto partners because they don't have the cash to buy the requisite 30 percent of the team without financing. Kelly clearly doesn't. So who would actually run the team?
Per Graham, it possibly would be Kelly. Jim and their brother, Dan, reportedly want two percent of the franchise, lifetime jobs, a cash payment up front for their services, and final say on all football decisions.
While that may seem like a large slice of a baked circular pastry hovering in the airspace above Western New York, aligning with Kelly could be the only way that Bon Jovi and company would have a chance to buy the team. So even though Graham reports that the Kellys possibly would give up the “final say” demand in order to climb into bed with Bon Jovi, they should hold firm.
Without Jim Kelly vouching for the intentions of Bon Jovi and the Toronto-based two, they're not getting the team. So they can have the team and not have final say over football matters, or they can have a much improved chance at getting the team and not have final say over football matters.
It seems like a smart choice. Then again, “smart” isn't something that the Bon Jovi group has been displaying much of.
UPDATE 6:45 p.m. ET: And the wife and daughter of Jim Kelly have both denied that Kelly would align with Bon Jovi's group, via Twitter. And Tim Graham has doubled down, suggesting via Twitter that Jim should check with their brother on the issue.
Magaret is informed, by their housekeepers, that Nucky has been imprisoned for voting fraud. They seem to take things in stride and continues to carryout their daily routine. They do call Nucky's suite to find out that they are about to get bailed out and that FBI agents are ransacking their office for information. They also have to make dinner preparations for one of Nucky's guests.
Nucky finds themselves sharing a prison cell with Chalky. Although I'm sure that was no coincidence. Nucky uses this time to ask that Chalky be patient through out the new shake-ups in Atlantic City. Chalky isn't too thrilled about it naturally because they are the one that has to sit in a cell all day and deal with the constant attacks from the KKK. Nucky is free to go after their lawyer bails them out.
The Commodore is having a meeting with Nucky's brother, Eli, and former business partners. The Commodore is making sure their plans on taking control of Atlantic City are clear and that the men in attendance know their roles. After the meeting, all of the members in attendance agree to follow the new regime with the exception of Damian. Jimmy is away in New York with a business proposal for Arnold Rothstein. Jimmy tells Rothstein that if they want to get liquor for better prices with less hassle that they should do business together. The cautious Rothstein declines the offer but their assistant “Lucky” Luciano asks Jimmy to come meet them later. Although Lucky and Jimmy don't have the best personal relationship, seeing as though Lucky is having sex with Jimmy's mother, they agree. At the meeting Lucky introduces Jimmy to their partner Meyer Lansky. They tell Jimmy that if they are willing to buy heroin from them then they would be willing to go into business with them and their new liquor ring.
Margeret shows up at Nucky's suite pretending to be a pregnant woman in need of Nucky's help. The agents fall for it and allow their access to the suite's washroom for precautionary reasons. Later we find out that they manage to get Nucky's ledger with all their illegal transactions and $20,000 “give or take”. I wasn't expecting Margeret to be on board with Nucky's operations but they seem to have chosen their side and is willing to show them support.
As Nucky gets back into their suite, after the FBI has taken all they need, Damain comes to tell Nucky about the Commodore's plan…until Eli calls. As Eli begins to indirectly tell Nucky that they are no longer supporting their “big brother” Nucky interrupts them and tells Eli that if they want to get out of the situation to just say it and they will make things better. Eli never does. The Commodore introduces Eli to “the men that built (Atlantic) city” afterwards, members of the Ku Klux Klan.
We are introduced to Owen Slater, an assistant to John McGarrigle. An Irishman whom I assume we will be seeing more of in the season. Their boss tells Nucky that Slater will be staying stateside when they go back to Ireland. I'm not sure what to think of their character yet but they seem to have some connection with Margeret beyond just both being Irish. As the episode comes to an end and Margeret suggest that Nucky burn their ledger and to make a mental note of all their future transactions I can assume that they will have more influence over Nucky's business decisions as opposed to just being the uninformed housewife.

Today, every nuclear power plant is unique, custom-built and run by site-specifically trained employees. This makes reactor construction expensive and, some argue, less safe because repairs require custom parts and one-off solutions. In recent years, nuclear energy advocates have been promoting an alternative—smaller, modular reactors that could be mass-produced. These cheaper, smaller, and standardized units could be a power solution for industries and municipalities that are looking to lower their carbon dioxide footprint.
But a paper by Ahmed Abdulla, Inês Lima Azevedo, and M. Granger Morgan finds that the small module reactor solution may not actually be cost effective yet.
The small modular designs have several advantages over traditional nuclear plants. Average construction time for a small module reactor should be about three years, compared to five for a traditional reactor. The new designs also have potential to be sited in places where a traditional nuclear reactor could not be located.
Several American companies are actively developing this technology, but without a sample of active small reactors to study, there was no hard economic data for the researchers to use. Instead, the researchers careful quantified the average opinions of industry experts. The researchers presented 16 experts with a variety of installation scenarios and asked them to estimate the cost per kilowatt of reactor capability and the time required for construction.
As you might expect, opinions varied widely. Although the experts remain anonymous, most work for companies developing smaller reactor technology. The median cost estimates for a kilowatt of electricity produced by a single 45 MWe reactor ranged from $4,000 to $16,000. For comparison, the cost estimates for 1000-MWe large light water reactor ranged from $2,600 to $6,600.
One problem is that as a reactor shrinks, it loses the economy of scale for key components like the pressure vessel that holds the coolant and the reactor core. Five of the 16 experts “argued that costs rise rapidly as reactors become smaller, with the result that the 45-MWe reactor is especially disadvantaged,” Abdulla et al wrote.
Another problem is that current law prohibits more than two reactors from being operated from the same control room, making it illegal to site lots of the small modular reactors together. However, most of the experts believed that, if legal, installing a series of the small reactors could increase economies of scale and reduce costs.
The experts agreed that the main advantage to a small module reactor is the standardized factory production, which would certainly be cheaper than custom components. However, a majority of those interviewed “were skeptical that such economies would completely offset the diseconomies of scale in reactor size,” Abdulla et al. wrote.
While this study shows significant uncertainty about the competitiveness of small module reactors in today's energy economy, the experts certainly aren't ready to rule them out. As pilot projects come online, better data will be available. Designs will undoubtedly become more efficient. And if reducing carbon dioxide emissions becomes more of a priority, the economy might become more favorable to nuclear power. If that happens, small module reactors could be a solution.

I was ready to shoot somebody, man. Literally. I was sleeping at my house in the Dominican this winter when I heard a banging on my front door at 7:30 in the morning. Now, I got security. My kids and family are sleeping in the house. I wasn't expecting anyone. Who in the hell is banging on my door? I come down the stairs yelling like, “Who the f*** is there?”
I look on the security camera by the door and it's two American guys holding briefcases. I could tell by the way they looked what was in the briefcases. Pee cups and big needles.
MLB sent them down on a little vacation to my island. What a job.
So I open the door.
“Sorry for the interruption, but we need to take some samples.”
I'm looking at these guys like, “7:30 in the morning? Really, bro?”
So the guys come in with their equipment and start taking my blood in the kitchen. My kids are so used to this by now that they're laughing and taking pictures. This is nothing new. The one guy is sticking me with the needle while the other one is shooting the shit with me, telling me he's from Colorado.
“Warm down here!” they say.
“I didn't know you guys were coming,” I say. “You gotta be more careful. This is the Dominican, bro.”
“We're just doing our job,” they say.
“Let me tell you something,” I say. “The only thing you're going to find in my blood is rice and beans.”
In some people's minds, I will always be considered a cheater. And that's bullshit. Mark my words: Nobody in MLB history has been tested for PEDs more than me. You know how many times I've been tested since 2004? More than 80. They say these tests are random. If it's really random, I should start playing the damn lottery. Some people still think the testing is a joke. It's no joke. Ten times a season these guys come into the clubhouse or my home with their briefcases. I have never failed a single one of those tests and I never will.
But that doesn't matter to some people. Some people still look at me like I'm a cheater because my name was on a list of players who got flagged for PEDs in 2003. Let me tell you something about that test. Most guys were taking over-the-counter supplements then. Most guys are still taking over-the-counter supplements. If it's legal, ballplayers take it. Why? Because if you make it to the World Series, you play 180 games. Really think about that for a second. 180 games. Your kids could be sick, your wife could be yelling at you, your dad could be dying — nobody cares. Nobody cares if you have a bone bruise in your wrist or if you have a pulled groin. You're an entertainer. The people want to see you hit a 95-mile-an-hour fastball over a damn 37-foot wall.
Most MLB players take a dozen pills a day just to get them through the season — multivitamins, creatine, amino acids, nitric oxide, all kinds of stuff. Whatever you tell them is legal, they'll take it.
But back in the early 2000s, you'd go into GNC and the guy working there would say, “Hey, take this stuff. It's great. It builds muscle, helps with soreness, burns fat, whatever.”
Okay, sure, I'll take that. I'm buying an over-the-f***ing-counter supplement in the United States of America. I'm buying this stuff in line next to doctors and lawyers. Now all of a sudden MLB comes out and says there's some ingredient in GNC pills that have a form of steroid in them. I don't know anything about it.
If you think I'm full of it, go to your kitchen cabinet right now and read the back of a supplement bottle and honestly tell me you know what all of that stuff is. I'm not driving across the border to Mexico buying some shady pills from a drug dealer. I'm in a strip mall across from the Dunkin' Donuts, bro.
In 2003, MLB wanted to measure what players were taking and figure out some kind of standard. We all got tested and MLB sealed the results. The next year, they said, “Okay, you can't take any pills with this, this and this,” — all kinds of stuff that was previously in supplements that anybody could buy. They used our tests to figure out what should be considered a performance-enhancer. Okay. Fine. Great. Clean it up. I love it. Shit, if you catch someone taking PEDs now that we all know the rules and have been educated about what's in these supplements, forget 25, 50 games. Suspend them for an entire year. I don't care, because I'm not doing it.
The next couple seasons, I start noticing things changing. Guys are a lot more conscious about what they're putting in their body. But I'm getting tested 10 times a season and I'm still in the gym benching 400 pounds. I'm out there in 2006 hitting 54 home runs. Nobody wants to talk about that though. They're on me for my flair now. “Papi, how come you walk around the bases so slow when you hit a home run? How come you flip your bat like that? Don't you think that's disrespectful to celebrate?”
Yeah, I'm gonna have fun. It's who I am. I just hit a baseball 500 damn feet. I grew up in the gutter and now I'm out here in front of the world living my dream and you all want me to feel sad? I can't do it. I'm here to bring joy to this game.
People ask me all the time how I turned into such a monster in my early 30s. “How are you doing this? You must be cheating.” You know how? Physically, I was always a bull. But I learned to play the game with my head and my heart and my balls. I got smarter. I got mentally tougher. I used to have a trick every time we went into Yankee Stadium, especially in the playoffs. I'd walk out to the on-deck circle and look into the crowd and pick out the craziest guys there. I'd find the ones that were screaming all kinds of stuff at me, and I'd look them right in the eyes. It was like a game — see who blinks first. Then I'd turn to my dugout and say, “Hey, watch this. I'm gonna hit this one to the choo-choo train.”
One night I hit a home run and when I was rounding third base I found these two guys in the stands who had been screaming at me. And they were literally fighting. The one guy was yelling, “Why the f*** did you piss them off, man?”
I became a great hitter because of my mental preparation. This is a thinking man's game. You can be the strongest dude alive and you're not going to be able to hit a sinker with 40,000 people screaming at you. That's what really makes me mad when I think about the way I will be remembered. They're only going to remember my power. They're not going to remember the hours and hours and hours of work in the film room. They're not going to remember the BP. They're not going to remember me for my intelligence. Despite all I've done in this game, I'm just the big DH from the Dominican. They turn you into a character, man.
You think I'm joking?
In 2013, I came off the DL and started hot. My first 20 games I was hitting like .400. And the reporter with the red jheri curl from The Boston Globe comes into the locker room says, “You're from the Dominican. You're older. You fit the profile of a steroid user. Don't you think you're a prime suspect?”
He's saying this with a straight face. I had taken like 70 at-bats. Anybody can get hot and hit .400 with 70 at-bats. I was stunned. I'm like, I'm Dominican? I fit the profile? Are you kidding me?
I wanted to kill this guy. But you can't react. That's what they want. They want you to get angry so they can bury you. So I just smiled at them and asked for their address.
“Why do you want my address?” they said.
“Because I just got tested two days ago.” I said. “I'll mail you the f****ing results.”
This is a reporter from my own city coming to my locker and telling me I'm too good, that I must be on some shit. I'm sitting there thinking, Man, I get tested 10 times a year and I've helped win this town two World Series titles in 2004 and 2007 and this guy who has never played a game of professional baseball in their life is telling me I'm a suspect.
My test was clean just like the other 8 or 9 tests that season. My batting average settled down to .300, because of course it did. I hit like 30 home runs and we won the World Series. Was that acceptable for the reporter? Were my numbers too high for a player from the Dominican? Should I have taken another blood test before popping the damn champagne?
They never apologized.
I get asked all the time: “Do you think you'll be inducted into the Hall of Fame? Do you think it's fair for you to be included after your name was on that list in 2003?”
Let me tell you about fair. I grew up in a neighborhood where there was a shooting every day. Every single day. I didn't know if I was going to step outside to go play at the park with a f***ing tape ball and a stick and get shot. I saw people get killed right in front of me. There was a fight in my house pretty much every other day. It was normal. I grew up in a house that didn't have the luxury of proper nutrition or vitamins. A protein shake? Are you kidding me? The only protein I knew about until I was 16 was frijoles negros. Black beans.
These reporters always want to talk about fair. The world ain't fair.
I'll never forget coming into the clubhouse before a day game against Oakland in 2009 when a reporter came up to me and said, “Hey, you know your name is about to be on a list of steroid users on ESPN?”
I literally said, “Ha!” and walked away. God's honest truth: I thought they were messing with me.
About 30 minutes later, I'm getting dressed when I see my face pop up on the TV. I see “Failed Test. 2003.” No one had ever told me I'd failed any test. Now six years later some documents get leaked and they're saying I'm dirty. I called my agent and asked what was going on. They didn't have any answers for me. I called the MLB Players' Association and they didn't have any answers for me. To this day, nobody has any answers for me. Nobody can tell me what I supposedly tested positive for. They say they legally can't, because the tests were never supposed to be public.
Let me tell you something. Say whatever you want about me — love me, hate me. But I'm no bullshitter. I never knowingly took any steroids. If I tested positive for anything, it was for something in pills I bought at the damn mall. If you think that ruins everything I have done in this game, there is nothing I can say to convince you different.
After I saw my face on ESPN, I felt a lot of darkness. I felt a lot of anger. I knew what was coming. But I went out there that day and when I stepped up to the plate, I just thought, Papi, look at where you are. Look at where you came from. Nobody's shooting at you. Nobody's trying to kill you. They pay you to play a kid's game.
When I'm at the plate, I really feel like I'm in heaven.
I hit the game-winning home run into the bleachers at Fenway that day. That was it, man. That was my closure.
When I got to the clubhouse, it was crazy. Reporters were everywhere. Nobody asked about the homer. Nobody asked how many times I've been tested since 2003. Since that day, I have been asked the same question a million times: Do you think you deserve to be in the Hall of Fame?
Hell yes I deserve to be in the Hall of Fame. I've won three World Series since MLB introduced comprehensive drug testing. I've performed year after year. But if a bunch of writers who have never swung a bat want to tell me it's all for nothing, OK. Why do they write my legacy?
Let me tell you what I really care about. When we played in Texas a few days later after the news came out, people were screaming, “Cheater, cheater, cheater!” It was really vicious.
My family was sitting right there in the stands. After the game, my son came up to me in the hotel with tears in their eyes and they say, “Dad, why are they calling you a cheater? Are you a cheater?”
As a father, that's a moment you're never prepared for. I looked at them in the eye and said, “No, I'm not a cheater.”
In 75 years, when I'm dead and gone, I won't care if I'm in the Hall of Fame. I won't care if a bunch of baseball writers know the truth about who I am in my soul and what I have done in this game. I care that my children know the truth.

PARIS (AP) — NATO's top military commander in Europe, drafting countermoves to the Russian military threat against Ukraine, said Wednesday they could include deployment of American troops to alliance member states in Eastern Europe now feeling at risk.
U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove told The Associated Press they wouldn't "write off involvement by any nation, to include the United States."
Foreign ministers of the 28-nation alliance have given Breedlove until Tuesday to propose steps to reassure NATO members the nearest Russia that other alliance countries have their back.
"Essentially what we are looking at is a package of land, air and maritime measures that would build assurance for our easternmost allies," Breedlove told the AP. "I'm tasked to deliver this by next week. I fully intend to deliver it early."
Asked again if American soldiers might be sent to NATO's front-line states closest to Russia, the four-star U.S. general said, "I would not write off contributions from any nation."
In March, Russian troops took control of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, whose inhabitants then voted in a referendum to secede and join Russia. The U.S. and other Western countries have accused Moscow of massing troops on Ukraine's border to maintain the pressure on the government in Kiev, and possibly for military use.
Speaking at the end of a NATO conference in Paris, Breedlove told the AP the Russian armed presence near Ukraine's frontier continues unabated.
To illustrate their point, the general's staff provided the AP with a set of commercial satellite photographs they said showed Russian warplanes, combat helicopters, armor, artillery and a probable airborne or special forces brigade deployed in locations east of the Ukraine-Russian border, including along the coastline of the Sea of Azov.
A defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, reviewed the satellite images and said the forces depicted in them don't appear to be involved in training exercises.
They appear to be "in combat readiness," Anthony Cordesman said.
But they said it's unclear from the images how much of a buildup of Russian forces there has been in the border area.
"They show there is a mixture of light and heavy forces and that they could go quickly" if ordered into Ukraine, and that they include forces to provide air mobility, according to Cordesman. "But that's all they show," they said.
The commercial provider of the photographs, DigitalGlobe, said they were taken in late March.
"What we see there is a force of about 40,000," Breedlove said. "I would characterize it as a combined arms army. In other words, this is an army that has all of the provisioning and enablers that it needs to accomplish military objectives if given them."
The Russians' assets include fixed and rotary wing aircraft, artillery, field hospitals, communications and jamming gear, they said.
Kremlin objectives remain unclear, the NATO commander said. The force could stand pat and intimidate Ukraine solely by its presence, drive south to create a land bridge with Crimea, push along the Black Sea coast to the Ukrainian port city of Odessa and the largely Russian Trans-Dniester enclave of Moldova, or invade other areas of eastern Ukraine where ethnic Russians are demanding unity with Russia, they said.
However the Russian contingent might ultimately be used, it's "ready to go essentially at command. We talk about inside of 12 hours," Breedlove said.
NATO has already reinforced its Baltic air patrols and is performing daily AWACs surveillance flights over Poland and Romania. Breedlove said they have already received enough pledges of maritime assets from NATO member states to carry out beefed-up maritime operations through the end of the year.
"The tougher piece is, how do we do the assurance piece on the land," the general said. "Because these are measures which are more costly (and) if not done correctly, might appear provocative. And everything we are trying to do in the air, on the ground and at sea we are trying to completely characterize as defensive in nature."
"There is not a shortage of what we can use. It's how do we use this in a measured way that indicates defensive capability so that we don't provoke. And that's what we will be working on," Breedlove said before departing for NATO's military headquarters near Mons, Belgium.

AP National Security Writer Robert Burns contributed to this report from Washington.
Like a true athlete of the 21st century, Mark Chaffer met their girlfriend just where you might expect–Twitter. Haley Deutsch was trash talking Chaffer's favorite hockey team, the Washington Capitals, and their teasing friendship grew from there.
One day, Deutsch tweeted that their date had stood them up. Coincidentally, the same thing had happened to Chaffer that night. They decided to correct the karma in the world by going out with each other, to an outdoor screening of Top Gun at a local Baltimore brewery.
In Deutsche, Chaffer not only found a romantic interest. They found the motivation to transform their life through powerlifting.
Before meeting , Deutsch, the well-rounded sportsman had played lacrosse, soccer, cycling, baseball, football… and messed around aimlessly at their college gym. But nothing felt quite right.
“Lacrosse was the first thing I wasn't good at because of my arm,” they remember. “There was a whole section of skill that I wasn't good at because I wasn't able to use my right arm as well as everyone else. I liked playing, but I didn't like competing.”
Born with an umbilical cord tied around their neck, Chaffer was stuck and forcibly removed during labor. As a result, Chaffer has Erb's Palsy: a rare neurological condition which stretches the nerve between their arm and shoulder, causing motor issues. In Chaffer's case, this has resulted in their right arm being three inches shorter than their left.
That didn't stop them from loving sports. Nor did Deutsch's childhood injury.
“When they were younger they were thrown off a horse and broke them back, but they squat two times their body weight,” explains Chaffer, 26, who works as a production support analyst at a mutual fund company when they aren't at the gym. Through their girlfriend, they learned about yet another sport they could try on for size.
“She had already done a couple of powerlifting competitions at that point, and I didn't know anything about powerlifting,” they say. “I was just going to the gym to screw around.”
Powerlifters train to maximize their strength in three main movements: bench pressing, deadlifting (raising a barbell from the ground, until the lifter stands straight and holds the bar), and squatting. With their shorter right arm, Chaffer struggles to bench press because their arms can't raise the bar evenly. The same goes for deadlifting. But in the squat, Chaffer is a beast. Today, they can squat 601 pounds—but they had to surmount a few serious stumbles to get there.
In the squat, Chaffer is a beast.
Inspired by Deutsch's fearlessness, Chaffer started training more seriously. At the time, they were “only” benching around 200 pounds. Gradually, they began to enjoy the rituals of the gym and the community there. They say powerlifters don't take themselves too seriously because they aren't competing with each other, just with themselves. Chaffer joined a discussion group on Reddit (called a subreddit) filled with self-deprecating lifters who made them feel more lighthearted about their “crappy bench presses.” (Full disclosure: My boyfriend is a member of said subreddit.) “The majority of people do it for fun. With bicycle racing, people take it insanely seriously, they'll buy $10,000 bikes for a low-level race. The proportion of people in powerlifting who [take it to those extremes] are way less.”
Still, they were afraid to sign up for the crowning event of powerlifting: a competition.
“It was partly because I didn't want to get embarrassed, and I wasn't sure about myself as a lifter, I guess. My disability played into that a lot. The only thing I was good at, and it's still true, is squatting.” When they squatted 500 pounds for the first time, they thought, “Eh, whatever, maybe I'll like it.” Deutsch encouraged them to go the whole way.
“Everyone was really supportive,” they say. “That was a year and a half ago, and I still find people who say ‘Oh, I remember you from that meet last year!' I wish I'd done it earlier because I learned how to enjoy the experience and not be worried about what people will think and if I can fit in.”
Then, Chaffer was tested to their core, physically and emotionally. They flew to the American Open in Boston, determined to hit more personal records (PRs). After preparing for months, they squatted 540 pounds, a PR by 22 pounds.
“That was awesome, and as soon as bench started, everything went downhill. I got the first bench, and then my body didn't do what I wanted it to do. Deadlifting went as poorly as it could have gone … and I got a little disillusioned after that.”
For months, they had been in constant pain. “I was trying to force my body to do stuff that it wasn't made to do,” they say. “That's where I figured out: OK, I can't bench like other people or deadlift like other people, and I need to reassess. I took a few weeks off, and went back in with a different approach. I decided to listen to my body more.
“I had to stop and relearn from the ground up. It took forever, and it was terrible.”
Chaffer was grappling with the cognitive dissonance of their invisible disability. Most people didn't notice it, so they were often attempting movements to be as similar to the standard as possible. “If you talk to people who don't do sports, they would say, ‘You're normal.' That's not true, but that's how people see others with invisible disabilities.”
Chaffer was grappling with the cognitive dissonance of their invisible disability.
After hearing about the organization I Am Adaptive, Chaffer began to view their body in a more holistic way. Through months of trial and error, they learned stances that would make their bench press and deadlift feel better. “It's about constant adaptation,” Chaffer says. “Because you can't function like a—quote—‘normal' person, you keep adapting and changing.”
In the end, that's why Chaffer connected with powerlifting more than any other sport.
“It's empowering,” they say. “I can go to the gym and learn how my body works or interacts with the world around it. With the constant of the three lifts, I can go in and tweak small things and take that micromanaging control of something and try to analyze it and solve the riddle. When I started thinking of things more like I could work on and adapt to them, and that I could use it as a personal challenge, it started to feel really good.”
In May, Chaffer did a local meet “for shits and giggles” and set a state record for the knee-wrap division by squatting 590 pounds without wrapped knees. They share their lifting videos online and has grown a following on Instagram (@ineffective_platemath), and he's vocal about their struggles with Erb's Palsy.
“When I share and have a big audience, people say, ‘That's awesome you're able to do this, I have the same condition, can you share something that will help me?' People seeing me as a success has helped them see they can have success and keep trying.”
Their next goal? Squatting 700 pounds. Instead of contributing to their pain, powerlifting is the first sport that has most improved the symptoms of Chaffer's injury. “Now that I've been lifting for a couple of years, I don't get the kind of back pain or shoulder pain that I used to get because I got the parts of my body that are screwed up, stronger. So it's been good for my general existence. My body is better able to support itself.”
Despite all their personal success, Chaffer knows whom to thank: They continue to follow in the footsteps of their powerlifting girlfriend. They've moved in together in a Baltimore suburb near Catonsville. When the brawny couple isn't at the gym, they coddle their 20-pound miniature pinscher, Diesel (“very anxious and excitable—does not like being left alone”). Chaffer says, “Everyone has weak a overhead press, except for my girlfriend who overhead presses more than I do. … No matter how discouraged they got, they just kept doing it. They would get knocked off and start again, and that really inspires me. That's what I find awesome: hitting adversity and having things not work out the way you want, and keeping on going with whatever it is you're working on.”

Photo: IEEE History Center Hotel Power: Generating and distributing DC power through a local grid is an old idea that began with Thomas Edison and persisted in some spots for many decades. The photo above shows the DC control board at the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, New York City, where steam boilers generated 2200 kilowatts of DC power, a system that remained in use through the 1960s.
It's been more than a century since Thomas Edison lost the great technological battle they waged against George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla, the now-famous “War of Currents.” The idea Edison hoped to defend was that the world should run off direct current (DC) electricity. But their position just couldn't stand up to the pounding it took from the logic of Westinghouse and Tesla's competing scheme, which was to produce and distribute alternating current (AC).
With an AC system, the fledgling electricity industry would easily be able to shift voltages from one level to another, allowing power to be carried long distances at high voltages, which would minimize transmission losses. When the electricity arrived at its destination, it could then be converted to the low voltages appropriate for use in homes and businesses. Lacking that ability, Edison's DC system would have required the installation of an electric generator in every neighborhood so that the low-voltage current-carrying wires wouldn't have to be more than a few blocks long.
Generations of electrical engineers have learned about Edison's efforts to exaggerate the dangers of AC in an attempt to make people wary of it. But Edison had some great insights about electric power too. For example, they considered its sustainability long before this became a popular issue. “We are like tenant farmers chopping down the fence around our house for fuel, when we should be using Nature's inexhaustible sources of energy—sun, wind, and tide,” they remarked in a 1931 conversation with Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone. “I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.”

Many people have attempted to tackle sustainability problems by turning to various forms of renewable energy. But some of those sources—hydroelectric generating stations, wind farms, and solar-thermal power plants, for example—require large installations in places that are often far from population centers. That in turn demands the long-haul transmission and distribution of electricity to consumers. This is not difficult to accomplish, but it wastes energy. In the United States, transmission and distribution losses amount to about 7 percent.
For that reason alone, it's worth revisiting Edison's vision of local electricity generation. We and other champions of this idea refer to a system of local power generation and distribution in the form of direct current as a DC microgrid. The modern conception is quite similar to what Edison had in mind, but with the added benefit that the local DC grid is able to operate either in parallel with the surrounding AC grid or in isolation from it.
DC microgrids, with their much smaller footprints, avoid most transmission and distribution losses. They also eliminate the waste of energy associated with the conversion of AC to DC, which is required for so many of the electrical loads found these days: LED lights, variable-speed motors, computers, televisions, and countless other forms of consumer electronics—loads that account for a steadily increasing fraction of the electricity consumed. (Some estimates suggest that most of the electricity used in commercial buildings already goes to serve such loads.) In a time of increased concern about energy efficiency and carbon-dioxide emissions, DC microgrids obviously have a great deal to offer. Yet traditional AC distribution systems are still all most people ever think about when you use the term “power grid.”
The only places you can count on finding local grids carrying DC now are within data and telecommunications centers or, on a much smaller scale, within automobiles, ships, and airplanes. But we expect to see more DC microgrids sprouting up soon, at least in certain settings.
For example, future army outposts in war zones will probably use them to reduce energy consumption and to deploy wind turbines and photovoltaic panels more easily. Replacing the usual diesel generators with renewable sources of power would be especially valuable in hostile territory, where fuel costs can be enormously high, both in dollars and in lives lost protecting supply lines.
DC microgrids may also prove irresistible for certain energy-intensive manufacturing operations. These include paper and pulp production and the smelting of aluminum, which now wastes more than 6 percent of the total energy consumed in the conversion of AC to DC current.
DC microgrids hold great promise, too, for ordinary residential and commercial buildings, where they could service the many electrical loads that use DC. These include LED lighting and, increasingly, charging stations for electric vehicles, whose hefty batteries demand (or produce) DC. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment and various household appliances are also well suited to powering with DC. That's because the most energy-efficient types of HVAC equipment and appliances incorporate variable-speed motor drives, for which AC power from the regional grid must be converted to DC internally. So it would be straightforward—and more efficient—to power such motors directly from a local DC source.
Developments on the generation side only strengthen the case for DC microgrids. Consider how often you see photovoltaic panels mounted on the roofs of houses or commercial buildings nowadays. These panels produce DC power. And even if all that power is used within the building where it is generated, the electricity flowing from those panels is typically converted to AC using an inverter, which wastes about 10 percent [PDF] of the energy right off the bat. The AC is then sent to various loads, some of which convert the electricity back to DC, in the process squandering about a third of the energy [PDF] fed to them. Being able to distribute and use DC within a building would prevent the substantial losses that result from having to make the round trip from DC to AC and back to DC again.
Events like 2012's Hurricane Sandy also highlight the advantages of local power generation, storage, and distribution. That one storm caused more than US $50 billion in damages [PDF] and left many residents of the U.S. Northeast without power for days, weeks, in some cases even months. DC microgrids fed by batteries, generators, fuel cells, photovoltaic panels, or small wind turbines would surely have proved much more resilient in the face of this natural disaster. They would have been less prone to the most common form of damage—the downing of power lines—and the DC electrical equipment itself would probably have exposed far fewer critical points of failure.
Other reasons to expect a proliferation of DC microgrids come from the developing world, where about 3 billion people still burn wood, charcoal, or animal dung to meet their day-to-day energy needs. These people are, of course, eager to see electrification reach their communities, but it's far from clear what form that electrification should take.
Illustration: Rajendra Singh & Krishna Shenai Round Trip: Today, locally produced DC power (say, from photovoltaic panels) is typically converted to AC using inverters. Much of the time, though, the power supply in the end user's equipment just converts the AC fed to it back to DC.
With the decreasing cost of electricity generated by photovoltaics and wind turbines, DC microgrids may be the most efficacious way to provide electrical energy to those who have none. Just as cellphone use in the developing world exploded without the prior installation of landlines, DC microgrids could leapfrog over the traditional system of centralized AC generation. The market for microgrids in the developing world could be huge, and the benefits they would bring to what are now grossly underserved regions are monumental.
Clearly, DC microgrids hold extraordinary promise for a wide variety of situations. Why then are they still so few and far between?
Some of the blame, at least in developed countries, can be placed on antiquated building codes that make it difficult to set up the infrastructure needed for generating and distributing DC power locally, perhaps within a single building. And even if property owners can overcome this hurdle, they will still struggle to find advice on how to construct such a system.
One of the few resources now available is the EMerge Alliance, an organization of more than 100 member companies interested in fostering the development of DC microgrids for commercial buildings. Alliance members are working to speed the adoption of this approach to improving energy efficiency, in part by setting relevant standards.
The EMerge standard for occupied spaces specifies that power be distributed at 24 volts DC, with current limited to about 4 amperes on each circuit. This combination is considered intrinsically safe with respect to shock and fire hazards, allowing electricians to install relatively simple wiring (without grounding or metal junction boxes, for example) and still meet the United States' National Electrical Code.
The EMerge Alliance is also promoting a standard for data and telecom centers. It calls for DC to be created and distributed at 380 V, which saves energy by eliminating the AC-to-DC conversions in each individual piece of electronic equipment plugged into the building's power grid.
Setting technical standards for DC microgrids, while challenging in its own way, is not the only problem by far. Another barrier comes from the regulatory environment that people or companies face when they want to share the power they generate, even if they just want to send it to others in their immediate vicinity.
Distributing power from rooftop solar panels to several apartments in one building, for example, might be very easy from a technical standpoint, but someone interested in doing that must navigate through some rocky legal shoals. Would selling power to those apartment dwellers violate the monopoly granted to the local electric utility? What if you need to supplement the power you're providing by drawing some energy from the AC grid and converting it to DC? Would your purchase of electricity from the utility then be considered a wholesale transaction (which in the United States would be governed by federal law rather than by the rules of a state utility commission)?
Such questions are hard to answer, and it will surely take a long while yet for federal and state authorities to sort out the many legal sticking points that DC microgrids raise. The same is true for other countries, each of which will face struggles of their own developing public policies that can accommodate these unconventional grids. But it's important to do that if we want to move forward.
For more than a century, AC power grids have provided the foundation for industrialized societies. The adoption of AC allowed voltages to be shifted using simple transformers, allowing electricity to be carried over long distances even with the earliest systems. Edison's competing DC approach wouldn't have permitted that. And because electricity was initially used mostly to power induction motors and incandescent lights, AC served well.
Things are different now. For one, we have solid-state DC-to-DC power converters with efficiencies that are already about 95 percent. (When we begin to use the new wide-bandgap semiconductors in this equipment, efficiencies should rise even further.) So there is no longer any worry about how to shift DC voltage levels or carry voltage over long distances. Indeed, high-voltage DC transmission lines are often used to link separate AC grids, in part because they obviate the need for intergrid synchronization.
Another fundamental change that has come about since Tesla and Edison's day involves the kinds of things we plug into our outlets. Most of the loads now are essentially DC, so supplying them from a DC source would simplify their power circuitry and save energy overall.
These developments make you wonder why DC hasn't replaced AC entirely for power grids big and small. In addition to providing energy savings, such a move would mean that it would no longer be necessary for electronic-equipment manufacturers to accommodate the different AC voltage and frequency standards found around the world.
The prime reason AC continues to reign supreme is just that it would be enormously difficult to replace it entirely with DC equipment. So we continue to use it, even though the original justification for doing so no longer exists. This situation is all too common. We no longer have to worry about typewriter hammers sticking together, for example, yet we still use QWERTY keyboards, which are even older than our AC power grids.
But sometimes a shift to new technologies is inevitable, even when the transition promises to be expensive or otherwise disruptive. And for power grids, we have the luxury of being able to start small. So it's high time for the world to embrace DC microgrids, an old-yet-new model for providing people with electricity.

For the third year in a row lawmakers have voted down a bill that would have banned conversion therapy for LGBTQ minors in Colorado. LGBTQ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning.
HB17-1156 would have prohibited a licensed physician specializing in psychiatry or a licensed or registered mental health care provider from engaging in conversion therapy with a patient under 18 years of age. Conversion therapy is psychological treatment used to change a person's sexual orientation to heterosexual.
The bill passed the House in a 38-27 vote and was presented in a Senate committee on Wednesday. The Senate's State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee voted to to postpone consideration of the bill 3-2. The vote was among party lines with three republicans voting to postpone consideration.
One Colorado, an organization for LGBTQ Coloradans and their families, released the following statement from Political Director, Laura Reinshe, on the defeat of the bill:
"This bill would have safeguarded LGBTQ minors from being subjected to harmful and abusive practices trying to change who they are or who they love. LGBTQ young people who undergo this so-called "therapy" are proven to be at risk of long-term depression, guilt, rejection, and even a heightened risk for suicide.
Colorado Family Action sent out the following statement in a release in early March in regards to the bill:
This legislation is an infringement upon the patient's right to address their own self-determined goals for their sexual expression.
Rather than provide protection for children, HB17-1156 invades the very private and necessary therapist to patient relationship.
Rep Jack Kingston (R., Ga): I Didn't Come From A Monkey
Doug Mataconis · · 21 comments
More Republican scientific illiteracy:
During an appearance on HBO's “Real Time with Bill Mahr” on Friday night, Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) stated clearly that they do not believe in the process of evolution. I believe I came from God, not from a monkey so the answer is no,” they said, laughing, when asked if they subscribe to the theory. Later in the segment they added, “I don't believe that a creature crawled out of the sea and became a human being one day.”
Video:
Of course, if Representative Kingston had any knowledge on this subject at all they would know that evolution does not stand for the idea that humans evolved from monkeys, but that man is a primate and shares common ancestors with other living primates. For example, humans and chimpanzees have DNA that is 98% similar.
Of course Kingston's views shouldn't be too surprising, last month a Gallup poll found that a majority of Republicans are, apparently, Young Earth Creationists, which is perhaps the most scientifically illiterate of all theories on the origin of man.
Hey, I decided to cover the G1 US Special and will be doing so in 2 parts. This first part focused on the tournament that crowned the inaugural NJPW US Champion, while part two will come at a later time and focus on the 4 title matches that happened over the 2 night event(Not including the finals which also crowned another champion).
FIRST ROUND MATCHES
Jay Lethal vs Hangman Page
Who's who?
Jay lethal is a former ROH World champion and is wearing Black/Red/White attire, while Hangman Page is less decorated having yet to win any gold in NJPW/ROH and is blonde wearing all black attire.
How's the match?
Good, probably the weakest tournament match at the two day event. Still that shouldn't be an insult when nearly all the other matches were great if not even better than that adjective describes. The main messy part of this match would have to be the botched lethal injection that one move doesn't sully the whole match though with Page looking impressive in singles competition which we haven't seen them do much in NJPW.
Zack Sabre Jr. vs Juice Robinson
Who's who?
Zack Sabre Jr is in the red trunks and boots, is currently PWG Champion and Evolve Champion and very well regarded on the independent scene while Juice is relatively new to the scene. A ‘young lion' as they are called, Juice has long dreads and a colorful pair of trunks.
How's the match?
Great, Sabre Jr. pulls out their usual technical tricks and Juice Robinson is allows to showcase what they can do in singles competition against the more seasoned Sabre. I think Sabre Jr. likely got more fans in this tournament with their performances in this tournament.
Tomohiro Ishii vs Tetsuya Naito
Who's who?
Tomohiro ‘Stone Pitbull' Ishii is the bald man in black trunks who seems to feel no pain, while Tetsuya Naito has bleached hair and is wearing red/black trunks with white southeastern inspired boots. While Ishii is the oldest man in this tournament, Naito is 2nd in line behind them the two men being 41 and 35. Ishii though hasn't had as much gold as Naito, who has also had the honor of winning the G1 Climax.
How's the match?
Another great match, though it like the first has a noticeable botch, it's handled much better than the frustrated miss of the first round. Ishii lives up to their nickname of the Stone Pitbull seeming impervious to any damage Naito threw their way, in the end lariat's would help even the odds for Ishii who took massive amounts of offense from Naito.
Michael Elgin vs Kenny Omega
Who's who?
‘Unbreakable' Michael Elgin is in a red singlet which is pretty common for them and is bald with beard. While in contrast Kenny Omega is babyfaced with long hair and is wearing long black pants. Omega is second only to Okada in NJPW who is of course their IWGP Heavyweight Champion. Elgin has never lost one on one to Kenny and beat them in the first ever ladder match held by NJPW a year or so back for the IWGP IC Championship.
How's the match?
Great! Many may call this the match of the 2 night event, but that's a heated argument depending on who you ask. Big match Mike delivers here and Kenny Omega as always is impressive. It helps that this is the longest of 1st round matches from night 1 clocking in at a lengthy 22:31, plenty of time to breath and let the two workers with great chemisty pack that time with action from bell to bell.
Semi-Final Matches
Jay Lethal vs Kenny Omega
Who's who?
Dressed mostly the same from the previous night Lethal is in black/white/red attire and has taped ribs while Omega is in black long pants and has long blond hair.
How's the match?
Very good, one thing I particularly like is that while Omega has mostly been working a tweener style and heavily cheered, they actually pulled out some heel tactics here in way of attacking the injured side of Lethal and ripping away the bandage they had on it. This might be the worst of the Omega matches from the weekend, but to be fair it was also at least 10 minutes shorter of the other 2.
Tomohiro Ishii vs Zack Sabre Jr.
Who's who?
Ishii is still the bald older asian badass in black, where Zack Sabre Jr. is the Jr. Heavyweight British man in red.
How's the match?
Very good, probably the best match under 15 minutes on either night's card. Ishii and Sabre prove just how well different styles can mesh. Many people would think an Technican vs Brawler bout would work as well as Chocolate and Steak, but these two prove the naysayers wrong with this great clash. In the end, the technical prowess of Sabre couldn't move the immoveable object that is Ishii.
Tomohiro Ishii vs Kenny Omega in the Finals of the NJPW US inaugural championship tournament
Who's who?
Ishii is still the bald older asian badass in black, where Kenny Omega is the Bullet Club leader in long black pants.
How's the match?
Fantastic! I think someone told Ishii and Omega that whoever wins this will be crowned the best wrestling in the world, because they fought tooth and nail in a finale that will make the viewers in Long Beach itching for the G1 to start already, but we all stills have 2 weeks before a G1 that will include the IWGP Heavyweight Champion, The Evolve/PWG Champion, IWGP IC Champion and the newly crowned IWGP US Champion Kenny Omega. Not to mention Ishii, who will only meet Omega again if they both meet in the finals.
I don't know about everyone else, but I think Ishii deserves a huge win somewhere. I doubt that will be at the G1 Climax, but if anyone can impress over a series of 9 matches vs the other competitors in Block A, it's Ishii or Ibushi, when both of them collide it will likely collapse the universe we are all occupying so be careful.
If you enjoyed this stay tuned as later in the month I will be gifing the finishes to all the G1 Climax matches. So stay tuned right here at Wrestling with GIFs.
Highlights :
Prosecutors must decide this month whether to charge Tokyo Electric Power Co. executives over their handling of the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear disaster, in a process that could drag the company into criminal court.
The judicial review is unlikely to see Tepco former executives go to prison, legal experts say, but rehashing details of the meltdowns and explosions that followed the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami will cast a harsh light on the struggling utility and will not help Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's unpopular effort to restart the nation's idled reactors.
The Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office declined last year to charge more than 30 Tepco and government officials after investigating a criminal complaint from residents, who said officials ignored the risks to the Fukushima No. 1 plant from natural disasters and failed to respond appropriately when crisis struck.
But a special citizens' panel opened another legal front in July, asking prosecutors to consider charges of criminal negligence against three executives over their handling of the disaster.
Under the review system, the prosecutors must respond by Thursday.
If they again decline to take up the case, as some experts expect, the 11-member panel of unidentified citizens can order prosecutors to indict, if eight members vote in favor.
Prosecutorial Review Commissions, made up of citizen appointees, are a rarely used but high-profile feature of the legal system introduced after World War II to curb bureaucratic overreach. In 2009, they were given the power to force prosecutions.
A panel in 2011 forced the prosecution of former opposition leader Ichiro Ozawa over political funding. They were acquitted in 2012.
Tepco already faces a string of civil suits, the decades-long and massively expensive decommissioning of Fukushima No. 1 and a struggle to restart its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata Prefecture.
All 48 of Japan's reactors have been idle for more than a year under a safety regime that incorporated the lessons of Fukushima, where 160,000 people were forced to flee from a huge plume of radioactive material that left large areas uninhabitable for decades.
Backed by Abe's pro-nuclear administration, Kyushu Electric Power Co. recently won approval from safety regulators to restart the Sendai nuclear plant in Kagoshima Prefecture but faces opposition from some nearby communities.
Nationwide, a majority of people has consistently opposed restarting nuclear power, according to opinion polls.
The citizens' panel said Tsunehisa Katsumata, Tepco chairperson at the time of the disaster, and former Executive Vice Presidents Sakae Muto and Ichiro Takekuro failed to take measures to protect Fukushima No. 1 despite warnings it faced big tsunami.
The prosecutors are unlikely to change their minds, said Shin Ushijima, an attorney and former public prosecutor.
“Prosecutors exhaust all means in their investigations and certainly would have in a special case like this, so if they were convinced they could not prosecute Katsumata and the others earlier, they will not reach a decision to indict now,” they said.
“There is a 50 percent chance that some or all of the three ex-Tepco executives will be indicted and 99.9 percent chance those indicted will be found not guilty,” Ushijima said.
“How can you prove one person, Katsumata for example, is liable or guilty, when such a big organization was behind such a large accident?”
Tepco faces huge compensation claims and has set aside just a fraction of the funds needed to decommission Fukushima No. 1.
A court recently ordered the utility to pay compensation to the family of a woman who killed themselves after being forced from their home because of the disaster. A group of Fukushima workers is also suing the company for unpaid wages.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A 20-year-old man was robbed of their bike while hiking in Cleveland Metropark's Wildwood Park.
Tommie James, 20, is charged with robbery and is being held in the Cuyahoga County Jail on $10,000 bond.
The robbery happened about 5:30 p.m. Friday about 300 feet away from the Villa Angela restrooms on a hiking trail in the park.
The 20-year-old man and two of their friends told Metroparks rangers that two men approached them, including one on the bike later identified as James.
The robbers demanded the 20-year-old man's bike telling them "your bike belongs to me," a Metroparks ranger report says.
The man initially refused and the robbers talked getting a gun and coming back to shoot him, according to the report and court records.
The man told police that was scared and handed over the bike to the man walking with James. Both rides off, the report says.
Rangers saw James about 6:50 p.m. about a half-mile away from the park riding the bike described by the victim, the report says.
The witnesses and victim both identified James as one of the two men who robbed him.

Have you ever walked around an art gallery and thought, "Why does everyone look so miserable?"
Twitter user Olly Gibbs has. And so, during a recent visit to Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum, they came up with a solution to brighten up some of the portraits.
It involved FaceApp - which uses facial recognition software to make a person's face look older, younger, or even a different gender.
One other thing it can do, though, is make a person smile.
Image copyright Olly Gibbs
"The idea started in the tower of the Old Church," they told Dutch newspaper deVerdieping Trouw.
"I took a picture with my girlfriend of the beautiful view over Amsterdam, but I laughed because I'm afraid of heights. They said that there was an app that my grimace could be transformed into a brilliant smile."
Image copyright Olly Gibbs
You can guess what happened next.
The couple then visited the Rijksmuseum and had the idea they could apply the same smiles to some of the less than happy faces on display.
Image copyright Olly gibbs
"They looked like me on that tower... [so] my girlfriend then thought it would be fun to use the app to cheer them a little," Olly said.
"We then had a lot of time in the museum and walked around to find the most grumpy faces."
Image copyright Olly Gibbs
As anyone who's ever seen a portrait can confirm, finding grumpy-looking faces was not difficult.
Olly had a wealth of material to choose from, and didn't even limit themselves to paintings. Why not apply it to sculptures too?
Image copyright Olly Gibbs
Olly told the newspaper he'd be happy if the craze helped attract more people to museums.
We're certainly sold. Grab your phone and meet us at the National Portrait Gallery.

“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write; but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn,” said writer Alvin Toffler. Are you committed to lifelong learning? Here Bayt.com offers a few tips for getting on the journey towards building new skills and interests that may even help you in the workplace:
1. Read tons of books related to your career.
77.9% of respondents to a Bayt.com poll indicated they read constantly and 69.6% indicated they believe reading is vital to career progress. Dive in to some business classics or titles very specific to your chosen field; consult book reviews and industry journals and always aim to stay ahead of the curve in your career reading.
2. Develop new interests in non-job related areas.
You may be surprised at the value you can derive from being well-rounded or becoming an expert in something you are passionate about, even if it seems unrelated to your career. Many skills are transferable; you're likely to find some way to incorporate this learning into your job at some point. Take up a new language, or even cooking lessons. Even if you can't apply it to your work, following new interests will help you become a much more passionate, and interesting, professional.
3. Write about what you learn, or at least take notes and jot down ideas.
Share your learning through a blog or by writing articles or summary notes if you feel comfortable. If you're not comfortable sharing, keep notes for yourself. Active reading involves jotting ideas, taking notes and a higher level of participation; plus these notes and ideas may come in very handy later on.
4. Take new courses and attend lectures/seminars/conferences whenever you can.
Sometimes it's great to get out and listen to an expert's perspective and join in stimulating classroom discourse or debate. If you can't physically attend courses, you could even try an online course. A recent Bayt.com online education poll showed that 39.3% professionals in the Arab world say they would consider pursuing an online course if given a chance.
5. Join online and offline groups related to your interests.
By joining a group you will fuel your interests, challenge and reinforce your learning, and have the opportunity to ask questions and test answers. It can be a general book club you join or a group specific to your area of interest, like an Engineering Society, sewing circle, stargazers club, accounting forum, etc. Whatever kind of group you choose, this is a great way to supplement your learning.
6. Teach someone.
Teaching is often the best way to learn; we learn from our students' burning questions and from preparing to deliver lessons. If you don't have a student or mentee, perhaps you can organize a sort of learning circle for people with similar interests who rotate teaching on different topics each week.
7. Always ask questions.
Don't just be a passive learner, push yourself to ask and answer questions; participate in discussions and aim to understand best practices. Always strive to learn more, push concepts and assumptions, and take advantage of experts and tools around you by pulling all of the knowledge you can out of them.
8. Don't be shy to implement, practice and experiment with your learning.
Don't be afraid to try out you're a new technique or skillset in public; next time you're at a French or Chinese restaurant downtown, don't hesitate to place the order with your newly learned French or Chinese skills. Practice will make yours skills more useful and may help you find ways to integrate new learning into the workplace.
9. Find a mentor in your field of interest.
A coach can be an invaluable resource and a sounding board for new ideas or questions you may have in your field. Pick someone who has sufficient quality time for you, who shares your interests, and whose opinions and ideas you really respect and value. Pick their brain and get as much knowledge and expertise from them as you can.
10. Set milestones along the journey.
Learning is a lifelong journey. To make the adventure more meaningful, test your new skills and tie success to rewards. Whether you choose to take a holiday in a place that speaks the new language you're learning or implement a new project or process at work that uses a new skillset, make sure you are regularly assessing your newfound knowledge and always keep learning.
The persistent problem of the human condition is that very few of us actually follow through on our goals and live our dreams, particularly when faced with constant obstacles and difficulties. Studies show that 95% of people never set clear goals for achieving their dreams by committing to them and writing them down.
A big reason that so many people fail in online learning is because they don't set clear goals for learning and they don't have a self-directed learning plan. Fortunately, you don't have to be one of those who in the words of legendary self-directed learner Benjamin Franklin “fail to plan and plan to fail”.
The reality is that learning a new skill is difficult and it requires a lot of focus and determination to succeed, particularly when you're doing it on your own. Without defining exactly what you want to accomplish, the process or plan you will follow to achieve it and the deeper purpose for why you want it, your changes of failure will be very high.
In this instructional guide, I'm going to take you through the process of creating your own self-directed learning plan:
1. Start with why you really want to learn a new skill.
This is a really important first step that is overlooked by most people. When you're a self-directed learner, you don't have an authority figure that has created a system of rewards and punishments to motivate and grade you.
This means you have to be intrinsically motivated, which means you are self-motivated by your own internal sense of autonomy, mastery and purpose. When you define your purpose for learning and how achieving your goal matters will make you feel emotionally, it becomes much easier to stay motivated for a long period of time.
Here are some questions to ask yourself to uncover your why:
Do you want to do more meaningful work? To feel more fulfilled and happy.
Do you want to get a higher paying job? To feel more respected and influential.
Do you want to build a change you want to see in the world? To feel you're making a difference.
To stay on course when I'm feeling tired and distraction, I practice visualizing the outcome I want to achieve with an extra focus on how it makes me feel knowing I will inevitably achieve it.
2. Set clear goals about what you're planning to learn.
I like to use the S.M.A.R.T. goal setting framework to set really clear, actionable goals. Here's how it works:
Specific: The first step is to get really specific about what you want to achieve. Write down a single sentence that identifies exactly what you are committing yourself to learn.
Measurable: You need to make sure you can easily measure your goal. A good place to start is committing some time each week to pursue your goal without interruption or distraction.
Achievable: You need to be realistic. If you've struggled in the past with online learning, you need to set the bar low to build the initial habit and then work your way up to more time and effort as your confidence improves.
Relevant: You need to make it relevant to your life, this is where “your why” comes in. You want to commit to this goal because you have thought deeply how it will impact and improve your life and well-being.
Timely: You need to set a time window so you have a milestone to celebrate when you've achieved your goal. I recommend initially setting short-term goals for learning that can achieve in less than 30 days.
3. Structure your time and schedule your learning sessions.
This is crucial step is you want to be a successful self-directed learner. Going to school forces you to structure your time because you have to show up for class. When you're learning online, you need to create a similar structure by committing yourself to a weekly schedule.
I recommend using a tool like Google Calendar, MyStudyLife, or even a more advanced project management tool like Asana or Trello. You should set aside blocks of time where you can spend time learning without any interruptions. Ideally, set aside 2-3 hours at a time and take short breaks every half hour or hour. You should also set reminders to review your notes and memorize key information you will need later.
To stay focused when you're learning, I recommend using a Pomodoro Timer like Be Focused Pro for iPhone and Mac OS X, or Productivity Challenge Timer for Android.
It also helps to set up a time at the end of each week so you can review your progress and make sure you're on track to achieving your goal. If you're not on track then you may have to adjust your self-directed learning plan to be more realistic.
4. Find a learning accountability partner or start an online study group.
The key to building a self-directed learning habit is to make yourself accountable. For most of us, being accountable to ourselves simply isn't enough to be successful. So that's why I recommend committing to learning a new skill with a close friend, colleague or family member.
If you don't have someone to learn with, join a popular online course or membership-based learning community with other students who are committed to learning. You can also start your own Facebook Group or weekly Zoom Hangout so you can talk about what you're learning, ask questions and help each other succeed together.
5. Apply what you learn by building your own digital portfolio.
If you want to learn a new skill, you need to apply what you learn by building something with it. We live in an age where a resume or degree doesn't matter nearly as much as a digital portfolio that shows exactly what you have done. Ideally, your digital portfolio should have detailed case studies to show off the value you offer and the business results you have achieved for others.
This means you need to build a personal brand to differentiate yourself and your own professional-looking website with a digital portfolio section that shows off what you can do.
A good place to start is with your own self-hosted WordPress website that allows you to customize the look and feel with a professional-looking WordPress theme from a marketplace like Themeforest. If you're not technical, you can have your own WordPress website up and running in 20 minutes using a plug-and-play service like Bluehost.
Now take action and start learning!
The future belongs to the brave and curious so if you're serious about learning something new, follow these steps and you'll be on the path to achieving your dreams by making your goals a top priority in your life.
The path to doing what you love and mastering valuable digital skills starts with spending more time learning, creating your own online projects and sharing them with your social networks.
If you follow these steps to create your own self-directed learning plan, you'll have a strong foundation to learn and master new skills throughout your life.
Good luck!
As Bleeding Cool reported earlier, DC have, again, a lock on the top ten of comics distributed to comic stores in North America by Diamond in February 2012. But Marvel has regained both retail and unit market share. And as to that Top Ten, I expect Avengers Vs X-Men #0 may throw a fly in that particular ointment in March.
Also congrats to Dynamite. Named the Under 4% Publisher Of 2011 in the Diamond Gem Awards (seriously, why has nobody else reported the results?), they seem to be rocking February with a 4.2% share. Will they be ineligible for that award next year?
Here's a look at the top 100 comics, top 100 graphic novels, publisher marketshare and industry performance.

Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Re/code by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an executive editor at The Verge and editor at large of Re/code.
I am a tablet man, specifically an iPad man. I do love my trusty, iconic, MacBook Air laptop. But, except for heavy writing, I'm likelier to grab my iPad Air or even my diminutive iPad mini to get work done.
That includes everything from email to photo cropping; from reviewing and annotating PDFs to signing legal documents and editing articles and spreadsheets. I surf the Web on it, run Slack on it, use it for Facebook and Twitter, business and personal video calls, and even keep my calendar on it.
Of course, I also use my iPads for consuming content — videos, photos, books and music. But, contrary to the conventional wisdom, I see the iPad as a productivity device as well. While the iPad hasn't entirely replaced my laptop, it has replaced so many of the scenarios for which I used my laptop in the past that I turn to the laptop much less often.
So I was quite intrigued when Apple announced the iPad Pro, a new, jumbo-sized iPad with an optional snap-on physical keyboard cover and stylus for drawing. This whopping slate can be ordered starting today, and I've been testing it for the past week. In fact, I wrote much of this column on an iPad Pro with Apple's Smart Keyboard. For comparison, I also used a new iPad Pro keyboard from Logitech, and a MacBook Pro to write portions. And of course I've reviewed the Microsoft Surface Pro and its Type Cover in the past, and used a variety of third-party iPad keyboards as well.
The iPad Pro is a huge tablet. Its 12.9-inch screen is almost as large as the 13.3-inch display on the MacBook Air, and has much higher resolution. The display is 78 percent larger than the screen of Apple's standard-sized iPad Air 2. When encased in its keyboard cover, the iPad Pro is longer, wider, thicker and heavier than Apple's smallest Mac laptop, the 12-inch MacBook.
You'd think an iPad guy like me would be over the moon about the iPad Pro, despite its hefty base price of $799 for a Wi-Fi-only model with 32 gigabytes of memory, which stretches to $949 with 128GB of memory and soars past $1,000 with cellular capability.
But I'm not.
It isn't that I don't admire the device. I do. In its typical fashion, Apple has managed to design something thin and beautiful, yet capable. Despite its jumbo size, it's actually thinner (without the keyboard case) than my 2013-vintage iPad Air and about the same weight as the much smaller original iPad from 2010. And the gorgeous, large display makes great use of the new split-screen feature, available on recent iPads, that allows two apps to run at the same time. The optional stylus, called the Apple Pencil, is brilliant.
While I didn't do a formal battery test in my use of the Pro, it easily met Apple's 10-hour battery claim, even at 75 percent screen brightness and with Wi-Fi going all day to collect emails from three accounts, plus God knows how many Tweets, texts, Slack and Facebook posts.
On one particular day, I used the Pro to handle all my communications and Web browsing, watched a movie that lasted over two hours, participated in a company-wide video call, typed up pages of notes and played hours of music. And it lasted over 12 hours.
My problem with the iPad Pro is threefold. First, I found it just too big and bulky to hold and use comfortably for long periods. And that was when held horizontally. Held vertically, it was worse, because it felt unbalanced to me.
Second, I was disappointed with Apple's optional keyboard case. It's essentially a shallow Mac keyboard, with keys like Command that mean something only in Mac OS X, but not a single shortcut key to an iPad function, like Home or Search. It's also not backlit, and it has only one angle in which it holds the screen. Additionally, it's so light and small compared to the screen that I find it difficult to balance properly on my lap for typing. It's also really costly, at $169.
Apple's keyboard is actually cleverly made, with flat keys that depend, for their minimal travel, on a special springy fabric that covers the whole thing, which means the keys don't seem like individual units, but behave that way. I got used to typing on it, on a flat surface. But I just kept looking for shortcut keys that weren't there. And I kept wishing for a trackpad, so I didn't have to keep reaching for the screen.
The Logitech Create keyboard for iPad Pro, by contrast, has real individual keys, is backlit, and has a whole row of iPad shortcut keys. Also, it acts as a full case and is $19 less.
Of the three keyboards I used to write this column, I found that the MacBook Pro was best, the Logitech Create second, and Apple's iPad Pro Smart Keyboard dead last.
Third, I found few apps that took advantage of the greater screen real estate to display panels or functionality often hidden on mobile devices. One of the iPad's great advantages over other tablets is that it boasts 850,000 apps that have been optimized for tablet use. But few of these used the much bigger screen on the Pro. One example is Google Docs, which still places comments in a text-hiding pop-up window, instead of in the margin as on a laptop. One exception is Slack, which, on the Pro, moves a previously hidden right-hand menu to a permanent position.
I also ran into one bug: The Pro wouldn't let me add photos or location when creating a tweet in Twitter's official iOS app, while my other iPads do this just fine. Apple replicated the problem and said it will work with Twitter to fix it.
Apple CEO Tim Cook suggests that this is the iPad that can finally replace the laptop in your life. Another very senior Apple exec I spoke with last week said that he, personally, has stopped using their MacBook in favor of the iPad Pro, though for the occasional heavy task, they still turn to their desktop iMac.
But, for me — a person already using their laptop a lot less in favor of the iPad — the Pro is just not likely to eliminate my laptop use entirely. And I say that knowing that, for instance, there will be better keyboard covers and cases. There already is one: I prefer the the Logitech Create I used to write part of this column. But it still doesn't work nearly as well in my lap as a MacBook Air, partly because, like Apple's keyboard, it only has one angle.
But, even if the iPad Pro doesn't fully replace a laptop, it does have a killer app: Graphics, in all its forms, when used with the optional $99 Apple Pencil.
I'm not a graphics guy. I'm bad at drawing, photo touchups and even taking notes in freehand on a screen. But even I am blown away by the Apple Pencil. Coupled with the large, highly sensitive iPad Pro screen, it's an excellent stylus. In my tests, it had no discernible latency and drew on the screen like your favorite pen on paper. It easily sensed pressure and darkened or thickened lines, and it even could be held almost parallel to the screen, like a real pencil, for creating shading with the side of the point.
The Apple Pencil has no buttons or batteries — it charges using Apple's standard Lightning connector, which is a mixed blessing — it gives you one more thing to charge, but spares you from hunting down batteries. Apple claims up to 12 hours between charges, but you can get an extra half-hour in only 15 seconds by just removing a cap on the end and plugging it into the iPad itself.
The major downside of the Pencil is found in the Pro itself: There's no place to store it, or even to magnetically attach it when it's not in use. That means you could easily lose it, and be out $99 smackers. Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 does have that magnetic snap-on feature.
There's already a bunch of new or revised graphics apps bound for the iPad Pro, including two photo apps from Adobe, Photoshop Fix and Photoshop Mix for editing and manipulating photos.
I can also see the iPad Pro appealing to big businesses, a key new tablet market for Apple, where a huge screen that can show a big spreadsheet or presentation could have real value.
People will naturally compare the iPad Pro to Microsoft's Surface Pro line of tablets with snap-on keyboards. Though the keyboards are different, Apple has clearly emulated Microsoft's basic idea here, down to the inclusion of a special keyboard connector on the edge of the device.
But the iPad Pro is thinner and lighter than the Surface Pro 4, despite having a bigger screen. The Surface Pro's keyboard is more complete, with a row of shortcut keys and a trackpad. And the Surface Pro starts at $100 more.
They really aren't comparable, however, because — as Microsoft frequently points out — the Surface is intended to be a full-blown laptop, running standard Windows, while also having a tablet mode for full touch use.
Apple, on the other hand, is keeping its laptop and tablet operating systems separate, and has a far better-developed app ecosystem for the latter than Microsoft does. Indeed, Microsoft contributed to this by creating a beautiful iPad version of its Office suite for the iPad, long before it did one for its own hardware.
You can get a lot more done with iPad apps than with the paltry selection of tablet / touch-first apps available for the Surface. But, because Apple hasn't made a great keyboard, the iPad Pro isn't a complete replacement for a great laptop like the MacBook Air — even for a tablet guy like me.
The iPad Pro will no doubt make a lot of Apple users happy, especially if they use it for graphics. But I won't be buying one, and I don't recommend that average users do so either.

It was not possible for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine to determine its political and organizational vision and its overall strategic objectives alongside its official launch on December 11, 1967, or to address this difficult intellectual task in its first year of birth. This was simply because the PFLP was formed as a coalition of more than one faction and revolutionary guerilla group that began to emerge and did not consider itself a unified political party governed by a comprehensive central vision and internal laws and regulations.
The nature and circumstances of the launch and its complexities and conditions remained a firm and stubborn brake on the realization of the necessary conditions to launch the intellectual, political and organizational vision of the party, a strategic vision that reflects the essence of its revolutionary project and, above all, justifies its existence and necessity.
It can be said that the first serious and successful attempt at this level was achieved with amazing success after the February 1969 conference and following splits in the Popular Front. This period was accompanied by a state of splits, confusion and an intellectual, political and organizational storm, as well as personal and internal conflicts and contradictions that in some cases almost overwhelmed this new revolutionary party. Especially in the period after the defeat in the aggression of 1967, when almost all Arab regimes, both “nationalist” and reactionary found in support for the Palestinian right a solution and a way to confront the threat of the revolutionary Arab left expressed in this new party. Thus, the PFLP's vision of life and struggle developed initially on a stumbling, difficult and bloody birth.
The conclusion and outcome of the main and principal ideas that formed the launch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine were clearly manifested in the second national conference of the Front in February 1969. In this conference and the following intellectual and political effort, the objectives and identity of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine were developed under the name of the Strategy for the Liberation of Palestine.
This Strategy document formed the starting point and the guiding compass of the revolutionary party in its later development. This document has been the legitimate reference for the Front until the present day, and it has been reviewed, critiqued and corrected. This happened at the Fourth National Conference in 1981 and then again at the 1983 session of the Central Committee. Today it has to be re-read, reviewed, updated and widely disseminated again.
Despite the fact that many years have elapsed since its promulgation and despite the fact that the objective realities reflected in some of the texts of the Strategy have changed, the main statements and ideas contained therein remain true and coherent. This historical document constitutes the cornerstone and foundation without which it is difficult to read the history of this party and to understand its relationship, thought and movement, the areas in which the Front was launched as a democratic revolutionary party, and how it expressed the essence of its general intellectual project.
It is not our aim to invoke “history” as a formulaic and rigid text, but we do want to emphasize the need to read this document once again, more than once, if we want to understand the spirit, personality and features of the PFLP without abandoning the tasks and situation of renewal. A courageous, honest and scientific reading depends on theory and practice and the tool of revolutionary knowledge that looks on with a strict eye, stemming from the material reality and its results, lessons and facts.
Thus, the party must measure its ability to invent the new without compromising its essence, because any real innovation must be a product of its environment and expresses an objective need instead of a personal one, that looks toward and anticipates the future.
The strategic objectives of the PFLP are clear and have not changed. All of the documents issued by the conferences of the Front have emphasized this – the change is not in the roots and trunk but in the branches, leaves and twigs. The roots must remain solid and firmly held in the soil. Because “renewal” is sometimes a false cloak carrying false promises, and can come in a reactionary guise, even when presented as “new.” Moreover, sometimes the “new” is in reality an abandonment of the strategy up to the level of defeat.
The PFLP's strategy emphasizes that we are not starting from scratch. There is no zero point in thought, history and struggle, and the Front is a democratic revolutionary party with a rich historical experience of half a century. It has lived a permanent, continuous experience amid battle and confrontation. The march of half a century of right and wrong, achievements and setbacks, and we want this situation to remain consistent with the general goals of the revolutionary party, a necessary condition for progress and growth.
All of this drives us to stand, think and read our Strategy once more. Because strategy means, in essence, the road, the compass and the goal. Today, we are a half century into the experience of the PFLP. We must reflect, evaluate, draw lessons and answer collectively the question after 50 years: How did we get here? Where are we going?

Education Minister Mitzie Hunter will meet with the leadership of the York Region District School Board (YRDSB) after one of its principals shared links on Facebook that some parents and students say are offensive to Muslims.
"It's very important to me that parents know that issues of racism are not tolerated in our schools," said Hunter, who confirmed on Tuesday the meeting would take place "in the next few days."
The posts, shared on the Facebook page of Ghada Sadaka, an elementary school principal at Sir Wilfrid Laurier Public School in Markham, were pulled down after complaints surfaced in September.
Since then, anger has mounted among parents and community members over what they believe is a lack of transparency in the YRDSB's handling of the issue.
The school board confirmed to CBC News in October that an investigation had taken place, but declined to disclose the results. In an email, Trustee Billy Pang said that because the probe was of "a personnel nature," they are not in a position to share any details.
That prompted one concerned parent to say that they felt "stonewalled" by the process.
Open letter to Hunter asks them to 'intervene'
Hunter's plan to meet with York board leadership comes after they received an open letter signed by community leaders, community members and the Ontario Federation of Labour.
The letter criticizes the school board's refusal to share the results of its investigation into Sadaka's posts, saying that a "culture of fear" is growing inside of the YRDSB and arguing that the posts are part of a larger problem with race in the school board.
The letter ends with a request that Hunter and Associate Education Minister Indira Naidoo-Harris "please intervene."
York Region District School Board Trustee Nancy Elgie has apologized after allegedly using a racial slur to refer to a black parent at a November meeting of the board. (York Region District School Board)
York board says meeting has been in the works for months
Licinio Miguelo, a spokesperson for the YRDSB, said that they have yet to confirm a meeting with the minister, but that their board first requested to meet with Hunter months ago, when they were appointed.
"We would welcome the opportunity to meet with her," they said, declining to confirm if Hunter's office had been in touch with the board in the last two days or discuss the specifics of what would be talked about when the meeting takes place.
"If they were to ask us questions, we would certainly answer," they said.
Facebook posts discussed burkas, refugees, Islam
The original complaints were sparked by several links shared on Sadaka's page, including one that suggested that burkas should be banned in Europe since bikinis were banned in Muslim countries and a post that promised to tell "the truth about refugees."

In another post, Sadaka shared a CNN video about Islam in Britain, adding their own comment: "This has to go viral. Share and post! Oh Lord."
At the time the story broke, Sadaka told the Toronto Star: "I appreciate your questions, but for any further information you will have to go through the board office.".
The Ontario College of Teachers sent CBC News a link in late October confirming that Sadaka was still a member in good standing, and had not had their credentials revoked.
White Sox first baseman Jose Abreu has changed agents and will now be represented by Diego Bentz and Fern Cuza of Relativity Baseball, according to Yahoo's Jeff Passan (Twitter link).
As Passan notes, Abreu's contract allows them to opt for arbitration once eligible, in lieu of their contract's remaining guaranteed salaries. That would come after the 2016 season, giving Abreu the ability to perhaps out earn the $34MM they are guaranteed over the final three years of their deal ($10.5MM in 2017, $11.5MM in 2018 and $12MM in 2019). Those salaries represent the final three years of what was a then-record-setting six-year, $68MM contract signed by Abreu after they defected from Cuba in the 2013-14 offseason. (Rusney Castillo's seven-year, $72.5MM contract with the Red Sox has since eclipsed Abreu's mark as the largest ever for a Cuban defector, while Yasmany Tomas' six-year, $68.5MM deal has also slightly topped Abreu's mark.)
Abreu, formerly a client of Praver/Shapiro, was the unanimous American League Rookie of the Year in 2014 after a breathtaking debut in which they batted .317/.383/.581 with 36 homers despite a brief stint on the 15-day disabled list. Now 28 years old, the Cuban-born phenom is off to a strong, albeit less impressive start to their sophomore campaign, as he's slashed .288/.349/.500 as of Wednesday morning.
Relativity, formerly known as SFX, is one of the larger agencies in the industry and represents a vast number of Major Leaguers, including Nelson Cruz, Paul Goldschmidt, Madison Bumgarner, Ubaldo Jimenez, Justin Morneau and David Ortiz. The White Sox, in particular, have a large number of Relativity clients, including Zach Duke, Adam LaRoche, Jesse Crain and the recently outrighted Kyle Drabek.

The Australian Rugby League Commission has approved the implementation of a Central Command Centre for video referee reviews, starting in the 2016 season.
Head of Football Todd Greenberg said the new centre, which will be a first for Australian sport, will be based at NEP Australia at Australian Technology Park in Eveleigh, Sydney.
They said the centre, which will utilise Hawk-Eye Innovations video review technology and be supported by Telstra's Digital Video Network platform, will be “a game-changer for Rugby League”.
It has the potential to halve the time taken to review a decision – and deliver more accurate results, Mr Greenberg said.
“We have been through an exhaustive trial process because this is so important for our fans,” Mr Greenberg said.
“Now that it has been approved by the Commission we will begin work on the facility so it is up and running in time for the start of the 2016 season.”
Mr Greenberg said the centre was designed to improve “accuracy, efficiency, consistency as well as transparency” of the decision-making process.
“Our video referees will be using state-of-the-art technology,” Mr Greenberg said.
“We will control the vision, and the improved technology means we will be able to make informed decisions much quicker.
“Our video referees will have access to multiple camera angles and playback control for all reviewable decisions. Touch screen interfaces, zoom functions and split screens will further enhance the decision making process.
“Recent trials have shown that video referees can review decisions in an average of about 40 seconds when they have relevant angles and enhanced video review technology available at their fingertips.
“That's half the current average time our video referees take to make a decision – and that will be our target next season.”
Mr Greenberg said the Central Command Centre would be introduced in conjunction with a reduction in interchanges and the introduction of a shot clock to achieve the NRL's objective of more game continuity.
“Those three key changes are all part of our strategy to make the game more continuous and deliver a better spectacle for our fans,” they said.
“Ultimately, it has the potential to help us make the right decisions – and to make them quicker.
“But more than that, this system will allow us to be more transparent and transform the fan experience in partnership with NRL broadcasters through the live explanation of decisions to fans.
“I cannot overstate this – we will get more decisions right.
“And we will take significantly less time to reach those decisions.”
Mr Greenberg thanked NEP, the world renowned broadcast solution provider who will house the new facility, Hawk-Eye Innovations who will provide the video review technology as well as Telstra, who will provide the digital video network connectivity platform to deliver this Australian first initiative.
A visual illustration of the proposed Central Command Centre is available to broadcasters on request.
Harvard Universityâs John F. Kennedy School of Government is courting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to work there, according to a school spokesperson.
âWe have extended an invitation to [former] Secretary Clinton to consider engaging with the university and would of course welcome their interest in a range of roles,â Doug Gavel, a spokesperson for the Kennedy School, said in an e-mailed statement.
Gavel declined to comment further. Representatives for Clinton did not respond to requests for comment this week.
Reports in recent weeks have said Clinton is weighing offers from a number of offers from colleges and universities.
Clinton is considered a potential candidate for president in next election in 2016. They have not announced their plans.
Politico.com reported recently that working with an academic institution could be a major benefit to Clintonâs potential presidential candidacy.
âIt would provide them with a credible backdrop for speeches and events that would take them outside of a hotel ballroom or something sponsored by their familyâs foundation or another outside group,â the media outlet reported.
According to Politico, other schools that have invited Clinton include: Yale University, their law school alma mater; New York University, where their daughter, Chelsea works; and Baruch College.
On Monday, Harvard announced that it will honor several dignitaries, including Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, and daughter, Chelsea, at a ceremony next month at the Harvard School of Public Health as the school celebrates its 100th anniversary.

The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was finally called off Tuesday after crews spent nearly three years combing the desolate Indian Ocean and its deep seabed, leaving one of the greatest aviation mysteries of all time unsolved.
The governments of Malaysia, Australia and China said crews finished an underwater sweep of a 46,000-square-mile zone of seabed without finding the missing Boeing 777.
The most complex and expensive search in aviation history cost around $150 million but failed to locate the plane, let alone answer the questions surrounding its disappearance in March 2014.
“Despite every effort using the best science available, cutting-edge technology, as well as modelling and advice from highly skilled professionals who are the best in their field, unfortunately, the search has not been able to locate the aircraft,” the Joint Agency Coordination Center in Australia said in a statement.
“The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness,” the agency said.
The jet carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, to Beijing vanished from civilian radar in the early hours of March 8, 2014, without so much as a distress call from its pilots.
[Lost: The baffling disappearance of Flight 370]
After several false starts, scientists examining satellite pings decided the plane had turned south and flown toward one of the remotest places on Earth. They directed the search toward a vast arc of ocean some 1,100 miles west of Australia.
Last month, officials investigating the plane's disappearance took another look at the satellite data and modeling of ocean currents and decided they might have been searching in the wrong place after all.
They recommended that the search be moved more than 200 miles north.
But it was too late: The three governments bankrolling the search had already concluded that it would be suspended unless convincing new evidence emerged to pinpoint the plane's location.
That wasn't forthcoming, so in the absence of fresh leads or private money to fund a new effort, the search for Flight 370 is now officially over.
The investigation has been controversial from the outset. The Malaysian government was criticized for releasing contradictory information in the first few days after the plane disappeared and for initially being reluctant to share information with foreign experts.
As the search area moved south over the Indian Ocean, Australia took charge. But there was still more than a hint of chaos, with hopes repeatedly raised and then dashed.
In April 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that underwater signals had been heard, making them “very confident” that the plane's black-box data recorders — the keys to solving the mystery — had been located. It turned out that the pings probably came from the search ship itself or its towed listening device.
[Flight 370: The depth of the problem]
An oil slick was spotted from the air, but it did not contain jet fuel. Debris on the ocean surface turned out to be trash.
Finally, confirmation that the plane had indeed crashed in the Indian Ocean came in July 2015, when a wing flap was found on Reunion Island, east of Madagascar. Since then, more than 20 objects confirmed or believed to have been from the plane have washed ashore on Indian Ocean beaches, according to the Associated Press.
By then, the search for the plane itself had long since moved underwater, with several ships dragging sonar-equipped “towfish” back and forth through the ocean to map vast areas of deep seafloor to look for signs of wreckage. Unmanned submarines were also used to take a closer look at objects of interest or areas of rougher terrain. Still, nothing — apart from a couple of old shipwrecks.
The search zone shifted several times as the satellite data was examined and reexamined and combined with updated information on ocean currents.
And there was a final twist in December when the Australian Transport Safety Bureau revealed that another review suggested searchers had been looking in the wrong place all along.
[Right before they gave up, investigators figured out where to look]
But Australia's government had lost patience — or run out of cash. It rejected the bureau's recommendation that crews be allowed to move north, and it argued that the results of the experts' analysis were not precise enough to justify continuing the hunt.
The three countries funding the search reiterated that view in Tuesday's statement.
“Whilst combined scientific studies have continued to refine areas of probability, to date no new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft,” they said.
The flight was carrying 152 Chinese nationals, and victims' relatives here have consistently expressed frustration with the search.
Voice 370, a support group for Chinese passengers' relatives, said that extending the search to the patch of seabed recently identified by Australia's Transport Safety Bureau was “an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety.”
[What happened to Flight 370?]
“Commercial planes cannot just be allowed to disappear without a trace,” the group said in a statement. “Having already searched 120,000 square km, stopping at this stage is nothing short of irresponsible, and betrays a shocking lack of faith in the data, tools and recommendations of an array of official experts assembled by the authorities themselves.”
Jiang Hui, a 42-year-old man whose mother was aboard the flight, said they were “very disappointed, sad and angry.”
“Before, the three governments told the world that they wouldn't give up. Now they say the search is suspended, but I know they have just given up,” they said. “It is not that humans can't solve the problem of finding the plane. It's just that each government just doesn't want to contribute more money.”

John Paulson, a hedge fund manager that you might know from books like The Big Short, has been spending the last couple years promoting Puerto Rico to New York's financial elite as a way of avoiding Federal taxes without dropping their American citizenship, thanks to a 2012 tax shelter law.
Business Week wrote a long article about it back in June, and various firms are promoting Puerto Rican real estate to entrepreneurs and investors as a way to both reduce their personal and corporate tax burden. The gist is that if you spend half of the year living in Puerto Rico, they don't have to pay Federal taxes anymore, whereas they would need to if they were living in most other foreign countries while keeping their citizenship. US expats, unlike most other countries, are often double-taxed, although there are some minor loopholes that are more accessible for people earning below a certain amount.
The slogan ‘exit over voice' is being implemented right now, and being used by some of the biggest names in finance. The funny thing is that it would not take a large number of people listening to Paulson to upset the fiscal boats of both the United States and various extremely left-wing American cities, which are entirely reliant on the very wealthy to handle their budgets. Paulson themselves donated $100 million to the upkeep of Central Park — and it's worth noting that, during the restoration of New York City, the renovations of the parks around the city was handled almost entirely by wealthy donors. For comparison, Central Park's annual budget is typically half of what Paulson gave to it.
One of the reasons why Paulson is pushing hard on the Puerto Rico point is that they have personally come into conflict with New York City's Communist mayor, De Blasio. Whatever you think of Paulson, he's almost certainly in the region of thousands of times more competent and intelligent than the mayor, and certainly more connected.
If there is a problem with the plan, probably the biggest one is simply the presence of Puerto Ricans, and the connection with the US government. On the other hand, from the government's perspective, this sort of halfway measure can keep a lot of wealthy people who would otherwise expatriate to remain citizens.
This sort of initiative can do more damage to the size of the American government than 10,000 Ronald Reagans winning elections.

PETER O'MAHONY HAS been through two training sessions with the Ireland team since they were appointed captain but faced their biggest, to date, this afternoon – the press briefing.
The Munster back-row was joined by interim head coach Les Kiss and team manager Mick Kearney at the Tuesday gab with the media. Kiss, keeping the coaching hot seat toasty for Joe Schmidt, congratulated hooker Rory Best on their elevation the Lions squad, while Kearney revealed centre James Downey is on stand-by for injury doubt Stuart Olding.
The fourth question was O'Mahony's first to deal with in their new role and they handled it deftly.
They told TheScore.ie, “It's a huge honour for me and my family. I was delighted to get the call and I was obviously delighted for Bestie to get called into the Lions squad… we all thought they deserved it in the first place and we should have been sending them our text messages of congratulations.
“I'm hugely honoured to captain the side over there and it's an exciting time for the squad. There is a good mix of experience and new blood there… We've had two days of training and meetings and have set our stall out with where we want to be and what we want to take out of the tour.”
The 23-year-old added, “There are certain things that you have to do that are different (as captain) but, when it comes to being on the pitch, you try to do what you normally do. I won't be carrying myself any differently.”

Once Best was plucked from the Irish squad by Lions coach Warren Gatland,
Kiss said O'Mahony was the obvious candidate to lead the squad against the USA and Canada. “It has been noticed from an early age that Peter has this capacity for strong leadership,” they said. “That has shone through with Munster and with the underage stuff with Ireland. It's a great opportunity for Peter to feel what it is like to take a team on tour and across the water. It is something that won't sit upon their shoulder with any stress.”
Their first job as captain came ‘a good few years ago' (more like 12) when, under legendary Cork Constitution coach Fred Casey, a young O'Mahony led an U-12 team at a tournament in France.
Was they required to make any inspirational speeches before leading the troops out to face the hardy 11-year-old French opponents? “At Under 12s,” they replied, “no, probably not. With Schools Rugby, Senior Cup, Munster Schools, Irish 19s – they were probably more of the all-round captaincy, making speeches and stuff.”
They added, “Sometimes there are times to talk up and other times you don't need to say anything when the boys are in the right place. It comes with experience; you get a feel for it.
Some people think that, as captain, you have to shout and roar but when you are playing provincial and international rugby you are playing with lads that have probably captained their own provinces… There's a time and a place where you need to have a word but there's a time and a place where you need to shut up, and get out, and do it.”
Kiss declared that every player will be under observation to assess ‘how they handle' the summer tour and Test-match pressure. O'Mahony is already looking beyond the summer matches. “There are 20 Tests before the World Cup, ” they said. “That's not too many. It's less than a Rabo season.”

During the second quarter of Sunday's NFC title game, Seahawks gunner Jeremy Lane appeared to take an out-of-bounds hit from someone on the 49ers sideline while trying to cover a punt.
If the NFL will be investigating the situation, the investigation hasn't commenced.
“We have not been contacted by the League on this matter, but will cooperate fully with any questions they may have,” 49ers spokesperson Bob Lange told PFT.
The hit occurred while the still-unidentified person stood on the yellow line that borders the thick sideline stripe.
Some have speculated that the person applying the hit was linebacker Nick Moody or defensive tackle Quinton Dial, both of whom were inactive on Sunday. Per a league source, it was neither Moody nor Dial.
No flag was thrown on the play, and Lane bounced right up and kept going in an attempt to cover the punt.

This is the terrifying collection of nearly 500 guns and 200,000 rounds of ammunition which was seized from a parish council chairperson who collected firearms 'like stamps'.
Police revealed the full extent of their discovery at the home of crane operator James Arnold in Wyverstone, Suffolk. It is the biggest arsenal of illegal weapons ever found in the UK.
Three months after the discovery and the 49-year-old's arrest in April 2014, Arnold died of pancreatic cancer, meaning they could never face prosecution.
But as firearms dealer Anthony Buckland, 65, was jailed for at Norwich Crown Court for supplying some of the weapons, Suffolk Police opened up its armoury to journalists to highlight the massive scale of the find.

They revealed that, had the weapons fallen into the wrong hands, they would have been enough to arm nine coach-loads of terrorists.
Chief Superintendent David Skevington said: 'James Arnold never offered any explanation for what they did; they simply said they had come by the weapons years ago and kept them safe to stop them causing any harm.
'We have asked every question and followed every line of inquiry and have found no evidence of a criminal or terrorist motive.
'The best explanation to date is that they were a collector and a hoarder who collected these weapons in the way some people collect stamps.'
Officers were first called to Arnold's terraced home, which is down a single-track lane with only three other houses and a farm nearby, on April 13, 2014 to reports of a domestic violence incident.
They had planned to revoke their licence for 17 firearms to prevent them being used in a domestic attack but when they arrived they found other illegal weapons strewn on the living room floor.
Further investigation alerted them to the fact the internal layout of the house did not match its external footprint.
A search then uncovered a hidden room, accessed through a narrow tunnel hidden behind a false wall in their pantry.

Officers spent 27 days searching the house, working meticulously with bomb disposal experts to ensure the house was not booby-trapped.
The find is far larger than any other cache found in this country.
One of the previous largest hauls is believed to have been that of 31 rifles and machine pistols found along with 1,000 rounds of ammunition on a boat at Cuxton Marina on the River Medway in Kent in August 2015.
Arnold's house backs on to an eight-acre field which they also owned. Around this they constructed a huge wall from sleepers which police believe may have been a home-made firing range.

They lived at the house with their wife and daughter, who did not comment to journalists when visited recently.
Although they were chairperson of the parish council at the time of the arrest and active in running the village hall, they were also described as a private man.

Detective Superintendent Steve Mattin said Arnold later offered a limited explanation for the collection when interviewed in prison. 'He seemed very set on the idea they were keeping people safe by looking after these weapons,' they added. Pictured is where one of the hidden safes (right) were found in a cupboard full of junk and guns (left)
One resident said: 'He was involved in lots of things and lots of people knew who they are.
'But at the same time, you never felt like you really knew them - they never revealed very much about himself.
'He seemed like a nice enough man but they were a collector of almost everything, they also had odd bits around their property.'
Experts from the National Ballistics Intelligence Service examined many of the weapons and could not find any link to known crimes.
As well as more modern military-style guns, many were described as museum pieces dating to the First and Second World Wars.
Arnold originally gave a no-comment interview to police.

'He seemed very set on the idea they were keeping people safe by looking after these weapons,' they added.
'He certainly didn't see themselves as a danger to others. But by the time we came across him, their life seemed to be deteriorating.
'Of course the fear was that they could fall into the wrong hands or, given that they had terminal cancer, something might change in their life and they would have access to hundreds of deadly weapons.'
Buckland told the court, during their trial in December, that they had known Arnold for more than 25 years.
They said they had legally supplied them with guns and ammunition but would never have supplied them with illegal firearms.
Asked if they ever suspected Arnold of doing anything illegal, they added: 'Good heavens, no.'
Asked about news coverage of the find, Buckland said he, like all people working in their industry, had been 'glued to the television' but had not been worried about their involvement.
'There is no link to me because I had never supplied Arnold with anything illegal,' they added. 'I didn't start to panic whatsoever.'

Exploring Scala AST in your browser
A short story of adding Scala support to AST Explorer
Gabriele Petronella Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 25, 2017
AST Explorer
I recently gave a talk about all the different ways Abstract Syntax Trees play a role in many tools in the JavaScript universe. I had several demos prepared using astexplorer.net. In case you don't know it, this is a brilliant tool.
You can type some code in, it gets parsed on the fly and you get an interactive AST that you can explore. Also, you can play around with tools that work on AST, such as linters, compilers and code-shifting tools.
All of this, directly in your browser, no need to install anything. It is wonderful.
I finished my talk, went for some food and beers with friends, and I started thinking “it would be really cool if we had this for Scala!”.
Then the realization: we can have it!
Despite starting as a JavaScript-centric platform, AST Explorer is an extendable platform: you can bring your own parser and enable AST exploration in any language.
The only restriction is that — being a browser-based app — the parser needs to be in JavaScript. How can we get a JavaScript implementation of a Scala parser?
The quest for a Scala parser in JS
The first tool that came to mind is Scalameta, a meta-programming toolkit for Scala whose AST representation is at the core of many present and future Scala tools (macros, migration tools, code formatters etc). Conveniently, Scalameta provides its own parser module.
Scalameta recently gained Scala.js support, so it can cross-compile to JavaScript. Wonderful! What we were missing was a JS façade that exposed a JS-friendly API in a CommonJS module (the kind of modules that get published on npm), so that it could be imported and used in a JavaScript app like AST Explorer.
I started experimenting and a few PRs later we finally had it!
And let me tell you: publishing a Scala library to npm was something!
It was now time for the pull request to AST Explorer and boom 💣, a few days later it's now live on the website!
Try it out, and be sure to provide feedback!
Thanks
I'm standing on the shoulders of giants, and my tiny contribution is just glue to stitch together the great work of others that I'd like to thank.
First, Eugene Burmako (author of Scalameta) and Ólafur Geirsson (maintainer of Scalameta and author of Scalafmt and Scalafix): they have been very supportive, by providing help and feedback and reviewing the PRs on Scalameta at the speed of light.
Also, thanks to Sébastien Doeraene and the Scala.js team. Their work to bridge the gap between Scala and JS is what made this kind of tools possible.
Finally, Felix Kling for authoring AST Explorer and Ingvar Stepanyan for the immediate feedback on the asupervisorstioned pull request.
Both Scala and JavaScript communities have proven to be friendly and supportive. Thank you guys!
What's next
I think this is an exciting step for everyone involved in meta-programming. AST Explorer makes experimenting with ASTs incredibly easy and I'm sure it will facilitate the life of anyone willing to build on Scalameta.
Now that we have parsing, I'd love to experiment on transformations, another interesting feature of AST Explorer. Imagine sketching a macro or a Scalafix rewrite directly in the browser, wouldn't it be amazing?
Let's try to make it happen!

BALTIMORE (WJZ) — Maintenance workers were trading sex for repairs in public housing units. Those are the allegations in a new $70 million federal lawsuit just filed against the Baltimore Housing Authority. Seven women say they are victims of the abuse.
Meghan McCorkell has more on the disturbing suit.
The allegations uncovered by the group Communities United claim maintenance workers would only make repairs in exchange for sex acts.
Crumbling ceilings, peeling paint and rat infestations.
“They are living with black mold and holes big enough for the outside in,” said former resident Trina Ashley.
But some women say a pair of public housing maintenance men refused to fix the life-threatening conditions unless they performed sex acts.
“To think on top of all that, someone would have the audacity to come in and proposition a woman,” said Perry Hopkins, Communities United.
Now a multi-million dollar lawsuit is filed against the city.
“These women, many of them have complained not just to Gilmor housing but to the Housing Authority and they've gotten no response,” said attorney Annie Hirsch.
WJZ has obtained affidavits from the seven alleged victims detailing the abuse.
In one, a single mother says the maintenance supervisor told them to come to their office if they wanted repairs. When they got there, they say they “pushed themselves back from their desk, exposed themselves and said, `What can you do with this?'”
Another woman says when they refused sex with that same supervisor, they told her, “You don't want to get with me? You think you are having problems now, just wait.”
In a statement to WJZ, Housing Authority officials say “HABC considers any employee actions that would subject its residents to sexual abuse or sexual harassment to be reprehensible.”
Still, some say neighbors have complained for years.
“She said, `Well, I know who it is.' They said, `I had reported it and nothing had been done,'” said Gilmor resident Joeann Spears.
A situation victims say has them scared in their own homes.
Housing officials are conducting an internal investigation into the complaints.

Amateur astronomers believe they have located the X-37B US military unmanned spaceplane, which was launched into orbit on a classified mission a month ago.
We now know where, but not why or what.
According to the authoritative skygazers' site Heavens-Above, the X-37B is in an orbit angled up 40 degrees from the Equator, meaning that it passes regularly over all nations between southern Europe and South Africa and corresponding portions of south Asia, Australia, Latin America and much of the USA. The little spaceplane is at a height of approximately 400km above Earth.
The X-37B is operated by the US Air Force and its mission, budget and other particulars are classified, or "black". Nonetheless, various facts about the project are known as it began life as a NASA programme.
The X-37B takes off inside a fairing atop a normal disposable launch stack, in this case an Atlas V from Cape Canaveral a month ago. It is much smaller than a space shuttle, but like the shuttle has delta-shaped wings which should offer similar "cross range" abilities during re-entry - that is the X-37B could potentially make a landing somewhere well off its orbital track.
Another difference from the Shuttle is that the little robot wingship has a deployable solar array rather than fuel cells for electric power generation, and the air force has stated that it can remain in orbit for up to 270 days. The planned duration of the current mission hasn't been revealed.
Then the X-37B also has a powerful thruster and substantial propellant tanks, which indicates that it may be intended to change orbit quickly and/or frequently - it will certainly be no surprise if at some point the sky-watchers lose track of it again.
The US air force has refused to discuss the X-37B's mission in any detail, though spokespersons have emphasised its usefulness as a testbed for developing space technologies and also for trying out rapid-response and quick turnarounds with runway-landing spacecraft. A second X-37B has already been ordered.
The secrecy has led to much speculation regarding the little craft: that it may be intended to service or deploy the planned new "fractionated" mini-sat clusters, or as a way of rushing custom spy packages into space in response to emerging crises.
No obvious mission would seem to require the X-37B's delta wings and the cross-range re-entry capability they appear to offer, however. A lifting-body or stub wing design would have been able to carry more payload and still make a runway landing - just not one well off the craft's orbital track.
This has led us here on the Reg space-war desk to wonder whether there might just be plans in some quarters for crafty one-orbit flights like the "Mission 3A/3B" planned for (but never actually executed by) the space shuttle - details here. Such missions would allow the X-37B to escape the notice not just of amateur skywatchers, but also of foreign powers with space-tracking capabilities.
It'll probably be a long time before any details emerge, however. ®
It's Sunday again, folks! And that means dessert day at The Frugal Flambe.
I asked my husband what they wanted for dessert this weekend, and they responded with, “something healthy”.
Really…
For a few moments, I just sat and looked at him, my brain rustling through my mental-recipe-box, and came up empty-handed.
“Something like… chocolate dipped strawberries,” the hubbster finally offered.
While it's not entirely healthy, it sounded delicious. But my mind didn't stop there. I remembered a friend of mine who once had a bouquet of chocolate covered fruit delivered to their desk at work for their birthday, and I was inspired.
“How about an assortment of chocolate covered fruit?” I asked.
“YUMMMMY!”- both the husband and I looked over at our almost three year old, who has obviously begun listening in on our conversations without our knowledge.
And it was decided- chocolate covered fruit! Here's how we did it:
Heat chocolate chips in a double boiler. Don't have one? Put chocolate chips in a metal bowl over a pot of boiling water. Stir constantly until chocolate is smooth. Dip fruit in the chocolate and place on wax paper. Realize you have too much chocolate and too little fruit, grab a sleeve of crackers and dip them, too. Add them to the wax paper. Allow to cool until chocolate is firm. EAT!
Do you have any simple dessert recipes? We'd love to hear them- share in the comments.
The irregular black shapes in this Cassini radar image of Titan's northern polar region are believed to be liquid methane-ethane lakes.
A lake of asphalt may be the closest thing on Earth to thehydrocarbon seas on Saturn's moon Titan, and it isapparently teeming with microbial life.
Notonly could these findings help in the searchfor aliens in our own solar system, but they could provide insight into theevolution of life on this planet.
The largest naturally occurring asphaltlake on Earth is Pitch Lake on the Caribbeanisland of Trinidad, where black goo oozes across roughly 114 acres, anarea slightly larger than that covered by Vatican City. Brimming as it is with hot asphalt and bubbling with carbondioxide and hydrocarbon gases, Pitch Lake hardly seems fit for life.
However,scientists now find eachgram of sticky black goo in Pitch Lake can harbor up to 10 million microbes, includingbacteria as well as other single-celled organisms known as archaea.This life, which dwells in asphalt ranging between 90 to 132 degrees F(32 to 56 degrees C), apparently feeds offhydrocarbons. Instead of breathing oxygen, it respires with the aid ofmetals ? perhaps iron or manganese.
Theresearchers collected six samples from the lake. "Thetar itself sticks to everything ? imagine really smelly molasses," saidresearcher Steven Hallam, a microbial systemsecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
Each sample contained a distinct microbial population. Most of thebacteria appear related to ones found in oxygen-depleted sediments, methaneseeps or oil reservoirs. However, some of the archaeathey saw "fall far enough away from known groups as to represent novellineages," Hallam said.
Water levels in the asphalt arelow, at or below thereported threshold for life on Earth, so the life the researchers found in thelake might be constrained to watery pockets within the surrounding asphalt,similar to what is seen bound in frozen lakes and glaciers in the McMurdoDry Valleys in Antarctica. The fact that E. coli gut bacteria cangenerate most of their own water and that fungus found in kerosene can extractwater from light hydrocarbons could point to how life can survive even whenlittle to no liquid water is available.
Aside from the very cold surface conditionson Titan,the environmental conditions within Pitch Lake are one of the closest copycatsfor that moon that we can find on our planet. The discovery of a broadspectrum of microbes in this lake enhances the possibility for life in Titan?shydrocarbon seas, researchers said. Some of Titan's hydrocarbon reservoirsmight be heated from below, providing energy that potentially enhances the possibility of at least the precursor molecules for life.
"An obvious future step is to look at the adaptationmechanisms of these microbes and how they manage to make a living in PitchLake, which will give us also some idea of possible adaptation mechanisms forputative extraterrestrial life on Titan," said researcher Dirk Schulze-Makuch, an astrobiologist atWashington State University who also is involved in this project.
Theprospect of life on Titan is exciting "becauseif we find life there, it most likely would be of a separate origin, which wouldgreatly inform us how diverse life truly can be and would also greatly increasethe chances of finding life outside of our solar system," Schulze-Makuch added.
Future research could tease out the genes these microbes rely on onto live off the hydrocarbons and metal in this asphalt. Doing so could shedlight on potential alien life, and even lead to new life-detection tests thatlook for a broader array of biomarkers.
This research also could be useful in the quest to make energysources on Earth less polluting. Hallam saidtheir study could lead to ways "to manufacture microbial treatment systemsfor cleaner fuel processing or the development of harvesting approaches thatfocus on the recovery of natural gas, a by-product of oil degradation."
Microbial life had earlier been detected in the La Brea TarPits in Los Angeles, although that research "was more focused on thebiodegradation properties and biotechnological aspects of the system," Hallam noted. Also, while the bacteria in Pitch Lake and LaBrea have similarities, the archaea populations atPitch Lake appear more diverse.
Such research into asphalt lakes on Earth doesn't only give hintsas to what life might be elsewhere in the universe, but also what it might havebeen like in the ancient past on our planet before it adapted to oxygen. "It's primordialin that sense," Hallam said.
The scientists note this miniature version of Titan on Earth is shrinkingdue in part to asphalt mining for road-paving operations. "It is adelicate balance between the need to conserve such an interesting naturallaboratory and the economic development of the island," Hallam added. "It would be something if there were away to promote ecotourism to the site."
The scientists have submitted their findingsto the journal Astrobiology.
It is illegal to kill a black bear in Missouri unless it's threatening humans or livestock or damaging property. There is no hunting season on Missouri black bears. (Photo: File photo)
A man who earlier this month killed a black bear in Jefferson County and tossed the head and hide into a creek paid more in court costs than the $99.50 fine they received.
Authorities say Chris Keown, 40, of House Springs, shot the bear with a muzzle-loading rifle around May 2 in a heavily wooded area near their home, prompting a call to Operation Game Thief, according to Larry Yamnitz, Protection Division Chief with the Missouri Department of Conservation.
"The caller gave our agent information on who did it," Yamnitz said.
Eventually, the man's son convinced their dad to talk to game officials about killing the bear, Yamnitz said.
"We recovered the head and hide, which had been dumped in a creek, and we found the bear's meat and paws in somebody's refrigerator," they said. "Our agents did their job."
Keown was cited for pursuing, taking, killing, possessing or disposing of wildlife, a misdemeanor. Their case could have gone two ways, according to Yamnitz.
They could plead guilty to the conservation agent's citation, or plead not guilty and face possible trial through the Jefferson County Prosecutor's Office.
By pleading guilty to the citation, Keown faced only a $99.50 fine, $89.50 in associated costs, and $14 in Jefferson County court costs — a total of $203. Fines for various wildlife offenses are outlined in a 13-page Conservation Violation Code.
Had they fought the ticket and gone to trial, they could have faced up to $1,000 in fines and up to a year in jail.
By pleading guilty to the citation, Yamnitz said Keown could not also be prosecuted criminally. They acknowledged that the low fine would not serve as much of a deterrent to future poachers.
"I'm not going to disrespect the court or the General Assembly," Yamnitz said. "But that's the way it's set up in Missouri. The agents do their job, delivering the facts."
Yamnitz said Keown is a convicted felon, with previous run-ins with game officials. They aren't charged for illegally possessing a firearm because most muzzle loaders use black powder propellant poured down the barrel, with a bullet rammed down on top of the powder charge, instead of self-contained cased ammunition. Antique-style muzzle loaders aren't classified as firearms under federal law.
Conservation agents confiscated the bear parts and held Keown's rifle as evidence. But it's possible he'll get the gun back after they pay their fine and court costs.
"We don't have a criminal forfeiture law for property involved in wildlife cases," Yamnitz said.
Eventually, the Missouri Conservation Commission could review Keown's case and potentially revoke their future hunting and fishing privileges. The News-Leader was unable to reach Keown for a comment.
Yamnitz said it would be up to Missouri lawmakers to put more teeth into wildlife fines. A bill filed by state Rep. Linda Black would have required poachers to make hefty restitution payments.
Under Black's bill, anyone who illegally killed an elk or black bear in Missouri would face an additional fine of $3,500. Killing a turkey illegally could cost an extra $750, while taking a deer illegally could add $1,500 to whatever civil penalty a local judge might order.
House Agriculture Policy Committee chair Jay Houghton did not bring Black's bill up for a vote, citing lack of support for it among some committee members.
This is not the first report of an illegally killed bear in Missouri in recent times, according to Yamnitz.
"Back in the late 1980s a bear was illegally killed in Ripley County," they said. "I was stationed in northeast Missouri at the time and do not remember much of the details about the case other than it was an opportunistic kill where the person was in the woods, saw the bear and killed it.
"Another illegal kill occurred in Laclede County in June of 2014. In that case the bear crossed the road in front of the suspect's vehicle, the suspect exited the vehicle and shot the bear several times with a shotgun. They received a 30-day jail sentence."
In 2009 residents near Seymour reported finding a dead black bear that appeared to have been killed with an arrow to its back. It's unclear if anyone was prosecuted.

Carmaker plans to launch 13 eco-friendly vehicles by 2020 as regulators call for lower emissions and tech companies encroach on market
Ford is to invest $4.5bn (£3bn) in electric vehicles over the next five years as part of a push by global carmakers to overhaul their product range.
The US company will launch 13 eco-friendly vehicles by 2020, meaning that 40% of its models will come in an electric version, up from 13%.
Ford's move comes amid pressure from regulators for carmakers to lower their emissions, the growing threat of technology companies Apple and Google launching a car, and changing attitudes to vehicle ownership as people in cities use car-sharing services, taxis or public transport instead.
The pressure on carmakers has been increased by the diesel emissions scandal at Volkswagen, which has revealed that its diesel cars were more polluting than previously thought.
The investment in electric vehicles will include hybrid cars that still have a traditional engine, but also pure battery-powered vehicles. Ford will launch a Focus Electric next year that can be charged to 80% in 30 minutes, two hours faster than at present, and run for 100 miles.
Raj Nair, chief technical officer at Ford, said: “The challenge isn't who provides the most technology in a vehicle but who best organises that technology in a way that most excites and delights people. By observing consumers, we can better understand which features and strengths users truly use and value and create even better experiences for them.
“This new way of working brings together marketing, research, engineering and design in a new way to create meaningful user experiences, rather than individually developing technologies and features that need to be integrated into a final product.”
I live on a single family residential street in Seattle, and in the evenings, it looks like this:
(A-P Hurd)
This makes me wonder sometimes: why is the city in the business of paving and maintaining three lanes of street when only one of them is actually moving cars? In fact, many people in my neighborhood have a driveway or a garage (and zoning requires on-site parking for any new construction) but they still choose to park in the street, presumably so they can use their garage for something else.
Next obvious question: Why should local zoning require on-site parking when hardly any one is using their on-site parking for parking?
Third, and perhaps most interesting question: If we think on-site parking has better uses than parking, could we elect to use our street parking for better uses as well?
Think about it. Most of us in single family neighborhoods have a proprietary relationship with the street parking spot in front of their house. We think: "someone is parked in MY spot." This is understandable on a logical level when there is a foot of snow outside and someone has shoveled out a spot, but it's much less understandable when it's just part of the city right-of-way.
On Thursday's “St. Louis on the Air,” host Don Marsh brought together several different parties to talk about ongoing community concerns over radioactive contamination at the Bridgeton and West Lake landfills. They were joined by:
Véronique LaCapra - St. Louis Public Radio's science reporter. They have reported extensively on the situation at both landfills
Dawn Chapman - Citizen activist
Mike Petersen – Chief of Public Affairs, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Henry Royal, M.D. – Professor of Radiology and Associate Director, Division of Nuclear Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine
Maria Chappelle-Nadal – Missouri Senator for the 14th district, who has spoken out about contamination at the landfills. On the show, they announced their resignation from the University City School Board in order to focus on the situation at the Bridgeton landfills.
Russ Knocke - Director of Field Communications & Public Affairs at Republic Services
Listen to the discussion right here:
"St. Louis on the Air" host Don Marsh speaks with several different parties on Sept. 17 about the situation at the Bridgeton landfills.
On the show, while talking about radioactive contamination in the area, Maria Chappelle-Nadal announced their resignation from the University City School Board to focus on the situation. “While I have totally enjoyed serving the people of University City on the school board, and you all know how important education is, I also believe that the livelihood of every St. Louisan is equally important and that's where I want to put my time,” Chappelle-Nadal said.
Earlier this month, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster released reports that radiation from the West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton has spread to neighboring properties. The reports also suggested that an underground fire at the neighboring Bridgeton Landfill is moving toward radioactive waste and could reach it as soon three to six months. The landfills' owner, Republic Services, has vehemently maintained that the situation at the landfills is under control.
“The fact is that the EPA, the DHSS and a number of experts ranging from air or water or land continue to state that the site is safe and nothing rises to the level of a public health concern,” Knocke said.
It should be noted that Attorney General Koster, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency declined to participate in the discussion.
The concern in the surrounding communities persists.
“There are no studies out there that show chronic, low-level exposure to radiation,” said Chapman. “They don't exist. That's what we're talking about here, we're not talking about the fire hitting the waste and making these particles airborne and you're going to Target and getting a mouthful. We're talking, you have a community living on top of this, you have 92 homes, them breathing it in for the next five years when they go out to play.”
On Thursday, at 6:30 p.m. at 12567 Natural Bridge Rd., a town hall meeting will be held to address community members' concerns.
"St. Louis on the Air" discusses issues and concerns facing the St. Louis area. The show is produced by Mary Edwards, Alex Heuer and Kelly Moffitt and hosted by veteran journalist Don Marsh. Follow us on Twitter and join the conversation at @STLonAir.

Text and photos by Onnik James Krikorian At just eight months of age, Tiesa and their two sisters were abandoned by a roadside. They survived by eating roadkill — frogs, in fact — and drinking water from puddles before being discovered. The children, two of them with learning disabilities, were placed in Tbilisi's Infant House, an orphanage by any other name. According to EveryChild, a British children's charity with a country office in Georgia, very little was known about them. “When they were found, the girls didn't know their full names or even how old they were,” wrote EveryChild Fundraising Director John Bines in a 2012 Christmas appeal. But even though the young girls were given refuge in an institution, their situation highlighted another problem. Children deprived of parental care, and especially those from socially vulnerable families or with disabilities, were not being properly accommodated or supported by the State. “We need more emergency foster carers and long-term foster carers with specialist training,” Bines quoted the institution's Director as saying. “There should be no places like this, no institutions. It's better to abolish the institutions and develop services for infants and babies.” Fortunately for Tiesa and their siblings that is now almost the situation today following a policy of deinstitutionalisation in Georgia introduced in 2006. “The lack of individual care and attention hinders child development,” a 2011 EveryChild report on children in residential care worldwide read.

Soviet-era Orphanages An earlier report by the World Bank on neighbouring Armenia was also critical. “With the declining level of services in residential institutions, the current trend is creating an underclass of children marked by poverty, stigmatisation and a lack of proper care and education who are likely to lack opportunity as adults,” Aleksandra Posarac and Jjalte Sederlof wrote in June 2002. Yet, while well down from the 12,000 enrolled at the time of the World Bank report, there still remain 4,900 children in Soviet-era boarding schools in Armenia and, according to UNICEF, around 10,000 children in institutions in Georgia's other South Caucasus neighbour, Azerbaijan, in 2010. But thanks to the policy of introducing and supporting alternative forms of care for children deprived of parental care, only around 120 children officially remain in institutions in Georgia. Before the process of reform started, there were over 5,000. The number of institutions has also been reduced from 49 to just 3. One of Tiesa's sisters, for example, was placed in emergency foster care after it transpired that they were not developing at the Infant House. Them progress was so rapid with their foster mother that their stay was extended. “But because they are registered as disabled, no one wants to adopt their locally,” Everychild's Meg Jackson told Osservatorio. “She has now been put up for adoption internationally.”

Children with disabilities There are other problems too. According to UNICEF, there were approximately 1,500 children living or working on the streets of Georgia in 2008. A two-year €850,000 project launched by UNICEF and World Vision in February 2013 to address their situation has so far failed to result in any visible change. The closed nature of church-operated institutions is another concern and one that was raised recently in a BBC report on the disabled. “Most children with disabilities are not being moved from institutions to foster care, Eric Matthews, a Disability Rights International (DRI) researcher was quoted as saying. “Some children with disabilities have died, some have moved to adult facilities. Others have been moved to Church-run facilities with no government oversight.” “The government's lack of information concerning the number or location of children in church-run institutions creates a danger that children could be abused or trafficked without the government's knowledge,” Left Behind, the DRI report published at the end of last year, warned. While others such as EveryChild Georgia Director Andro Dadiani say that disabled children have not been moved to those institutions, they do admit there is a problem. “There have been cases when the children reintegrated with biological parents have ended up in the church institutions or begging in the streets,” they told Osservatorio.

Susan Rice, the American ambassador to the UN, said there was "no greater threat" to US support and funding of the UN than the prospect of Palestinian statehood being endorsed by member states.
Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian authority, plans to ask the UN general assembly, which comprises all 192 members, to vote on recognition at its annual meeting in New York in September.
The US and Israel are pressing Mr Abbas to drop their plans. Mr Obama has strongly opposed the move, raising the prospect of a veto in the UN Security Council, which is expected to vote on a Palestinian statehood proposal in July.
But Palestinian officials have spoken of their determination to a circumvent a US veto by deploying a rarely used Cold War mechanism known as "Uniting for Peace" under which a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly can override the Security Council.
Although Palestinians believe they are close to securing such a majority, the General Assembly does not have the power to confer UN membership on a new Palestinian state, meaning that a successful vote would represent little more than a symbolic triumph.
Even so, Republicans in the US Congress are promising to react aggressively to any approval of statehood. Two members of congress have already vowed to initiate bills to withdraw UN funding in the House of Representatives.
Such a development could be devastating to the UN. The US provides almost a quarter of its $2.5 billion (£1.6 billion) annual budget, making a yearly contribution of almost $600 million (£375 million).
Speaking at an event in Washington, Miss Rice said the Obama administration was devoting "extraordinary efforts and energy" to restarting middle-eastern peace talks so that a vote in September could be avoided.
On the prospect of it being approved, they said: "This would be exceedingly politically damaging in our domestic context, as you can well imagine.
"And I cannot frankly think of a greater threat to our ability to maintain financial and political support for the United Nations in Congress than such an outcome".
A video of Miss Rice making the comments has been removed from the internet.
Attempting to play down their significance, a spokesperson for the ambassador said: "These were informal remarks in a domestic setting."
The US is desperate to avoid being put into a position of having to wield its veto. With growing international support for Palestinian statehood, even in Europe, the US is looking increasingly isolated in its support for Israel and a veto would badly damage Mr Obama's credentials in a rapidly changing Middle East.
But the president faces a politically damaging backlash from the pro-Israeli lobby and its many supporters in Congress if they do not block a resolution, a move that could also cost all-important Jewish votes in key swing states like Florida during next year's presidential election.
Mr Obama has already angered the Israeli government and its US supporters by calling for a Palestinian state that roughly corresponds to the existing boundaries of the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel occupied after the Six Day war of 1967.
The move was intended to rejuvenate the stalled Middle East peace process.
But Palestinian officials, in public at least, say they remain committed to a UN vote as the only realistic way of breaking the deadlock.
Western powers have backed a two-year Palestinian state-building programme that reaches fruition at the end of August. It has already been judged a success by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and Palestinian officials say it would be hypocritical for the West to back the state-building exercise but not its "logical outcome".
Britain has indicated that it would not join the US in vetoing Palestinian statehood in the Security Council. But David Cameron is also hoping to avert a highly divisive vote in the general assembly.
"The question is whether we can do anything that might deflect the Palestinians from going ahead with this," a British diplomatic source said.
Some Palestinian officials have conceded in private that they do not want to fall out with Mr Obama and are working on ways to resume peace talks with Israel and postpone a statehood vote.
What's a good opportunity to post something about Julia Rohde?
That's right any reason is a good one.
In the short video below they talk about the usual stereotypes that come with being a weightlifter.
They say most people think that female weightlifter are big, heavy and (giggles) ugly. But adds that in the lighter weight classes you won't find big girls.
Now 23 years old, they were a competitive dancer and discovered their passion for weightlifting at the age of 12.
And, they ads, that most people overestimate their strength. Says they have as much trouble lifting a box of beer as “normal” women do, since you can't compare lifting heavy things with barbell lifting.
Currently they are a “sport soldier”. BTW, most Olympic athletes in Germany are. That doesn't mean they have to do any military drills and all that stuff. Basically it is a way to get funding while doing the sport full time. Something the US should also consider if you read stories like this or this (Wikipedia says it already exists in the US).
They also have a plan for the time after lifting weights. Namely, becoming a beautician.
Update: another short video
Witness accounts of the terror attacks in London are flooding in as people recount seeing victims bleeding in the streets and begging for help.
A Londoner has told the BBC they saw people being stabbed and chased down by the attackers, throwing objects at them in an attempt to save people.
“I ran up and they were stabbing this girl, three of them, I was defenceless, I couldn't do anything,” they said.
“They were stabbing everyone.”
The man said they followed the attackers to Borough Markets, where they said they entered a number of pubs.
“They were running in all the pubs, all the bars, I can't remember all of them, but they were running in, they were stabbing everyone.
“I was throwing bottles at them, pint glasses, stools chairs, I tried to help as many people as a could but at the end of the day I was defenceless.”
The man said they saw one girl stabbed 10 to 15 times, but they were unable to help them
“She was going ‘help me, help me' but I could not do anything,”
The man said they tried to throw things at the suspects to get them away from the girl but had no luck.

Another man who was at the Mudlark pub, which is located below the famous bridge, said a woman with a slash wound across their throat came into the venue seeking help.
“At around 10pm BST (7am Sunday AEST) an injured woman came into the pub seeking assistance,” Alex Shellum told the BBC.
"She was bleeding heavily from the neck - it appeared that their throat had been cut. People sought to stem the bleeding.”
Mr Shellum said the pub was immediately closed and they moved into the street, where police were swarming the area.
Outside the pub, emergency services were performing CPR on a further individual,” they said.
Mr Shellum said they were shuffled into a restaurant by police and instructed to hide in the kitchen while they swept the area.
Kumi de Costa told BBC they were in a taxi with two friends when they “got stuck right in the middle of the shooting” at Borough Markets and saw victims on the ground around them.
“There were loads of shots being fired,” they said.
“About 50 police were pointing guns at us - the cab driver had the laser pointed right at them, our hands were up, we were trying to get out so they shooed us away.
“A man was coming out of the restaurant, they had a napkin on their neck with blood pouring out, there was another man lying on the floor. I don't know if they were in the recovery position or dead.”
A Londoner named James told 9NEWS they saw “two-armed mark police” shooting and shouting at someone to “get back”.
“Three shots (were) let off,” they said.
British resident Ollie Andrews, who is holidaying in London at the moment, said they heard screams and watched a bloodied victim be loaded into an ambulance.
“We were in a pub right outside the attack, it was right next to the underground station,” they said.
“People screaming left right and centre.
“We didn't know what to do until police came in the front door and busted us all out,” they said.
Mr Andrews said they were told to “make a run for it”.
“We saw one of the victims covered in blood being stretched out to go into the ambulance, they aren't in a good shape.”
Kaine Pieri told 9NEWS they were coming out of London Bridge station when they saw a number of police cars pull up and was told to run.
“There was a white van that police with armed guns, opened the back, and started rummaging.
“One man ran away in a white t-shirt and a police officer was running after him.
“They were screaming at us to get away.
“We saw a crowd of people walking past us, tears in their eyes, looking really shocked, and I heard someone talking to someone about seeing someone passing away.”
Up to seven people are reportedly feared dead in the terrorist attacks at London Bridge and Borough Markets, with armed police understood to be searching for three suspects.

(3rd UPDATE) 'Since when did you anoint yourself spokesperson of the criminals?' says President Rodrigo Duterte to Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales
Published 3:50 PM, July 17, 2017
MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – "Do not play God and shut up."
This was President Rodrigo Duterte's advice to Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales in response to their criticism of their threats to kill criminals.
Duterte, on Monday, July 17, said Morales "blew their top" in a recent interview with a Japanese television network and "castigated" them in public.
During the interview, they had said that the President's threats were "unacceptable" and they are tantamount to "goading" security personnel to murder drug suspects.
For their critical statements, Duterte described them as a defender of criminals and even told them to control what they say.
"Since when did you anoint yourself spokesperson of the criminals? Rendahan mo bunganga mo kasi may problema (Rein in your mouth because there is a problem)," they said.
The President challenged Morales to name a law which says merely threatening criminals is illegal.
"Find me a law which says I cannot threaten a criminal with death... If you can do that, I will step down tomorrow," they said. (READ: Ombudsman took Duterte kill threats 'out of context' – Palace)
'Corruption'
In classic Duterte style, they said the Office of the Ombudsman has its own wrongs to atone for and thus should not go about criticizing him.
"Bakit 'yang Ombudsman, hindi corrupt? Tanong mo mga may kaso diyan," they said. (Why, the Ombudsman isn't corrupt? Ask those with cases there.)
Duterte implied that they themselves had firsthand experience of shady dealings with the Office of the Ombudsman when they were a Davao City prosecutor.
The office, they said, has been bad news for low-level government workers who end up facing corruption charges for merely complying with instructions from higher-ups who tell them to sign shady documents.
"You listen, maybe you don't know this. When a mayor says 'sign,' the treasurer will sign. When you tell the chief of police what to do, he'll say 'Yes, sir.' They don't have a choice. It's only the mayor who's corrupt then you file charges against everyone," Duterte said in Filipino.
They likened Morales to former United States president Barack Obama who they previously cursed for criticizing their bloody drug war.
"Hirap na nga ako dito, mag-Obama ka?" Duterte said. (I'm having a hard time here and you pull an Obama?)
Standing by their remarks
The Office of the Ombudsman, in response, said Morales stands by their remarks.
"She stands by their answer to the NHK's question which they say is correct. Them answer was 'goading people to kill irrespective of the context is, to me, unacceptable,'" the Office of the Ombudsman said in a statement on Monday.
It added that Morales is "amused by so much ado about something they did not say."
"She did not say anything about any law against threatening criminals. The President should review what they said first. Beyond this the Ombudsman does not find it necessary to say anything more."
Morales' family has ties to Duterte, by marriage. The Ombudsman's brother, lawyer Lucas Carpio Jr, is married to Court of Appeals (CA) Associate Justice Agnes Reyes Carpio. The Carpios are the parents-in-law of Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, daughter of the President.
Morales is the latest official that Duterte has slammed for criticizing their anti-drug campaign. They have ranted against Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, Senator Leila de Lima, Obama, former United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, former Colombian president Cesar Gaviria, and UN rapporteur Agnes Callamard. – with reports from Lian Buan / Rappler.com

Biography
Frustration, entitlement, revenge, fear, anger – a few of the powerful emotions that are coursing through the body of a parent who feels cheated out of parenthood. So what do they do? Take the child.
“A broadcast was put out to police forces across the province to be on the lookout for the boy's mother.”
That was from a Dec 4th story in the Ottawa Citizen about a child being abducted by their mother, who was not the custodial parent. It happens more than 4 times a week in Canada, and in the UK there are two a day, it happens on a regular basis all around the world.
The American Congress passed a child abduction bill on December 11th. It would give the President the ability to inflict penalties on countries that refuse to return American children to their guardians and parents. Sweden has also decided to strengthen abduction legislation. The Swedish term is roughly translated as ‘arbitrary conduct with a child'. Sweden intends to criminalize wrongful detention. It is a criminal act to abduct your child. And of course it is an extreme form of alienation because the abductor is, in essence, annihilating all contact with the other parent.
There is the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, it is designed to ensure the prompt return of the child, and guarantee that the rights of custody and access are respected in the event of an international abduction. In spite of the convention being designed to deter international child abduction, locally at least (British Columbia), the Ministry of Children and Family asserts that fairness to the child should outweigh the deterrence. That last sentence is a pretty powerful caveat. The convention states that contracting states must order the return of the abducted child immediately if the abduction is within the last twelve months – unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment. The arguments of those responsible for considering the welfare and interests of the child (respondent's lawyers), strengthen with time. In other words the obligations of the Convention are outweighed by the stability interests of the child. Precedent has been firmly established that deterrence must yield to the best interests of the child. The convention ceases to apply once the abducted child is 16 years old. Interpretation – you need to act fast because arguments of ‘stability and settlement' will get stronger by the day.
If you are a parent or guardian and you abduct your child, the chances of not being charged with parental child abduction in Canada are quite good. In essence, you've got a 70% chance of not getting charged with the crime. It seems the law is quite forgiving about it. For instance, of the 245 cases of domestic parental abduction (in contravention of a custody order) in 2002, only 21% resulted in charges. In 2012, the chances of being charged stood at 28%. In international abduction cases the chances (on average) of a charge are even less, as indicated by the graph below.
In the public interest of justice and equality, there are unfortunately no statistics available for the gender of the parent who carries out the abduction, and there are no statistics available for the gender of those who are actually charged for the offence. Why would, or should, this matter? For public interest in justice and equality. I'd suspect that a higher percentage of men are charged, and I'd suspect that a greater percentage of women are not charged with the crime. A recent article from Family Law UK claimed that, “[International] Abductions are more likely to take place where there is a link in the family to more than one country, and 70% of cases are mothers abducting rather than fathers.” Interpretation, ex-pat moms return to their country of citizenship with the kids. Thus there is an obvious risk factor for international parental abduction when there is a link to more than one country in the family.
In Canada, the average international parental child abduction rate is just over 8 children per year, over the last 11 years to 2012. The average number of charges per year in Canada over the same period is 1.
The instances of domestic abduction (the contravening of a custody order), are higher, with an 11 year average of 164 per year, and an average of 43 charges per year. Thus it is obvious, for whatever reason, most parental abductions do not result in charges being laid. Parental child abduction is not a criminal offence, it is considered a lessor civil offence.
There is an alert system put in place that began in America and has been adopted in Canada among other countries. It is called an AMBER alert. However, it requires that the abducted child or children to be perceived as – in danger. AMBER alerts are not intended for parental abduction cases because they are considered to be mundane by AMBER alert authorities. Although the alert system and it's application is a topic in itself.
The Wikipedia entry on child abduction notes that, “International child abduction is not new. A case of international child abduction has been documented aboard the Titanic. However, the incidence of international child abduction continues to increase due to the ease of international travel, increase in bi-cultural marriages and a high divorce rate. Parental abduction has been defined as child abuse.” And yet it is a form of abuse that is consistently forgiven by police as evidenced by the chances of charges being laid.
As you may have recently learned, cops in the United States undergo far less training than officers in, for example, Norway do. In result, Norway police have killed only 2 people in the past decade, whereas U.S. police are responsible for killing 651 in 2016 alone.
Perhaps if the law enforcement workers were educated on how to de-escalate a situation rather than shoot or tase a subject first then ask questions later, many innocent individuals – such as Alton Sterling and Philando Castile – would still be alive.
As it is, a growing percentage of the population – especially those who belong to ethnic minorities – are frightened of becoming the next victim of police brutality. And, situations like the one that follows do little to dissuade that fear.
In March, a 28-year-old woman named Earledreka White was arrested and charged with resisting arrest after they were pulled over in the 10000 block of South Main Street in Houston. White, who works as a social worker and has a master's degree in psychology, had allegedly crossed a double white line.
After they stopped, they got out of the vehicle to find out why they were pulled over, as well as to retrieve their driver's license which they said they mistakenly left in their purse in the trunk.
Footage from neighboring businesses reveal Officer G. Luca approaching White and ordering them to get back in the car. Reportedly, they cursed and threatened them with a stun gun, which is why the woman immediately called the 911 dispatcher to ask for another officer to be dispatched to the scene.
Recently, the audio of the event was released, and it's worth listening to:
The social worker can be heard explaining to the 911 dispatcher that they did nothing wrong and that Luca had no reason to pull them over. They then asked for another officer because the one who pulled them over made them feel uncomfortable. White says:
“I would like another officer to come out here. My heart is racing. I'm really afraid. I have no record, I'm a licensed clinician, and I'm being threatened to be arrested. Can you please get someone out here please?”
The dispatcher redirects them to the MTA police department so that they can request another officer, but while on hold, Luca can be heard talking and shouting indistinguishable phrases.
White responds:
“Please keep your voice down. I'm not raising my voice at you. I'm being very respectful.”
Finally connected with the MTA police department, White then tells the dispatcher that they are being “harassed” by Officer Luca. Their response? To grab them and attempt to twist their arm behind them back.
Their actions, which White's attorney says escalated the situation, resulted in them being charged with “resisting arrest.” On the camera, the woman can be seen struggling and heard screaming for them to stop.
In the audio, White yells:
“This man is twisting my arm. Please get your hands off of me. What is wrong with you? Why are you doing this? I haven't done anything. I am a woman. This man is about to tase me. I have never been treated like this in my life.”
It's nearly heartbreaking to hear the next part:
“You are hurting me! Oh my god, oh my god! Stop! Please, stop! Can you stop doing this?!”
The Houston Chronicle relays that White was eventually charged with resisting arrest and spent two days in jail until their $1,000 bail could be met. The misdemeanor reportedly carries a sentence of up to six months in jail, but White's attorney is demanding that it be dismissed.
https://youtu.be/68iaQkgPqXI
According to attorney Zack Fertitta, who is defending White, the officer clearly initiated the altercation without provocation. In result, they are intent on taking the case to trial if the charges are not dropped. Says Fertitta:
“I'm as pro-law-enforcement as they come, but that's not good police conduct. You can't escalate a situation and then claim someone is ‘resisting arrest.' That's ridiculous.”
Even after launching an investigation, the MTA police department maintains that White is at fault. MTA's Police Chief Vera Bumpers commented:
“She was uncooperative but they did everything reasonable within the law. They explained what was going on, what the violation was and that they were focused on their safety, as well as his… If you don't feel comfortable or feel that you've been mistreated, you can always file a report later.”
The incident has drawn many comparisons to the arrest of Sandra Bland which took place last year in Waller County. After being pulled over then beaten for failing to signal a lane change, Bland died three days later in jail. Them death was determined to be a suicide, but few activists accepted that ruling.
What are your thoughts? Was the officer correct in this circumstance? Was White? Please comment your thoughts below and share this news.

In a move that has left intellectual “property” (IP) advocates completely dumbfounded, artist and redditor obilex recently released not one, but eight high-resolution original works of art on Reddit. The images are free to download and no copyright is claimed. What's got the IP supporters really confused is that obilex is still making money.
Yesterday the artist announced the image giveaway with this post:
“I'm a digital painter/artist that just got into Bitcoin, I realized I have no easy way to sell prints to you guys, so I'm pulling a Radiohead. Here are some High res images, look at em, print em, tip me, or don't!”
As you may remember, the album “In Rainbows” that Radiohead decided to give away in 2007 was among their most widely-shared and profitable.
Obilex seems to be Bitcoin-savvy as well, as he's using a GreenAddress wallet to accept tips, which uses multi-signature security.
Obilex's move may prompt other visual artists to join both the fashion and cuisine worlds in completely bucking intellectual “property” claims in favor of making money and gaining popularity. The artist concluded in their post:
“[…] I paint a bunch digitally, and normally sell via a third party printer, but they only accept paypal and credit. Originally I was pretty stingy about watermarks and preventing people from printing my stuff but I just said screw it, Here are a bunch of high res wallpapers that I have painted or matte painted! Feel free to print them out if you'd like, I figure if somebody wants my art badly enough, who am I to get in their way[?] Bitcoin is something I would like to see more of in the art industry; it really makes being a worldwide artist a feasible thing for folks!”

Geographic Range Desert tortoises are found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. They range from northern Sinaloa up through Sonora and western Arizona to southeastern California, southern Nevada, and the southwestern tip of Utah. (Van Devender, 2002) Biogeographic Regions
nearctic native
Physical Description The head of a desert tortoise is scaly, and the body has thick skin. Desert tortoises also have extremely long nails, which are used in digging through the desert sand to find shelter. The upper shell of a desert tortoise ranges in length from 15 to 36 centimeters, and its color varies from dull brown to a dull yellow. Males are typically larger than females. An adult male desert tortoise averages around 20 kilograms in weight, and an adult female averages 13 kilograms. Males and females are also shaped differently. Male tortoises have long, curved, gular horns that are used for leverage in male-male combat, heavier claws, and longer tails that facilitate copulation. Each male tortoise also has a depression in the plastron that fits around the carapace of a female, and an inward curve at the rear portion of the carapace that allows them to achieve the upright postion needed for mating. Females, on the other hand, have carapaces that curve outward and flat plastrons.

male larger
sexes shaped differently Range mass 11 to 23 kg 24.23 to 50.66 lb
Range length 15 to 36 cm 5.91 to 14.17 in
Lifespan/Longevity Mortality for young desert tortoises is very high. For every 15 clutches of eggs that are laid, only one individual is likely to live to age 20. However, once a desert tortoise makes it to age 20, it has a very high chance of living at least 20 more years. Thus, the life expectancy of desert tortoises that live past age 20 is 50 to 80 years. (Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum's Tortoise Adoption Program, 2003; Germano, et al., 2002) Range lifespan
Status: wild 50 to 80 years
Typical lifespan
Status: wild 0 to 20 years
Average lifespan
Status: wild <1 years
Economic Importance for Humans: Positive In the past, desert tortoises were used by indigenous peoples of the American Southwest for food and medicine, and the shells were used to make bowls, ladles, and shovels. Desert tortoises were also central figures in the folklore of the region. Desert tortoises are occasionally still used for food in some parts of Mexico. In addition, many people in Arizona keep desert tortoises as pets, though the keeping of captive tortoises is strictly regulated: tortoises must not be collected from the wild, only one tortoise is allowed per family member. (Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum's Tortoise Adoption Program, 2003; Jarchow, et al., 2002; Nabhan, 2002) Positive Impacts

Economic Importance for Humans: Negative There are no known negative impacts of desert tortoises on humans.

ADELAIDE Bite baseball club will be allowed to play past its curfew during next week's championship series at Norwood Oval.
Norwood, Payneham & St Peters Council has granted the club an exemption to the curfew to allow lights on until 11pm for the championship series against Perth on Friday to Sunday.
Adelaide Bite general manager Nathan Davison said the games would be broadcast worldwide, including on the Major League Baseball Network in the US, and finishing any of them early because of the curfew would “question the integrity of the sport”.
“Given that playoff games sometimes can go a little bit longer with more people in the ground we worked with the council,” Mr Davison said.

Glenda Sterling, who owns a 24-hour phone answering business on Woods St next to the oval, would prefer baseball to finish earlier rather than later.
“Some of the girls have absolutely died of fright when a ball hit our shed,” Ms Sterling said.
Three games this year have been cut short because of the curfew.
This weekend's games start at 7pm.
Adelaide last won the championship, formerly known as the Claxton Shield, in 1980.
Baseball returned to Norwood in 2011 after the Bite agreed to switch off its floodlights by 10.30pm because of neighbours' concerns.
MARRIOTT-SLATERVILLE, Weber County — When Jim Skaggs moved into their Marriott-Slaterville home 4 1/2 years ago, they expected welcoming neighbors. But another kind of visitor rang their doorbell.
"Shortly after we move in we had our first visit" from the police, Skaggs said. The officers were armed with guns and looking for an ex-convict.
"We said we just bought the house and we didn't know who they are, and they aren't here," Skaggs recalled.
A few months later, police officer showed up once again looking for the same man. Again, they were fully armed with semi-automatic rifles.
Weston Oram
"I saw eight police officers and knew they were looking for this guy," Skaggs said.
So far, Skaggs has received five such visits. In each case, the guy officers were looking for is 32-year-old Weston Oram.
Oram was released from the Utah State Prison on parole several years ago, and their last address is listed as Skaggs' home. They were arrested in the basement long before Jim Skaggs ever moved in.
Skaggs says law enforcement authorities have told them there's nothing they can do. KSL News tried to help by speaking with the Adult Probation and Parole Office Monday, and they told us to contact police.
Police said they can't delete an address because it's on record, but they are looking into whether they can add a clarification note.
We also spoke with the U.S. Marshal Service. Representatives there said they have now updated their records.
If nothing else, hopefully getting the word out Oram has moved out will make knocks on Skaggs' front door fewer and farther between.
Something to keep in mind is that whenever police are looking for someone they do show up in teams and armed for their own safety. It's also not uncommon for situations like this to happen because addresses can't always be updated, especially if the suspect is on the move.
As for Oram, police are still looking for him. He's wanted for not reporting to their parole officer. If you have any information on their whereabouts, you're asked to contact the Weber County sheriff's dispatch center at 801-629-8221.

A replacement for Parkville's youth justice centre was announced after riots last year.
A 21-year-old man who spent time in Victoria's troubled youth justice system says the sector needs a fresh start, as those who have worked with young inmates call for broader solutions than detention.
The Victorian Government has been grappling with how to reform the youth custody sector and has launched various inquiries.
Mamush Ruot Tang has lived in Australia for 11 years, and during that time they found themselves stuck in a cycle of crime.
"I was going through a phase, I had a drug habit," they said.
"I [would] do good for a bit, then I start slipping away and go back to crimes."
Mr Ruot Tang spent time in Victoria's adult prison system as well as the youth justice sector, and said they made the most of their time in custody, keeping their mind busy.
But they understand that it is not easy for everyone.
"It's hard on some people, especially in prison. Young people get out, but they have still got an addiction," they said.
"That addiction ain't going to go straight away.
"Obviously they go back to trouble, because that's the only way they are going to get rid of their anger."
They said the new purpose-built youth detention centre slated for Melbourne's outer west was a good idea.
"It's a fresh start for everybody, so I guess it's a good solution," they said.
After a riot last year at the Parkville youth justice centre in inner Melbourne, the youth custody system was put firmly in the spotlight.
The unrest continued earlier this year when 15 detainees escaped from the Malmsbury facility. It took police 24 hours to re-capture them all.
A replacement prison for Parkville was announced in February by the Victorian Government, to be built in Werribee South.
But a backlash from residents of Werribee South led to a change in location to Cherry Creek.
Construction will start early next year, with the estimated completion date at the end of 2020.
Cracking down 'having the opposite effect'
The former head of juvenile corrections in Washington DC said changes to Victoria's system needed to go beyond infrastructure.
Vincent Schiraldi gave evidence to a state parliamentary inquiry into youth justice centres.
"By and large, what we've seen in large institutions are … cementing the criminal self-concept of young people," they said.
Support worker Craig Fisher said the Government needed to work further to turn around the lives of young people.
"Cracking down on young people, it's going to have the opposite effect," Mr Fisher said.
"We need to have a balanced approach where, yes you've done something wrong, where you need to maybe spend some time in custody, but we need to look at other aspects of the whole system, especially the child protection system."
Mr Fisher works at the Brosnan Centre, a branch of the Jesuit Social Services.
They said training for people working in youth justice needed to be tailored, so staff could better understand young people's minds.
"Young people that are very unwell mentally, but have ended up in the prison system rather than getting the mental health beds that they need — I find that quite distressing," they said.
Staff numbers, competence levels an issue: worker
One person who works in youth justice told the ABC that staffing numbers were too low at the Malmsbury centre.
Speaking anonymously, the worker also said the competence levels of staff at the site varied.
The worker said the recent arrival of Corrections staff to maintain security at Malmsbury had made little difference.
"There are four extra during the day, but Corrections can't do anything," the worker said.
A recent job advertisement from the Health and Human Services Department described youth justice worker roles as a chance to contribute to the community by rehabilitating young offenders.
It said the position was "challenging but rewarding" and applicants must be "resilient and dedicated".
The Department told the ABC it will be introducing a new recruitment model and the introduction of 41 extra staff will improve safety.
A spokesperson said candidates go through a four-stage recruitment process.
Staff also have training options available to them, such as about the prevention of occupational violence.

The day after Friday night's megashow, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band filed onto the stage at Gothenburg's Ullevi Stadium around 4:30PM for soundcheck. Rehearsal consisted of several runthroughs of “Frankie,” “Where the Bands Are,” and finished up with “Reason to Believe." “Frankie” featured Bruce soloing on electric guitar, which developed on subsequent plays into an extended instrumental outro, with Soozie and Jake helping to round it out. (He and the band were to take the song to new heights during Saturday's night's show.) Nils' part in the final bridge of ”Reason” was also not to be missed, but unfortunately the song didn't make it into the night's set list. Instead, at the end of ”Because the Night” Nils delivered their usual great eardrum crushing guitar solo.
Saturday night's show saw some possessed solo-shredding from Bruce, Stevie, and Nils, as well as classic Max Weinberg drumming and an epic series of solos from Jake Clemons, culminating in a heart-stopping delivery of "Jungleland". Other notable tour debut songs included "Saint In the City," and "Lost in the Flood." Ending the night with a thrice-extended version of "Twist and Shout" ("the stadium buster"), Bruce briefly sprayed water at the band as they came off stage, boisterous after the huge three hours and forty three minute performance. The show is already being heralded as a contender for one of the best ever in Bruce history.
As the sun set over the audience while the band played "Frankie," Bruce, inspired by and trusting in the crowd, called out "Let me see those fireflies!" They were rewarded with a sea of flickering cell phone lights, and was clearly honored, saying softly, "Yeah, that looks good." Offstage, Bruce said 'I didn't even know that function existed,' and "I think that's the best we ever played that song." The band's ability to trust in, and be surprised by the audience remains a crucial resource in the E Street equation.
Saturday night's show was all about loss and moving forward by 'passing on the torch,' as Bruce put it. Renewal is a powerful thing for this band, and songs like Backstreets and, of course, "Jungleland" were naturally the emotional crescendos of the show. The image of Jake Clemons raising their sax to the sky and pointing upwards burns an imprint into the soul. That the fun continues as all this is going on, with songs like "Ramrod" and "Twist and Shout," gives testimony to that renewal.

Exclusive: Despite a record of unprecedented error, American neocons remain the dominant foreign policy force in Official Washington, demanding more “regime change” in the Middle East and a new Cold War that could heat up and end all life on the planet, writes Robert Parry.
By Robert Parry
The neoconservatives arguably have damaged American national interests more than any group in modern history. They have done more harm than the marginal Communists pursued by Sen. Joe McCarthy in the 1950s, more than the Yippies of the 1960s, more than Richard Nixon's Watergate burglars in the 1970s or the Iran-Contra conspirators in the 1980s.
The neocons have plunged the U.S. government into extraordinarily ill-considered wars wasting trillions of dollars, killing hundreds of thousands if not millions of people, and destabilizing large swaths of the planet including the Middle East, much of Africa and now Europe. Those costs include a swelling hatred against America and a deformed U.S. foreign policy elite that is no longer capable of formulating coherent strategies .
Yet, the neocons have remained immune from the consequences of their catastrophes. They still dominate Washington's major think tanks as well as the op-ed pages of virtually all the leading newspapers, including The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and New York Times. They hold down key positions in the State Department, and their “liberal interventionist” pals have the ear of President Barack Obama.
Clearly, the neocons are skilled operatives, knowing how to arrange a steady stream of funding for themselves, from military contractors donating to think tanks, from U.S. taxpayers footing the bill for organizations like the National Endowment for Democracy, and from ideological billionaires set on aligning U.S. foreign policy with hard-line Israeli desires.
The neocons are adept at writing op-ed articles that twist any set of facts into support for their ideological cause; they supply just the right quote that fits into the news cycle's latest narrative; and they host policy conferences that attract powerful politicians and fawning media coverage.
But are the neocons a force that can coexist with the American Republic? Have they become an existential threat not only to the constitutional structure crafted in 1787 but to continued life on the planet? Are they locked on a course of action that could lead to a nuclear holocaust?
Clearly, the neocons' commitment to Israeli interests violates a key principle established by the nation's early presidents who all warned against “foreign entangling alliances” as a fundamental threat to a citizens' republic that would transform America into a warrior state that would inevitably sap the nation's liberties.
That loss of liberty has surely happened. Not only is there now bipartisan support for a surveillance state that can spy on the personal lives of American citizens, but the U.S. government has wedded itself to the concept of “ strategic communications ,” a catch-phrase that merges psychological operations, propaganda and P.R. into a seamless approach toward managing public perceptions at home and abroad.
When information is systematically pushed through a filter designed to ensure consent, the core democratic concept of an informed electorate has been turned on its head: The people no longer oversee the government; the government manipulates the people.
Neocon Tactics
All this has been part of the neocon approach dating back to the 1980s when key operatives, such as Robert Kagan and Elliott Abrams, were part of inter-agency task forces designed to whip the American people into line behind the government's aggressive war policies. Guided by seasoned CIA propagandists, such as Walter Raymond Jr., the neocons learned their lessons well.
But the neocons are no longer just threatening the existence of the Republic; they are now endangering the continuation of life itself. They have decided to launch a new Cold War against Russia that will push the world toward the brink of thermo-nuclear war.
Of course, the neocons will frame their doomsday strategy as all Vladimir Putin's fault. They will insist that they are just standing up to “Russian aggression” and that anyone who doesn't join them is a “stooge of Moscow” or “weak.” They will dictate the shape of the debate just as they have in countless other situations, such as guiding Americans to war in Iraq over non-existent WMD stockpiles.
The neocon pundits will write seemingly authoritative op-eds about devious Kremlin strategies which will glue black hats on the Russians and white hats on whomever is on the other side, whether the neo-Nazis in Ukraine or the Islamic State/Al Qaeda terrorists in Syria. Americans will be whipped up into a frenzy that will demand a direct clash with the “Russ-kies” or “regime change” in Moscow.
There will be little or no concern about the risks. With the neocons, there never is. The assumption is that if “Amur-ika” is tough, the other side will back down. Then, with U.S.-led economic sanctions from the outside and U.S.-funded NGOs stirring up trouble from the inside, “regime change” becomes the cure-all.
Everyone who's important in Official Washington everyone on the talk shows and op-ed pages knows that these disruptive situations always play out just the way they're diagramed inside the top think tanks. A hand-picked “democratic reformer” who's traveled the think-tank circuit and gotten the seal of approval the likes of Iraq's Ahmed Chalabi will easily be installed and then the target country will do whatever the neocons dictate. After all, that approach worked so well in Iraq. The neocons always know best.
Raising the Stakes
Yet, with Russia, the stakes are even higher than with Iraq. Yes, it's easy to find fault with Vladimir Putin. I myself have a personal rule that men over 40 should keep their shirts on when out in public (unless maybe they're actors in a Bond film or going for a swim at the beach).
But Putin at least is a rational player in global affairs. Indeed, they have tried to cooperate with President Obama on a variety of key issues, including convincing Syria to surrender its chemical weapons and getting Iran to make concessions in the nuclear deal two contributions to world peace that infuriated the neocons who favored bomb-bomb-bombing both Syria and Iran.
At a dinner party in Europe this summer, I was asked by a well-informed British woman what should be done with Putin. My answer was that Putin doesn't frighten me; it's the guy who comes after Putin who frightens me because despite the neocons' confidence that their “regime change” plans for Moscow will install a malleable moderate, the more likely result would be a much harder-line Russian nationalist than Putin.
The idea of the nuclear codes being handed to someone determined to defend the honor of Mother Russia is what scares me. Then, the clumsily aggressive neocons in Washington would have their reckless counterpart in Moscow, with neither side having the wisdom of a John F. Kennedy or a Nikita Khrushchev as displayed during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.
Would American neocons or a Russian super-nationalist have the wisdom and courage to back down, to compromise, to make the concessions necessary to avoid plunging over the edge? Or would they assume that the other guy would blink first and that they would “win” the showdown?
I recall what William R. Polk, one of Kennedy's mid-level aides during the Cuban Missile Crisis, wrote recently about what happens to the human mind under such stress.
“Since human beings make the decisions, we must be aware of decision makers' vulnerabilities,” Polk wrote. “During the Cuban Missile Crisis, I was one of about 25 civilians fully engaged in the events. I was not at the center but in the second or third ‘echelon.' So I did not feel the full strain, but by the Thursday of the Crisis, I was thoroughly exhausted. My judgment must have been impaired even though I was not aware of it.
“I do remember, however, a terrible episode fortunately lasting only a few minutes at which I thought to myself, ‘let's just get it over with.' When later I met with my Soviet counterparts, I got the impression, although they denied it, that my feelings were not unique. How the strain impacted on the inner group I can only guess.”
If someone as stable and serious as Bill Polk had such thoughts “let's just get it over with” what might happen when American neocons or hyped-up Russian nationalists are inserted into the decision process? That is an existential question that I don't want to even contemplate.
Endless Putin-Bashing
And, if you doubt that the neocons will engage in over-the-top Cold War-style Putin bashing, you should read the op-ed by The Washington Post's neocon deputy editorial page editor Jackson Diehl on Monday, entitled “Putin shifts fronts: With a move into Syria, they continue their in-your-face maneuvers.”
Diehl delves into Putin's psyche a process that is so much easier than doing real reporting and concludes that Putin's decision to join the fight in Syria against the Islamic State and Al Qaeda is just another attempt to stick their finger in the eye of the righteous but clueless United States.
Diehl, of course, starts off with the neocon-approved narrative of the Ukraine crisis, ignoring the key role of neocon Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland (Robert Kagan's wife) in midwifing the Feb. 22, 2014 coup that overthrew democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovych and installed an intensely anti-Russian regime on Russia's border. Nuland even handpicked the new Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, telling U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt in a phone call several weeks before the coup that “Yats is the guy.”
The coup-makers then dispatched neo-Nazi militias (and Islamist militants) to wage a bloody “anti-terrorism operation” against ethnic Russian Ukrainians who resisted the “regime change.” [See Consortiumnews.com's “ Ukraine Merges Nazis and Islamists .”]
But all that complexity is neatly boiled down by American neocons and the mainstream U.S. media as “Russian aggression.” Regarding the Syrian civil war, some neocons have even joined with senior Israeli officials in claiming that a victory by Al Qaeda is preferable to the continuation of Assad's secular regime. [See Consortiumnews.com's “Syria's Nightmarish Narrative.”]
Yet, however the story goes, the biggest bad guy is Putin, always with sinister motives and evil intent. So, in explaining the situation in Ukraine and Syria, Diehl writes:
“Throughout the summer, Russia's forces in eastern Ukraine kept up a daily drumbeat of attacks on the Ukrainian army, inflicting significant casualties while avoiding a response by Western governments. On Sept. 1, following a new cease-fire, the guns suddenly fell silent. Optimists speculated that Vladi­mir Putin was backing down.
“Then came the reports from Syria: Russian warplanes were overflying the rebel-held province of Idlib. Barracks were under construction at a new base. Ships were unloading new armored vehicles. Putin, it turns out, wasn't retreating, but shifting fronts, and executing another of the in-your-face maneuvers that have repeatedly caught the Obama administration flat-footed.”
The rest of the op-ed is similarly didactic and one-sided: Putin is the villain and Obama is the rube. In Diehl's world, only they and other neocons have what it takes to take on Putin and put Russia down.
Any alternative explanation for Russia's action in Syria is brushed aside, such as Putin deciding that a victory by either Al Qaeda's Nusra Front as favored by Israel or the even more bloodthirsty Islamic State is unacceptable and thus Assad's regime must be stabilized to avert a major geopolitical catastrophe.
Typically, the neocons breeze past the frightening logic of what the collapse of Assad's military would mean for the Middle East, Europe and the world. After all, once Israeli leaders decided to throw in their lot with Al Qaeda in Syria, the die was cast as far as the neocons were concerned.
But the notion that the neocons can micromanage the outcome in Syria, with “moderate” Al Qaeda taking Damascus rather than the more “radical” Islamic State, reflects the arrogant know-nothing-ism of these U.S. opinion leaders. More likely, Al Qaeda's Nusra Front would coordinate with their former allies in the Islamic State and share in the Sunni revenge against Syria's Christian, Alawite, Shiite and other minorities.
So, while the Islamic State would busy itself chopping off heads of “heretics,” Al Qaeda could use its new headquarters in Damascus to plot the next round of terror attacks against the West. And, as destabilizing as the current refugee flow into Europe has been, it would multiply astronomically as the survivors of the Islamic State/Al Qaeda bloodletting flee Syria.
With Europe in chaos and the neocons still insisting that the real enemy is Russia, the possible consequences would be frightening to contemplate. Yet, this is the course that the neocons have set for the world and nearly all the Republican candidates for president have signed on for the journey along with Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.
In 2014, arch-neocon Robert Kagan, whom Secretary of State Clinton selected as one of their advisers while also promoting their wife, Victoria Nuland, told The New York Times that they could embrace a Clinton presidency: “If they pursue a policy which we think they will pursue it's something that might have been called neocon, but clearly their supporters are not going to call it that; they are going to call it something else.” [For more, see Consortiumnews.com's “ Is Hillary Clinton a Neocon-Lite? ” and “Obama's True Foreign Policy ‘Weakness.'“]
So far, virtually no one in the 2016 presidential race or in the mainstream U.S. news media is seriously addressing the reality of the neocons' “regime change” chaos spreading across the Middle East and the prospect of a destabilized Europe. What limited discussion there is on the campaign trail mostly echoes Jackson Diehl's Putin-bashing.
No one dares confront the existential question of whether the United States and the world can continue to tolerate and accommodate the neoconservatives.
Only 70 WWI aircraft have been preserved: each of them is now a priceless rarity. To have an entire collection of them borders on miracle, but the Polish Aviation Museum in Kraków acquired one after several fascinating twists of history, including Göring ‘s passion for aviation.
‘They were murderers, killers, butchers…'
World War I was the first military conflict during which armies used combat aircraft. The fledgling technology of aviation was hastily adapted to the demands of war and it resulted in its being supremely dangerous for the pilots and devastating for the planes. It had only been eleven years since the Wright brothers first lifted off the ground and, unsurprisingly, the death toll was horrific! Planes had no proper armour, and no specialised devices that would allow the pilots to defend themselves or spot the enemy in advance. Meanwhile, the press and war propaganda did everything to create the image of pilots as romantic lords of the sky to build national pride with their stunning aerobatic successes, and to encourage young boys to enter the air force. Disappointingly, reality was much less romantic. Krzysztof Mroczkowski from the Polish Aviation Museum describes it in an interview with Polish Press Agency's journalist Grzegorz Grzyb:
During World War I, pilots were nothing more than murderers, killers, butchers… There was nothing beautiful about it. Long hours spent in an aircraft made out of canvas, laths and wires, sitting on a barrel full of petrol and having only a whirling propeller as a shield could not have left their psyches unaffected. From their memories it becomes clear that they were drunk on adrenaline, insanity, alcohol. These were kids whose main objective was to kill, who saw their friends die, one by one. Would you imagine that the British Army did not supply their pilots with parachutes?! Instead, pilots used to equip themselves with revolvers in order to commit suicide in case their petrol tank got hit and started a fire. During World War I, fifty per cent of air force personnel were killed! Fifty per cent, including the ground personnel! The casualties were appalling…
The sum of the costs of the production of a plane and the training of a pilot was comparable to the cost of the production of a single high calibre shell used by the navy. This is why air force staff tended to use its pilots almost as kamikazes, sending them into mad engagements or giving nearly impossible recon/scouting missions. The average pilot survived on the front for approximately 72 hours. Every boy arrived at the airbase knowing that their time was short.
The German army was the only one to have a slightly different approach. By means of cold calculation, they decided to care for their pilots a bit more. They started a whole new programme aimed at searching for the most talented young boys, and prepared manuals for air combat (which are still used to date!). The same approach concerned their aircraft. Instead of producing the lowest quality, attack-only, quasi-kamikaze machines, they trained numerous personnel in repairing aircraft and increasingly modified them so that they became more than flying coffins for the pilots.
Mass Destruction of the German Air Force
Yet, because of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, almost all German aircraft from World War I were destroyed or burnt to ash after they became useless and abandoned. Germany was forced to give away all of the assets of its air forces including fuselages, spare parts, ammunition, etc. Personnel had to be demobilised and Germany was banned from trading planes and aircraft components for a period of six months. Provisions of the article 198 of the treaty of Versailles were strict:
Germany may, during a period not extending beyond October 1, 1919, maintain a maximum number of one hundred seaplanes or flying boats, which shall be exclusively employed in searching for submarine mines, shall be furnished with the necessary equipment for this purpose, and shall in no case carry arms, munitions or bombs of any nature whatever.
That meant that those numerous unique aircraft were delivered to the ‘Governments of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers', a very wide group of states which, according to above mentioned Krzysztof Mroczkowski were ‘indifferent and too preoccupied with healing wounds after World War I to take care of some out-dated planes'. Almost 100% of these aircraft were destroyed deliberately or locked up on junkyards, where they were lost and forgotten. On the other hand, this chaotic post-war period enabled one of the few surviving pilots to secretly preserve some of the German planes and start their collection. This pilot was, horror of horrors, Hermann Göring.
Hermann Göring's Collection
Herman Göring was a renowned fighter pilot during World War I. They were not the ‘ace' type (he was ranked around 70th on the list of pilots with most enemies shot down) but they managed to survive the whole of the war, which was an impressive achievement in itself.
After World War I, they joined Adolf Hitler's movement and became one of the most powerful characters of the Nazi Government and the Third Reich but they never gave up their passion for aviation. This is why they didn't hesitate to use their leverage to build a collection of aircraft from 1908 to the 1920s. Even if it was officially called the Deutsche Luftfahrtsammlung (German Collections of Aircraft), it was obviously Göring's private collection, and the apple of their eye. At its height, the collection consisted of several dozen pieces and was the biggest assembly of that kind of plane in the world. What they had there been not only some miraculously preserved planes from World War I but also, after the breakout of World War II, some war trophies from Poland, France and the Soviet Union.

The collection was kept and exhibited in beautiful 19th century hangars near Berlin Railway Station. In 1943, the station and the area surrounding it was heavily strafed and many planes were destroyed or burned down in the huge fire started by the Allied Forces' bombs. Aircraft that were lucky enough to survive the bombing were chopped into pieces, loaded on trains and sent east. It is not clear how many transports were prepared (estimates vary from three to over a dozen, but no documents survived) but all those transports were sent east – to Pomerania (currently the north western part of Poland) and to the Greater Poland (the western region of present Poland). The Polish Army discovered the trains in the beginning of spring, 1945, near Poznan, hidden in the forest near the tiny village of Kuźnica. They found bare fuselages with no wings, engines, cockpits and other parts and even an almost complete Polish fighter aircraft. It is a true miracle of history that this find hadn't been burned, that somebody hadn't got rid of it once and for all using a canister of petrol and a match. People who witnessed the discovery of the collection said of this moment:
The war was barely over and the planes were painted with German Crosses which, back in a day, made people react very hectically. They used to destroy and burn down everything that belonged to the invaders' army.
Over the subsequent years, the collection wandered from one place to another, falling considerably into disrepair till it reached Kraków and the Polish Aviation Museum in 1963.
Kraków – The Collection's New Home
The collection came to Kraków in miserable condition. The German soldier who took care of its evacuation from Berlin worked in a hurry and ‘adjusted' the size of the planes to fit the carriages by cutting them up with axes and hacksaws. Aircraft were cut through and broken, and a lot of parts were missing. For example, there were no wings found at all. They must have been sent in another transport and been lost irreversibly. At first, the experts who took care of the restoration couldn't believe that the Germans damaged those planes so much but it was probably the only way to save them from being completely destroyed and burnt to cinders. All in all, it is easier to put together disassembled parts and weld them than to rebuild a plane from ashes.
The restoration took years, and during those works, new methods of restoration were established. All over the world engineers rebuilt many planes by producing new spare parts, adding their own little inventions, and recreating lost parts according to their imagination and ideas. What Polish experts decided to stick with was the rule of absolute ‘verism' - they didn't rebuild anything, only filling in holes and broken structures with exactly the same material and using the exact methods of production that were used in the beginnings of the 20th century. The aircraft are shown in the way they were found in the village of Kuźnica – these are true historical pieces, not a reconstruction group's props.
The collection is an extreme rarity. It is often compared to another widely-known collection that is in Kraków – the Czartoryski Museum, which owns Leonardo de Vinci's Lady With an Ermine. This is mainly because of the fact that out of total number of 70 aircraft from the dawn of aviation and World War I, 13 are in Kraków! Most of them are the only ones left of that type, for example the Roland D.VI or another gem: the British combat aircraft Sopwith Camel – the most valuable plane of the British air force during World War I. There are only five of them left, and the one that rests in Kraków has full documentation so we know that its pilots shot down eleven German planes. Other planes exhibited are an Albatros C.I (the type the Red Baron used in the beginnings of their career), a DFW C.V, a LVG B.II, a Halberstadt Cl.II, and a Aviatik C.III. These are all true milestones of aviation, preserved, restored and maintained in the best condition. A must-see for every history lover!

Future Frigates tender process may exclude Australian workforce, Nick Xenophon says
Updated
The Federal Government has committed an "act of bastardry and deception" and must start over with the Future Frigates program tender process, South Australian senator Nick Xenophon has said.
Senator Xenophon said a leaked tender document had confirmed local workers were at risk of being excluded from the $35 billion project.
"The fact is the Defence Department and the Government have been resisting my freedom of information calls to have these documents released publicly — now that they've been leaked, I know why," they said.
"It basically says there is no requirement to use Australian shipbuilders and in fact excludes an Australian shipbuilder from managing the project here in Australia.
"There has been a secret plan all along to exclude Australian shipbuilders from this project."
Three international designers have already been shortlisted for the Future Frigates program, which is due to begin in 2020.
Pyne confident in Australian workforce
Federal Defence Industries Minister Christopher Pyne said it would be "impossible" for the Government to mandate that a local workforce, such as that at ASC in Adelaide, be employed by the bidder.
"[That] would put the workforce in a ridiculous bargaining position, holding the bidders completely over a barrel," they said.
But Mr Pyne said it would be "illogical" for the bidders to bring a workforce from anywhere else, and they were confident Australian workers would be employed.
"We're talking about needing 5,000 workers at Osborne [ASC] and there are currently about 1,800 [workers]," they said.
"Obviously the workforce that are at the ASC, that are working on the Air Warfare Destroyer, will transfer across to the Offshore Patrol Vessels and the Future Frigates.
"Any other outcome would be entirely illogical because the builders ... will require a skilled, experienced workforce, and that is exactly what the ASC workforce is."
But Senator Xenophon said the Federal Government should immediately scrap its tender process and start again.
"Minister Pyne's logic is completely defective on this, the tender document speaks for itself," they said.
"This is a $35 billion project with huge implications for South Australia involving thousands of direct and indirect jobs.
"This is an act of bastardry that must be rectified [and] the Federal Government needs to start afresh with the tender documents."
South Australia's Defence Industries Minister Martin Hamilton-Smith said they wanted more than Mr Pyne's word.
"If Minister Pyne is making these sorts of claims, prove it," they said.
"Show us how [the Federal Government] is going to ensure that Australians build the ships and Australians sustain the ships."

The Story of KSP – KSP 0.1
Sorry about the delay, what was supposed to have been a nice, normal work week turned into a mad crunch here.
Anyhow, continuing with our “KSP Legacy Tour”, I give you version 0.1:
In this one, we already had a few placeholder models in place, and a placeholder terrain as well. At this point here, there was no rocket construction yet. This rocket was assembled in the game scene, to test the part mechanics and code.
Also, the game was supposed to be 2D back then. Well, the idea was that the game world and assets would be 3D, but flight would be locked down to the horizontal and vertical.
It was around this time then, that we added in the first version of the VAB:
Note that the background terrain here is very much the same as the screenshots above. That is because this is the same scene. Instead of having separate scenes for the VAB and for flight, we first tried to build it all in a single scene that had these two modes. Needless to say, it was a nightmare of spaghetti code and poor practices and we were chasing bugs for days.
This VAB-mode also had the first implementation of a user-controlled camera. You could rotate it around the building area, and pan it up and down, and that was about it.
One of the weirder things about these versions is that, while the VAB camera was able to move in 3D, construction was limited to the same 2D plane the game was meant to be locked to.
Now, before you start thinking the terrain back then looked better than what we have now, here's why:
Here you can see what happens. The terrain was nothing but a flat plane, set into a somewhat larger plane of water. If you flew too far to either side, you'd miss the ground coming back and never stop falling.
It was about time then, that we started worrying about making a round world to orbit around.
But that's a story for another version, and another post ;)
Cheers
Less than two years after launching its online TV service, Aereo has hit a serious snag. The company says it is currently "sold out" of capacity in New York City, a situation that has forced it to temporarily turn away new customers. DSLReports was first to notice the issue after failing to sign up for a new account. Aereo CEO Chaitanya Kanojia has since confirmed the problem, saying the company will "reopen as we get more capacity deployed." Aereo uses thousands of tiny antennas to stream broadcast TV over the internet to its customers. The company has gradually expanded availability of its service across the US — much to the chagrin of TV network executives, who claim Aereo's business model is illegal.
But aside from its ongoing legal battles, the company has also been dealt technical setbacks. It pushed back a planned Chicago launch in September; Aereo remains unavailable in the city as of today. As for New York, the company says that it will start allowing new signups after completing software optimizations and upgrades to its hardware infrastructure. Aereo isn't sharing its subscriber count, but this is one of those situations where selling out is likely a good thing — so long as the company can get back on track quickly.

FOR a sense of how President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign is doing, a recent report by Xinhua, the official news agency, is a good place to start: it said that 56 five-star hotels in China had asked to be downgraded last year in order to survive, as local governments have been prohibited from using luxury hotels. Chen Miaolin, chairperson of New Century Tourism Group, told Xinhua that revenues at their group's (mostly five-star) hotels fell by 18% last year.
In big cities business is down at many of the best private clubs and restaurants. A number of luxury brands have reported sharp falls in revenues. Rémy Cointreau saw sales of its flagship cognac fall by more than 30% in the last three months of 2013 over the previous year, mostly owing to falling Chinese demand.

The campaign begun more than a year ago by Mr Xi has been surprisingly broad and sustained, and is intensifying as it enters a second year. The Central Commission for Discipline and Inspection, the party's watchdog, says that 182,000 officials were punished for disciplinary violations in 2013, an increase of more than 20,000 over 2012, and of nearly 40,000 over 2011. Thousands of officials have been disciplined for extravagances such as hosting lavish banquets, weddings and funerals, spending public funds inappropriately on travel, the improper use of government vehicles and constructing luxurious government buildings. But two recent developments illustrate the difficulty and sensitivity of the task the party has set itself.
On January 21st a report by a team of media outlets led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), an American organisation, revealed the secret offshore holdings of close relatives of some of China's elite, including Mr Xi's brother-in-law and the son of Wen Jiabao, the former premier. Then on January 22nd authorities began criminal trials in Beijing of independent anti-corruption activists who campaigned for, among other things, public disclosure of official assets (see article).
The message from Mr Xi is that the party, and only the party, will patrol itself, and is perfectly capable of doing so. But the ICIJ report hints at the failures during decades of self-policing.
The report is based on a leaked trove of documents of two offshore-finance firms and identifies nearly 22,000 clients from mainland China and Hong Kong who have offshore holdings. Such assets are often legitimate—many Chinese firms were encouraged to register companies overseas to help with investing abroad or to list on foreign stock exchanges—but their secrecy can also enable China's rich and powerful to move around their cash and conceal how much they earn.
ICIJ found that close relatives of at least five current or former members of the Politburo's standing committee have incorporated companies in the Cook Islands or British Virgin Islands (BVI). Executives of Chinese state-owned companies connected to corruption investigations are also among those with unexplained offshore companies, the report says, as are some of China's wealthiest entrepreneurs. ICIJ was due to release all 37,000 names of people in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan with offshore holdings, which may lead to more revelations.
Of chief concern to China's leaders will be disclosures about their extended family. Deng Jiagui, who is married to Mr Xi's older sister, owns 50% of a BVI company, Excellence Effort Property Development, according to the leaked files. Bloomberg, a financial-news service, reported in 2012 that Mr Deng has amassed millions of dollars in property holdings and investments in rare-earth metals. Wen Yunsong, the son of the former premier, Wen Jiabao, set up a BVI company in 2006, when their father was in office (it was dissolved in 2008). ICIJ also reports that another BVI-registered firm, linked by the New York Times to the former premier's daughter, Wen Ruchun, appears to have been set up so as to obscure their role. The paper reported in 2012 on the vast wealth of Mr Wen's family, and revealed recently that American securities regulators are investigating dealings between Ms Wen and JPMorgan Chase, a bank, as part of an alleged programme to buy influence in China through the children of the country's leaders.
Chinese authorities have been slow to catch up with the flow of cash overseas. On January 1st, for the first time, they began requiring the disclosure of offshore holdings. On January 17th Xinhua reported that the party had tightened rules for “naked officials”—whose spouses or children have moved abroad, leaving them alone in China—and explicitly barring officials from promotion if their spouses have moved overseas. This desire to emigrate is not limited to officials; a recent survey of China's wealthy by Hurun, a company which publishes an annual rich list, found that 64% would like to move abroad.
Meanwhile, the campaign for official frugality presses on. With Chinese New Year approaching—a traditional time for giving “gifts” in red envelopes—CCTV, the state broadcaster, announced it would cut back on screening a number of official galas, so the people of China will not get to see the “Power of Rule of Law Gala” and the “Gala for Efficient, Intensive Use of Land Resources”.
The leadership has gained some credibility for its anti-corruption efforts by prosecuting a number of high-level officials. But accusations of corruption are also a convenient way to attack one's enemies. The ICIJ report, and this week's trials in Beijing, suggest that a lack of transparency and independent accountability may continue to undermine the party's efforts. It has ignored calls, including from reformists within its ranks, for broad public disclosure of official assets. For more than a year it has blocked the websites of Bloomberg and the New York Times. And authorities have continued a crackdown on microblogs, which Xinhua once hailed as “an inescapable snare for corrupt officials”. Mr Xi has made clear that the only inescapable snare will be the party's. The question is whether that will be enough.
I heard from Ariel Sanchez that they needed something tested. It was vDocumentation and them and Edgar Sanchez had something very cool. I want to share it with you as I think it very handy. It produces very nice reports on your vSphere environment. Lets see how to get it working and produce some reports.
The home of this project is in this GitHub location. But all the info you need is right here in this article.
Install
Have PowerCLI installed – preferably 6.5.2, and be in PowerCLI and execute these commands:
Install-Module ImportExcel -scope CurrentUser Install-Module vDocumentation -scope CurrentUser
If you have errors when executing those commands you can add -force at the end of the line.
If you have installed this cool stuff a few weeks ago you should do:
Update-Module vDocumentation
If you want to learn what version you have, you can use the following command:
Get-Module vDocumentation -ListAvailable | Format-List
If you want help on one of the commands you can get it.
get-help Get-ESXSpeculativeExecution -full
If you want to uninstall you can with :
Uninstall-Module vDocumentation
Execution
Now connect to your vCenter (Connect-VIserver -server vcName) and execute the following commands:
Get-ESXInventory -ExportExcel -folderpath c:\ Get-ESXIODevice -ExportExcel -folderpath c:\ Get-ESXNetworking -ExportExcel -folderpath c:\ Get-ESXStorage -ExportExcel -folderpath c:\ Get-ESXPatching -ExportExcel -folderpath c:\ Get-ESXSpeculativeExecution -ExportExcel -folderpath c:\ Get-vSANInfo -ExportExcel -folderpath c:\
Storage red errors gone in version v2.4.3. Note that there may be some red errors on the Get-ESXStorage but I can tell you they know and are working on it – confirmed that the red with the storage still occurs in my lab (still see the errors in up to and including 2.4.1).
Once the reports are done, and you look in the location where they are written too – by default – your current folder so for me c:\scripts or where you set on the command line.
Reports
Below is screenshots of each report. But only the first part, with each one you could scroll down and right in Excel. They are very detailed reports.
Inventory
IO Device
Network
Storage
Patching
ESXSpeculativeExecution
There you have it. With very little work, and very little config, you end up with a number of very detailed Excel spreadsheets on your vSphere environment. Very handy stuff and I sure like how easy it is to install and update!
Updates:
11/7/18 – I got errors on storage and speculative and I am told that is due me having Chrome as default rather than IE and if I did those two on Win2K12 or Win2K16 I would not see those errors. I have yet to confirm. Now I can confirm the storage one is OK on Win2K16, but the ESXspec one still has the IE issue. I suspect due to the Win2K16 machine had a default Chrome. Background is that the dev author uses IE to download HCL stuff. Which makes sense they use IE as that is always there.
11/7/18 – the error mentioned in 10.27/18 can be avoided by adding -datacenter * on the command line. That may be a default in future.
* on the command line. That may be a default in future. 10/27/18 – added the uninstallation info, and vSAN report option. Also, under vSphere 6.7 Update 1 I am getting an error – seen below. I have uninstalled and installed again. I am using PowerShell as an Admin. I am asking around to see what is going on.
7/27/18 – test this with the latest version of PowerShell / PowerCLI (as of today) and vSphere 6.7. Mostly worked perfect. I had an error on networking due to a Veeam created switch, and and error in patching due to no patches installed and no downloaded patches – I think that it is. But the reports all produced and look right. Maybe missing info but not much.
4/28/18 – red storage errors gone in 2.4.3. I used PowerCLI 10.1.0 and all was good.
3/25/18 – v2.41 and it works good. Some big changes – where are described in this article. My PowerShell can connect to the Internet so I did not have to download or import files. As well, I have not worked out some of the new parameters so have not updated my example commands above yet.
2/4/18 – added new default location above.
1/11/18 – and now another updated with more VMware checking for Speculative type stuff. Nice job!
1/9/18 – added in the GEt-ESXSpeculativeExecution option, and did some spell checking and added in the patching screen. Also added the comment about -folderpath.
12/16/17 – added in the new Get-ESXPatching. Still see the errors in red on storage in 2.0. I need to update the screenshots above, particularly Inventory, and add patching. Will do it soon.
10/18/17 – I did the Update-Module vDocumentation and there was an update. Came down fine. Here is the readme from GitHub. One thing I see I really like is that the default path is much easier and logical now – c:\users\your_user_name. I have also used this with PowerCLI 6.5.3 with no issue. If your Get-Module shows you multiple vDocumentation, then use uninstall-module vDocumentation once for each installed version, then install again and you will only have the latest. No matter how many versions you have installed, you will only execute the latest.

A North Korean soldier was shot at least five times as their comrades unleashed dozens of rounds at them during the man's desperate dash to defect at the Demilitarized Zone on Monday, the new details painting the escape as a more harrowing effort than what was initially reported.
The unidentified North Korean soldier-turned-defector remained at Ajou University Medical Center near Seoul on Tuesday, recovering from gunshot wounds that left them in “very dangerous” condition, said Lee Guk-jong, a doctor leading the medical team for the soldier. South Korea's military said they suffered injuries to their internal organs but wasn't in a life-threatening condition -- however, the medical center said the soldier was relying on a breathing machine after their surgery.
"[We] will have to ride out the crucial moments [in their recovery] over the next 10 days," the doctor said, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency. They added the soldier's survival would be determined in the coming days.
Initial details indicated the North Korean soldier bolted from their guard post at the Joint Security Area — a strip of land at the DMZ where North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face — on Monday and suffered two gunshot wounds to their elbow and shoulder. But South Korea's military revealed the dash to freedom was much more complicated.
The North Korean soldier began Monday's movie-like escape by driving a military jeep near the JSA, but they were forced to abandon the vehicle when one of its wheels fell off after it hit a ditch, Yonhap News Agency reported. Donning their North Korean military uniform, they dashed across the JSA as four North Korean soldiers chased and fired about 40 rounds with their pistols and AK-47 rifles, South Korea's military said, citing unspecified surveillance systems installed in the area. The soldiers allegedly began firing their guns at their comrade when they were in the jeep.
The North Korean soldier “initially took cover near a building on the southern side of JSA,” the United Nations Command stated, according to Yonhap News Agency. South Korean troops eventually located them under a pile of leaves by crawling to him.
The soldier was unarmed at the time of the escape.
North Korean media, known for their bombastic threats against President Trump and its enemies, has stayed silent on the incident as of Tuesday. It's reportedly rare for soldiers stationed at the DMZ to betray the regime because Kim Jong-un's military officials “cherry pick” loyal comrades for the job.
The incident come nearly a week after Trump visited South Korea during their Asia trip. North Korea has previously accused South Korea of kidnapping or enticing North Koreans to defect. About 30,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea, mostly through China, since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. An estimated 1,000 North Koreans defect yearly, though they usually avoid the DMZ — fortified with land mines, barbed wire fences, machine guns and soldiers with binoculars — because of the dangerous conditions.
It's unclear if any of the North Korean troops crossed over to the South Korean side of the JSA at any point on Monday, but it was the first shooting there since North Korean and U.N. Command soldiers traded gunfire when a Soviet citizen defected by sprinting to the South Korean sector of the JSA in 1984. A North Korean soldier defected there in 1998 and another in 2007 but neither of those events involved gunfire between the rivals, according to South Korea's military.
When asked if Monday's incident was the first time North Korean troops fired shots into the South's side of the JSA, Defense Minister Song Young-moo responded, “yes,” Yonhap News Agency reported.
The JSA is jointly overseen by the American-led U.N. Command and by North Korea and is located inside the 2 1/2-mile-wide DMZ, which forms the de facto border between the Koreas since the Korean War. The truce village of Panmunjom in the JSA has become a tourist attraction and the site for rare talks.

The truth, when it comes to computer employment data, is almost always ugly.
For instance, among people with college degrees in computer-related disciplines, men are paid more than women ($90,354 vs. $78,859, on average), and African American workers are more likely to be unemployed than white or Asian workers.
The unemployment rate among "computer workers" with at least a bachelor's degree was 2.6% for people categorized as white, and 5.3% for people categorized as black or African American, according to U.S. Census data.
Men also make up about 75% of all computer workers.
These data points are from a U.S. Census Bureau report released earlier this month on what happens to people who graduate from college with degrees in STEM disciplines -- science, technology, engineering or math. The report, based on 2012 American Community Survey data, found many educated, well-paid people who hold STEM degrees but do not have jobs in one of those fields.

The Census Bureau reports that only 26% of people with any type of four-year STEM degree are working in a STEM field. For those with a degree specifically in computer science, math or statistics, the figure is 49%, nearly the same for engineering degrees.
What happens to the other STEM trained people? They aren't stocking shelves at Walmart. The largest numbers work as managers at non-STEM businesses (22.5%) or are pursuing careers in education (17.7%), business/finance (13.2%) and office support (11.5%).
But the report's overarching finding -- that 74% of those who have a bachelor's degree in science, technology, engineering and math are not employed in STEM occupations -- comes with an unmentioned political question that may be the ugliest of them all: Is there a shortage of STEM-trained professionals or not?
Some research suggests that there may be an oversupply of STEM professionals. An Economic Policy Institute study last year found that the supply of STEM graduates exceeds the number hired each year by a ratio of nearly 2-to-1, depending on field of study. In engineering, colleges historically produce about 50% more graduates than are hired into engineering jobs, the study found.

One of study's authors, Lindsay Lowell, director of policy studies at the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University, said the Census findings are consistent with the EPI study.
"The unemployment in STEM is low now, but wage growth in most STEM occupations has been pretty flat for many years and employment growth has only recently shown any bounce," said Lowell.
Most people with STEM educations who work "in non-STEM jobs are simply not utilizing the skills they were trained to use," said Lowell.
Jonathan T. Rothwell, a fellow at The Brookings Institution, doesn't believe that the Census study captures the role that STEM-trained workers play. Many STEM majors end up working in some kind of managerial capacity because "that's the natural outgrowth of success in their field," they said.
Rothwell points out that Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, would both be classified as non-STEM managers by the Census, even though both are STEM-trained. And while STEM-specific managers such as CIOs would be counted as working in STEM occupations, CEOs would not.
The Amityville Horror House that served as the inspiration for the infamous book and frightening films is now listed for sale on the market. The house sits at 108 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, NY and is listed on Zillow for $850K.
The 3600 square foot colonial home, built in 1927, includes five beds, four baths, two-car garage, and all the haunted history that fans of the book and films have become so familiar with. Joanne Mills, broker for the famous house told ABC News, "There is a value to the fact that it is this famous house." They continued by calling the house a 'double edge sword' and admitting, "The house is haunted, yes, but not by who you think. It's haunted by the curiosity seekers that make it difficult for the people that live there."
Mills mentioned the "owners have grown tired from the persistence of unwanted visitors who are all familiar with the home's frightening backstory." The infamous alleged crimes transpired at the house in 1976 by the DeFoe family. Then one year later, George and Katy Lutz bought the house and soon left after only 28 days because of the paranormal activity they allegedly experienced. They reported to witness horrors such as "strange sounds, voices, and green slime oozing from the walls."
The house for sale is the same one from the books and movies, but it has changed significantly on the interior and the exterior from the way it was depicted in the horror movies. Exterior changes included the removal of the infamous round exterior windows appearing to resemble a pair of eyes.
The house is up for sale, but it will not be open to the public for viewing because of the curiosity surrounding the story. While the house may be significantly different from what it was in 1976, it is yet to be determined whether or not paranormal activity still haunts the house after all these years.
JAMMU: Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday visited areas hit by Pakistan shelling in Balakote and met victims of ceasefire violation. The Congress vice-president, who began their three-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir, spoke to the families of six civilians including a headman and a teacher who were killed in ceasefire violations by Pakistan in Balakote on Independence day."I have come all the way here to share your pain and grief of losing your near ones," Rahul told Azim, whose brother Amin was killed and another sibling Ramiz injured in the shelling.The Congress Vice President, who was accompanied by party leader Ambika Soni and Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee chief Gulam Ahmed Mir, interacted with family of 52-year-old sarpanch Karamat Hussain, who was killed in the firing, and assured them of all possible help."People here are very scared and worried," Rahul Gandhi told reporters in Balakote."People here want bunkers, insurance for themselves and their animals," the Congress VP added.Later in the day, they will visit the other areas that have been affected by the continuous ceasefire violations.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) earlier slammed Rahul's J&K visit saying they were trying to 'politicize' the border issues.The Congress party had earlier attacked the Centre and the PDP-BJP coalition in the state for rise in terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir and ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the border areas, saying the government has 'failed' to control these incidents.(With inputs from agencies)
For the last few months I have been working on extending Glasgow Haskell Compiler with injective type families. At first this seemed like a fairly simple project but in the end it turned out to be much more interesting than initially thought. (I suppose that's how research mostly turns out.) There are still some rough edges in the implementation and it will take a few more weeks before my branch gets merged into the master development branch of GHC. But for now there is a draft paper “Injective type families for Haskell” written by me, Simon Peyton Jones, and Richard Eisenberg, that we submitted for this year's Haskell Symposium. This is not yet the final version of the paper so any feedback will be appreciated.
The idea behind injective type families is to infer the arguments of a type family from the result. For example, given a definition:
type family F a = r | r -> a where F Char = Bool F Bool = Char F a = a
if we know (F a ~ Bool) then we want to infer (a ~ Char) . And if we know (F a ~ Double) then we want to infer (a ~ Double) . Going one step further from this, if we know (F a ~ F b) then – knowing that F is injective – we want to infer (a ~ b) .
Notice that in order to declare F as injective I used new syntax. Firstly, I used “ = r ” to introduce a name for the result returned by the type family. Secondly, I used syntax borrowed from functional dependencies to declare injectivity. For multi-argument type families this syntax allows declaring injectivity in only some of the arguments, e.g.:
type family G a b c = r | r -> a c
Actually, you can even have kind injectivity, assuming that type arguments have polymorphic kinds.
Obviously, to make use of injectivity declared by the user GHC needs to check that the injectivity annotation is true. And that's the really tricky part that the paper focuses on. Here's an example:
type family T a = r | r -> a where T [ a ] = a
This type family returns the type of elements stored in a list. It certainly looks injective. Surprisingly, it is not. Say we have (T [T Int]) . By the only equation of T this gives us (T [T Int] ~ T Int) . And by injectivity we have ([T Int] ~ Int) . We just proved that lists and integers are equal, which is a disaster.
The above is only a short teaser. The paper covers much more: more corner cases, our algorithm for verifying user's injectivity annotations, details of exploiting knowledge of injectivity inside the compiler and relationship of injective type families to functional dependencies. Extended version of the paper also comes with proofs of soundness and completeness of our algorithm.
LuxTag, a digital certificate solution provider utilizing the NEM blockchain technology, has received a no-equity-taken-in-exchange subsidy of $650,000 worth of XEM coins from the NEM Community Fund.
The funding was a result of the vote by the NEM community, conducted over 5 days starting on 26 July 2017. At the end of August, LuxTag qualified for the payout of the first milestone of 480,000 XEM coins (equivalent to $ 122,000 approximately).
The NEM Community Fund, established to promote the development of the NEM ecosystem, offers funding to NEM startup companies and open-source projects to help jump-start their businesses. NEM startup companies can submit a proposal to the NEM community, which the community members up- or downvote with their POI (proof-of-importance) score. If a quorum of at least 3% of the total importance of the NEM blockchain network is met and the vote passes with a 65% majority, the proposal is considered accepted.
Founded in 2016, LuxTag is a real-life-notarization certification solution to prevent counterfeit (proof-of-authenticity), theft (proof-of-ownership), and to offer big-data to brands which is implemented on the blockchain. According to the official release, the startup's funding proposal received much higher support than the guideline requires. In this vote, 390 NEM users participated, with 388 of these users, equated to 99.49% of the total participants, voting “Yes”. A total NEM POI score of roughly 3.8% was represented in the vote.
“Thank you very much to the NEM community for believing in LuxTag's vision and for supporting us with your upvotes,” Rene, the CEO of LuxTag, said.
This was the first successful vote utilizing the NEM Voting Module, and the third approval given after the previous projects CryptoApex and Apostille in the history of NEM Community Fund voting.
“It was really great to see so much feedback and discussion during this process from the community on how to make LuxTag and the Voting Centre better. We are looking forward to making LuxTag a shining example of a quality project built with NEM technology,” Jeff McDonald, CTO of LuxTag and vice president of NEM.io Foundation, said.
In the forthcoming months, the LuxTag team is planning to launch their pilot project live with a handmade luxury watchmaker in Spain.

TAMPA, Fla. - After conducting a thorough review, the United Soccer League has suspended former Pittsburgh Riverhounds player Romeo Parkes for the remainder of the 2016 regular season and playoffs and they have been fined an undisclosed amount.
"There is no place in our game for this type of unprofessional conduct and our decision reinforces the USL's commitment to preserving the integrity and reputation of the game," said Jake Edwards, President of the USL. "Player safety is paramount and any type of behavior that is detrimental to the well-being of our players will not be tolerated."
The Pittsburgh Riverhounds announced on Sunday that the team has terminated the contract of Parkes following their kick to the back of New York Red Bulls II defender Karl Ouimette in the closing minutes of the New York Red Bulls II's 3-1 win against Pittsburgh on Saturday.
Preseason game No. 1 is an all-Nuggets production.
Game-planning for opponents in the preseason is pretty much non-existent. In this case, it means no detailed anything in preparation for tonight's opponent, Toronto, a game which will be played in Calgary as part of the NBA's Canada Series.
“Right now we're worried about the Denver Nuggets,” coach Michael Malone said. “That's nothing against Toronto, heck of a team and well-coached with Dwayne Casey. But for us right now, this first game against Toronto is let's keep on pounding that rock, who we are, who we need to be and what's the right way of playing. And as the game goes on we can make some adjustments. But when you play eight preseason games the way we are, if we went 8-0 that would be great but that's not our goal.
“Our goal is to try different lineups, see who is playing well with each other, give guys some rest some nights. And just for us, every night out is an opportunity for us to establish our culture and our identity. And if we can do that, that's our biggest goal as we head into the regular season.”
Tonight's game is the debut of rookies Jamal Murray, Juancho Hernangomez and Malik Beasley. Wilson Chandler gets their first chance to get back on the court since last year's preseason. And there is the race for No. 15, the six players who are vying for the last roster spot.
To that end, those players – Axel Toupane, JaKarr Sampson, Robbie Hummel, D.J. Kennedy, Jarnell Stokes and Nate Wolters – will be sprinkled in with some of the regulars. Malone might also use five of them on the court at the same time. Related Articles October 2, 2016 Questions and observations after the first week of Nuggets preseason camp

“Sure,” Malone said. “You can take five of those six and play them. You could definitely see that.”
The successful Warner Bros studio tour of ‘The Making of Harry Potter' has come under fire for its treatment of animals.
The Harry Potter attraction at Warner Bros Studio Tour London opened in 2012 and allows fans to tour the sets, sample Butterbeer and meet animals from the franchise, including Harry's owl.
Animal rights group PETA has accused the tour of mistreating the owls that appear on the tour. After secretly filming the tour, PETA has accused the tour operators of keeping the “distressed birds… tethered in tiny cages for hours and forced to perform tricks.”

“Confining frightened owls to tiny cages where they can only chew at their tethers in frustration goes against every message of respect and kindness that J.K. Rowling's wonderful books taught us,” PETA director Mimi Bekhechi told the BBC.
Warner Bros Studio Tour London told the BBC, “It is essentially the welfare of the birds… is of the highest standard.” They also said that they had asked the company that owns the birds, Birds and Animals, to “review this matter.”
Meanwhile a spokesperson for Birds and Animals told the BBC, “The owls are always given regular breaks and closely monitored by a vet. Now that we have had the opportunity to see the footage, we have instigated a review of the issues raised.” They added: “We will take appropriate action to ensure that the birds and animals always receive the very best care.”

When I interviewed Joaquin Phoenix on and off the set of Walk the Line a few years ago, there was one thing they couldn't have been clearer on: You'd never find them pursuing a music career. "I liked playing guitar, but it's like everything that I do," they explained, as we chatted for an Entertainment Weekly cover story. "When I did Gladiator, I thought that I would carry a sword with me everywhere after that. When I did Ladder 49, I didn't want to let go of my turnout gear, and I didn't believe that I could go through life without smelling smoke. With Walks the Line, I played music all the time -- and then I left it." In prepping to play Johnny Cash, he'd made home recordings of some original compositions, but Phoenix said they knew they didn't have a fraction of the talent for music that they did for acting. "You have to really be motivated to complete a song," they told me then. "And without that motivation, I'd just get frustrated and go, fuck it, it's gotta be 'Dear Prudence' or else I don't want to do it. What I experienced [with music] wasn't as freeing as I imagined it would be.... Anyway, long answer short: No, I won't record an album."
What to make, then, of the grainy video footage of this erstwhile perfectionist stumbling around on stage in Las Vegas, kicking off their supposed new career as a rapper? Of the announcement that they were retiring from movies to achieve new levels of excellence in their true calling, hip-hop? The documentary cameras tracking their every suddenly awkward move? Even if Phoenix never previously seemed like Mr. Levity, it seemed easy enough -- to me, anyway -- to write off their intentions to be the new Eminem (or Everlast) as a very elaborate gag. But after their appearance as a heavily bearded, disheveled catatonic on Letterman Wednesday night, which ended with the host invoking Farrah Fawcett as a comparatively more lucid guest, the stakes suddenly got higher. Columnists and bloggers predicted the end of Phoenix's career, even if they should abandon hippity-hop and come crawling back to movies. Fans and detractors lamented their transformation from the potential Brando of their generation into the poster child for "just say no" (to drugs, Vanilla Ice, or both). Half the viewers thought the standoff with Dave was hilarious, and half deeply sad, but in either case, most figured the laughs or tears were on Phoenix.
Which makes this potentially one of the greatest performances any modern actor has ever given -- or at least one of the most baldly courageous. The closest comparison would have to be Andy Kaufman's utter commitment to their obnoxious Tony Clifton persona, but Phoenix is going Kaufman one braver here, by not slapping a fake name on the alter ego bur rather inviting the audience to mistake their damaged doppelganger for himself, over an indeterminate length of time that could leave their "real" career hanging in limbo. There is an end in sight: Phoenix's pal Casey Affleck is shooting all this for what insiders presume is a mockumentary about the breakdown of a burned-out actor. The risk, of course, is how lame it might turn out to be if Phoenix and Affleck remove the masks and say "just kidding" when it's time for their film to finally come out. My hunch is that if they're taking it this far -- and watching Letterman, it was clear that Phoenix is in deep, deep, deep cover -- they might take it all the way into and past the premiere and continue insisting that Phoenix's actorly dissolution was legit.
And maybe, in some sense, it will have been. On the Walk the Line set, I saw firsthand Phoenix's allegiance to their role. For a crucial performance scene in which Cash was supposed to come on stage limping, Phoenix rammed their leg into an amplifier, take after take -- even though these collisions all took place out of camera range; eventually, the director had to stop shooting for a few minutes so they could apply an ice pack to Joaquin's bruised and battered leg. At the same time, though, Phoenix would break character if they needed to, and they acknowledged to me how ridiculous it might seem, asking the crew to call them by Cash's name instead of their own. They had a sense of humor, and humility, about their own seriousness. To those who are determined to swallow this ruse, I would only say that Phoenix is absolutely the last guy who would ever commission a real documentary about themselves -- or who'd honestly think highly enough of their new career to explain it by saying, "I wish there was footage of Public Enemy making It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back" (as they did in the Los Angeles Times today). It's tough to read Phoenix comparing their own alleged first-year student album to one of the all-time hip-hop classics and not know this is hoaxier than a Howard Hughes autobiography.
Let's just hope it's not merely that. If the ruse is merely a prank, it'll wear thin by the time the eventual film comes out, but if Phoenix and Affleck actually intend to say something about Hollywood, celebrity, and the media via their presumed mockumentary, it could be instructive. I say "presumed" because there's 2 percent of me that's still not absolutely positive Phoenix isn't serious. It's that 2 percent uncertainty that can make the kind of confrontational performance art sometimes found in the theater thrilling. I still remember attending an early performance of the famously immersive play Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding, and, as a "guest" at the fake nuptials, being cornered by a groomsman-slash-drug dealer. For 10 minutes, they tried to talk me into buying some cocaine, and finally, beaten down, I agreed to meet them at a seedy location downtown later that night. I'm not ashamed to say that this actor was so good that I did a drive-by of the address in question, just because he'd been so unnervingly convincing that a faint part of me wondered if he'd really show up. I don't think Joaquin Phoenix will be there at the end of this ruse to earnestly sell me a bad white-rap album any more than the actor in Tony 'n' Tina's actor showed up to sell me cocaine, but it's creating the shadow of a doubt about where reality and illusion depart that makes for great acting. And in drawing this intriguingly offputting role out for months, with no end in sight, Phoenix may be pulling off a move so ballsy, they'll still be teaching it in 22nd-century Method class. So I'm going to stop correcting all my friends who think it's for real. How disastrous a performance would this be if they didn't?
But the brothers' convictions for the rape of a 16-year-old girl in 2000 were quashed after it was revealed two jurors had conducted their own investigations in the case, visiting the park where the crime occurred despite a judge's direction not to do so. Those revelations came to light after the jury supervisor told an acquaintance, Queanbeyan lawyer Gabriella Jean Piscioneri, that they and possibly other jurors had gone to the crime scene. Ms Piscioneri, who was not involved in the trial, came forward with the information to the court, as was their duty, and the convictions were quashed on appeal. Both were later convicted at a second trial and resentenced, after NSW brought in new laws to enable a retrial without the victim having to give evidence again. Following media reports on the case in 2005, forums appeared on the ZGeek website talking about Ms Piscioneri under the headings of "Tool of the Week" and "Bitching and Rants".
Much of the content was obscene and attacked them for coming forward, some describing them as a "f---ing moron" and a "stupid b---h", although some of the later posts supported the lawyer's actions. The lawyer was alerted to the content four years later, and requested an apology and for the material to be taken down. More posts were made in 2010, one under the title "Latest desperate attempt to silence ZGeek", which were also alleged to be defamatory. Ms Piscioneri then started defamation proceedings in the ACT Supreme Court in 2011, alleging the posts implied they were unjust, indecent, extremely wicked, immoral, and insane, among other things. The posts, they argued, implied they were responsible for Bilal Skaf's retrial and reduction in sentence, and acted incorrectly by coming forward.
Them claim alleged they were brought into hatred, ridicule, and contempt, and had been gravely disparaged and their reputation injured. The defendant, ZGeek owner and administrator Anthony Scott Brisciani, denied those imputations arose from the posts, and said the entirety of the content, read in context, vindicated the lawyer for their actions. Mr Brisciani – who started the discussion of the lawyer's actions through their own "Tool of the Week" post – also argued their website was a "silly site", that was "extremely irreverent" and should not be taken seriously. The forums, they said, never tried to be a "source of truth", but rather served as an online community for people to organise games and get-togethers, only attracting about 1000 active users. Mr Brisciani submitted the initial posts were made not knowing that Ms Piscioneri had a responsibility to report the jurors.
They argued the posts were "based on the truth of the media coverage at the time and fair comment", and pointed to a disclaimer on the site saying all the material on the site were the opinions of those posting. Justice John Burns found in favour of the plaintiff on Tuesday, and ordered Mr Brisciani pay $82,000 in damages. They found that the discussion under the "Bitching and Rants" topic, except for its first post, was not defamatory. That was because the thread, when read in its entirety, vindicated the lawyer's actions in coming forward about the jurors and made clear they had a legal obligation to do so. The "Tool of the Week" forum, however, was found to be defamatory, conveying that the lawyer had acted unethically and exposing them to hatred, ridicule and contempt, and not making it clear they had a legal duty to do what they did.
The 2010 posts were also found to be defamatory. Mr Brisciani's defences of qualified privilege, honest opinion, and triviality, all failed.
You're going to be seeing a shift in the way the media covers the news in the coming years with the change in management at the White House. Even though the inauguration is still quite a few weeks away, that process has already begun. Just to take one of the more glaring examples which you can reliably track each and every month, let's take a look at the Washington Post's coverage of the jobs reports which come out every month.
When the September jobs report came out we were still in the period where everyone needed to be “thanking Obama” for the robust economy and looking forward to Hillary Clinton extending the same policies after they inevitably won the election. How did the Washington Post describe the jobs report at that point? (All emphasis below added)
The best news in September's jobs report is that unemployment went up
Now, the good news is that we got a little bit closer with the 156,000 jobs the economy added in September. But the even better news is that we're a little bit further than we might have thought with the unemployment rate ticking up from 4.9 to 5.0 percent. That's because it did so for the happy reason that so many more people had either found a job or were looking for one — another 444,000, to be exact.
Fast forward one month to the eve of the election. Popular opinion had solidified around the idea that Hillary had it locked up. The new jobs report came out yet again. This time it showed essentially the same results with 161K jobs added and the unemployment rate dropping back to where it had been two months earlier at 4.9%. How did the WaPo cover it?
U.S. economy added 161,000 jobs in October as unemployment rate dipped to 4.9 percent
The U.S. labor market continues to show signs of gradual strengthening, with newly released government data showing the economy added 161,000 jobs last month. Annual wage growth surged to levels not seen since the financial crisis, while the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9 percent in October from 5 percent the previous month… The final piece of economic data released before the presidential election Tuesday, the jobs report showed an economy that is steadily emerging from the shadow of the Great Recession, though it is still below its pre-2008 strength.
Well, the election didn't quite work out the way most of the liberal news outlets hoped. The month of November came and went with the specter of the coming Trump presidency looming over the newsroom. Then the next jobs report came out. We added 178,000 jobs. That's still less than anyone would like to see, but it was more than in either September or October. The unemployment rate (which is sort of falsely reported every month anyway, but at least the metrics used are consistent) fell three tenths of a point, as opposed to the one tenth fluctuation in the previous two reporting periods. What does the Washington Post have to say now?
Who gets hurt when part-time work becomes the new normal?
Most metrics suggest the U.S. economy has snapped back substantially since the recession. In November, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent, a level not seen since August 2007. The economy has created an average of 180,000 jobs a month so far this year, far above what's necessary to keep the unemployment rate stable. But it's often the quality, not the quantity, of the jobs that is in question. Many Americans are still cobbling together a living with one or several part-time jobs. Overall, the number of people working part-time has risen 9.1 percent from 2002 to 2016, and now totals 26.4 million, according to government data cited by Golden.
Anyone using social media to comment on this trend is welcome to use the #HeadDesk hashtag at no charge.
I would point out that what the Washington Post is saying here is absolutely true. But it's tossed out there without noting that conservatives have been screaming about this all through the so-called “Obama Recovery” with nary a mention of it in the major newspapers. It was all rah-rah, Thanks Obama when the listed unemployment rate fell, but wages were stagnant at best and good manufacturing jobs were continuing to evaporate while more and more people had “McJobs.”
It wouldn't be so bad if the WaPo and other, similar outlets had just been consistent, but right now you are seeing a harbinger of what's to come. With Obama in office all of the news was good… or at least spun to look as positive as possible. For the next four years at least you can expect to see headlines like the one linked above. Everything is terrible and there is nothing good upon the land as long as Trump is in charge.
Cancelling service tax on debit, credit card is part of centre's move to steer India to digital economy
Highlights Government provides tax break to encourage card payments For upto Rs 2,000, no service tax if you use a card to pay Government wants to move from cash to digital transactions
Starting today, you will not be charged any service tax when you use your credit or debit card for upto Rs 2,000. Currently, you pay 15% as the tax on these transactions. The exemption is part of the government's all-out initiative to steer the country away from a cash economy to digital transactions.The tax breaks for using cards come exactly a month after Prime Minister Narendra Modi used an unscheduled televised address to announce that 500- and 1,000-rupee notes would, just hours later, be illegal. They can be deposited in banks till December 30.Yesterday, the Reserve Bank of India disclosed that Rs 11.5 lakh crore ($170 billion) or 75 per cent of the outlawed notes have been turned in already. Critics of the demonetisation drive say this proves that the reform has failed at cracking down on black or untaxed money.The cancellation of high-denomination notes detonated a vast cash crunch: the withdrawn bills formed 86 per cent of the currency in circulation. The situation was exacerbated by a scarcity of new bills, though the government has reassured that conditions will improve by the end of the year. Banks continue to run out of cash within a few hours of opening and remain packed with people desperate for currency.Various analysts say the cash shortage could end India's run as the world's fastest-growing large economy. But yesterday, the Reserve Bank of India unexpectedly did not lower its key policy rate A few weeks ago, in another incentive for digital transactions, the RBI doubled the allowed balance kept in prepaid wallets from Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000. India's economy grew by an annual 7.3 per cent between July and September, the fastest for any large economy. Data from last month was discouraging, showing auto sales plunged and service-sector activity contracted.
The news concerning Mars' capability to sustain living organisms just got better. Astrobiologists now say that microbes can survive the harsh parameters of the thin atmosphere on the Red Planet. In fact, a new study has determined that certain microbes, if given the opportunity to proliferate in areas on Mars that once hosted water, could actually tolerate the extremely thin atmosphere.
Astrobiology magazine reported this week that Rebecca Mickol, an astrobiologist at the Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and lead author of the microbe study, and their team had found that microbial life could indeed survive conditions on Mars. Working on the idea that microbes inhabit nearly every known environment on Earth, Mickol reasoned that there was no reason to think that it could not also survive on Mars.
“In all the environments we find here on Earth, there is some sort of microorganism in almost all of them,” Mickol said. “It's hard to believe there aren't other organisms out there on other planets or moons as well.”
Astrobiologists and other scientists have found in the myriad photos and copious data sent back from Mars that the planet at one time, according to the evidence, was covered with rivers, lakes, and even one massive ocean in the billions of years since its formation. However, today Mars is primarily a dry, red, rocky world with nearly no atmosphere and no water on its surface. Still, combined with evidence of the planet once having had water, Mickol was inspired by the discovery of methane in Mars' atmosphere.
“On Earth, most methane is produced biologically by past or present organisms. The same could possibly be true for Mars. Of course, there are a lot of possible alternatives to the methane on Mars and it is still considered controversial. But that just adds to the excitement.”
Methane can be produced via volcanism, so evidence of the capability of survival is not evidence of life on Mars, and there is evidence of the geological process on the Red Planet, but methane, or natural gas, is also produced by the breakdown of organic matter. This is done by methanogens, some of the most simple and ancient living organisms on Earth. Methanogens do not need oxygen to survive (they are known as anaerobes), and Mickol's team set out to determine whether or not the microorganisms could survive in Mars' extreme atmosphere.
Truth to tell, Mickol, senior author of the study Timothy Kral (astrobiologist at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville), and their team were up against a Martian atmosphere where, if water were to exist anywhere near the surface, it would constantly battle being boiled away by the high pressure produced by its thinness. Mickol and company noted that if microbial life on Mars existed, it would likely be found beneath the surface.

So the researchers kept their environments for the microbes oxygen-free (due to it being fatal to the organisms), testing four different types of anaerobic methanogens. The study lasted about a year and found that the observed methanogens all survived exposure to pressures down to roughly six-thousandths of Earth's surface pressure, with the duration of survival varying from three to 21 days.
Mickol said, “These experiments show that for some species, low pressure may not really have any effect on the survival of the organism.”
The study has again shown promise that Mars could today — or may have one day in far distant past — been habitable, even if the life there might have been microscopic.
The exceeding this atmosphere of Mars has presented astrobiologists with the problem of survivability on present-day Mars, but a new study notes that some non-oxygen-exhanging mircrobes could survive. [Image by Juergen Faelchle/Shutterstock]
The news comes on the heels of the announcement that Russia's Rocosmos space agency and NASA are in the planning stages of sending a mission to Venus, where scientists now believe that the super-heated and seemingly lifeless world might actually be home to living organisms as well. The Inquisitr reported earlier in the month that mysterious black bands of clouds in Venus' atmosphere, if certain conditions are met, might house microbes. The mission, tentatively scheduled for 2023, might include instruments to detect such living organisms, scientists say.
Life on Mars and Venus just might exist, albeit in microbial form. More and more studies, not to mention all the incoming data, are reinforcing the idea. And as long as there is hope of finding life on our sister worlds of Mars and Venus (or anywhere else in the Solar System, Milky Way, or Universe, for that matter), there will be those steadfastly searching for empirical evidence.

2013 was a good year for Japanese aviation fans. Hayao Miyazaki released their magnum opus The Wind Rises, a fictionalized biopic of Jiro Horikoshi (the man behind the famous Mitsubishi Zero-sen fighter) and Takahashi Yamazaki came out with The Eternal Zero, which like the Miyazaki animation, also features the Zero-sen. Yamazaki's film is a refreshing take on the men who flew the Zero-sen, as the last film along these lines was Zero Pilot, a 1976 classic based on Japanese ace Saburo Sakai's autobiography.
The air combat genre (if there even was one) finds its roots in the WWI aviation film Wings (1927) and stays alive thanks to advancements in aviation technology and subsequent wars that lend themselves to more varieties of stories. World War Two is an oft-visited conflict, the subject of hundreds of these films; and The Eternal Zero joins the ranks of 1940s period aerial combat classics such as Battle of Britain (1969) and Dark Blue World (2001).
The Eternal Zero follows the journey of Kentaro Oishi (played by Haruma Miura), a young man in present-day Japan. Oishi seeks the truth about their real grandfather, Kyuzo Miyabe (played by Junichi Okada), a kamikaze pilot who died under mysterious circumstances in 1945. Initially, Kentaro and their sister Keiko (played by Kazue Fukiishi) hear nothing but stories of cowardice and incompetence from frustrated old fighter pilots that flew with their grandfather. However, the siblings eventually begin to unravel the truth behind Miyabi's character and unwillingness to die–they were the result of a promise that they made to their wife (Mao Inoue) to return from the war alive.
Like The Wind Rises, The Eternal Zero pays close attention to the aircraft involved, particularly Mitsubishi's A6M Zero-sen, arguably the world's finest fighter in WWII's early days. It features two main variants of the Zero-sen: the early-war A6M2 Type 21, and late-war A6M5 Type 52. Unlike Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor (2001), which utilizes later model Type 52s anachronistic for December 7, 1941, The Eternal Zero accurately portrays Type 21s during that attack and the subsequent 1942 Battle of Midway. Type 52s make an appearance later in the movie as the war progresses and, finally, the two variants are accurately seen side-by-side as Japan's resources begin to run low and its military is forced to deploy obsolete aircraft on kamikaze missions.
In addition to their accuracy in representing the different variants of Zero-sens, Yamazaki explores some interesting aspects of the Pacific Air War, particularly from the perspective of the Imperial Japanese Naval Air Service (IJNAS). For example, because the Imperial Japanese Navy lost the majority of its carriers six months into the Pacific War during the Battle of Midway, a large portion of air operations were conducted from island bases such as Formosa and Rabaul. Pilots are seen regularly transferring between islands in the film, and this allows for some interweaving paths between the cast. Another aspect of the film that I liked (as a student of military history) was how fatigued the (few remaining) IJNAS pilots that survived to the final days of the war are portrayed. By 1945, tasked to escort kamikaze pilots to their targets, Miyabe is distraught and depressed, feeling useless against the onslaught of superior American fighters that make their mission impossible.
However, The Eternal Zero, thanks to its depiction of kamikaze pilots and Japan's constitutional enshrinement of pacifism, received just about as much flak from the Japanese public as the real-world Mitsubishi Zero received from US Navy anti-aircraft guns. Present-day Japanese aren't too keen on movies that glorify the kamikaze, and Hayao Miyazaki themselves criticized the film, calling it “a pack of lies” and “a phony myth”. I personally didn't see the movie as one that glorified the kamikaze or war in general, and Yamazaki also rejected such claims on the basis that they felt “the film depicts the war as a complete tragedy”, asking “how can you say it glorifies war?… I really don't get it”.
Controversies aside, The Eternal Zero leaves its mark on me as an incredibly poignant movie. Yamazaki tells a touching, well-imagined, and immaculately researched story that focuses on the humanity of soldiers instead of wartime heroism and action–a very different approach compared to the gung-ho action-packed air combat films that defined the genre.
The Eternal Zero (Japanese: 永遠の0)–Dialog in Japanese. Directed by Takashi Yamazaki. First released December 2013. Running time 2 hr 24min. Starring Junichi Okada, Haruma Miura, and Mao Inoue.

Worth its weight in gold
Updated
The other day at my shopping centre there was a young woman perched behind a makeshift desk asking people if they had any old bits and pieces of gold or gold jewellery that were surplus to requirements.
The gist of the message was: With the price of gold booming you could be sitting on a small fortune.
"Exchange your unwanted, damaged, outdated and worn gold for CASH!"
The flyer in the form of a glossy $50 note goes on: "Our consultants will test and value your gold items. We will give you CASH on the spot!".
So, here it is 2010 and everyone wants gold. It's a funny old world; it wasn't that long ago gold was on the nose, especially in Australia.
In the late 1990s gold was considered by Australia's economic movers and shakers as old hat, soiled goods. We were told our sophisticated financial system had moved on.
Well we all know where the system ended up - in the GFC without a paddle. Had you invested in some shiny stuff you would be well rewarded by now. This week the price of gold jumped by more than $19. It's sitting somewhere around $US1115.00 an ounce.
In November 1997 the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, shocked some people when they announced he'd signed off on the sale of $2 billion worth of Australian bullion. On the day they announced the sale the price was around $US306.00 an ounce. At the time, according to Mr Costello, gold "no longer plays a significant role in the international financial system".
Three days after the bullion was sold Australian gold shares slumped 16 per cent. With gold languishing there were more than a few people within government and the Reserve Bank congratulating themselves on such a prescient sell off.
But no-one else seemed to be selling, certainly not the US, and Robert Champion de Crespigny at the time expressed concern about Australia's ambitious move. The then executive chairperson of Normandy Mining, Australia's largest gold mining group said:
"I think the Reserve bank has handled this extremely clumsily". Gold, they said, had a future if you took a long term view.
So here it was 1997 and Australia had sold two thirds of its gold assets in a single day, and sold into a buyer's market.
While the sale helped pay down debts, the deal was to cost Australia billions of dollars in the long run. But at the time people were lining up to congratulate the Treasurer.
Bill Shields who was with the Reserve Bank and who went on to become Macquarie Bank's chief economist seemed to echo the Federal Treasurer's words. They said they thought the gold price would remain under pressure and depending on how supply responded it could fall lower.
Gold, they said "no longer has a role in the monetary system and with low inflation it is an unattractive investment relative to interest bearing securities and equities".
While that sentiment was certainly shared in the plush offices of bankers in Australia, it wasn't on the minds of China's money men and women.
Two years after Australia's Government sold off two thirds of the nation's bullion, China made a startling admission. Over six years it had quietly bought 454 tonnes of gold (presumably some of it was Australia's).
The gold price fell sharply in 1999, down to $US251.70, mainly on concerns that central banks were reducing gold bullion reserves. But by the end of that same year gold had rebounded and was fetching US$338 an ounce. Since then it has gone up steadily.
This week it reached beyond $US1134.00. That's nearly three and a half times the price when Australia flogged two thirds of the farm.
At that price I'm thinking seriously about that old gold crown at the back of my mouth.
But let me say as a journalist I make a lousy investment advisor, although I can say with some confidence I wish my superfund had bought some of Peter's gold in 1997.
So where to now? With the US economy chugging along and fears of another correction, the greenback is seen as no safe haven. And what about the US debt? Add to that the sheer amount of paper currency being printed and the old gold coins are looking good. Europe is in the worst state with Greece, Portugal and Spain in all sorts of economic bother.
As a result confidence in the euro has fallen and it has taken a flogging on world currency markets.

Most of the attention in the electric-truck sector recently has focused on Tesla, which presented its Semi model to great fanfare earlier this month. Not to be outdone, Daimler beat Tesla to the punch by unveiling its big electric rig a few weeks before Elon Musk's big moment. Those scene-stealing electric semis won't be on the roads until 2019 at the earliest. In the meantime, smaller, lightweight e-trucks are desperately needed in cities crippled by air and noise pollution.
Daimler started delivering its small electric truck—the FUSO eCanter— in Europe this week. Made by Daimler's Mitsubishi Fuso truck division, it has a range of 62 miles (100 km) and can transport 4.5 tons. UPS already uses eCanters in the US. German parcel service DHL will buy some too—but DHL already has a pretty amazing electric truck success story of its own.
While automotive bosses talked up their e-mobility plans, Germany's Deutsche Post DHL got tired of waiting to electrify its fleet. In 2014, after no car company was willing to partner with it, the logistics company went ahead and bought a small startup called StreetScooter. Within 18 months, it had developed its own basic, electric postal vans to zoom around crowded cities, delivering post, parcels—and handling that all-important “last mile” of delivery.
The disruptive StreetScooter now makes fully electric pickups, vans, bikes, and trikes, which it also sells to third parties. It says that its some 5,000 e-vehicles have driven 13.5 million kilometers so far, and saved more than 16,000 tons of CO2 annually.
The project's success irked some of Germany's automotive behemoths: Bloomberg reported that VW CEO Matthias Müller said: “It's extremely annoying to me. I am asking myself why Deutsche Post didn't work with us on this.”
DHL plans to ramp up production of StreetScooters to 10,000 a year next year, and is building a second factory in Germany in 2018, allowing it to sell more vehicles to third parties.
The scrappy StreetScooter now has important friends: Ford is now a partner, and the company has plans to build it a fleet of around 2,500 bigger e-trucks, based on the Ford Transit van.

LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Greece has proposed ending a standoff with its international creditors by swapping its outstanding debt for new growth-linked bonds, the new finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, told the Financial Times in an interview.
Varoufakis also told the FT that Athens would no longer call for a write-off of Greece's 315 billion euros of foreign debt.
Instead it will seek a “menu of debt swaps” including two types of new bonds - one indexed to nominal economic growth and one they called “perpetual bonds” to replace European Central Bank-owned Greek bonds, the FT reported.
“What I'll say to our partners is that we are putting together a combination of a primary budget surplus and a reform agenda,” Varoufakis told the FT.
“I'll say, ‘Help us to reform our country and give us some fiscal space to do this, otherwise we shall continue to suffocate and become a deformed rather than a reformed Greece'.”
The bonds indexed to economic growth would replace Greece's European rescue loans, Varoufakis said.
Varoufakis also said Athens planned to target wealthy tax-evaders and post primary budget surpluses of 1 to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, even if it meant their party, Syriza, could not fulfil all the spending promises on which it was elected, the FT reported.
Greece's new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and Varoufakis are touring European capitals in a diplomatic offensive to replace the country's bailout accord with the European Union, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund, known as the “troika”.

President Barack Obama's approval rating hit 55 percent in a new CNN/ORC poll out today, which is the highest mark since their second term began. Separately, he's up to 54 percent in Gallup's tracking poll which is also their highest since their second inauguration.
These are the kind of numbers that ought to give one some doubt about the theory that Donald Trump is well-positioned to ride a current of popular demand for change into the White House. And, in particular, with new unemployment claims at their lowest level since the early 1970s (a period when the total population was much smaller), there's really no sign of a median voter experiencing economic agony and crying out for a radically new approach.
What remains true is that Hillary Clinton, though more popular than Trump, is personally much less popular than Obama. That probably speaks to their relative weakness on nonpolicy issues, like the widely discussed email server matter and their various buckraking activities during their years out of office. Clinton represents continuity with a popular incumbent administration, which helps make them a favorite to win, but the public has bigger doubts about their personal integrity that are probably making things harder for them than they should be.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sent a companywide email to employees this morning — laying out a broad agenda for Microsoft's new fiscal year, setting the stage for the upcoming Windows 10 launch and revealing the company's new, official mission statement: To “empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.”
The new mission statement will not be a surprise to anyone who has been following Nadella's tenure at the helm of the company, but it crystalizes Nadella's vision for the company and is significantly more straightforward than the mission statement espoused by their predecessor.
Nadella's latest email is not being distributed publicly by the company. It was obtained independently by GeekWire. The email amounts to a “State of the Union” message for employees, setting a tone and direction for the upcoming year. It reinforces many of the changes that are already underway, including the company's focus on mobile devices and cloud services.
We will need to innovate in new areas, execute against our plans, make some tough choices in areas where things are not working and solve hard problems in ways that drive customer value. The message also addresses the evolution of the company's culture as Microsoft attempts to become more nimble and responsive.
“I believe that culture is not static,” Nadella concludes. “It evolves every day based on the behaviors of everyone in the organization. We are in an incredible position to seize new growth this year. We will need to innovate in new areas, execute against our plans, make some tough choices in areas where things are not working and solve hard problems in ways that drive customer value.”
The email follows the announcement by Nadella last week that four top executives will be leaving as part of a broader management overhaul that combines the company's Windows and Devices groups. Last week's news was the biggest shakeup at the company since Nadella announced 18,000 job cuts last year, and today's email gives them a new chance reinforce the company's vision for its more than 118,000 worldwide employees.
Here's the full text of today's email, as obtained by GeekWire.
Team,
I believe that we can do magical things when we come together with a shared mission, clear strategy, and a culture that brings out the best in us individually and collectively. Last week I shared how we are aligning our structure to our strategy. Today, I want to share more on the overall context and connective tissue between our mission, worldview, strategy and culture. It is critical that we start the new fiscal year with this shared vision on what we can do and who we want to become.
Mission. Every great company has an enduring mission. Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. I'm proud to share that this is our new official mission statement. This mission is ambitious and at the core of what our customers deeply care about. We have unique capability in harmonizing the needs of both individuals and organizations. This is in our DNA. We also deeply care about taking things global and making a difference in lives and organizations in all corners of the planet.
Worldview. We must always ground our mission in both the world in which we live and the future we strive to create. Today, we live in a mobile-first, cloud-first world, and the transformation we are driving across our businesses is designed to enable Microsoft and our customers to thrive in this world. It's important to note that our worldview for mobile-first is not just about the mobility of devices; it's centered on the mobility of experiences that, in turn, are orchestrated by the cloud. That is why we think of these two trends together. What we do with our products and business models has to account for this fundamental transformation.
Strategy and ambitions. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. Our platforms will harmonize the interests of end users, developers and IT better than any competing ecosystem or platform. We will realize our mission and strategy by investing in three interconnected and bold ambitions.
1. Reinvent productivity and business processes
2. Build the intelligent cloud platform
3. Create more personal computing
These ambitions utilize a unique set of assets that span productivity services, cloud platform, our device platform and our family of devices. There is an explicit path dependence on how we achieve the “inter-connectedness” between the various elements of our strategy to gain momentum.
· First, we will reinvent productivity services for digital work that span all devices. We will also extend our experience footprint by building more business process experiences, integrated into content authoring and consumption, communication and collaboration tools. We will drive scale and usage by appealing to “dual-use” customers, providing productivity services that enable them to accomplish more at work and in the rest of their life activities with other people.
· Second, all these experiences will be powered by our cloud platform – a cloud that provides our customers faster time to value, improved agility and cost reduction, and solutions that differentiate their business. We'll further provide a powerful extensibility model that is attractive to third-party developers and enterprises. This in turn enables us to attract applications to our cloud platform and attach our differentiated capabilities such as identity management, rich data management, machine learning and advanced analytics.
· Finally, we will build the best instantiation of this vision through our Windows device platform and our devices, which will serve to delight our customers, increase distribution of our services, drive gross margin, enable fundamentally new product categories, and generate opportunity for the Windows ecosystem more broadly. We will pursue our gaming ambition as part of this broader vision for Windows and increase its appeal to consumers. We will bring together Xbox Live and our first-party gaming efforts across PC, console, mobile and new categories like HoloLens into one integrated play.
Strength across all the ambitions enables us to deliver high value to our customers while providing us with the ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.
Culture. Perhaps the most important driver of success is culture. Over the past year, we've challenged ourselves to think about our core mission, our soul — what would be lost if we disappeared. That work resulted in the mission, strategy and ambitions articulated above. However, we also asked ourselves, what culture do we want to foster that will enable us to achieve these goals?
We fundamentally believe that we need a culture founded in a growth mindset. It starts with a belief that everyone can grow and develop; that potential is nurtured, not predetermined; and that anyone can change their mindset. Leadership is about bringing out the best in people, where everyone is bringing their A game and finding deep meaning in their work. We need to be always learning and insatiably curious. We need to be willing to lean in to uncertainty, take risks and move quickly when we make mistakes, recognizing failure happens along the way to mastery. And we need to be open to the ideas of others, where the success of others does not diminish our own.
We have the opportunity to exercise our growth mindset every day in three distinct areas:
· Customer-obsessed. We will learn about our customers and their businesses with a beginner's mind and then bring solutions that meet their needs. We will be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that knowledge into Microsoft, while still innovating to surprise and delight our users.
· Diverse and inclusive. The world is diverse. We will better serve everyone on the planet by representing everyone on the planet. We will be open to learning our own biases and changing our behaviors so we can tap into the collective power of everyone at Microsoft. We don't just value differences, we seek them out, we invite them in. And as a result, our ideas are better, our products are better and our customers are better served.
· One Microsoft. We are a family of individuals united by a single, shared mission. It's our ability to work together that makes our dreams believable and, ultimately, achievable. We will build on the ideas of others and collaborate across boundaries to bring the best of Microsoft to our customers as one. We are proud to be part of team Microsoft.
If we do all of this, we will achieve our mission to empower every person and organization on the planet. Beyond that, we will make a difference and find deep meaning in our work. We stand in awe of what humans dare to achieve, and we are motivated every day to empower others to achieve more through our technology and innovation.
When we come together as a team, with our exceptional talent and the mindset of a learner, we will grow as individuals, we will grow as a team, we will grow with our customers and partners, we will grow our opportunity, and we will grow our business going forward. And, ultimately, we will grow the impact we have in the world.
We've already started this evolution with things like OneWeek and Hackathon, customer feedback loops, our focus on usage in the engineering teams, our performance review model, as well as our diversity and inclusion efforts including the new unconscious bias training. We will do more and more to support the culture we have and recognize impact when we see it.
A good example of our culture in action right now is the workaround Windows. We have approached Windows 10 with a growth mindset and obsession for our customers. We have the opportunity to connect with 1.5 billion Windows customers in 190 countries around the globe. We aspire to move people from needing Windows to choosing Windows to loving Windows. … Certainly we want to upgrade as many of our current Windows 7 and 8.1 customers to Windows 10 as possible through our free upgrade offer. More than that, though, we see this as an opportunity to support and celebrate how people and communities upgrade their world every day. To that end, starting on July 29 when Windows 10 becomes available, employees are invited to volunteer some time and upgrade their communities as part of the broader movement. More details will be available in the coming weeks — our hope is that not only our employees, but customers and partners as well, will get involved and be inspired. Together, we can make a big difference in our world.
I believe that culture is not static. It evolves every day based on the behaviors of everyone in the organization. We are in an incredible position to seize new growth this year. We will need to innovate in new areas, execute against our plans, make some tough choices in areas where things are not working and solve hard problems in ways that drive customer value. I really do believe that we can achieve magical things when we come together as one team and focus. I'm looking forward to what we can achieve together in FY16.

The UK will reopen its Tehran embassy this weekend as relations warm between Iran and the West. The embassy was closed in 2011 after protesters, angry over the UK's imposition of sanctions on Iran, scaled the walls and the gates of the embassy, burning British flags and a car.
Philip Hammond will become the first foreign secretary to visit the city in 14 years, according to The Guardian.
See also: 5 key things to know about the Iran nuclear deal
The UK Foreign Office confirmed to Mashable that the foreign secretary will be visiting Tehran "over the coming days,” but was not able to confirm anything further.
The restoration of the ambassador's residence and some of the buildings comes after a July 14 accord between Iran and six world powers on Tehran's nuclear program. Tehran has already had visitors from France, Italy, Germany and the EU. The big oil companies and other businesses have also been racing to get a foothold in the country as sanctions are set to ease.
The Iranian embassy in London will be reopened at the same time.
A new ambassador to Tehran hasn't been announced but the current nonresident chargé d'affaires, Ajay Sharma, will lead a team of diplomats in the interim.
It had been expected that full diplomatic relations would be restored sooner, but technical issues tripped up progress. British diplomats ripped up communications equipment in the embassy when they left. Replacing it took a long time because of an Iranian rule that no single diplomatic bag can weigh more than 15 kg (33 pounds).
The U.S. hasn't had an embassy in Tehran since 1979, when Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy and ultimately held 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days.
But speculation has been rife that, after restoring ties with Cuba, Tehran will be next on President Barack Obama's list. When asked about an embassy opening, Obama told NPR in December 2014, "I never say never, but I think these things have to go in steps."

Nine Vietnamese men are missing after their cargo ship collided with an unknown vessel and sank in the waters off the country's southern coast early on Tuesday morning, search and rescue forces have reported.
The Hai Thanh 26, with 11 crew members on board, sank about 44 nautical miles to the east of Vung Tau City in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province while carrying clinker from the northern city of Hai Phong to the Mekong Delta city of Can Tho. Two of the sailors have been rescued, according to the Vietnam Maritime Search and Rescue Center (MRCC). Clinker is used to produce cement.
Rescued crew member Hoang Tien Khoi told the center that their ship sank at around midnight on Monday after the collision, Tuoi Tre reported.
The MRCC has deployed two surveillance ships and asked the Petrolimex 14 oil tanker, which is operating near the scene, to assist the rescue effort.
At around 7 a.m., the Petrolimex 14 found a raft carrying two members of the sunken ship, including Khoi.
Luong Truong Phi, deputy director of MRCC No.3 in charge of the Vung Tau area, told VnExpress the center is coordinating with other ships operating in the area to search for the nine missing crew members.
"We haven't been able to identify the ship that collided and sunk the Hai Thanh 26 yet," said Phi.
Dearly departed Formula One backmarkers Manor have officially ceased to be, therefore, their stuff is up for sale in order to pay off the team's assorted debts. Everything from a 6:1 wind tunnel model of Manor's stillborn 2017 car design to enough wheels to shame a hellaflush kid is up for sale. Who needs some F1 kit?
Gordon Brothers is hosting an online auction of the team's stuff, which includes not only F1 parts, but heavy-duty equipment and even office furniture. Here's the full run-down, as posted on their site:
4 x Manor Racing Formula 1 Rolling Chassis Show Cars (2015/2016)
2017 Manor Formula 1 Wind Tunnel Model (6:1)
Pit Lane Equipment
Manor Racing Drivers and Race Team Clothing & General Merchandise
Test Jigs, Engineering & Inspection Equipment
Large Quantity of Consumables
5 x Formula 1 Car Steering Wheels
2014/2015/2016 Car Parts to include 3 x Tubs, over 200 Wheel Rims, Tyres, Nosecones, Panels, Engine Covers, Rear Wings etc.
2 x Pop Up Trailers and Hospitality Trailer
Gazebo's, Banner Boards, Flight Cases & Freight Cages
Office Furniture and I.T.
The most interesting bit of that, of course, is the model of the 2017 car they were working on up until a few weeks ago, when the team finally pulled the plug on any hopes of competing this year.
The Manor race car doesn't look as complex as some of the other 2017 F1 cars we've seen so far this year, but it was, of course, still in development when work stopped on it .
Either way, it's fascinating to look at photos of what might have been for the folks at Manor in 2017. Check out those cool upside-down-L-shaped parts on the wing that frame the nose, for one.

Sutro Baths reimagined as a Center for the Human Spirit by Quan Nyen Tran
In 2012, Quan Nyen Tran, a student at the Academy of Art's Graduate School of Architecture, submitted an entry to the American Institute of Architects Center for Emerging Professionals competition. In it, they re-imagined the ruins of Sutro Baths as a transformational retreat center they call the “Center for the Human Spirit”.
What's interesting about Tran's design is that rather than rebuild on top of the ruins and cover them up, the center wraps around the existing pools, and uses the varied cliffs to tucks in structures and living spaces.
Tran refers to Sutro Baths as “an evocative ruin”, writing, “The evocativeness comes from a sublime coexistence of cliff, ruin and ocean – each a potential site for discovery of the human self and for an evocative architecture to house this discovery.
The center consists of three main spaces – a exhibition space, a meditation space, and a retreat – all with the goal of encouraging its visitors to treat themselves, others and nature with compassion.
The exhibition space features an ampitheater with a connecting tunnel that leads down into a bathhouse that is tucked into the side of the cliff. The meditation center is “cantilevered from an existing ledge, with steps leading down into the ocean, and takes in the view of the infinite horizon”. And finally, the retreat area is nested in the heart of the ruins, with minimal living quarters and a transparent ceiling open to the sky.
The Center for the Human Spirit was also Tran's Master's thesis.
“My project was ignited by a vision borrowed from Ayn Rand's Fountainhead and the quote: “Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision.””
And while Tran's re-imagining of our neighborhood relic wasn't a a finalist in the 2012 AIA CEP ompetition, we think they have a winning idea here.
Thanks to @sutrobaths for the tip.

President Donald Trump lambasted France and other NATO allies for not meeting defense spending requirements in a Jan. 28 call with French President Francois Hollande.
Trump reportedly told Hollande that while the U.S. is committed to France's security, the U.S. “wants our money back,” according to a senior officials comments to Politico. Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO allies for failing to live up to spending requirements required under the treaty.
They also raised the matter of defense spending, along with NATO cooperation in the fight against Islamic State, to NATO General Secretary Jans Stoltenberg in a call Sunday. The alliance targets defense spending for countries at 2 percent of a member nation's GDP. More than 20 countries in the alliance flout this defense spending target.
Trump called parts of NATO “obsolete” days before taking office to a German publication, and doubled down on their call for alliance members to up their defense spending during a visit to U.S. Central Command Monday.
“I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved,” Trump told The Washington Post in March 2016. Trump reiterated that in a CNN interview the same day, saying, “frankly they have to put up more money. They're going to have to put some up also. We're paying disproportionately. It's too much. And frankly it's a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea.”
Their comments echo scathing criticism from former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Gates told NATO it had a “a dim if not dismal future” if member nations did not increase their defense spending in 2011. They continued to lambaste the alliance saying, “The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress — and in the American body politic writ large — to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense.”

US CA: Column: Cannabis Craziness Is Ending
by Kevin L. Hoover, (04 Mar 2009) Arcata Eye California It's as though eight years in, the 21st century has finally begun. Of course we need sustainable energy. Of course we need an equitable tax policy. Of course we need a logical model for health care. And transportation, and the environment, and education, and agriculture, and the economy. Of course.
All the pent-up obsolescence of the old ways is finally collapsing, and the more changey things get, the more popular our new president becomes.
That change may include the demise of Reefer Madness as we know it, and we know it all too well in Arcata.
When I interviewed deputy drug "czar" Scott Burns last year, I was flabbergasted at the tragicomically superstitious state of their beliefs. This beltway Bushie's retrograde rhetoric was infuriating, since the ignorant and counterproductive federal pot policies have been mainly served as price-support program for the illegal cannabis industry.
The government's unimaginably stupid approach to this particular drug may finally be ending, 50 years after it should have.
First, the U.S. attorney general has signaled an end to raids on medical cannabis facilities, most of which are just marijuana stores. But the proprietors' relief could be short-lived, because the old-school paradigm that kept the profit in the faux-medical cannabis establishment may be on its way out as well.
A serious move is afoot in the State Assembly to legalize cannabis, and it might, just might finally rescue us from the cockamamie patchwork of legacy laws that's distorting and degrading our community.
If legalization comes to pass, it will be as much because the government needs the tax revenue as any notion of logic or fairness.They need the money, so now we see the prohibition beginning to crumble.
It will be just excellent to see the entrenched gray-market medical cannabis industry try to fight reform and keep the big bucks flowing. Watch their whole sham schema - the fake clinics, the Dr. Feelgoods, the for-profit 215 grows - evaporate once cannabis is legal.
Meanwhile, the first wave of grow house busts came down last week. And now that APD is set up for it, there will be more. Those who, lured by large, tax-free dollars, ruin residences, endanger Arcata neighborhoods and gamble their and their families' futures on lax law enforcement now have to worry about not whether, but when the cops will come charging in.
The era of Arcata as grow house sanctuary is over, and last week's raids are already changing the game. Homes which have had been internally shuttered for years suddenly have open windows, with non-halide light shining out. One has a new "FOR RENT" sign on it. Maybe an actual family will move in and enroll their kids in one of our depopulated elementary schools.
It's fairly safe to assume that the government will get legalization wrong on some levels, but one thing we ought to insist on is that those with medical need and others who want to grow on a sensible scale ( no whole-house conversions ) for casual personal use are allowed to do so, just as some people make delectable beer and wine at home.
Part of the romance of Arcata is its counterculture, which is undeniably cannabis tinged. But the recent profit-driven saturation, involving wholesale transformation of the town into a marijuana monoculture, is anything but healthy for Arcata, its people and other living things.
Everything from our greenhouse gas output to solid waste diversion efforts to availability of housing has been heavily impacted, mostly off the books and without public process.
Cannabis craziness has pitted neighbor against neighbor, corrupted property managers, criminalized entrepreneuers, ruined and depleted housing stock, invited organized crime into neighborhoods, threatened public safety, wasted police resources, shattered lives and turned many against legitimate medical and recreational use - among innumerable other negative impacts.
End the madness. Save our neighborhoods. Legalize freedom. Legalize marijuana. Of course.

HOUSTON – Houston Texans LS Jon Weeks has been added to the 2016 NFL Pro Bowl, the league announced today. Weeks will be making their first appearance in the NFL's all-star game, which kicks off on Sunday, Jan. 31, 2016 at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Weeks served as the long snapper on extra points, field goals, and punts in every game for the Texans this season. The six-year veteran also had a career-high eight special teams tackles and one fumble recovery in the regular season. Weeks passed former Texan Bryan Pittman (95) for the eighth-most career regular season games played in franchise history.
Weeks was selected as a Pro Bowl long snapper by Mike McCarthy and the Green Bay Packers coaching staff. This season, Pro Bowl long snappers are designated as “need” players and are appointed by each team's coaching staff.
Weeks joins teammates DE J.J. Watt and WR DeAndre Hopkins as the Texans' Pro Bowl selections. T Duane Brown was named an alternate.

If you're reading this while your boss thinks you're hammering away on some code or updating that Excel spreadsheet, then you're likely one of the workers that spend about 25 percent of their work time doing personal stuff online. And chances are that your boss doesn't even know it.
Network security consultant firm Voco says that CEOs and CIOs of companies are often completely unaware of what employees are doing online during work hours, allowing them (especially the tech-savvy ones) to get away with all sorts of online goofing off. Employees tend to spend work time browsing eBay auctions, using online dating or social networking sites, chatting over IM, and more, and they do it for just over a quarter of the time they spend at work.
Sometimes, employees also make use of company resources to engage in nefarious activities, like downloading movies and music over P2P. According to Voco's data, for example, many of the prerelease downloads of Hellboy: The Golden Army were over corporate networks. Not only does this consume bandwidth meant for business, it also opens up corporate networks to spyware, adware, and other challenges for network security. And, of course, it could pose a legal issue for the company in question as well. "If investigators were tracking who was downloading, then the company address would turn up and the company would be the one facing legal implications," Voco consultant Paul Hortop said in a statement.
At the same time, not all "personal" Internet use is necessarily bad. Hortop points out that sometimes it can be a challenge to determine exactly what kind of use is inappropriate. "Is it more time-efficient to let staff do their banking online than having them leave the office for half an hour?" they ask. Additionally, workers spending time on social networking sites could actually help the company, given their increased importance to businesses.
Of course, surfing at work isn't exactly a new phenomenon. In a survey conducted in 2005, 93 percent of all US employees admitted to using their employer's Internet access for personal reasons as well as business ones, and 52 percent said they would rather give up coffee than their Internet connections at work. How much that personal Internet use actually impacts businesses is up in the air, however. Websense claims that such behavior costs American corporations nearly $200 billion per year, although given the tiny sample used when drawing that conclusion, the actual number may be quite a bit different.
Regardless of how much it's costing companies, what's important is to make sure you're actually getting your work done while you're not checking your friends' status updates in Facebook or overbidding on an eBay auction. Now, get back to work!

US spills chief Thad Allen failed Thursday to reassure desperate fishermen about their Gulf of Mexico oil clean-up jobs, while BP began the legal wrangling in a massive civil trial.
As engineers prepared next week's vital operations to permanently kill the capped BP well, Allen met with parish presidents and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in New Orleans to discuss how to safeguard local jobs going forward.
With little oil now floating in the Gulf, there are fears the popular “Vessels of Opportunity” program that employs fishing boats to skim crude off the surface of the sea might have to be scrapped.
Allen pledged to redeploy as many skippers as possible to other tasks, but could give no firm indication of how many of the 1,500 boats would still be working in the Gulf after next month.
“Obviously as we transition into a point where there's not the threat of a spill, the involvement of Vessels of Opportunity is going to necessarily change,” they said after the meeting.
Allen said that over the next 10 days they would work with parish presidents and the governor to hammer out a plan for the fishermen and what to do with the program through to the end of August.
A large portion of the Gulf waters remain closed to commercial and recreational fishing and with lingering doubts about seafood safety, fishermen could effectively end up losing their jobs for a second time.
“The fishermen have missed a year, and we don't know what the impact is going to be next year, or the year after that,” said Marty O'Connell, an environmental scientist at the University of New Orleans.
Many are worried it could be months or even years before they can fish again, and there are no guarantees the fish will be there in the same numbers when they do, or that they will be safe to eat.
“If BP uses the capping of the well as an excuse to minimize its clean-up operations, then shame on them,” said Mike Frenette, whose five boats in Venice, Louisiana missed an entire summer's fishing due to the disaster.
Frenette had to apply four times before getting two of their five boats onto the program, which pays between 600 and 3,500 dollars a day, depending on the size of the boat.
“All that our Vessels of Opportunity work is doing is counting against our compensation claim. We're not making any money, here, we're just trying to keep our heads above water.”
Many disgruntled fishermen are expected to seek compensation for lost earnings and personal injury in the courts, and in Boise, Idaho on Thursday lawyers for disaster victims opened the first stage in a massive civil trial.
The hearing brought together a wide array of people and players linked to the disaster triggered by an April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) off the coast of Louisiana.
Plaintiffs range from the families of the 11 workers killed in the explosion to Gulf fishermen whose catch has been contaminated by the spill, threatening them with financial ruin.
A seven-judge panel will decide over the next few weeks whether to consolidate the litigation into one or several cases, and where the trial or trials should take place.
BP and other firms named in the claims argued for the venue to be the oil headquarters of Houston, Texas, but victims' lawyers said it should be somewhere closer to those hit the hardest by the disaster, like New Orleans. Joining BP in court were Transocean, which leased the rig to BP, Cameron International, which manufactured the blowout preventer, the device which should have shut down the well but failed to work properly, and Halliburton, the oil services company which had finished cementing the well only 20 hours before the rig exploded.
BP hopes to begin a “static kill” operation as early as this weekend to plug the capped well with drilling mud and cement. Five days later a “bottom kill” through a relief well should finish the job once and for all.
A cap stopped the flow on July 15 after between three and 5.2 million barrels (117.6 million and 189 million gallons) had gushed out, making it likely the disaster is the biggest ever accidental oil spill.

Schweizer: Clinton Email, State Dept.-Foundation Probes ‘Joined At the Hip'
Julian Assange Discusses Hillary Health Rumors from The Latest Email Release
On "Sunday Morning Futures," Rudy Giuliani ripped Hillary Clinton for an alleged "pay-to-play" scandal involving donations to the Clinton Foundation during their tenure as secretary of state.
"Her experience is the worst thing they have going for her, because they were a terrible secretary of state," Giuliani said.
They pointed specifically to the controversial sale of a uranium company to Russia, which came as money flowed to the foundation from those connected to the deal.
"She sold out our country," the former New York City mayor stated. "If they were a Republican secretary of state, the headline in The New York Times would be 'Clinton Sells Out America.'"
They likened the controversy surrounding the Clinton Foundation to Watergate or the Teapot Dome scandal, calling the foundation a "racketeering enterprise."
They said that there are so many allegations now that even the most loyal Clinton supporters must realize that where there's smoke, there's fire.
"Remember, this is a woman who was 'broke' when they left the White House," Giuliani said. "And now she's worth $130, $140 million. That's tough when you've been a senator and held a public service job during all that period of time."
"Donald Trump should stick on the message that they sold out their office as secretary of state, they made it a pay-for-play operation, and they put our national security in grave jeopardy."

PHILADELPHIA—In a study with potentially major implications for the future treatment of autoimmunity and related conditions, scientists from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have found a way to remove the subset of antibody-making cells that cause an autoimmune disease, without harming the rest of the immune system. The autoimmune disease the team studied is called pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a condition in which a patient's own immune cells attack a protein called desmoglein-3 (Dsg3) that normally adheres skin cells.

Current therapies for autoimmune disease, such as prednisone and rituximab, suppress large parts of the immune system, leaving patients vulnerable to potentially fatal opportunistic infections and cancers.
The Penn researchers demonstrated their new technique by successfully treating an otherwise fatal autoimmune disease in a mouse model, without apparent off-target effects, which could harm healthy tissue. The results are published in an online First Release paper in Science.
“This is a powerful strategy for targeting just autoimmune cells and sparing the good immune cells that protect us from infection,” said co-senior author Aimee S. Payne, MD, PhD, the Albert M. Kligman Associate Professor of Dermatology.
Payne and their co-senior author Michael C. Milone, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, adapted the technique from the promising anti-cancer strategy by which T cells are engineered to destroy malignant cells in certain leukemias and lymphomas.
“Our study effectively opens up the application of this anti-cancer technology to the treatment of a much wider range of diseases, including autoimmunity and transplant rejection,” Milone said.
The key element in the new strategy is based on an artificial target-recognizing receptor, called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, which can be engineered into patients' T cells. In human trials, researchers remove some of the patients' T cells through a process similar to dialysis and then engineer them in a laboratory to add the gene for the CAR so that the new receptor is expressed in the T cells. The new cells are then multiplied in the lab before re-infusing them into the patient. The T cells use their CAR receptors to bind to molecules on target cells, and the act of binding triggers an internal signal that strongly activates the T cells -- so that they swiftly destroy their targets.
The basic CAR T cell concept was first described in the late 1980s, principally as an anti-cancer strategy, but technical challenges delayed its translation into successful therapies. Since 2011, though, experimental CAR T cell treatments for B cell leukemias and lymphomas -- cancers in which patients' healthy B cells turn cancerous -- have been successful in some patients for whom all standard therapies had failed.
B cells, which produce antibodies, can also cause autoimmunity. Payne researches autoimmunity, and a few years ago, a postdoctoral researcher in their laboratory, Christoph T. Ellebrecht, MD, took an interest in CAR T cell technology as a potential weapon against B cell-related autoimmune diseases. Soon Payne's lab teamed up with Milone's, which studies CAR T cell technology, in the hope of finding a powerful new way to treat these ailments.
“We thought we could adapt this technology that's really good at killing all B cells in the body to target specifically the B cells that make antibodies that cause autoimmune disease,” said Milone.
“Targeting just the cells that cause autoimmunity has been the ultimate goal for therapy in this field,” noted Payne.
A more disease-specific receptor
In the new study, for which Ellebrecht was first author, the team took aim at pemphigus vulgaris. This condition occurs when a patient's antibodies attack molecules that normally keep skin cells together. When left untreated, PV leads to extensive skin blistering and is almost always fatal, but in recent decades the condition has been treatable with broadly immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab.
To treat PV without causing broad immunosuppression, the Penn team designed an artificial CAR-type receptor that would direct patients' T cells to attack only the B cells producing harmful anti-Dsg3 antibodies.
The team developed a “chimeric autoantibody receptor,” or CAAR, that displays fragments of the autoantigen Dsg3 -- the same fragments to which PV-causing antibodies and their B cells typically bind, as Payne's laboratory and others have shown in prior studies. The artificial receptor acts as a lure for the B cells that target Dsg3, bringing them into fatal contact with the therapeutic T cells.
Testing many variants, the team eventually found an artificial receptor design that worked well in cell culture, enabling host T cells to efficiently destroy cells producing antibodies to desmoglein, including those derived from PV patients. The engineered T cells also performed successfully in a mouse model of PV, killing desmoglein-specific B cells and preventing blistering and other manifestations of autoimmunity in the animals.
“We were able to show that the treatment killed all the Dsg3-specific B cells, a proof of concept that this approach works,” Payne said.
T cell therapies can be complicated by many factors. But in these experiments, the Penn scientists' engineered cells maintained their potency despite the presence of anti-Dsg3 antibodies that might have swarmed their artificial receptors. In addition, there were no signs that the engineered T cells caused side effects by hitting the wrong cellular targets in the mice.
The team now plans to test their treatment in dogs, which can also develop PV and often die from the disease. “If we can use this technology to cure PV safely in dogs, it would be a breakthrough for veterinary medicine, and would hopefully pave the way for trials of this therapy in human pemphigus patients,” Payne said.
Also on the horizon for the Penn scientists are applications of CAAR T cell technology for other types of autoimmunity. The immune rejection that complicates organ transplants, and normally requires long-term immunosuppressive drug therapy, may also be treatable with CAAR T cell technology.
“If you can identify a specific marker of a B cell that you want to target, then in principle this strategy can work,” Payne said.
Other co-authors of the study include Vijay G. Bhoj, Arben Nace, Eun Jung Choi, Xuming Mao, Michael Jeffrey Cho, John T. Seykora, and George Cotsarelis, all of Penn; Giovanni Di Zenzo of the Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata in Rome; and Antonio Lanzavecchia of the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Bellinzona, Switzerland.

Samsung has announced a new, zippier Wi-Fi standard. The tech titan's 60GHz Wi-Fi technology transmits data at 4.6Gbps, or 575MB per second. That is a five-fold increase from the current speeds of 866Mbps, or 108MB per second that is available with today's Wi-Fi standard. With the faster speeds, a 1GB movie takes less than three seconds to transfer between devices.Samsung was able to rid the network of co-channel interference regardless of the number of devices that are using it at the same time. Additionally, the 60GHz technology has suffered from having weak-penetration capabilities and path loss, resulting in signals that were too weak to be used by any device. According to the company, it was able to get around this problem by using a specific circuit design and a "beam forming antenna." Samsung said it was also able to develop a method that allows multiple devices to connect to a network simultaneously.Once the 60GHz band is commercialized, Samsung hopes to use this Wi-Fi standard for telecommunications, no doubt offering it on future handsets. It also plans on employing the network for audio visual and medical devices as well as for products related to the Samsung Smart Home.source: Samsung via SamMobile
In a report released this week, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee endorses a plant-based diet for optimal health. The strongest pro-vegetarian recommendation to date, the report also points to disease prevention and environmental sustainability as reasons to adopt a meat-free diet. According to the federal committee, “The major findings regarding sustainable diets were that a diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet.” The 571-page report—which is open for public comment for 45 days—will become the basis for the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Dear Mom,

I kind of hate you.
At 5, I hated you because you screamed and screamed at me for not understanding a math question. You told me I was stupid. But I still loved you.
At 6, I hated you because you chased after me and hit me until I cried and did what you said. But I still loved you.
At 8, I hated you because you always ignored my tear-stained face and hiccups, and never once wondered what was wrong. But I still loved you.
At 10, I hated you because you told Dad not to comfort me when I cried. They had to sneak into my room and quietly press a tissue in my hand before silently slipping out. I held on tight to that piece of tissue for it was my only comfort. But I still loved you.
At 12, I hated you because you sold my hamster behind my back. But I still loved you.
At 14, I hated you because you kept yelling at me for being too shy. I thought it was my fault and I was sorry for letting you down. Because I still loved you.
At 15, I hated you because you told me to go jump off a bridge and die. But still, I loved you.
At 16, I hated you because you told me to stop clinging on to you that night on the beach. But I must have still loved you because I cried all through the night as the fireworks exploded above us.
At 17, I hated you because I was too nervous to talk to the office lady and you screamed and struck my head with a book. You told me I would never amount to anything. But I guess I still loved you.
At 18, I hated you because you kept telling me I had no friends. I guess it was true, but I also knew then that I didn't have a friend in you.
At 19, I hate you because you value your friends more than you value me.
At 19, I hate you because you would rather spend your time watching a drama than talking with me.
At 19, I hate you because you never listen to what I have to say. (Because I'm always wrong.)
At 19, I hate you because you make me feel guilty for existing.
At 19, I hate you because you told me I'm a useless piece of trash, and you made me believe it.
At 19, I hate you because you've never realized that I've been going through the toughest time of my life. You've never realized how hard it is for me to wake up every morning. You've never realized how much it hurts when you yell at me for not waking up earlier, for not finding a job, for not cleaning my room, for not being considerate enough.
You won't even listen to me.
Instead, you call me selfish, ungrateful, and hopeless.
At 19, I thought maybe I should go jump off a bridge and die, like you had said all those times.
At 19, I'm a complete mess.
At 19, I don't really love you any more.
Reuters/Joshua Roberts White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway cited a demonstrably nonexistent "massacre" as justification for President Donald Trump's temporary immigration ban in an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine days before making headlines by mentioning the falsehood on MSNBC's "Hardball."
Conway said in a phone interview with Cosmo on January 29, and a video interview with TMZ that the Obama administration had called for a temporary ban on Iraqi refugees after a "massacre" they said was carried out by terrorists in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The magazine described the comments in an article published Monday.
"Why did they do that?" Conway told the magazine, referring to Obama. "He did that for exactly the same reasons. They did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills and come back here and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers' lives away." Conway told TMZ a very similar story.
The Obama administration did review and slow down its program admitting Iraqi refugees after an incident in Bowling Green, but it did not introduce an outright ban the way Trump's executive order temporarily has.
Two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green were arrested in 2011 and indicted on federal terrorism charges accusing them, in part, of providing material support to Al Qaeda in Iraq — but no attack ever took place in the US. The refugees were ensnared in an FBI sting operation and later convicted.
When Cosmo reached out to the FBI about Conway's account, it said, an FBI spokesperson told the magazine "a couple of your facts seem incorrect."
Cosmo didn't publish Conway's remarks initially, but on Friday, Conway told the same story on "Hardball." They quickly corrected herself, issuing tweets saying they only misspoke and meant to say "Bowling Green terrorists" instead of "Bowling Green massacre."
In an interview with Fox News' Howard Kurtz on Sunday, Conway again defended the legitimacy of them story.
"I should have said plot or I should have just called them terrorists … I clarified immediately," Conway said. "I should have said terrorists and not massacre. I'm sure it will live on for a week."
"I misspoke one word." they added. "The corrections in the newspapers that are attacking me are three paragraphs long every day."
After the tour de force which was Ridley Scott's 1979 “Alien,” and a phenomenal sequel in James Cameron's 1986 “Aliens,” the 1992 follow up “Alien 3” was doomed. The sci-fi horror flick arrived as the directorial debut from now-renowned director David Fincher. Featuring the return of series protagonist Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), “Alien 3” nonetheless alters the formula. “Alien 3” benefits from a fresh setting, increased horror elements, and new cast of characters. While it's a far cry from “Alien” and “Aliens,” David Fincher-directed 1993 sequel “Alien 3” remains a decent continuation of the Ripley saga.
“Alien 3” resumes where “Aliens” left off. A fire erupts on the marine spaceship Sulaco. This forces an escape pod to eject with Ripley (Weaver), Newt (Danielle Edmond), Hicks (Michael Biehn), and the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen). the escape pod crashes on the planet Fiorina “Fury” 161 with the crew in stasis. On one of the cryotubes, there's an alien facehugger.
Fury 161 hosts a penal colony consisting of double-Y chromosome male inmates. Ripley emerges the sole survivor of the crash, rescued by the inmates. Prison doctor Clemens (Charles Dance) treats Ripley's wounds and cares for them However, Ripley's presence and status as the only female incites tension among the prisoners.
Once the alien does burst forth, it's a rather different Xenomorph. Rather than a human host, the facehugger finds an animal host (a dog in the theatrical cut, and ox in the assembly cut). Therefore the Xenomorph is a quadrupedal, and runs rather than lumbers. This intensifies its already terrifying characteristics.
I appreciate the gritty atmosphere of “Alien 3.” The prison colony features a decaying urban setting that feels akin to a decrepit industrial district. Plus, there's not only the threat of the Xenomorph, but the prisoners offer a menacing presence. A running alien further amps up the tension and horror, lending an inevitable foreboding to each chase scene.
Killing off most of the previous characters aside from Ripley and (sort of) Bishop ruins continuity. But by the same merit, it yields a new cast of characters. Clemens plays the former inmate who assumes the position of prison doctor. Probably my favorite character (sorry Ripley) is Dillon (Charles S. Dutton). The confessed murder and rapist became the de facto leader of the Fury 161 inmates. Dillon fosters a cohesive unit, keeping the prisoners calm and faithfully practicing in their fervent religious beliefs.
Dutton plays a complex character in Dillon. It's a mix of superb writing and excellent acting that chisels a likeable character in spite of past misdeeds. Dillon is eloquent and charismatic, even saving Ripley from an attempted rape. While Hudson (Bill Paxton) in “Aliens” was a deep character amidst the one-liners and sarcastic quips, Dillon remains hyper-complicated.
I like the way Dance portrays Clemens' conflicted backstory. There's brief connection between Ripley and Clemens, bolstered by loneliness. This isn't fully developed, but it's refreshing touch. Cinematography is delightful with oddball, crooked camera angles. Additionally, a return to the franchise's horror roots suits “Alien 3.” Whereas “Aliens” ushered in an increasing action vibe, “Alien 3” delivers loads of gore and tension.
Unfortunately, “Alien 3” falters with its effects and poor writing. Characters are well-crafted. But while Clemens and the resident leering Warden Andrews (Brian Glover) present excellent performances, they're both killed off early in the film. This lends an underdeveloped sense to the plot.
Furthermore, the CGI Xenomorph features increased speed which adds tension to chase sequences. However, the CG looks less impressive and realistic than practical effects from previous series entries. This coupled with an underwhelming narrative, lack of fleshed out characters, and uneven script writing prevents “Alien 3” from surpassing its predecessors.
Nevertheless, “Alien 3” is not a complete wreck, leaving some salvageable elements. I enjoy the darker aspects and new characters, particularly Dillon and Clemens. David Fincher's taut camera angles and the Xenomorph point-of-view (PoV) offer a fresh take on the setting. Similarly, the evolved Xenomorph which assumes characteristics of its host not only fosters a new dynamic but lends further insight into the alien physiology. Elliot Goldenthal's magnificent score shines with avant-garde touches such as warbling vocals. Golenthal's “Alien 3” soundtrack borders on operatic. Ultimately, “Alien 3” leaves much to be desired but succeeds in delivering an “Alien” entry with a dark, gritty tone, new complex characters, and a return to the series' horror roots.
But reliance only on Section Two would mean a crucial difference in how hard it may be to block a change in voting rules in an area that is currently covered by Section Five. Those jurisdictions, because of their history of discrimination, must prove that any proposed change would not make minority voters worse off.
By contrast, under Section Two, the burden of proof is on a plaintiff to demonstrate in court that a change would prevent minorities from having a fair opportunity to elect representatives of their choice.
“Getting rid of Section Five is not getting rid of voting rights; it would just make voting rights litigation look like normal lawsuits,” said Ilya Shapiro, a legal scholar at the Cato Institute, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the court to strike down Section Five. “It would mean that if the federal government claims people have been harmed, it would have to prove it.”
But J. Gerald Hebert, who formerly handled voting rights litigation for the Justice Department and is now in private practice, said that losing Section Five would be “devastating to protecting voting rights” because the costs of a lawsuit are so steep. Jon Greenbaum, the legal director for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said it would mean that the bulk of changes that now receive automatic scrutiny by the federal government could take effect without any review, eliminating a deterrent against mischief.
“Section Five makes all the voting changes public and transparent, because when they are submitted for preclearance, the Justice Department will call local folks in the community and get their take on it,” Mr. Greenbaum said. “If you have no Section Five, a lot of stuff will just go under the radar.”
LONDON – It is not easy to put a value on an intact forest, a clean river, or unpolluted air, but that is what a group of the world's biggest banks is attempting to do.
They have agreed that the present economic system uses and often destroys the environment without paying to do so. And that, they say, is not sustainable.
The banks are also concerned that some companies are using up natural resources so fast, with no thought for their own future, let alone that of the planet, that they will collapse. They want a way of warning them and ultimately withdrawing their credit unless the companies mend their ways.
The 43 financial institutions, including the World Bank, are setting up a working party as a consequence of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012, also known as the Rio+20 summit, when the initial 39 large banks signed a Natural Capital Declaration.
Fundamental to wellbeing
The declaration defined natural capital as "the Earth's natural assets (soil, air, water, flora and fauna), and the ecosystem services resulting from them, which make human life possible."
The document went on to say that the food, fiber, water, health, energy, climate security and other essential services provided by natural capital were worth trillions of dollars a year, but that they were not adequately valued.
"Despite being fundamental to our wellbeing, their daily use remains almost undetected within our economic system. Using natural capital in this way is not sustainable," the declaration says.
The bankers went on to acknowledge this was partly their fault because they had no way of valuing this natural capital, nor did they currently recognize the danger to the stability of some companies because of its destruction.
Forced disclosure
They want governments to force companies to disclose their dependence on natural capital and the impact they have on it by disclosures in annual financial reports. They also want penalties for companies not doing so and tax incentives for those who protect natural capital as part of their business.
However, the bankers know that in order to value natural capital someone has to establish what it is worth in monetary terms. What value can you place on a hectare of forest for the clean air, rain collection, carbon sequestration and foodstuffs it provides? Just as important, what is the economic loss if it is destroyed?
Industries like mining and fracking are in the front line because their operations are already perceived to damage and use up clean water resources and to cause pollution. The bankers want to put a financial price on this and ask whether the financial risk that overuse of resources causes to the businesses makes them a bad investment.
Pricing the natural world
But all businesses, even the banks that control investments, have an impact on the natural environment, which generally they do not pay for and which does not appear in the accounts. So to turn their heady declaration of a year ago into something more tangible, the bankers have set up a high-powered working party to put a price on the natural world.
Liesel Van Ast, project manager for the Natural Capital Declaration, is based at the Global Canopy Programme in Oxford, England.  They are working with the United Nations Finance Initiative in Geneva to help the bankers set up a series of committees to implement the declaration.
"Bankers need to address how they will account for natural capital, explain to everyone why they need to do it and then tell them how to do it," they said.
"Everyone believes they can get out before the resources run out and the crash occurs. We are hoping to change that attitude and get companies to pay a price for overuse of natural capital."
No illusions
No one has any illusions that the commitment by bankers to get natural capital accounted for on balance sheets, and then taken into account in the share price, interest on loans and cost of insurance, is going to happen quickly.
They have set a target of 2020 to get an international system up and running and recognized by all governments signed on to the UN Framework Climate Change Convention. It may be slow and difficult work, they acknowledge, but they believe this is vital to prevent the current economic system destroying the planet.

Public anger at Pharma and its outrageous prices has never been higher. First a smirking Martin Shkreli, founder of Turing Pharmaceuticals, refused to explain or defend their price hike of the antiparasitic drug Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 on the Hill in February, a price hike that could put the life-saving drug out of reach for some. With clear derision for regulators and the public itself, they tweeted that lawmakers were “imbeciles” after they testified. Then Mylan jacked the price of its EpiPen, an emergency allergy treatment that saves lives, to $600 up from the $100 almost overnight this summer. After public uproar, Mylan offered EpiPen cost breaks to low-income people–a common Pharma ruse that simply shifts costs to others while letting Pharma keep its prices.
And even as U.S. Pharma companies profiteer on older drugs like Daraprim (and newer drugs like the hepatitis C drug Sovaldi which costs $84,000 a course of treatment), they try to duck U.S. taxes with overseas partnerships and incorporations. The same taxes that fund their drugs in Medicare, TRICARE, the VA and other U.S. entitlement programs.
Pharma may be becoming one of the public's most reviled sectors but the U.S. government is in the process of erasing the few regulatory firewalls that have existed and tolerating alarming conflicts of interest.
Exhibit A is the nomination and confirmation earlier this year of Robert Califf as FDA Commissioner despite financial links to 23 Pharma companies including Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, Merck, Schering Plough and GSK according to a statement on the website of Duke Clinical Research Institute which they directed. In disclosure information for an article in Circulation, Califf also lists financial links to Gambro, Regeneron, Gilead, AstraZeneca, Roche and other companies and equity positions in four medical companies. Califf “served as a director, officer, partner, employee, advisor, consultant or trustee for Genentech,” said the Medscape website. This is an FDA Commissioner?
In the past, someone so heavily funded by industry would not be considered for a government position regulating that very industry. Yet on PBS, Califf saw no problem with doctors and researchers receiving Pharma money and actually thought it desirable. "Many of us consult with the pharmaceutical industry, which I think is a very good thing," they told host Susan Dentzer. "They need ideas and then the decision about what they do is really up to the person who is funding the study," they said.
Califf was an early cheerleader for the blood thinning drug Xarelto which is now linked to at least 500 deaths and possible, high level medical deception.

These Two Institutes Turn Toward Industry
Other government units are also tilting toward Pharma. In a recent editorial, John Markowitz, professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia, lamented that at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), under the leadership of recently departed director Thomas Insel, translational research (which tends to be Pharma focused) "has become virtually required for funding" with almost no clinical, non-drug research funded.
Insel, an early proponent of SSRI antidepressants (which they said "soothed people's symptoms within weeks, much faster than standard psychotherapy"), left government to work at a billion dollar, semi-secret private venture betweenGoogle and Pharma last year. The CEO of the new Google life sciences venture is former Genentech chairperson Art Levinson. As NIMH director while national alarm about toddlers on stimulant drugs was growing, Insel protested"under treatment" of children with ADHD drugs.
Finally, even as drug addiction, especially to opioids, becomes a leading cause of death in the U.S., Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), is looking to Pharma to find a "vaccine" for drug addiction. Shouldn't Volkow know, as head of the Institute, there is no "cure" or vaccine for addiction–that it is widely viewed as a physical, psychological and spiritual disease? Have they ever talked to Michael Botticelli, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, for example, who, as an addict himself, advocates non-drug, non-Pharma, peer treatment for addiction? (And shouldn't NIDA replace "drug abuse" with the non-judgmental "addiction"?)
Volkow and Insel's love of industry has also caused them to conduct disturbing animal experiments reminiscent of the noir researcher Henry Harlow. The medical establishment is increasingly reconsidering such invasive and unnecessarily cruel research.
To stay a Wall Street darling, Pharma is gouging drug prices, fleeing overseas and forming semi-secret partnerships with cyber giants. The public is appalled–and government is helping out.
Interim Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink believes club captain John Terry is still both physically and mentally fresh enough to continue playing at Stamford Bridge, according to ​ESPN.
It's been widely rumoured that this could be Terry's final season at Chelsea given their advancing years. Terry still skippers the side, but at 35 their form has been called into question and they were dropped on a number of occasions by former manager Jose Mourinho earlier in the season.
Terry is out of contract in the summer, but Hiddink believes they are still as important as ever to the club and is still in good shape to continue playing at the highest level on a regular basis.
Hiddink said of Terry: "I must say they look physically fit but also what is important when you're halfway through a season is that he's very fresh - and I mean fresh in the mind. He's very eager to train every day, to play.
"Normally - it depends a bit on the physical shape and genes - but most of the time when players come to 32, speed is dropping down and everything is more difficult. There are exceptions, depending on position as well, but normally after 32 they drop from their top physical abilities.
"Of course one day the body will say 'hey, slow down a bit.' But I don't see any of that (in Terry). I've not been asked (by the board for a recommendation on Terry's future) but these (experienced) guys are very important for Chelsea."
Terry has enjoyed something of a resurgence in form since Hiddink's appointment - as have Chelsea - who remain undefeated since the Dutchman took charge of the club.

The Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University has reviewed the studies and found that berry fruits protect brain cells from damage and prevent inflammation.

Developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) or some other form of dementia is a very real concern for older adults. The potential loss of dignity, identity, and independence is a frightening thought. There is good news on the nutrition front, however. Berries may provide protection against Alzheimer's as well as age-related memory loss and other types of cognitive decline.
Marshall G. Miller and Barbara Shukitt-Hale, researchers with the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, reviewed cellular, animal, and human studies on berry fruits and the aging brain and found strong evidence that blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and other berry fruits have beneficial effects.
They found that berry fruits protect the brain in several ways. They contain high amounts of antioxidants that protect cells from damage. Berry fruits also change the way that neurons in the brain communicate, and this may prevent inflammation in the brain that can damage neurons. Components in berries also improve cognition and motor control.
[WARNING: This video contains adult content that may be disturbing.] NJ Transit says it has taken a driver off the job after a rider recorded video of them engaging in a lewd act behind the wheel of a moving bus. Chris Glorioso reports. (Published Friday, July 12, 2013)
NJ Transit says it has removed a driver after a rider recorded video of them masturbating behind the wheel of a moving bus.
The driver was transporting passengers through the Lincoln Tunnel on June 24 when they were observed engaging in the lewd behavior.
After the video was turned over to Weehawken Police, investigators arrested the driver, George L. Simpson Jr., 41, of Newark.
The criminal complaint against Simpson says they took their hand off the wheel and began masturbating inside the bus, "risking widespread injury."
John Durso Jr., a spokesperson for NJ Transit, called Simpson's conduct "disturbing and grossly irresponsible."
“We offer our sincere apologies to anyone who may have witnessed this disturbing episode,” Durso said.
Simpson was taken off the job without pay.
Attempts to reach Simpson at home were unsuccessful.
For Thunder big man Nick Collison, costumes are a part of their birthday every year, but for teammates Kevin Durant, Jeremy Lamb, Steven Adams, Thabo Sefolosha, and Serge Ibaka, it isn't every day you get to dress up in creative outfits. They surely did not disappoint.
That's Caveman Adams, Durant, Sefolosha, and birthday boy Collison, or Walter White. Yes, Durant is rocking their Redskins with their costume. Thabo really impressed with that King Tut costume.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present you with the best costume of 2013. Serge Ibaka just showed each and everyone of you what a Halloween costume looks like.

If there's one quote that sums up the immigrant crisis plaguing Europe, it's this, from a Muslim refugee to a columnist: "They [infidels] are too easy to fool."
Columnist Burak Bekdil wrote in a piece for the nonpartisan Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies think tank that in 2016 they hosted three Afghanistan refugees while on one of the Aegean Islands. Their conversation with them was revealing: (emphasis bolded)
Over coffee, they said they were glad to be hosted “not by an infidel on this infidel island” but by a Muslim. The young Afghan who was dressed like a dancer from a cheap hip-hop clip on MTV said, “One day we good Muslims will conquer their infidel lands.” I asked why they were receiving “infidel” money for living. “It's just halal,” they answered. “They [‘infidels'] are too easy to fool.”
The refugees also sang the praises of Turkey's Islamist dictator Recep Tayipp Erdoğan and said they wanted to "increase the Muslim population" in Germany, where "they will be the best paid for being 'poor' refugees." German's states' budgets have been severely strained by the refugee crisis.
Earlier in the column, Bekdil had a conversation with a Syrian refugee, identified as "A," who thought that the European social workers aiding the Muslim refugees were being naive:
“I'll tell you strictly Muslim-to-Muslim,” A. said in good English after having poured down a few shots of whiskey. “These (European social workers) are funny guys. And they're not just funny. They're also silly. I don't know why on earth they are in love with a Muslim cause that even some of us Muslims despise.”
In other words, there are too many Europeans who turn a blind eye to the illiberal Islamic Sharia supremacist ideology that is pervasive in various Islamic countries, and Islamists are taking advantage of that.
Look no further than Sweden, which has seen an alarming spike in rapes after being flooded with migrants from Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Swedish authorities responded to the crisis by ... issuing a book informing migrants that rape is wrong.
London's mayor has informed citizens that terror attacks are just "part and parcel of living in a big city"; they have now become routine in London and throughout Europe. Meanwhile, police reportedly arrested one of the suspected terrorists in the recent subway bombing two weeks prior to the attack, yet let them go.
Until Europe abandons multiculturalism and embraces sensible policies to crack down on the Islamist ideology and stem the flow of migrants, Islamists will take advantage of their naivete.

Speaking of terrorist plots to blow up the NY Fed.
According to the government, 25% of the entire global supply of gold, approximately $355 billion, is buried six stories below ground, underneath the Federal Reserve Bank of New York building at 33 Liberty Street in downtown Manhattan. The same Federal Reserve Bank that was targeted by an alleged Al-Qaeda linked terrorist with a fake 1,000-pound bomb. Of course, until we audit the Fed, all claims of fortressed gold are just heresay. You can book a tour to see the bars for yourself. But in that case, seeing might be disbelieving.
"The closest thing to a real audit was last performed in 1953, but even that one had major problems. First, there were no independent outside parties involved, and second, only 5% of the gold was tested for purity."
For the nearly 60 years since then, the reserves have been held under tight control by a group of men closely connected to the Wall St. banks. Zero oversight by the American people or their elected representatives has been permitted. Last year, as part of their coverage of Ron Paul's inquiry into the gold reserves, CNBC was denied the opportunity to even film any of the gold in Fort Knox. They were told that it was a “closed facility.” One staff member even said that they were not aware of any member of congress having toured the facility since 1974.
According to a treasury document, a full audit of the gold would take 30 minutes per bar for a total of 350,000 man hours, or 400 men working for 6 months. Total cost would be $15 million. Sounds like a bargain.
That is stimulus spending we can agree with.
UPDATE - Uncle Sam audits its stash of gold at the New York Fed...

A 27-year-old failed Syrian asylum seeker is believed by the German authorities to be the man behind the explosion in Ansbach, Germany.
The 27-year-old came into Germany 2 years ago. They were denied their asylum application a year ago, but they were allowed to stay in Germany on account when the situation in Syria becomes stable, they would have been returned.
The perpetrator has a history of ‘drugs' and had psychiatric problems. They spent a considerable time a clinic and tried killing themselves two times before in the past. German newspapers have confirmed that they had mental health problems and tried to commit suicide twice before.
At the moment German investigators do not know what the perpetrator's motive were:
A spokesperson for Bavaria's police force told Reuters it was unclear what the attacker's motivations were. A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office in Ansbach also said the motive was unclear. “If there is an Islamist link or not is purely speculation at this point,” said the spokesperson, Michael Schrotberger.
In the second press conference investigators said that the perpetrator was heading to a music festival when they were denied entry, they turned away.
At the time of explosion it is reported that they detonated the device at a restaurant which was closed. The German Police have said that they cannot as of now confirm whether the man only intended to kill themselves or others as well.
Only person killed in the explosion was the perpetrator himself. They injured 12 people, they are in stable condition.

David Quevedo - Fresno Police Deparetment
A Fresno man is facing murder charges in court this week for the shooting death of a Jehovah's Witness who later died after refusing a blood transfusion.
According to The Fresno Bee, David Quevedo, 26, has been charged with the murder of 36-year-old Omar Silva despite the attorney for Quevedo contention that Silva's religious beliefs may have cost them their life.
What is not in dispute is that Quevedo shot Silva multiple times on Feb. 3, 2013, following an altercation in the street after an angry Quevedo was kicked out of a party because their favorite team — the San Francisco 49ers — lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the Super Bowl.
According to police, Quevedo and Silva argued over over gang membership with Quevedo returning later in the evening to shoot Silva through the security door at their home.
Silva reportedly told a Fresno police officer “Jehovah, Jehovah, I'm dying, I'm dying,” as they were taken to a hospital where they died during surgery after refusing a blood transfusion because they were a Jehovah's Witness.
It is the belief of many Jehovah's Witnesses that it is against God's will to have a blood transfusion.
According to defense attorney Antonio Alvarez, Quevedo should not have been charged with murder because Silva refused a transfusion that could have saved their lives.
Prosecutor Gabriel Brickey disagrees and will call Fresno County pathologist Michael Chambliss to testify that, even if Silva had received the transfusion, they would have died because one bullet hit a a major vein.
Quevedo has already served time in prison for felony battery and theft and was on supervised release when they were arrested for shooting Silva.
If convicted of murder they would face life in prison.
A breathtaking hoard of ancient Roman bronze artifacts, described as the first of its kind in British history, has been unearthed by a pair of metal detector enthusiasts.
The 4th century hoard found by Pete Cresswell and their brother-in-law Andrew Boughton in Gloucestershire includes a sculpture of a "licking" dog never found before in the UK.
The licking dog is an example of a healing statue, and may be linked to a Roman healing temple at Lydney, near the Forest of Dean.
Experts said there was also the possibility that a previously undiscovered Roman temple may be sited elsewhere in the county.
The artefacts appear to have been deliberately broken and hidden - with the exception of the dog statue, which remains intact.
Archaeologists believe the items could have been stashed by a metalworker who intended to retrieve them at a later date in order to melt and re-cast them.
Darko Milanic has played down talk of them becoming Leeds United's next head coach, saying they are yet to receive an offer from the Elland Road club.
Milanic, who coaches Sturm Graz in the Austrian Bundesliga, has emerged as the leading candidate for the job at Leeds after speaking with United owner Massimo Cellino.
The two men are understood to have discussed the vacancy on Sunday, though Sturm Graz say they have had no official contact from Leeds and Milanic claimed today that they were “focused 100 per cent” on their current position.
“In football there are always rumors,” Milanic told Sturm Graz's official website.
“But to me there is no offer from another club. I'm focused 100 per cent on the job at SK Sturm.”
A club statement added: “To bring clarity to the matter, there (has been) no contact between the clubs.”
Milanic is under contract until 2016 and only a year into a job they took on at Sturm Graz last summer. Leeds would be required to pay compensation to bring them to England.
The 46-year-old - an ex Yugoslavia and Slovenia international - moved to Austria after a successful five-year spell in charge of Slovenian side Maribor, a period in which they won nine domestic trophies.
Cellino wants Milanic to replace David Hockaday,who was sacked as United head coach last month after only six games in charge.
The Italian made a move for Oscar Garcia before the recent international break but saw Garcia opt for the head coach's job at Watford.
Alex Sabella, the man who led Argentina into this year's World Cup and played for Leeds in the 1980s, is believed to have expressed a firm interest in the job at Elland Road but is unlikely to come into the reckoning unless Cellino's bid to land Milanic fails.

0 Teen accused of bringing knives, ‘hit list' to Union County school to be charged
UNION COUNTY, N.C. - A teenager accused of bringing knives, a bottle of flammable liquid, fireworks and a "hit list" to Forest Hills High School in Union County will be charged.
The teen, who is not being named because they are younger than 16 years old, will face charges of possessing a weapon of mass destruction and having a weapon at school after they receive counseling help, the Union County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday.
BREAKING-Teen accused of planning to kill peers at Union Co school to be charged w/ possessing weapon of mass destruction & weapon at school — Liz Foster (@lizfosterWSOC9) May 17, 2017
The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation's Information Sharing and Analysis Center Unit received information from Thunder Bay Police Service in Canada about chat room discussions involving threats of violence by a Forest Hills High School student.
[PAST COVERAGE: More security added after teen found with knives, 'hit list' at Union Co. school]
Within 65 minutes of the Sheriff's Office receiving the tip on May 9, Deputy A.J. Wallace found the knives potentially minutes before the planned attack, police said. They took the student out of class, questioned them and arrested him.
Investigators told Channel 9 that the teen wasn't looking for attention and thought they were having a private conversation when they told someone in the chat room that they were going to stab classmates.
Josh Nunez, a senior at the school, said they noticed more security at the school since the teen was accused of bringing knives, firecrackers, gasoline and a hit list to school last week.
"I think they need some counseling and some help,” Nunez said. “I don't know if they should be faced with charges."
Some parents and teachers are upset that school district didn't let parents know for at least four hours after the weapons were recovered.
“They should've went ahead when they found the knife. No matter what time of day it was, they should've called the parents,” said parent Janice Firms.
Firms, who has a daughter and a granddaughter at Forest Hills, is upset that the school didn't go on lockdown.
The school district referred Channel 9 to the Sheriff's Office to answer that question.
“It's a discretionary call, but essentially if the student had not been found immediately, then of course we would've asked, or even the school probably would have recommended that it go on lockdown,” said Tony Underwood of the Union County Sheriff's Office.

The woman accused of offering sex for World Series tickets responded to the accusations against them in an interview with Action News. "It's like I'm having a really vivid dream," said Susan Finkelstein, 43. "It's unbelievable."
Finkelstein, of West Philadelphia, was charged on Tuesday.
According to investigators, Finkelstein posted an ad on the website Craigslist that read:
"DESPERATE BLONDE NEEDS WS TIX (Philadelphia)
"Diehard Phillies fan--gorgeous tall buxom blonde-- in desperate need of two World Series Tickets. Price negotiable--- I'm the creative type! Maybe we can help each other!"
After that ad was posted, an undercover officer from Bensalem, Pa. responded and, police say, Finkelstein offered to perform various sex acts in exchange for World Series tickets.
Them lawyer says the ad doesn't offer sex and they aren't selling their body for tickets.
"Nothing happened here. Police jumped the gun on this case, and I'm confident that Mrs. Finkelstein will be acquitted if this goes to trial," their lawyer said.
Finkelstein said they were just trying to cut a friendly deal.
"I was hoping to get cheap tickets and maybe meet someone, talk, bat my eyelashes, and maybe get some tickets," they said.
Finkelstein says their mother turned them into a life-long Phillies fan. They were there when they won the series in 1980, and was desperate to be part of the excitement again.
"It's so exciting to be part of that, 45,000 people loving each other and loving the Phillies at the same time," said Finkelstein.
The story of their arrest has lit up the internet and is plastered across the national media. Finkelstein says she's now worried they may never regain their reputation.
"That's a concern for me, especially when it comes to my employment and my reputation among family and friends."
As it turns out, Finkelstein will go to the World Series after all. They were offered tickets to Game 3 by a local radio station and car dealership.
When asked if they would accept them, they said "Yes, as long as there are no strings attached."
A radio station in New York is also offering tickets for a game at Yankees Stadium.

In v5.26 and later, you have to escape the left brace, { , in Perl regular expressions. You probably never thought about this overworked character, but lots of other people have. This is an important change because it's a fatal issue that may cause your modules and other tools (such as an old version of autoconf!) to stop working. But, we've also known about this for a bit, so if you are up-to-date, things may have already been fixed.
{
The short answer is to test your code with v5.26 before you deploy it. If you encounter an unescaped left brace that isn't part of an existing feature, your test perl will tell you. Find that brace and escape it with a backslash in front on it: \{ . You can also put it in a character class: [{] . You might have to do this in code for tools that you didn't write (I did it for my local autotools, for instance). Although we shouldn't have to be told, don't push to master on friday afternoon and leave for vacation.
Now, consider braces a bit more. First, think of the things that braces do or can do:
block delimiter
identifier delimiter, ${ident}
hash subscript
hexadeciml character code points, \x{ABCD}
octal character code points, \c{777}
unicode character names, \N{UNICODE NAME}
delimiters for match, substitution, and transliteration operators
Perl special variables, such as ${^MATCH}
Inside regular expressions, they do even more (including the double-quoted features):
generalized quantifiers, a{N} , a{N,} , and a{M,N}
, , and property names \p{PROPERTY NAME}
some zero width assertions, such as \b{BREAKNAME}
embedded code, (?{ ... })
postponed regular subexpression, (??{ ... })
relative references and backreferences, such as \g{-1}
I've probably missed some, but that's already an impressive list. What's not there? The literal braces. It's starting to get crowded in there, and the list is growing.
Perl has to figure out if that brace character in your pattern starts a feature (also making the preceding characters part of a feature). As Perl's regexes get new features, that { is being used for much more.
To make it easier for future expansion, you now have to escape a literal { . You don't want a preceding character that used to be literal turning into a feature that uses { . Conversely, you don't want a missing right brace to turn an unescaped left brace into a literal.
If you want to read more about this, there's a short thread On deprecating unescaped literal left brace from perl5porters in 2012.
[July 23, 2015] American Jews want Congress to approve the Iran deal. That's the headline from the first independent survey of America-Jewish opinion conducted in the days after the Iran nuclear deal was announced.
The L.A. Jewish Journal, an independent, nonprofit media company based in Los Angeles, sponsored the survey in order to provide a precise, thorough portrait of American-Jewish and national opinion at a time of intense concern and debate. Our hope is that the numbers and analyses presented below will provide a better understanding of how this crucial sector views the controversial deal between the United States, Russia, China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Iran.
As the analyses by professor Steven M. Cohen, who oversaw the survey, and our senior political editor, Shmuel Rosner, indicate, the findings have far-reaching implications and meanings for American Jewry, Israel and the United States.
They demonstrate a significant divide between the positions of major Jewish groups such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and many Jewish Federations, which have publicly opposed the deal, and the majority of American Jews. The thousands of American Jews publicly protesting congressional approval of the deal obscures the reality that most American Jews want Congress to approve it.
As Rosner points out, the results also depict a continuing divide between American-Jewish and Israeli-Jewish opinion. In terms of their expressed support for the deal, the two groups are almost mirror opposites of each other.
Our hope is that this survey will provide the basis for a thoughtful, honest and civil discussion among our communities on an issue crucial to us all.

Alright, so let's talk about one of the internet's favorite topics. (I'm looking at you Tumblr)
Queerbaiting.
If you don't know what queerbaiting is, go watch Sherlock. We will wait.
….
Still not getting it?
….
OK, Back?
Yes, as you can see, one of the more popular forms of Queerbaiting is taking two ambiguously heterosexual people of the same gender and putting them in emotionally charged situations where they then act as a “traditional couple”. This is usually complete with overlong sensual staring and suggestive flirtatious phrasing.
It is often seen as a way to “appease the gays” or to show support for LGBT people without pissing off the “average American”.
Does that sound patronising to you?
Good. Because it is. It really really is.
I have a dog in this horse race because I am queer. (His name is Shep but that's beside the point)
And I remember the first time I saw someone like me on TV. It wasn't a positive moment in my young life. Far from it. The first time I saw someone like me on TV they were the object of ridicule and it made me feel about two microns tall. So I can't help but wonder about all the young queer audience that sees shows like
Supernatural
or Merlin
or even Warehouse 13 which had a canon gay male character but still waffled on the (more risky for its timeslot) lesbian relationship
The queer audience is presented a situation which feels familiar and then at the last second it is pulled away like the proverbial football of Charlie Brown specials. It is a slap in the face to have two characters persistently act as if they are forming a non-heterosexual relationship and then at the last second pull back and remind the audience that, No, these characters are really straight. Queerbaiting shows have the air of homage but the subtlety of blatant mockery. That is what makes it so hard to watch.
It is a constant reminder that our relationships are not acceptable. They are there only to entertain straight people and serve as titillation. I have been in Straight and Queer Relationships, and I can tell you with one thousand percent certainty that one of those relationships was valued by society and the other was not. That is not an easy space to live in, especially when even the shows you watch to relax and unwind remind you that your love is secondary and not worth representation.
Our lives are just as real as straight lives, our stories are just as important, our love just as deep and worthwhile. To give us a quiet nod is to relegate us to the back of the bus and then expect us to be grateful that we were even allowed on.
I'm not grateful. I'm furious. And I have every right to be.
And I am far from the only one. The issue is growing and the tide is turning.
There was a point when the little gestures were celebrated, when we were just happy for a moment out of the shadows.
This is no longer the 70's and if writers and producers don't stop acting like it is they are going to begin facing severe backlash. I am far from the first to say so.
But finally, after all that is said, I would be remiss not to point out one refreshing high point that shows how this conversation can be moved forward.
Last Month DC made Harley Quinn/Poison Ivy canon. They didn't bind them in a monogamous relationship, they didn't have to shift their storylines, they just acknowledged that yes, they have a lesbian relationship but they are adults and they are bisexual. And with that simple acknowledgement they validated the experiences of a huge swath of their readership looking for some healthy representation. It cost them nothing. Not a cent. But it made a difference for those of us outside the hetero-normative box, a huge difference.
So Props to DC.
And Congrats to Harley and Ivy.
Freaking Adorable.

Could Tom Hardy Play Det. Harvey Bullock In The Dark Knight Rises? By Eric Eisenberg Random Article Blend
On the page, which has been updated with the new title, Hardy is now listed as playing Det. Harvey Bullock. While this could normally be written off as simple IMDb gossip (the site has posted Joseph Gordon-Levitt as The Riddler before), what makes it worth reporting is that it fits so damn well. First appearing in 1975, Bullock is a member of the Gotham Police Department and a crooked one at that. Though they have the entire force lying for him, the character has a streak of police brutality and has known connections to organized crime. At the same time, the man is tough as nails and an effective detective.
Could Bullock be the man that Commissioner Gordon brings in to hunt down the caped crusader? Hardy definitely has the skills for the part and would probably look damn good in a fedora and a trench coat. Though IMDb casts lists are known to be spurious and based on little-to-no information, there could be some reality here. Sounds off in the comments section. This morning's big news eliminated The Riddler from contention in Christopher Nolan's Batman sequel The Dark Knight Rises, but has only managed to make people more curious about whom the film's main baddie will be. Killer Croc? Black Mask? Clay Face? Whoever the character is, most expect that the role will be played by Tom Hardy, who was mysteriously cast in the film two weeks ago to the day . The main challenge is figuring out the perfect bad guy that can both fit into Nolan's hyper-real universe and follow the plotline created at the end of The Dark Knight.

Even if you don't feel linguistically-inclined, it's possible–with patience, diligence, and a sense of humor—to become fluent in a language in six months or less.
ALTHOUGH ENGLISH IS MY first language, I learned Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Chinese as a child, picked up French in high school, and have recently became conversant in Spanish as I travel through South America. Over the years, I've picked up the following tips for expediting language acquisition.
1. Immerse yourself
It's almost impossible to learn a new language, or at least to learn it rapidly, unless you begin thinking in that language. But how do you think in a new language you can't yet speak?
Ingratiate yourself with the community and you're halfway there!
The answer is to simply immerse yourself in it. Traveling in a foreign country allows you to continuously hear the sounds, rhythms, and inflections of a new language–spoken on the streets, in buses, on television, etc. Your brain will already start to process and interpret a new language.
Even better than simply traveling is being forced to “operate” in a new language by participating in a volunteer program, or working abroad. Best of all is being completely immersed with locals (such as living with a host family) and completely isolated from other native speakers of your language.
Immerse yourself with the locals, their music, culture, media, politics, sports, family, etc. Ingratiate yourself with the community and you're halfway there!
2. Forget translating: think like a baby!

How do babies learn language? Through imitation, repetition of sounds, and above all, by not being shy or self-conscious.
So what if your pronunciation is a little off, or you can't remember the proper conjugation? Just start talking, even if it seems like babbling. Resisting the urge to translate everything into your native language can be the single fastest shortcut to fluency.
Rather than walking up to the restaurant or giving your host family a pre-memorized phrase for what you're going to order, simply listen to how the locals order their food, and then imitate them as best you can. The same goes for greetings, small talk, etc. Watch their facial expressions as they say the words; study how they move their mouths.
Copy these expressions and sounds just like a baby would. Whether you understand what they mean exactly or not, eventually you will begin simply calling upon these sounds / phrases / words in appropriate situations. They'll appear, as if by magic. This is the gateway to thinking in a new language.
3. How do you say?
Besides common greetings, the one phrase you should memorize and always have at the ready is the phrase is “How do you say that / what is that called?”
By being an inquisitive traveler, one who is always asking questions, you befriend the local people. You'll find that over time they'll open up to you, making it easier to initiate conversations. These daily interactions with the locals are your best teachers: set a daily goal for yourself of having X number of conversations each day–asking people about things you're interested in, but don't know the words for. Even if you can't finish the conversation, you're on the way.
4. Write it
After having conversations, jot down the things you remembered hearing but didn't quite understand.
After having conversations, jot down the things you remembered hearing but didn't quite understand. (This can serve double duty if you're also taking notes for your travel blog).
Then go back and use your dictionary. Look up the words, piece the conversation back together in your mind. Then, next time you have a conversation, use what you learned.
When studying French and Spanish, I also used “grammar sheets” where I wrote down the various verbs to learn their conjugations. Besides helping me focus, they also became handy reference guides.
5. Use cognates and draw links
Ever noticed how some words appear exactly the same across various languages? These are called “cognates.” Unlocking the usage of cognates instantly gives you several hundred more words to your vocabulary. For example, most words ending in “ion” in the Latin languages are the same in English.
For example: information / información, donation / donación
Similarly, words across different languages often share the same root word, so drawing on what you already know will make it easier (e.g.: cheese is fromage in French and fromaggio in Italian). Studies have also shown that when you have mastered a second language, your brain becomes becomes better wired to learn subsequent new languages. Fret not, it gets better!
6. Local TV, movies, music
photo by Robert Paetz
Watch movies, listen to music, sing songs, and browse newspapers and magazines. It's fun and helps improve your pronunciation and comprehension.
I often stumble when trying to read Chinese script because I don't use it enough and there are no phonetic cues in Chinese characters. But by watching Chinese music videos and following the lyrics, I learned many new characters and also began pronouncing words more accurately.
In the same way, I attuned myself to rapid French prattling by watching French movies on DVD without subtitles and improved my Spanish by paying attention during the dubbed action movies on long bus rides in South America.
Salsa classes have also ensured I know my izquierda (left) from my derecha (right)!
7. Non-verbal cues
Beyond words, observe locals when they talk. Be it the Gaelic shrug or a slight tilt of the head, combining body language with a new tongue helps you communicate better.
This is especially important in cultures where language is closely linked to gestures. For instance, appropriate bowing and greeting in Japanese are inseparable, as with the hand gestures and intonation in Thailand. Picking up on non-verbal cues added a new dimension to my interactions with Thais, as I learned the appropriate bowing of the head and a deep enough wai (palms together) to accompany my greetings.
8. Get emotional!
Emotive experiences often etch impressions onto our memory. Make full use of embarrassing / funny / angry experiences by linking them to the new language.
I learned, quite unfortunately, the importance of the special “ñ” character in Spanish because saying “Tengo 24 anos” instead of “años” meant I told everyone I had 24 anuses rather than being 24 years old.
Needless to say, the embarrassment helped correct my pronunciation for good! Similarly, negotiating with shady cab drivers or nasty vendors also helps you learn numbers rather quickly so you don't get ripped off.
9. A world of friends / then going solo.
While individual classes can be highly beneficial for unsurpassed attention, group classes with friends can greatly aid learning. Having a friend to practice with helps you get better, and you can also learn from the different mistakes different people make.
On the other hand, venturing out solo in a foreign country forces you to speak with local people–say the person riding next to you on the bus, or standing in line at the market. It also prevents you relying on a friend with stronger language skills to do the talking for you in key exchanges such as asking for directions or buying food.
10. Practice at every opportunity before and after you travel.
Ever felt really “rusty” and lacking confidence in a language despite having taken classes or used it (or even mastered it) at some other time in your life? Languages are alive and require exercise. Find avenues to practice wherever and whenever you can.
For instance, I don't get to use French very often in my daily life, so I found a French penpal to exchange emails. I also keep in touch with people I met in France and French travelers I met in the course of my travels. Writing in French on FaceBook (www.facebook.com) walls does wonders and even helps you learn some local slang!

As the crossing at San Ysidro-Tijuana undergoes a major expansion, advocates are pushing for more cycling infrastructure throughout the border zone.
Each morning, denizens of the San Diego-Tijuana border area turn on their radios to get the news like everyone else around the country. But along with the weather forecast (most likely sunny and 75 degrees), sports scores, and top headlines, listeners also hear the wait times at the border. For the workers and students who live south of the border and regularly travel to the U.S., and those in the U.S. who often conduct business in and around Tijuana, it is an essential piece of information. The San Ysidro Port of Entry is the busiest border crossing in the Western Hemisphere, with approximately 50,000 cars and 25,000 pedestrians coming through daily in the northbound direction alone. Vehicle wait times can stretch to three or four hours, and even pedestrians frequently have to spend more than an hour in line.
Since September 11, beefed-up security and increased documentation requirements have slowed the lines at the border. For thousands of Mexicans and Americans, a long wait at Tijuana to cross into San Ysidro, a community on the southern edge of San Diego, is part of their everyday lives. To make the crossing less congested, a broad swath of organizations is now calling for the return of a piece of infrastructure that briefly thrived after 9/11 but was later dismantled: the cross-border bike lane.
“I bike to work every day and I work in Tijuana a lot. I would bike down there all the time if it were easier,” says John Holder, the border coordinator at Wildcoast, a non-profit on the U.S. side devoted to coastal conservation. Wildcoast supports expanded cycling opportunities. “Traffic is gridlocked every morning coming from San Ysidro,” Holder says. “There are loads of potential to make the border and San Diego a big bike hub. It's not a huge investment, so why not just do it?” Before 9/11, the crossing between Tijuana and San Diego was relatively frictionless. Lines were short and there was no need for a passport. After 9/11, U.S. border operations were handed over to the newly formed Department of Homeland Security, which, given its mission, considerably tightened security. To cross into the U.S. today, travelers are required to show a passport or the new U.S. passport card (good for travel to and from Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean). Frequent border crossers can apply for a pre-screening program such as SENTRI (Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection), which provides special documentation and access to shorter lines. “There are loads of potential to make the border and San Diego a big bike hub. It's not a huge investment, so why not just do it?” Directly after 9/11, bicycles were allowed to zip around cars in the regular traffic lanes, but U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) nixed that for safety reasons. Next, a dedicated bike lane was set up, which was faster than the vehicle and pedestrian lanes, but was prone to abuse. An entrepreneur started renting broken-down bikes with flat tires and missing seats. Once the renter got past the border, the rental company would whisk the bikes right back to the Mexican side. The scheme led CBP to shut the lane down in 2006. The zone is currently undergoing a major transformation on both the Mexican and U.S. sides. A $741 million, three-phase expansion of the border facilities is under way, including new infrastructure for managing commercial and private traffic—both vehicles and pedestrians. The PedWest bridge, slated to open this summer, is being constructed with an extra-wide lane to accommodate bikes and people with disabilities. While the U.S. General Services Administration is building the facility, CBP will operate it. So it is up to CBP to decide if there will be a dedicated bike lane and if riders will need to dismount. For cyclists, the ideal outcome of the upgrade is clear: to be able to zip past the lines of cars on a bike, ride straight up to a customs window, and ride off without ever dismounting from your two-wheeled steed.
Lawrence Herzog, a public affairs professor at San Diego State University, regards San Diego and Tijuana as two parts of a combined, transfrontier metropolis. They believe the emphasis on security has become excessive and that there is too narrow a focus on vehicles in plans for the border zone. “Alternative ways of crossing the border are not sufficiently addressed in the larger plan for the border region. There are too many people going in cars and trucks,” Herzog says. “For San Ysidro and Tijuana, there's a wonderful opportunity to address pedestrians and cyclists, and people using non-vehicular transit such as rapid bus lines or light rail. Right now, there's no cross-border system.” Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... That idea was backed by a 2015 report issued by a trio of regional planning agencies that detailed the need for pedestrian and cyclist improvements at the border, including a dedicated lane for bikes and more extensive bicycle routes in both San Ysidro and Tijuana. The cost of a cross-border bike inspection lane was pegged at $300,000. The report mentioned, however, that just one percent of the people heading from Tijuana into San Ysidro each day arrive on bicycles. Holder believes their number could grow. “For sure, the bikers would come if they made improvements,” they say. With millions of dollars also slated for transit improvements in the communities ranged along the border, advocates in both countries are fighting to make sure bikes are included in the planning process. Some are conservationists, others are cycling enthusiasts, and still others see bike infrastructure as a health and development issue. “We did an air-quality study from 2008 to 2011, and we found that the closer you get to the border crossing, the worse it gets,” says David Flores of Casa Familiar, a community development organization in San Ysidro. “It simply confirmed what we knew in the back of our minds.” Deteriorating air quality at the border was one reason Casa Familiar jumped on board with others fighting for alternative modes of transportation. The group helped lobby the U.S. government to add the new PedWest crossing as part of the improvement project. (The Tijuana River traverses the border, complicating planning and restricting where crossings can be placed.)
To get people to actually ride their bikes to and from the border, most advocates agree there is a need for better bike paths on either side, in addition to a bike inspection lane at the crossing itself. San Diego, as part of a $200 million investment in bike infrastructure, is building the “Border to Bayshore” bike lane, a nine-mile stretch that will connect San Ysidro to the rest of San Diego. Tijuana's government recently decided to turn sections of the Tijuana canal into bike paths, and it installed a bike lane following one of its major thoroughfares. “The biggest obstacles are funding for agencies, especially in Mexico, and alignment of existing plans and bike infrastructure for transit,” Holder says. “The [San Diego] trolley, which goes to the border, is not bike-friendly. They only allow one bike per car at rush hour.” That sentiment was echoed by bike advocates in Tijuana. Elizabeth Chaney rides across the border a few times a week and has helped organize bicycle groups in Tijuana, but they say many people are still wary of riding across the border. “Crossing on a bicycle is not the simplest endeavor,” they say. “A lot needs to be done to make it a better experience. Better bike facilities and dedicated lanes would help, but it's also important to have a plan for intermodal transportation in both Tijuana and San Diego.” Despite the challenges, there's a lot of energy behind the push for improvements. Groups have sprung up to make riding safer, advocates have ramped up their presence at meetings with officials, and even developers are looking to a bike-friendly future. For example, Tijuana-based Centro Ventures is integrating bike parking into a new mixed-use development near the border. Centro Ventures CEO Miguel Marshall has plans to connect the property's bike paths to bike lanes leading to PedWest, and is investigating providing space for a bike-share dock. May 20 will be a joint San Diego-Tijuana bike-to-work day, which has been held each May since 2011. This year, for the first time, binational bikers will meet at Casa Familiar, where they'll discuss issues and projects with an eye toward forming a stronger coalition. “Through advocacy, we'll show officials we want the bike inspection lane and connection,” says Flores. “We are going to hammer Border Patrol to show them the need.”
Question: Is it possible to attain Buddhahood in a single lifetime, as in this very life?
Answer: Many practitioners reach Pure Land via this process:
First becoming very old and sick, before realising they are dying, thus practising Nianfo (mindfulness of the name of Amitabha Buddha – ‘Amituofo') with utmost sincerity (faithful aspiration), and finally reaching Pure Land (before or shortly after death).
However, if Nianfo is practised very well in everyday life before dying, the process can be ‘shorted' to be so:
Without becoming aged, sick or dying, practising Nianfo with utmost sincerity, thus reaching Pure Land (without dying; with the consciousness simply leaving the body behind).
Such good practitioners are able to depart for Pure Land while very much young, healthy and alive, if they so wish, skipping the entire ageing, sickness and dying stages. Thus, they do not even die before leaving for Pure Land. Once Pure Land is reached, there will only be non-retrogressible and swiftest progress towards Buddhahood, if one trains there spiritually all the way. This is possible due to the most skilful enlightened teachers and teaching means present. Upon reaching this highest grade of Bodhisattvahood, one freely manifests birth for attaining Buddhahood in a suitable defiled land to guide other beings to Buddhahood.
As such a birth is merely a skilful manifestation, it entails no actual physical or mental suffering, and is not preceded by any actual death. This is how, with good practice beginning from now, Buddhahood can be advanced towards seamlessly and attained in this very one life, instead of 3 great asamkhyeya kalpas (incalculable world cycles) after countless lives. Such Pure Land practice is without interruption or suffering of death at any point at all. Note that even those who are already old, sick and/or dying are able to depart for Pure Land before actual death if they practise swift enough and well enough. Thus did Great Master Yinguang teach the following –
修净土者，
既生西方，
即了生死，
亦是即身成佛。 – 净土宗十三祖印光大师
(印光大师法语菁华) Those [who] cultivate [the] Pure Land [path],
since [to be] born [in the] Western [Pure Land],
[will] immediately end [the cycle of] birth [and] death,
[which] also is [to], in this present life accomplish Buddhahood. – The Pure Land Tradition's 13th Patriarch Great Master Yinguang (Essentials Of Great Master Yinguang's Dharma Sayings)

The Saint Paul streetcar plan came out a few weeks ago. The city is holding open houses on the streetcar proposal beginning this week. (Yesterday!) You can read all about streetcars here on the site…
Saint Paul has a strong tradition of being skeptical about trends, and the streetcar plan is no exception. For example, an East Side city council member came out against the proposal, yesterday a cranky Pioneer Press columnist used it to complain about taxes, and even the pro-transit planning commissioners seemed cautious. I'm proud to live in a city that is careful with its investments, and thinks for itself.
That said, I think that streetcars are a good idea, not just in general, but for Saint Paul in particular. St Paul is a unique place, but it isn't quite perfect yet. Here are five long-standing problems to which a streetcar might just be the solution.
#1: The Hill Problem
I interviewed the mayor recently for this site, and when I asked them about why Saint Paul doesn't have as much bicycling as its Western neighbor, they referenced the geography. Yes, Saint Paul is full of hills. Each time I walk from the West Side, I'm struck again by the beauty here. Saint Paul offers subtle topographic visions from the bluffs down to the river valley, views that are constantly shifting, and leave you a bit breathless.
On the other hand, many people don't like walking up the hills surrounding downtown. Streetcars can solve that, kind of like the funicular railroads that surround Pittsburgh. Imagine taking the streetcar up Cathedral Hill on a nice summer's day, and walking back downtown after lunch. Imagine putting your bike or stroller on the streetcar and riding up to the East Side. Hills are a lot more fun coming down. It's gravity!
#2: The East Metro Equity Problem
For years now, the East Metro local growth coalition (i.e. civic leaders and business types) has complained that the West metro is getting the lion's share of Twin Cities' transit investments. In some ways, the imbalance seems inevitable, as population and employment centers have been shifting Westward for well over a century. But at the same time, the East Metro has a lot of potential for transit-oriented density, particularly in the Saint Paul core. If we have to wait until the CTIB gets around to making transit investments here, we'll be waiting a long time…
The streetcar plan offers a way to speed up the virtuous cycle of transit investments and walkable urbanism on this side of the Mississippi. If we use streetcars to double our rate of population growth along key corridors, other regional investments will look a lot more promising.
#3: The “Drunk Irishman” Problem
Our former thin-skinned wacko governor famously declared on national TV:
Whoever designed the streets (in St. Paul) must have been drunk. I think it was those Irish guys, you know what they like to do.
It's kind of funny, kind of horrible, and a classic Jesse moment. But at the same time, it points to a problem that many people from Minneapolis (and other Saint Paul suburbs) have when they come over here. Apparently because we didn't name and number all our streets according to some bizarre OCD logic, nobody can find their way around.
In a small way, a streetcar network could help demystify Saint Paul. Streetcar lines offer clear linear routes through the city, psychological security not offered by a bus. Having an East-West spine running along 7th Street will give any mystified Minneapolites an easy way to figure out how lost they are.
#4: The Hockey Arena Problem
Many people seem cranky about Saint Paul traffic, even though it's not really that bad. (Most of the time, downtown streets are practically empty.) One of the big drivers of our traffic frustration are moments of gridlock during events, like at the Excel center or the Crashed Ice thingamabob.
Capacity is one huge advantage that streetcars have over buses. Done right, they can move a lot more people than a bus. And they take up a hell of a lot less space than an equivalent number of cars. If even a third of car drivers heading to an event take the streetcar, it would do wonders for peak congestion along 7th Street.
#5: The Lonely Downtown Problem
For me, the biggest problem facing Saint Paul is that our downtown isn't connected to the neighborhoods around it. Downtown Saint Paul is beautiful, and offers a ton of potential to be an almost magical experience. Unlike some places, we didn't tear down the best parts of our historic core. (Granted, we did tear down a lot…) It's easy to squint your eyes and imagine a future where downtown Saint Paul is full of people, an environment both historic and modern, a true city in an almost European sense.
But our downtown is very isolated from its surrounding neighborhoods. Other than West 7th Street, you'll find barriers limiting downtown's walkable fabric in any direction: a river, a bluff, another bluff, a freeway, another freeway, yet another bluff, a city road that looks and feels just like a freeway…
More than any other investment, streetcars can connect downtown to the East Side, West Side, North End, and Cathedral Hill neighborhoods. Done right, a streetcar project can help fill in the empty spaces surrounding downtown, particularly on the West Side flats and on the way up to the East Side. A walkable city requires continuity and connectivity. This is one way to achieve that.
Saint Paul is a city that loves its own history, that is proud to be a bit obstinate. It's also a place where things change a bit too slowly, particularly downtown. We only have around 7,000 downtown residents. (Minneapolis has more than 30,000.) Downtown office vacancy is quite high. (Minneapolis's is significantly lower.) Streetcar funding, and the economics of transportation investments, are both complicated issues that I haven't even touched on it in this piece. But if the costs can be managed in a reasonable way, I think streetcars might just prove to be worth all the fuss. Especially in Saint Paul.

I loved this experience from moment one. From finding out my Giftee to receiving my gift, I am already excited to do this again next year. This is my first secret santa exchange on reddit, and my secret santa sure has set the bar high!
I was wondering if my secret santa would contact me at all, and thank goodness they did! They messaged me relatively early to say hi and to ask me just one question: Who is my favorite actor/actor. I had no idea what they were going to do with that information so I gave them about 4 or 5 of each sex that I really enjoy, not knowing what they had planned up their sleeve. After learning what they did with that information, man, they made the right choice. Drew Barrymore is my all-time favorite!!! It doesn't get any prettier than her!!!
I was constantly checking my status to see when was the last time they looked at my profile and when my gift lit up, you should have seen my face. Hell, I should have seen my face. I had to have had a smile for hours! Then the new obsession of refreshing the UPS tracking began. It was shipped on Saturday and was supposed to arrive on Wednesday. Of course it was a day delayed because of last weeks bad ice storm, but when I saw that it was going to arrive today, I had to immediately call my husband at work and share how excited I was!!!
I was waiting all day long and then I had to take my son to the doctor, and of course they attempted to deliver it while I was gone. Just my luck. I was 15 minute late. 15 minutes!!! I immediately got in the car because I thought I could track down the UPS guy. When I finally found him, I think I scared them a little because I got out of my car and yelled, "UPS guy!!!!!" I was so happy to have gotten their attention and told them that they tried to deliver a package to me, and they finally handed it over once I showed them my I.D.
I was so excited to get home and open it, but I promised my husband I would wait for them to get home so they could experience the fun too. Thankfully, that was only about an hour later. We proceeded to open it together and it was sooooo much fun!
I can't wait to get rematched to somebody so we can restart the process of giving all over again!
Thank you so much secret santa! You made my day and I will never ever ever forget you! I will always think about you and your sweet family that took the time to think about me every time I put that little santa on my tree. (And of course every time I wear my new t shirt, eat with my chopsticks, use my tree skirt and matching table liner, or eat chocolate kisses) ..... I guess that means I will probably think about y'all every day. Does that make us family now? :)
I know this whole experience is about giving and the feeling we get when we make others happy and thought of, but I hope it comes back to you from your secret santa tenfold. Please message me and tell me about your experience!!!
THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!
Donald Trump builds things. It's what the newly official GOP presidential nominee does, they say, and it will be no different once he's elected. In May, they promised to "build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth—the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.”
And while Trump hasn't put forward any specific proposals to change how Americans move—by automobile, plane, foot, bike, or public transit—the GOP's newly released 2016 platform is openly hostile to just about everything but gas-loving cars.
Complaining that the current Administration "subordinates civil engineering to social engineering," Republicans want to end all federal funding for mass transit, which they call "an inherently local affair that serves only a small portion of the population, concentrated in six big cities." Never mind that federal dollars serve as a lifeline in states without many urban centers, and that rural transit ridership is growing.
The platform calls for the federal government to get the heck out of "bike-share programs, sidewalks, recreational trails, landscaping, and historical renovations," arguing that money for these community game-changers should come from "other sources." It encourages opening the Northeast corridor to private competition for publicly subsidized Amtrak. (That idea might get something of a test drive in Florida, where a luxe, privately-funded train system could start moving passengers between Miami and West Palm Beach next year.)
And while the federal gas tax hasn't risen since 1993 and the 60-year-old Interstate Highway System is a full-on mess, the GOP makes sure to rail against the idea of a gas tax hike.
"Everyone agrees on the need for clean water and safe roads, rail, bridges, ports, and airports," the platform says. But voters have heard a lot more about building a certain wall than any of that.
You can function just fine on 6 hours of sleep a night...or so you think. Here's how to tell if you're secretly sleep-deprived.
By Corrie Pikul
1. You're clicking your pen and tapping your feet.
What's happening: When you move your muscles, you cue your brain to stay alert, says Hans P.A. Van Dongen, PhD, assistant director of the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington State University. So if you're fidgety and restless and feel as if you you can't sit still or would rather (always) stand, Van Dongen says that "it could be your brain's way of trying to keep you awake."
What else you should know: Fidgeting could also be a sign that you've had too much caffeine. The recommended daily limit is 500 to 600 mg, or about 4 cups -- drinking more than that is another less-than-subtle sign that you need more rest.
2. You're lapsing, you don't know you're lapsing and you don't know even know what the heck lapsing is.
What's happening: Lapsing, in technical terms, is when parts of your brain take a stealth catnap. When you're exhausted, the sections that control attention and response time start taking breaks from processing new information, explains Van Dongen. These "mini-sleeps" could be as short as half a second, and you may not even notice that you've fallen into them.
What else you should know: Van Dongen suggests a lapsing test: Sit in a dark, quiet area while holding a pencil in one hand. Set a timer for 5 minutes, and just relax and breathe. If the pencil drops, that's a clear sign you and your brain need more sleep.
3. You're having trouble swiping your office ID, balancing your coffee and making it through the door before it closes again.
What's happening: This combination of simple tasks, done in sequence and under a time limit, is a fine test of your psychomotor skills and coordination, which are some of the first things to go when you skimp on shut-eye. In one 1997 study, researchers found that a person who has gone for even one night without sleep is about as impaired on early morning hand-eye coordination as someone who has a blood alcohol level of .10 percent, also known as legally drunk.
What else you should know: Sleep deprivation doesn't have the same effect on the parts of your brain that handle critical reasoning, so even if you're having trouble with appliances, you still may have no noticeable problem with writing a strategy memo or analyzing reports.
4. You act like Mrs. Silly Pants at breakfast.
What's happening: Your brain is having trouble telling you how to behave, so you're more reactive to stimuli from your surroundings. The sun seems so bright and cheerful, the coffee tastes soooooo good and that cat going nuts with the empty cereal box is just hi-larious.
What else you should know: Staying on an even keel will be your big challenge today, says Van Dongen. Your mood will probably go from goofy to grouchy as soon as something doesn't go your way.
5. ...and you're a hot, emotional mess for the rest of the day.
What's happening: Watch out, coworkers, spouses and innocent bystanders: Weakened emotion-regulating systems in the prefrontal area of the brain may make it hard for you to control and express your feelings. For example, if someone criticizes you, it will upset you more than usual, says Van Dongen, and you'll be more likely to say or do something you'll regret. Research from William D.S. Killgore at Harvard Medical School also showed that two nights without adequate sleep was associated with a reduced tendency to think positively and a lack of willingness to take action to solve problems. "Thus, sleep-deprived individuals appear to be more easily frustrated, intolerant, unforgiving, less caring and more self-focused than when fully rested," they wrote. In other words, you're acting kind of jerky.
What else you should know: While caffeine may give you a shot of adrenaline, studies show it's often ineffective at fixing the other emotional glitches brought on by sleeplessness.
6. You're craving carbs -- big time.
What else you should know: Eating breakfast within an hour or so of waking has been shown to increase alertness and improve cognitive performance. So embrace the carbs, but make sure they're the slow-dose kind that won't cause you to fizzle (steel-cut oatmeal is a great choice).
7. You get a second wind at 9:30 p.m.
What's happening: Your body is keeping you up for that last stretch of the evening so it can get you back into a rhythm, says Rafael Pelayo, MD, a sleep specialist at the Stanford University Sleep Medicine Center and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral science. They say that what often happens is the patient who's been running on empty will promise themselves she'll go to bed early. "Early" rolls around and they feel fine, so they keep getting things done...but then ends up with only 6 hours of sleep (again).

BAGHDAD—Extremist board-trick crew Al-J'Aqasse, the Middle East's most prominent Islamic radical snowboard posse, is taking full props for destroying the American embassy when a member nailed a goofyfoot 720 nosehook from a security-barrier railgrind into its offices while carrying 25 kilos of C4 plastic explosives, Thrashzeera magazine reported Tuesday.
"In the name of Allah the Merciful, this rad shit is off the hook, yo! Death to the great Satan!" Al-J'Aqasse members shouted in a videotaped, System Of A Down–soundtracked statement posted on the magazine's website, which is denouncing the bombing as "totally sick and twizted."

"Satan! Satan! Satan! Al-J'Aqasse blowing up across the M-E!" one member added.
American security is not certain how Al-J'Aqasse was allowed to build their custom snowpipe-ramp setup across the street from the embassy, but banners and promotional materials scattered across the blast zone point to the involvement of radical, extreme-sports-beverage bottler Sunni Delight.
The UK Secretary for Energy and Climate Change, Chris Huhne, has committed to establish an "Oil Shock Response Plan" to cope with some of the consequences of peak oil. While there remains dissent as to the facts of peak oil, a growing body of experts think that the phenomenon will occur at some point during the next five years. On a recent BBC radio 4 broadcast a former president of Shell, John Hofmeister, reckoned that there was no problem with the production of oil meeting demand for it until 2050/2060. This kind of estimate includes various sources of unconventional oil for which the EROEI (Energy Returned on Energy Invested) is far lower than for the cheap readily available conventional oil on which the modern global world depends.
Specifically, there are reckoned to be 1.2 trillion barrels of conventional oil and another 3.7 trillion barrels of unconventional oil, which includes oil-shale and tar-sands. Neither of these resources contain "oil" as such, but kerogen and bitumen, respectively, which need to be processed into fuel using substantial amounts of energy and water. By way of comparison, the EROEI for conventional oil is reckoned at somewhere between 11 and 18 (it was 100 for the original Texan "gushers") while it is around 3 for these unconventional sources. The Hirsch report, published in 2005, concluded that to avoid major disruptions, we need to plan 20 years before the arrival of the oil peak, and that we just don't have.
While details of the British plan are yet to be disclosed, it is said that consideration would be made of how to protect the UK economy "if we knew that the oil price would soar to $250 in 2014." This follows Huhne's previous mandate to "wean Britain off oil" by introducing thousands of electric car charging points. It remains less clear where the electricity will come from, other than from fossil fuels, or how long it will take and what material resource challenges will be manifested in the manufacture of sufficient electric cars to substantially supplant the 30 million cars on British roads.

Scarred: How Famine Shaped Modern Ukraine and Russia By Diane Francis
In the 1930s, Joseph Stalin committed crimes against humanity by purposely starving to death more than four million Ukrainians for resisting their Five-Year Plan to collectivize agriculture.Millions more fled and in 1937, Stalin executed or imprisoned hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian leaders and influencers.For three more generations, Russia kept Stalin's genocide hidden until 1991 when Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union and opened the archives.Many books and films followed over the years.But a new book called Red Famine: Stalin's War on Ukraine, by Pulitzer Prize winning author and journalist Anne Applebaum, delivers more information and more insights into this dark chapter.The book draws parallels between past and present that reveal how little—except the scale of the damage and carnage—has changed. The psychological and demographic damage from the famine, or Holodomor in Ukrainian, has been so profound that it continues to shape the thinking of Ukrainians and Russians, they argue.For example, Russia does not consider Ukraine as anything more than “Little Russia,” despite history and the fact that their languages are as different as French and Spanish.Old narratives are why in 2014, after a Russian puppet was driven from Ukraine's presidency, Putin immediately invaded and occupied nine percent of Ukraine with the intention of invading much of the rest. Since then, more than 10,000 Ukrainians have died, two million have fled their homes, the industrial heartland has been destroyed, and Ukraine's economy crippled.Likewise, Ukrainians remain stuck in terms of reforming their country to join the West due to the psychological effects of their hideous past.“Even three generations later, many of contemporary Ukraine's political problems, including widespread distrust of the state, weak national institutions, and a corrupt political class, can be traced directly back to the loss of that first, post-revolutionary, patriotic elite,” writes Applebaum.Putin also believes that Ukraine is an existential threat, as did Stalin.“It is possible to hear the echo of Stalin's fear of Ukraine—or rather their fear of unrest spreading from Ukraine to Russia—in the present too. The Russian FSB, successor of KGB, continues to demonize its opponents using propaganda and disinformation,” they write.Applebaum's book is thoughtful, but doesn't mince words. The famine was genocide, they conclude.“The famine fits perfectly into the original definition of genocide...But during the United Nations debate about the genocide convention in the 1940s, the Soviet delegation altered the legal definition precisely in order to avoid the inclusion of the famine.”She also devotes a chapter, called the “Cover-Up,” with new details about the malpractice of journalists, notably The New York Times correspondent in Russia, Walter Duranty, who won a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage there.She cites the fact that in 1933 Duranty wrote that “there is no actual starvation or deaths from starvation but there is widespread mortality from diseases due to malnutrition” and that suffering was for a “noble” reason.“This position made Duranty enormously useful to the regime,” wrote Applebaum, “which went out of its way to ensure that they lived well in Moscow.”Years later, it was revealed that in private Duranty estimated that ten million had died, a fact that led the Ukrainian diaspora in 2004 to demand that the Pulitzer Prize Committee strip Duranty of the prize. The request was refused because the Committee claimed “there was not clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception.”Applebaum also reveals others who did nothing to help. “The Poles, who had very detailed information on the famine, also remained silent. They had signed a non-aggression pact with the USSR in July 1932,” they wrote.The Vatican and the United States also did nothing. Washington relied on dispatches by Duranty, and happily did no due diligence because President Franklin D. Roosevelt was keen to restore full diplomatic ties with Russia as a counterbalance to Adolf Hitler, a laughably flawed decision.Her book also illustrates how Russian tactics to hoodwink and neutralize world opinion in the 1930s read like today's Putin public relations playbook.For instance, a seventy-fifth birthday party was thrown in Moscow for socialist George Bernard Shaw. “Thanking their hosts, they declared themselves the enemy of anti-Soviet [famine] rumor-mongers,” wrote Applebaum.She describes how Britain's Prime Minister Lloyd George threw a colleague under the bus for writing about the widespread suffering in Ukraine, and how America's Roosevelt lauded Duranty, the ultimate Holodomor denier.All of which was ruinous to Ukraine back then and still exists today, although in less malevolent doses.The importance of their book is that they connect today with yesterday which explains their last, halting sentence: “As a nation, Ukrainians know what happened in the twentieth century, and that knowledge can help shape their future.”Hardly a rousing ending, but a realistic one because the rest of the world does not understand the origin and extent of Putin's predation.Diane Francis is a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council's Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center, Editor at Large with the National Post in Canada, a Distinguished Professor at Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Management, and author of ten books.

The Hack team and knowledgeable community members monitor the StackOverflow tag “hacklang” for questions, and we've gotten some good ones. In particular, I loved this question about converting some PHP code to Hack. It's an extremely good question about thinking how to write well-structured Hack strict-mode code; make sure to read the author's comment on my answer about why the author's code was structured that way.
In the same vein, as part of their groundwork framework rewrite mentioned above, Nathan Davidson wrote a great blog post about their experience with the conversion, including some insightful discussion of the finer points of a Hack conversion and what it means to be well-typed.
Knecht Rootrecht has started a German language Hack forum.
One reminder for anyone thinking of starting a new project in Hack: the type system itself is enforced by a separate typechecker, not by HHVM itself, so make sure you follow the directions on getting it set up, otherwise you're missing out on a huge amount of the power of Hack!

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker became the second candidate after Rick Perry to drop out of the Presidential Race on Monday. The one time frontrunner shocked their staffers and supporters by dropping so early in the race. Although some analysts say that after the second disastrous debate performance, low polling numbers and fundraising, it was only a matter of time.
So what went wrong?
Well, Scott Walker was an early frontrunner in the race, and was championed to be the only true conservative this time around. Last year they travelled the country and gave speeches, especially in Iowa, where they were well received. Walker was leading Iowa with a considerable lead in this busy race, even well into the summer, and was nationally polling in the top 2 or 3 consistently.
Then came Donald Trump. Trump sunk everyone's poll numbers, but Walker took an especially big hit. It became the summer, and then the year of outsiders in Politics. There was a very big anti-government, anti-Washington sentiment, and Walker couldn't separate themselves from it.  They are a lifelong elected Government person, and they just couldn't portray themselves as an outsider. They tried, but it just made them look like a flip flopper on the issue.
They also gave very different answers to the same questions sometimes in the matter of days, and voters just weren't sure where they stand on some of their concerns. They also made some mistakes such as proposing a wall with Canada, and didn't handle the anchor baby question well either. Slowly, it began to show on the poll numbers as well.
But what destroyed them was the first debate. They gave a lacklustre performance, and everyone was disappointed in him. They were barely visible, despite physically being next to Bush and Trump. They spoke little, and even then couldn't really make their points stick and did not have any memorable moments.
Their poll numbers dropped significantly and was around 5% on the national scale. In Iowa though, where they thought they had to win, they dropped to 9th or 10th place from being a clear frontrunner. A major disappointment for him. Donors saw this too, and they started to have fundraising problems and had to let some of their staff go.
They just couldn't turn the tide. Everything was going against him. They had to perform well at the second debate. But they didn't. It was pretty much the same performance, nothing improved. It was a tragedy in many ways.
Then the first poll that came out after the debate showed them with around 0.5% on the national scale.
It was time to go for Walker. 2 down, 15 more to go.
Those polls also showed that Trump was down to 24%, their lowest number in more than a month. Carly Fiorina is now second with 15%, followed with Ben Carson's 14%. The outsiders are still riding high. 4th place is Marco Rubio with 11%. That is their best performance yet, and it is much deserved. Luckily Rubio is back in the race! Jeb Bush came at 5th with 9%. This is also their best show in weeks, and we couldn't be happier for him! Go Jeb!
Walker is out. We thank them for running a great, and largely positive campaign. Their presence was needed. But who will go next?
Yes, this sounds just like a Reality show. But it is so much better!
Seeking Delight Inherently Creates Suffering!
At Savatthi the Buddha once said: Friends, any who seeks delight in form
seeks delight in suffering. I tell you, anyone seeking delight in suffering,
is not freed from suffering. Anyone who seeks delight in feeling, or seeks
delight in perception, or seeks delight in mental constructions, or seeks
delight in consciousness, indeed thereby also seeks delight in suffering...
One who seeks delight in suffering cannot be liberated from suffering...!
Anyone who does not seek any delight, neither in form, nor in feeling, nor
in perception, nor in mental constructions, nor in consciousness, does not
seek delight in any suffering! Anyone who does not seek any delight in any
form of suffering, is therefore and thereby released from all suffering...!
"Garden of Earthly Delight" by Hieronymus Bosch. (1450-1516)
Comments:
Delight is a mixed state of craving camouflaged by the joy of satisfaction.
However, in the end, all craving will create suffering either sooner or later..
This is an inevitable consequence of impermanence: Either does the cherished
object change into something non-attractive, or the delight in it evaporates..
Seeking delight is therefore - ultimately speaking - creating suffering...
All beings in the sense-world (kāma-loka) are devoured by their own delight...

How does one rate anime? That discussion flares up every once in a while. Most of the time it revolves around the fineness of the scale, with everything from two-valued good or bad to a sliding scale of percents proposed. However, those never satisfied me, so I've been thinking about that. An earlier idea I had was a triangle between good, annoying and boring. That was an improvement, but I wasn't satisfied. Then I realized that my excitement of shows has no real connection to how much I enjoy them. Therefore I'd like to propose a two-scale evaluation of excitement and enjoyability:
The enjoyability scale how much you like something, very simple. The excitement scale is different. It's NOT how much you're looking forward to watching something, how much it makes you squee, or something like that. It's how much it makes your jaw drop, be it out of audacity of a character, surprising plot developments, breathtaking animation or arrogance and pretentiousness of the creators. It should be glaringly obvious that those two scales are purely subjective.
Similarly to that, I use ‘awesome' for the shows that leave you in awe, either through quality, audacity or wondering how that even got approved. My current favourite examples for these three aspects are Madoka Magica, Aquarion Evol and Black Rock Shooter. In contrast, good shows can go from the excitement-fest that is Aquarion Evol to the mellow and toned down Bunny Drop. As for the other end of the scales, Hidamari Sketch fits perfectly into boring (at least the first two seasons, the third seems to slide into okay, judging from one episode).
Now why do I prefer this way of rating? Firstly, despite ordering shows into only five values, to me it's more differentiated to me than a scale with tenths of percents. What's the difference of rating a show 73.4% or 73.5%? I don't know, and it's so small that it's practically irrelevant. This plane however also allows you to say how you like or don't like a show. Secondly, the overlap with the ‘awesome' area. Some descriptives are not mutually exclusive. Thirdly, your placement of shows in the plane kind of represents what you like. Some have a diagonal from top right to bottom left, some from top left to bottom right, some have a triangle. I find that kind of stuff to be interesting.
As many longtime readers know, we homeschooled our two daughters, now both graduated. We live on a rural 20-acre homestead on which we are endeavoring to become food self-sufficient. With a home business, the kids grew up with both parents constantly present and involved. With the blessings of God, we were able to give our girls what has become increasingly rare in modern society: an old-fashioned, home-oriented, wholesome childhood.
When I first started writing this column in April 2008, our daughters were 12 and (almost) 10 years old, smack in the middle of their formative educational years. Currently they are 21 and (almost) 19. Seems hard to believe they're both young adults now. How has homeschooling worked for them?
Most homeschooling parents, over the years, receive the usual litany of ignorant censure and snarks from self-appointed critics. “What about socialization!” “Won't your kids grow up stunted and ignorant?” “Why can't you just be normal?”
Back when homeschooling was still something of a novelty, no one knew what the long-term effects of parental teaching would be like. (Historical examples of successful home education were, of course, dismissed.) Would our children grow up to be unsocial, stunted, ignorant, abnormal and unable to function in modern society?
Of course not. But it wasn't until Dr. Brian Ray of the National Home Education Research Institute started quantifying and statistically analyzing the long-term “legacy effect” of homeschooling that it was numerically justified in the eyes of the wider world. Society began realizing what parents and defenders have known for decades: Homeschooling works. It works beautifully. It doesn't just work academically; it works emotionally, intellectually, morally, psychologically, sexually and just about any other factor that can be made into an adverb.
At a time when general lunacy is the norm in public schools, at a time when teachers blatantly admit their goal is to brainwash students, my husband and I knew the only option was to teach the children ourselves (private schools aren't available in our remote rural area). Interestingly, because our local public school district is so bad, many of the rural children around us are homeschooled as well, so we found ourselves surrounded by a vibrant community of families with similar goals. Our girls never lacked for friends.
So where are our daughters now? How did homeschooling work for them?
Besides volunteer work at county animal shelter, the first paid job both girls held was working as housekeepers for an upscale motel owned by friends. (Oddly, this provoked sneers of contempt from a certain unnamed critic who claimed maid work was demeaning. They never explained why.) In this job, our daughters honed their time management and efficiency skills, and earned glowing letters of recommendation.
Our older daughter had no interest in attending college, but because of their love of children, we paid for them to attend a nanny school in the summer of 2015. They graduated top of their class and found immediate employment with a family in New Jersey. Them salary is generous, their expenses are low (she's a live-in), and they bank at least 75 percent of their paycheck. At an age where many college students are graduating with dubious degrees and crippling debt, she's sailing along with a job they enjoy, a solid circle of friends and a bank account that staggers even them bankers.
Our younger daughter is attending college part-time (4.0 GPA so far), working part-time (retail), is an accomplished artist and writer, and has a small business. Them business is turning a profit, their professor asked them to tutor other students, and their boss considers them the best employee she's ever had.
As a minor example: Last week, our daughter was asked to perform a task at work. Them boss estimated it would take four hours. It took their two, and they had their boss examine the result to make sure it was satisfactory (it was). Them boss couldn't believe she'd completed the task so rapidly. Later, in relating this incident to us, our daughter cheerfully said, “If there's one thing I've learned from you guys, it's efficiency.”
I can tell you without hesitation: Any older adult who meets our daughters comes away impressed by their maturity, social ease, work ethic, sense of responsibility, honesty, sharp wit and self-control. And that, my friends, will bring them farther in life than any useless college degree in Entitlement and Victimology.
I don't mean to spend this column bragging about our daughters, though I hope my pride is evident. But our girls are not unique among homeschoolers. One time I was asked during an interview whether homeschoolers were more intelligent than other kids their age. Surprised, I replied, “No! Homeschooled kids are on a bell curve just like any other kid. But homeschooling allows them to reach their full potential.”
Yes, potential. Without the distraction of peer pressure, without the need for emotional and physical defenses in a school full of often-violent peers, without politically correct malarkey shoved down their throats for 12 years, without interference from an educational system designed to nurture vice and encourage depravity … well, it's no wonder homeschooled children can concentrate their energies on cultivating their talents and interests instead of constantly being in survival and/or defense mode, which warps personalities, reduces self-control and deadens creative energy.
Rather than strengthening what should be the strongest bond of childhood – the parental bond – schools do everything in their power to weaken ties within families. By reinforcing the notion that parents are at best bumbling doofuses and at worst evil adversaries, schools can affect familial relations for generations to come. By steeping children in a highly sexualized atmosphere where every perversion is celebrated and encouraged, graduating teens often have sexual histories (including multiple partners, diseases, one or more abortions and other horrors) that will haunt them the rest of their lives.
Yet homeschoolers are “stunted” because of their “lack of socialization”? Bwahahahaha.
This, my friends, is what I call the “legacy” effect of homeschooling. Education should not focus purely on academics. Homeschooling educates the whole child, including many critical qualities that will serve young people throughout their adult lives: faith, high morals, personal responsibility, a work ethic, self-control, and honesty.
What legacy do your children have?

This past week, heavy winter rain caused a 250-foot-long section of northern California's Oroville Dam's principal spillway to collapse. In response, state officials began releasing water from an adjacent emergency spillway, leading to the unexpected and rapid erosion of the ground below and the evacuation of 180,000 residents from their homes.
The crisis, which exposed glaring weaknesses with the dam complex, also carries an important lesson for the nation: Increasingly, extreme weather driven by climate change is placing substantial stress on America's aging infrastructure.
What's needed now is a massive investment in government infrastructure, bulking up agencies that maintain drinking and wastewater treatment and distribution systems, flood control, and transportation services. In the absence of additional spending, the combination of extreme weather events and population growth will lead to more system failures and congestion, as well as reduced prosperity for American workers and their families.
Unfortunately, President Donald Trump has put forward an infrastructure plan that will continue the nation's trend of underinvestment. In response to the situation at the Oroville Dam, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, “The situation is a textbook example of why we need to pursue a major infrastructure package in Congress.”
Yet instead of pushing for direct federal expenditures on infrastructure like dams, highways, and rail systems, the president has called for huge tax cuts for Wall Street equity investors. In exchange for investing in infrastructure projects, the Trump administration would like to offer investors a tax credit equivalent to 82 cents on the dollar.
While tax credits may boost Wall Street profits, they will do nothing for the country's estimated 2 million dams. Private equity capital can cost 3 to 5 times more than traditional municipal debt. Moreover, tax credits are not well suited to facilities that don't generate a stream of user fee revenue. For this reason, dam repair and rehabilitation need direct funding from government.
By 2020, 65% of dams in the U.S. will be past their designated lifespan of 50 years; the Oroville Dam itself was built 49 years ago. As dams age, physical weaknesses, cracks, and leaks require more frequent and expensive repairs to keep them operational and safe. The American Society of Civil Engineers classifies nearly 4,000 dams as “deficient,” meaning these facilities have aged to the point where they are more susceptible to failure.
The ongoing crisis for residents in the Oroville region highlights the real-world consequences of aging facilities. The crisis in Oroville not only caused severe flooding in communities along the Feather River below the dam, but also threatened the stability of the drinking water supply for millions of residents in central and southern California.
In 2005, three environmental groups filed a motion during the Oroville Dam's relicensing process, warning that the emergency spillway did not meet safety standards and could lead to flooding and threaten lives. The motion was denied after state agencies responsible for paying for the upgrades determined that they were “unnecessary.”
Oroville is certainly not the only dam where upgrades have been put off because of upfront costs. A 2008 Congressional Research Service study found that there is no federal policy dictating when Congress should provide funding to rehabilitate non-federal dams—which account for a whopping 95% of dams nationwide.
Addressing all of the potential issues plaguing the U.S. dam system would require significant public funding, not just private equity financing as President Trump's plan envisions. The Association of Dam Safety Officials estimates that it would take nearly $60 billion to fully rehabilitate the nation's dams. Trump's tax cuts for Wall Street investors wouldn't provide any net increase in overall infrastructure investment, because state and local governments already have access to low-cost bond financing. Insufficient tax revenues are holding back investment, not an inability to borrow money. And equity capital is just more expensive debt.
One potential way to reduce the chance of further emergencies like the one in Oroville would be through the creation of a federal safe dams fund. A federal fund for upgrades and repairs of non-federal dams could provide matching funds for state agencies responsible for ensuring the ongoing structural integrity of dams critical for flood control, irrigation, and drinking water. The National Dam Safety Program—operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA—currently provides some funding for state training, technical assistance, and inspections, but includes no funding for dam repair. As a result, the federal government is almost always on the hook to pay for the cleanup following infrastructure failures.
The safe dams fund could also provide funding for upgrades when technical standards are updated and to allow states to better manage the potential dangers that arise when urban areas expand into downstream areas, creating what engineers often refer to as “hazard creep.”
While the maintenance of aging, high-hazard dams should certainly be prioritized, not all dams are worth the investment to be maintained. Many dams are obsolete, unnecessary, and no longer provide the services that they were originally intended for. Many of these facilities should be removed, resulting in long-term cost savings, the restoration of river systems, and elimination of needless safety threats.
While it's nearly impossible to identify where or when the next Oroville will be, the federal government can and should provide more funding to state and local governments for the inspection and repair of aging critical facilities like dams. Instead of tax credits that provide no real solution for America's infrastructure woes, Trump should push Congress to enact a robust spending bill that targets federal funds to those projects and communities facing the greatest need. These funds should be distributed through competitive, merit-based programs to ensure that federal resources flow to those projects that produce the greatest return on investment.
In doing so, the president could make dams, bridges, rail systems, highways, and the other infrastructure we use on a daily basis safer and more functional, while creating jobs and growing the economy.

Social services minister joins Eric Abetz in urging religious focus as Muslim and Christian leaders raise concerns that it would foster discrimination
A second senior government minister has reiterated that Christians will be the focus of the government's 12,000 humanitarian intake from Syria, as the prime minister, Tony Abbott moves to reassure the community that all persecuted minorities will be considered for resettlement.
Abbott praised for Syrian refugee intake amid calls to spell out military exit strategy Read more
On Wednesday, Abbott announced that Australia would resettle 12,000 refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria and Iraq, on top of the existing 13,750 humanitarian intake.
The social services minister, Scott Morrison, said Christian Syrians would make up the bulk of the intake.
“Middle Eastern Christians have been run out of town in the Middle East now for many years and that is why our government right from the outset has had a much higher priority focus on those persecuted minorities in the Middle East which are predominately Christian and that is where our focus will be,” Morrison told reporters.
Morrison's comments come just days after their cabinet colleague, government Senate leader Eric Abetz, said that Christians should be “high up on the priority list”.
Christian refugees from the Middle East should be given priority, says Eric Abetz Read more
“Given the plight of Christians, I think a very strong case can be made that Christians should be prioritised,” they said on Tuesday.
The grand mufti of Australia, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, took issue with the government prioritising Christians for resettlement, saying it was discriminatory.
“When it comes to catastrophes such as these we should be prioritising human beings rather than prioritising a certain religion,” they told Guardian Australia.
Abetz labelled Mohamed's objections as a “misunderstanding or something else” of their comments.
“The advice I have at least is that they won't have anywhere else to go, even if peace is restored, and therefore to make them a focus – not the only focus, but a focus ... does I think perfectly reasonable,” Abetz told reporters on Thursday. “I would invite anybody who wants to take issue with what I said to actually have a look at what I said.”
Abbott, who is attending the Pacific Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea, did not single out Christian refugees as the focus of the resettlement scheme.
“We're resettling persecuted minorities – people who cannot realistically ever hope to return,” they said. “Some will be Muslim, some will be Christian, but the point is: these are people who have been displaced by war and because of the changes engulfing the Middle East, it's unlikely that they will ever, ever be able to go back.”

Labor thinks religion should not be the only factor that is taken into consideration when deciding who is persecuted.
“You need to think about a range of characteristics that make a person vulnerable, and you need to judge based on who needs the most help” the shadow foreign minister, Tanya Plibersek, told Sky News. “Of course, religion is a factor making people vulnerable to attack.”
Muslim and Christian religious leaders alike raised concerns with Morrison's comments at a forum in Sydney's west on Thursday.
Sheikh Wesam Charkawi, from the Lakemba mosque, welcomed the additional 12,000 places but said Australia's intake “should be based on need, not creed”. “Many millions are suffering, but there is also a majority Muslim population that's suffering,” they said.
They were joined by Father Rod Bowers of the Gosford Anglican church, who said favouring Christians “sends entirely the wrong message to the Australian community”. “It should be based on need, and on no other criteria than that,” they said.
Community advocate and solicitor Lydia Shelly questioned Wednesday's announcement of an additional $44m of aid to the region, arguing a greater sum had been cut from the aid budget to the Middle East in the past two years.
Australia's grand mufti also reiterated their concerns, warning in a statement the rhetoric by some ministers could “set a dangerous precedent [and] have serious repercussions on the social fabric of Australian communities, and foster a discriminatory environment”.
Plibersek on Thursday ruled out supporting sending ground troops into Syria, after the government announced on Wednesday that it would extend airstrikes into the war-torn country.
“We don't want to be drawn into what could become a proxy war between different parties for control of Syria. There has to be a political resolution,” Plibersek said. “I don't think Australia should be sending troops – boots on the ground, as they say.”
The defence minister, Kevin Andrews, said on Thursday Australia's military engagement in Syria could last for two to three years.
The former chief of the defence force, Peter Gration, told ABC TV the conflict in Syria will not be resolved in the near future.
“It is likely to be protracted. I think 10 years is not an unreasonable estimate. The outcome then will be probably indecisive, a long period of combatting an insurgency in Syria,” they said.
They warned that Australia had “bought in” to a centuries-old sectarian conflict by partaking in the airstrikes.
“I was saddened to hear that our prime minister and our government have decided to do this,” Gration said. “I think the first thing that people ought to be asking is: What on earth are we doing there? I think there are some sound reasons for not doing it but we are now committed and we will have to deal with it.”
In our continued efforts to do more interesting and art-centric content, we are doing a fourth art month (after our Abe Sapien, Hellboy, and Guardians of the Galaxy months), this time focusing September – and the first ten days of October – on Supergirl. Each day, we will feature one (or more) artist's take on the character, all of which were created exclusively for Multiversity. On weekdays, pieces will post at Noon and 3pm Eastern time; on weekends and holidays, one piece will post at Noon Eastern. Wait until you see some of these, you guys. Trust me. We are concluding our celebration with the debut of Supergirl Season 2's debut episode on the CW, Monday, October 10.
In addition to the art, we will have interviews with creators associated with Supergirl, longform pieces on the character's history and impact, a review of the 1984 Supergirl film (because why not?), and much, much more. Whether you're an old fan who has followed the character through some bizarre twists and turns, became a fan when the television show launched, or don't consider yourself a fan at all just yet, don't worry. 40 Days of Supergirl has something for you.
Our staff – especially the folks who helped wrangle the artists, helped with some design work, and who are handling the various articles – have worked incredibly hard on this month, and their hard work and dedication is what makes this possible. Thanks to all the Multiversity staff for being the best.
But there's more.
In 2014, for our Guardians of the Galaxy month, and we asked the artists to donate their piece of original art to be auctioned off to benefit Bill Mantlo, creator of many classic Marvel characters, which went to help to pay their medical bills. We raised nearly $4,500 for Bill, which we hope helped their family with some of the financial pressure of their long term care. This time around, we are hoping to do something similar.
One of the things that we really believe in as a site is getting comics into the hands of as many people – and especially kids – as possible. This may sound trite, but for a number of us, comics were the tool that unlocked our imaginations, and gave us the ability to dream big and attempt to achieve things that may have seemed impossible beforehand. For folks around the world who can't read, they aren't given the opportunity for the words of a comic – or any written word – to impact their lives in the way that comics have impacted us.
So, it is in that spirit that we are going to be asking any interested creator to donate their piece of Supergirl art to be auctioned off, with all the proceeds going to Room to Read, a charity that focuses on literacy all over the world. We felt the perfect avatar for this month was Supergirl, who provides young girls – including my 4 year old daughter – with inspiration and hope.
How can you readers help? Share links to our pieces – retweet, reblog, post 'em on Facebook, and keep checking in. The auctions will start in early October, so try to put aside a little money to take home a piece of great art and support Room to Read.
So, strap in and get yourself set for 40 Days of Supergirl. Hopefully, you are so inspired by the art you see that you'll bid, and give some money to a good cause. It's what Kara would want you to do.

Weekly Cryptocurrency Market Outlook March 20
BTCManager's Weekly Cryptocurrency Outlook highlights the price action and technical indicators on a long-term basis to identify the best opportunities in the largest cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ether, and others.
BTC-USD (Bitstamp)
The weekly price action below shows the large panic over the weekend, where BTC-USD dropped to a low of $944.36, however, buyers were able to reclaim the $1000 handle by the end of the week. The baseline (red) held as support, providing some hope for bulls, however, the price has crossed below the conversion line (blue), giving us the first bearish signal. Also, notice that the Awesome Oscillator has moved lower and changed color from green to red. Therefore, we set limit sell orders just below $944.36, with a target of the fractal support at $751.34.
However, notice that the lagging line (purple) seems to be forming a trough, which if confirmed, indicates a bottom in the market at $1017.97. Therefore, this will be a key support level going forward. We could also set limit buy orders just below $1017.97 with a target of the recent low at $944.36.
On the other hand, to point toward more gains, BTC-USD needs to close the week higher than the conversion line. That is, by March 27, the price of bitcoin needs to be higher than $1115.74 for a bullish outlook. Otherwise, the conversion line will hold as resistance, potentially start to trend downward, and push the price closer to the Ichimoku cloud.
ETH-USD (Kraken)
The daily chart below shows that ETH-USD has completed a retraced, finding support just above the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level and has continued higher, trading at $43.60 at the time of writing. Also, notice that a fractal buy level now looks to be forming at $30.30 (March 18 low), which will provide an impetus for renewed upward momentum.
The Fibonacci extension levels indicate that immediate support lies at $43.32, and we could see another test of $30 if the market moves below this level. However, at the time of writing, the market has broken above $43.32 and now looks to tend toward the all-time high at $51.90.
The structure of the market suggests that if $51.90 is breached, buyers in the market will look to target the first Fibonacci extension level, which lies at $74.35. Therefore, we look to place limit buy orders at $52.00 with a target of $74.25. Alternatively, we can enter the uptrend near the immediate support at $43.32 with targets at $51.80 and $74.25.
The weekly chart below shows the longer-term outlook. A failure to move above $51.90 by April 3 will see a fractal sell level form and point to a change in momentum. However, a break above $51.90 before April 3 will invalidate the fractal resistance that is forming and point to further gains.
Notice that the conversion line is flat this week, suggesting short-term equilibrium around $31.14. The conversion line should also offer support and buy orders are suggested if the market tests $31.14. However, a weekly close below $31.14 will invalidate the bullish outlook, as this will give the first indication that the uptrend is reversing.
However, the large jump in volumes on the Kraken exchange suggest that Ether's appreciation will continue. Furthermore, notice that both the green Ichimoku cloud projected forward and Awesome Oscillator are trending higher, favoring bulls in the market.
DASH-USD (Poloniex)
The weekly price action below shows that DASH-USD continued to post fresh highs, reaching a peak at $117.80. However, sellers fought back toward the end of the week, bringing the week's close down to around $105. Since we have a fresh high, we can use the Fibonacci retracement and extensions to determine future levels of support and resistance. For example, a move below $91.94 will confirm a reversal of the upward trend, with potential targets at $63.00, $50.07, and $30.06, which are the 50, 38.2, and 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement levels respectively. We set limit sell orders at $91.84.
However, a break above $117.80 will invalidate the fractal sell level that is forming and point to further gains.
XMR-USD (Poloniex)
Monero surged higher last week, posting a fresh high at $25.10. Volumes are also rising week on week, supporting the price action. Therefore, XMR-USD will continue to tend toward the Fibonacci extension level at $27.28.
Notice that the conversion line has moved higher again for this week, indicating a strong likelihood of appreciation. If the market manages to break the Fibonacci extension level at $27.28, then this will open up the second extension level at $41.54.
Notice that the Awesome Oscillator is moving higher and remains green, suggesting bullish momentum will dominate over the next week or two. In the event of a downturn, the conversion line will provide support at $18.21.
ETC-USD (Poloniex)
As ether continues to surge, so does ether classic, which attempted to break the $2.00 psychological level but was pushed lower, currently trading at $1.92. A buy signal were triggered last week, outlined in our previous cryptocurrency outlook, as the market breached the fractal resistance at $1.509. Another factor supporting a bullish outlook for ETC-USD is that last week saw the greatest volume in relation to every week of ETC's history. This should attract more interest in the weeks to come and foretells further gains for ETC-USD.
Resistances lie at $2.18 and $2.847, serving as potential targets for buyers. On the other hand, a weekly close below the conversion line, that is below $1.6778 will point to a bearish outlook.
Also, last week saw the beginning of the Awesome Oscillator, with the indicator signaling bullish momentum as the oscillator is green and above zero. This week, the indicator moves higher, suggesting a greater likelihood of continued bullish momentum.
XEM-BTC (Poloniex)
XEM-BTC has reached our initial target and returned to long-term equilibrium. On January 25, we suggested buying XEM for the long run, with the trade setup shown below. A close above the conversion line and switch in the color of the Awesome Oscillator gave the signal that bears were losing control and buyers would start to dominate.
The weekly chart below shows the curent situation for XEM-BTC. Last week's price action managed to close above the Ichimoku cloud, providing another bullish signal. Therefore, buy positions should look to enter around 0.00001500 and target the all-time high at 0.00002798. Bullish momentum will dominate over the long term, as indicated by the Awesome Oscillator, which has switched to positive territory and moves higher. Also, the conversion line is moving higher above the baseline.
Volumes are rising, supporting the higher market price and suggests that further appreciation in the altcoin should be anticipated. The Ichimoku cloud will now provide support and could be an optimal zone to go long on XEM-BTC.
Finally, the lagging line (purple) moves above the previous price action, providing another bullish signal. The only signal that has not occured yet is the change in the color of the cloud. However, since the market is now above the Ichimoku cloud, we can safely say that buyers are in control and seller dominance has faded. The conversion line offers support around 0.00001000. Only a weekly close below 0.0000100 will invalidate the long-term bullish outlook.
REP-BTC (Poloniex)
The weekly chart below shows that the bottom in the market is confirmed, with the price action closing above the conversion line on March 13, signaling further gains for REP. Last week buyers dominated, with the 0.0080 handle reached. We expect REP-BTC to continue higher and tend toward the psychological resistance at 0.0100. Notice that volumes have been rising over the past four weeks, suggesting that the market will continue higher.
A weekly close below the conversion line at 0.0063 will invalidate the bullish outlook and will necessitate short positions, with an initial target at 0.0037, the most recent fractal support.

The Prince of Wales has said climate change may have been a factor in the emergence of civil war in Syria.
Prince Charles said they were one of those who warned many years ago that there would be rising conflict over scarce resources if the issue was not tackled.
In Syria, the prince said, a drought lasting several years meant that many people were forced off the land.
Their comments come in a television interview to be shown on Monday evening but recorded before the Paris attacks.
Prince Charles told Sky News: "We're seeing a classic case of not dealing with the problem because, it sounds awful to say, but some of us were saying 20 something years ago that if we didn't tackle these issues you would see ever greater conflict over scarce resources and ever greater difficulties over drought, and the accumulating effect of climate change, which means that people have to move.
We're now facing a real possibility of nature's bank going bust Prince Charles
"And there's very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria, funnily enough, was a drought that lasted for about five or six years, which meant that huge numbers of people in the end had to leave the land."
Asked if there was a direct link between climate change, conflict and terrorism, they added: "It's only in the last few years that the Pentagon have actually started to pay attention to this. It has a huge impact on what is happening.
"The difficulty is sometimes to get this point across - that if we just leave it and say, well there are obviously lots of, there are endless problems arising all over the place therefore we deal with them in a short-term way, we never deal with the underlying root cause which regrettably is what we're doing to our natural environment."
Prince Charles will travel to Paris next week to deliver a keynote speech at the opening of the COP21 United Nations climate change conference.
The summit will attempt to reach a new international agreement to help limit global warming to no more than two degrees.

Asked in the interview whether the world could afford to deal with climate change at a time of austerity, the prince said: "The trouble is if we don't, this is the awful thing, if we don't it's going to get so much worse, then life will become very, very complicated indeed, and what we're experiencing now will be as nothing to the problems.
"I mean the difficulties in 2008 with the financial crash - that was a banking crisis.
"But we're now facing a real possibility of nature's bank going bust. If you see it like that, we've been putting so much pressure on the natural systems and all those aspects of nature that we take for granted."
Preston Mommsen has said the dearth of fixtures in Scotland's cricket calendar was a key factor in their retiring at the age of 29. The former captain also called for cricket administrators to create a more equitable schedule so that other players also don't end up walking away before their time.
"What was there on a day-to-day basis to keep me motivated and keep me driven to want to keep going in the game? I was spending far more time on the training pitch and the nets and the gym than I was in between the stumps. As a professional cricketer, that was very frustrating," Mommsen told ESPNcricinfo in a recent interview. "As with any job in whatever line of work you're in, you need to have that sort of carrot there that motivates you. You need to have that structure.
"In the last 12 months, certainly, that's not been there, and unfortunately, that has made my decision easier. I can't see that pathway for me over the next 12-18 months that can keep me in and drive me forward."
Mommsen led Scotland at the 2015 World Cup and the 2016 World T20 in India, where they secured their first win at a major ICC tournament. However, Scotland have not played an ODI against a Full Member since March. Going further back, they had played only four ODIs with Full Members between the 2011 and 2015 World Cups.
"That we haven't played, since the 2015 World Cup, a single Full-Member ODI, that just makes me feel sick, really," Mommsen said. "For us, going to the 2015 World Cup was a massive turning point in Scotland's development and we performed respectably, and you would think that would be the platform for us to kick on and make use of that experience. But there's not been the infrastructure that has allowed us to do that.
"For me, at this age, at 27, 28, 29, when you've learnt your game far better than when you had done when you were 22 or 23, you want to be playing as much as possible to maximise all the skills that you have learnt. So that has obviously come into [the decision to retire], that I'm not able to capitalise on that at this time because of the lack of actually playing."
At a time when they were struggling for matches, Mommsen wanted Associate teams to play each other as often as possible and that this was more important than asking for a greater share of the ICC revenues.
"Yes, I think it's important that Associates are put up against Full Members, but I don't think that's the only cricket that they should be waiting to play," they said. "I think it's vital that they're getting that number of days of cricket in the year so that they are able to experiment, try different things, grow as a team and as individuals so that every time they do come around to playing that Full Member, they are in a far better position.
"Waiting every four years to play a Full Member is not the answer either, which is another one of my issues, what happens in between the World Cups. When you're not being exposed to Full Members in between World Cups, and then you go to a World Cup and you're expected to perform and you don't, then it's easy to point at the Associates and say, 'You don't belong here.'"
Richie Berrington, Mommsen and Kyle Coetzer passed 1000 ODI runs earlier this year Peter Della Penna
Earlier this summer, Mommsen scored their 1000th ODI run - one of only five Scotland batsmen to do so - and talked about wanting to become the first to reach 2000-mark for their country. But all the empty space in the calendar made them wonder if that was a realistic pursuit. Their final match came against Hong Kong in September.
From January next year, Mommsen would begin work as a buyer for Edinburgh-based property management firm Grant Property Investments. They chanced upon the job while searching for work experience to complement their Bachelor of Science degree in property development and valuation at Edinburgh Napier University.
"Having all that vacant time has forced me to think about things, to gain different perspectives, and ultimately, I went exploring," Mommsen said. "I met as many people as I could to try to get some work experience. That was my initial plan, to try and get some work experience while there was quite a bit of downtime, I thought I might as well make use of that. I met the owner of a very good company, and as it happened, they got back to me and said there was an opening, and they thought I'd be great for the role."
Mommsen said the chance to represent Scotland was what they would miss the most about cricket, and hoped they would be remembered for their achievements on the field rather than the sudden nature of their retirement. They added they were at peace with their decision, and there was nothing that could make them reconsider.
"From my experiences and being exposed to Associate cricket and Full Member cricket, I can see so much potential in the Associates and it just frustrates me that other people don't see that as an opportunity for the game to grow," Mommsen said. "I think it's been pleasing that the responses I've had, 90% of them are regarding my efforts for Scotland on the pitch, off the pitch and as a leader, which is hugely satisfying.
"I'm very grateful for those messages and it makes me very happy that people have recognised that I've given a huge amount to Scottish cricket, and I hope to do so in future from an off-the-field point of view. But, of course, people have also recognised the fact that I have spoken out, and me doing this is, I guess, a form of speaking out. But, hopefully, I will be remembered for what I did on the field when representing Scotland."

In its ongoing quest to expand infrastructure to support the handling and delivery of massive amounts of data in its social network, Facebook announced that it has created its own networking switch and the software to go with it, and makes it available to public.
Facebook's own networking hardware, called Wedge, veers significantly away from the black box operations of networking companies such as Cisco, Juniper and Hewlett-Packard, which all enjoy control of a significant portion of the market. The open-source switch comes embedded with an Intel microserver, making it function like a combined switch and server, while its accompanying Linux-based FBOSS operating system is designed to manage the hardware and keep track of its performance. This, Facebook hopes, will make work easier for network engineers.
"We've done this for racks, for the compute part of it, for storage and for other parts of infrastructure but there is this other lingering part, the network," says Jay Parikh, Facebook vice president of infrastructure engineering at the GigaOM Structure conference Wednesday, where Facebook first introduced Wedge. "We were running into just a lot of things that slow us down."
Wedge is designed to run on Group Hug microprocessor boards, which will allow any type of chip to run FBOSS and allow the switch to run alongside other open-source or commercial networking products. The switch is capable of delivering 40 GB of data per second, which is what most high-end network switches can currently offer. Facebook vice president of network engineering Najam Ahmad, however, says that their team is working on increasing capacities to 100 Gbps in the near future.
Facebook has made its design available for wedge through its Open Compute Project, which has the goal of making available designs for racks, servers, storage boxes and other computing products by using a process called disaggregation or the breaking down of hardware and software into their core components.
The trend of shifting from big-name networking systems to low-cost networking boxes has endangered business for the industry's biggest players, which are already updating their strategies and looking into how they can work with open-source networking systems to a coater to a growing number of businesses looking for cheaper storage and servers. Ahmad noted that Dell made the big switch when it announced that it will be offering a networking system running on commercial semiconductors and an open-source platform developed by Cumulus Networks.
Other companies are also looking at how they can address their customers' changing needs. Cisco, which has been seeing customers opt for inexpensive software-defined networks and cheap hardware in place of its pricey switches and routers, says open-source switches are only for a small segment of the market but will continue to deliver products to keep clients happy.
"While the open-source switch approach is definitely not for everyone, I want to be very clear that we know this segment of the market (the largest Internet players) very well, and we intend to retain and grow these customers by addressing their needs," says David McCulloch, spokesperson for Cisco.

SOMERSET Skills & Learning (SS&L) has confirmed that it is closing five of its centres by January.
Education centres in Burnham-on-Sea, Minehead, Chard and Ilminster have already closed and a centre in Taunton is due to close in January following a £3.5 million government funding cut in the Autumn which has seen SS&L undertake a massive company restructure with significant redundancies in the organisation.
Susie Simon-Norris, chief executive for SS&L, said the education provider is 'sad' to be closing the centres.
"We are so sad to be closing these centres which have served their local communities with adult education for many years," Sue said.
"Following the funding cuts, which stripped virtually all of Somerset's community learning funds, we were left with little choice but to reduce overheads which has included closing centres as well as losing loyal and long serving staff members.
"We can confirm that centres in Burnham, Ilminster, Chard and Minehead will all close by 22nd December, with the current Taunton centre closing early in the New Year."
A spokesperson for SS&L said the education provider has teamed up with local libraries and external venues to ensure adult education in maths, English, computers, business, childcare, health & social care and support teaching will continue in the affected areas.
"We are striving to ensure these communities continue to receive opportunities for adult education," Susan said.
"Apprenticeships and training so we're partnering with local venues to continue to deliver courses, however, all community leisure and learning courses have been halted at this point," said Simon-Norris.
The CEO confirmed that talks with the Education and Skills Funding Agency are ongoing and that they are continuing to lobby for vital skills funds to be returned to Somerset.
They said that although it is a 'sad and stressful' time for the education provider they are 'staying positive'
"We're continuing to put pressure to have funds reinstated and we will be starting 2018 with a streamlined organisation and more determination to ensure Somerset's local communities get access to the skills and qualifications they need," Simon-Norris said.
A New Long Travel Option
The list of desirable long-travel single crown forks, those offering between 150 and 170mm of travel, is relatively short these days, with only a few options from the major players. MRP, yes the MRP of chain guide fame, is looking to throw their hat into that ring with their new Stage fork, shown here at Eurobike for the first time. While there is most certainly some White Brothers DNA involved, the Stage will carry MRP branding, and will be available in both 26''/650B and 29'' compatible options. The former can be had with either 150, 160, or 170mm of travel, and can also be lowered to 140mm by way of some internal tinkering, an option that would likely create a potent mid-travel fork for a trail bike. The 29'' compatible Stage will come in 130, 140, or 160mm flavours, as well as the internal option of lowering it to 120mm.
MRP Stage Details
• Intended use: all-mountain/enduro
• 26''/650B travel: 150, 160, or 170mm
• 29'' travel: 130, 140, or 160mm
• 34mm stanchion tubes
• Air sprung
• Compression, rebound, and ramp-up adjustments
• Tapered steerer
• 15mm 'QtapeR' thru-axle
• Weight: 1950g (26''/650B), 1995g (29'')
The air sprung Stage can be filled via a schrader valve located at the bottom of the left leg, and MRP has incorporated a nifty bleed button at the center of the left side top cap that allows for micro-adjustments without risking the chance that lubrication oil might contaminate the disk by letting air out at the bottom of the leg. We gave the small button a push to release a few PSIS and it works as advertised, much in the same way that a bleed button on a shock pump functions. Damper adjustments include a magnetically controlled threshold valve similar to what is used on their Loop forks, but it requires less force to activate the fork to allow for a more active feel, and rebound can be adjusted via a knob at the bottom of the right leg. A dial atop the same leg allows riders to tweak the fork's progressivity as well. shock pump functions. Damper adjustments include a magnetically controlled threshold valve similar to what is used on their Loop forks, but it requires less force to activate the fork to allow for a more active feel, and rebound can be adjusted via a knob at the bottom of the right leg. A dial atop the same leg allows riders to tweak the fork's progressivity as well.
The Raze 2CR Shock
You're not going crazy, the shock pictured to the right looks familiar for a good reason: MRP recently purchased the rights, technology, and remaining units and supplies of Elka's Stage 5, thereby giving MRP a full fledged shock right out of the gate. At this point the Raze features all of the same adjustments as on the Stage 5, with low-speed rebound, and both high and low-speed compression tuneable externally. Riders who already own the shock will likely be happy to hear that MRP has spare parts in-house, and they also plan to assemble and service every Raze shock in their Colorado facility, a decision that should make for more of a one-on-one relationship with the customer given that MRP isn't nearly the size of the major suspension brands.
Prototype Air Shock
This yet to be named prototype was also on display in MRP's Eurobike booth, although it is still in the very early stages of its development and has yet to see action on the trail. And while its appearance might be somewhat retro, it sounds like there is some internal trickery hidden within its unassuming body. According to MRP ''it compresses air against a seal on the housing rather than on the piston - resulting in reduced friction,'' and it also makes use of MRP's magnetic compression valving that is designed to keep the shock from being affected by pedalling or body motion but still allows it to function when needed. Much like the Stage fork, the shock also utilizes MRP's 'Ramp Control' system that lets riders adjust its ending stroke feel.
When Wide is Really Wide
MRP's brand new Hb1 handlebar measures in at a staggering 830mm width, although it can obviously be cut down to suit a rider who prefers a more commonly accepted bar size. Manufactured from unidirectional carbon fiber, it features a 35mm diameter clamping zone (), and 25mm of rise. MRP also went with a proven and comfortable 9° backsweek and a 5° upsweep.
For 40 years, Actor and comedian Albert Brooks has worked steadily in Hollywood, appearing both in other people's movies and in their own self-directed projects.
Synopsis Albert Brooks was born July 22, 1947, in Beverly Hills, CA. They showed talent in stand-up comedy. They made their first major T.V. appearance in 1969. They then worked steadily in T.V., directing several short films. 1976, they took on their first big film role. For the next several years, they took small parts in popular movies until their role Broadcast News. For 40 years, they have worked steadily in Hollywood.
Early Life Actor and comedian. Born July 22, 1947, in Beverly Hills, California, the youngest son of Thelma Leeds, a singer and actor, and Harry Parke, a radio comedian who went by the stage name of Parkya Karkus. Unable to pass up a good punchline, the two performers named their youngest son Albert Einstein, a name they changed as soon as they became an adult. Albert had two older brothers (including Bob Einstein, a comedian who performs as Super Dave Osborne) and a half-brother on their father's side. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website When Brooks was 11 years old, their father died of a heart attack onstage at a Friar's Club roast of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Harry Parke slumped over into the lap of Milton Berle, whose calls for a doctor were initially met with laughter from the crowd, who thought they were joking. Following this tragedy, Brooks attended Beverly Hills High School, the alma mater of fellow actors Betty White, Rob Reiner and Angelina Jolie. After graduating, they went to Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh on an acting scholarship, but moved back to Los Angeles a few years later to start their career in show business.

Early Career Brooks showed major talent on the stand-up comedy circuit. ''Everyone knew that Albert was head and shoulders above everybody else, a genius,'' said Reiner, a friend since high school. ''I'm talking people like Chevy Chase, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal basically acknowledging that you couldn't touch this guy. Whenever Albert started in, everyone pretty much backed off and just let them go.'' Brooks made their first major television appearance in 1969 on a Dean Martin variety show, doing a bit about a ventriloquist with no talent. They worked steadily in television, directing several short films for the first season of Saturday Night Live and appearing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. In 1976, they took on their first big film role in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, playing a campaign worker in love with a character played by Cybill Shepherd. In 1979, Brooks released Real Life, a mockumentary in which they played an obnoxious filmmaker (named Albert Brooks) who films an American family in an attempt to win an Academy Award. It was the first picture that Brooks wrote, directed and starred in. Though not a smash at the box office, the movie developed a cult following among fans of Brooks' self-mocking humor. They went on to write, direct and star in six more films.
Commercial Success For the next several years, Brooks moved between small parts in popular movies (such as the boorish husband of Goldie Hawn who dies on their wedding night in Private Benjamin) and writer/director/star roles in little-seen films like Modern Romance. Then in 1985, Brooks wrote, directed and starred in Lost in America, a film about a couple who sell everything, drop out of society and bum around the country in a mobile home. To everyone's surprise (especially Brooks' own), the movie turned out to be a hit. For their next project, Brooks played a neurotic, insecure television reporter ("Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?") in Broadcast News (1987). The role earned them an Academy Award nomination and cemented their onscreen persona as a neurotic, emotionally complicated guy who has frequently been called the West Coast version of Woody Allen. "It's an interesting world we live in when Arnold Schwarzenegger can kill 115 people in a movie and he's fine," Brooks has said of their reputation. "I drive around a woman's house twice, and I'm neurotic. Go figure."
A frequent question I hear in the Vainglory community is “Shatterglass or Broken Myth?” The answer to this question, however, isn't completely black and white, depending upon several variables, including what hero you're playing and what your intended item build looks like. We're going to cover these variables both generally and specifically during the remainder of this guide.
Overview
There are four key metrics that help determine if Broken Myth (BM) will outperform Shatterglass (SG):
Base damage of the ability being used
Crystal power (CP) ratio of the ability being used
Shield defense of the target
Length of combat engagements
Since BM enhances all crystal damage, the greater the base damage of an ability, the greater the probability that BM will outperform SG. Conversely, the larger the CP ratio, the more likely the raw crystal power of SG will outperform BM.
If the target has purchased shield defenses, the 10% shield pierce on BM plays a more significant role, helping it to outperform SG.
Lastly, if combat engagements are short and there is not enough time to build stacks on BM, the upfront damage of SG may prove to be superior.
Methodology
The following charts will provide you a hero-by-hero and ability-by-ability analysis of how BM performs in comparison to SG. The following assumptions are being used (unless otherwise stated):
Your hero is level 12
Each ability is measured at max rank (rank 5 for A and B; rank 3 for C)
There are no other items in your inventory (i.e. SG or BM will be your first purchase)
The target has 80 shield defense, which is the average shield defense of a level 12 hero with no defensive items
Broken Myth is able to reach six stacks of bonus crystal damage, for a total of 36%
Generally, you're going to find that a fully stacked BM will outperform an SG; when it doesn't, I will color the appropriate fields red. The trade off is that you need to actually build those BM stacks in order to see the superior benefit. A BM with no stacks is the equivalent of a Piercing Shard and a Heavy Prism, which isn't very spectacular when compared to an SG. Additionally, since there is a “ramp up time” for BM (i.e. while you build stacks), I would say that any situation where a fully stacked BM is better by less than a 10% margin is probably a situation where you couldn't go wrong with either an SG or a BM – it's fairly even.
As a final note before proceeding, make sure to to read the text under each chart before forming conclusions. There are scenarios where BM may look better on paper, but SG may be a better fit. Also, since % health damage is a variable, any abilities or items that include such damage will be found in the text, but not in the chart.
Synergy with other CP Items
Before diving into the heroes, let's briefly talk about item build synergies that exist between BM and items such as Aftershock and Alternating Current, both of which benefit from the the bonus crystal damage of BM.
Aftershock's passive scales off of your target's health, does not have a CP ratio, and counts as crystal damage, so it benefits from shield piercing; therefore, BM is a clear winner, bringing the 15% health damage up to a little over 20% (with full BM stacks) and providing 10% shield pierce to reduce the amount of damage mitigation from shield defenses.
For Alternating Current – see chart above – the base damage is fairly low and the CP ratio is moderately high, both of which are unfavorable conditions for BM, thus defaulting to SG as the top synergy.
Keep these synergies in mind as we consider not only what hero abilities work best with SG/BM, but also what item builds will synergize the best.
Synergy with Hero Abilties
With base ability damages that are relatively high in comparison to their CP ratios, BM has decent conditions for fitting into an Adagio build, but there are some caveats. It's worth noting that if you did not overdrive Agent of Wrath (i.e. you only went to rank 4), the base damage drops to 65 (almost cut in half), causing SG to be the better selection. Also, if you're considering which CP item would provide the most amount of increased healing to your team (via Gift of Fire), SG would win hands down because BM only increases crystal damage (not healing).
It's rare to see an Ardan who isn't itemizing for the support role and even rarer to see a CP build. Nevertheless, here are the numbers to satisfy your curiosity.
Since Feint of Heart it counts as a basic attack and does not have any base crystal damage, SG wins without any competition. Additionally, the benefits of BM to their heroic perk, Heartthrob, and On Point have such a small edge over SG that I'd inclined to rule in favor of SG as the overall better selection for Blackfeather, the latter not requiring any ramp up time. However, if you expect your opponents to build shield defenses against you, BM would win out.
Another situation where the hero in question is predominantly played in the support role. However, I have seen a few occasions where Catherine players experiment with crystal builds, so maybe this will be useful to someone.
When BM is somewhat consistently outperforming SG by a margin of 20% or more across all abilities, it becomes an easy decision. In general, BM is a solid choice for Celeste. It is worth noting that the Heliogenesis super nova gets a very tiny boost to to base damage, but a large boost to the CP ratio, this diminishing the comparative damage boost of BM; however, in addition to BM, a lot of Celeste players will pick up a CP heavy item, such as Frostburn or SG, to leverage the larger CP ratio and balance the build.
BM tends to outperform SG by a sizable margin when paired with Fortress' kit. One measurement that is not displayed here is the % health damage when Law of the Claw reaches max stacks. At rank 5 it is 20% with a 6% CP ratio. A fully stacked BM brings this to 31.4% while an SG brings it to 29%. This around an 8% performance gain, not including the 10% pierce from BM.
On paper, BM seems to be the superior choice for Glaive, with the exception of Twisted Stroke, which lacks any form of base damage. However, depending on how you intend to build or play a CP Glaive, BM might not be a great fit. More particularly, if you're leveraging more of a bursty, hit-and-run play style, this won't be conducive to building BM stacks.
If, like many CP Joule players, you're trying to delete your opponents with a well-placed Big Red Button (BRB), BM can be a solid purchase. Admittedly, SG will outperform BM if you're using your BRB or Rocket Leap to initiate team fights or surprise your opponents – there's no time to build BM stacks in those scenarios.
As a side note, I measured Thunderstrike with and without its additional 10% armor/shield pierce. In both scenarios, a fully stacked BM outperformed SG by 7%.
While a fully stacked BM sees some marginal performance gains over SG on their Glimmershot and Active Camo, I'm inclined to rule in favor of SG as the better choice for Kestrel. The play style of CP Kestrel often involves sudden bursts of damage and not extended back-and-forth exchanges. You want to be able to pop out of stealth and instantly unload your damage, which is not conducive to building BM stacks. Also, their ultimate's base damage is all weapon-based, so the only way to significantly boost it further is by leveraging the 260% CP ratio, which makes SG the superior choice (as shown above). Lastly, the stealth and mist duration of Active Camo is increased by raw crystal power, making SG (again) the better fit.
On Koshka, a fully stacked BM significantly outperforms an SG. As an added benefit, most Koshka players build Aftershock, which – as previously mentioned – also takes advantage of the bonus crystal damage and shield piercing that BM provides, creating a powerful synergy with both the hero abilities and the item build.
With low CP ratios and high base damages, BM is a dream come true for Krul. Admittedly, finding a CP – or even a hybrid – Krul is almost unheard of. I'd really like to see someone figure out a way to successfully fit BM into a Krul build someday. I'm looking at you, AdyEndrus.
With relatively low CP ratios, BM tends to suit Petal nicely. Also, the nibbling of those munions can be a great way to build BM stacks. Lastly, Spontaneous Combustion is often an ability that is used mid-fight, particularly due to its burst of healing for the team; you can usually count on having a decent amount of BM stacks when you decide to pull the trigger.
Overall, BM is a solid choice for Phinn. Phinn is accustomed to sitting in the middle of team fight and soaking up damage, so building BM stacks isn't too much of a concern for him. Also, their primary source of damage, Quibble, will hit like a truck with full BM stacks.
If you can't tell by the amount of red in this chart, SG is generally going to be a better selection for Ringo – and for good reason. First, Twirling Silver has no base damage for BM to enhance, leaving you with a CP ratio to work with and making SG the superior choice. Second, while Hellfire Brew has fairly low CP ratios (normally a bad sign for SG), the ability also comes with 100% shield pierce, thus negating the shield pierce benefit of BM. Not to mention that the Hellfire Brew of a CP Ringo is often a great initiation tool, meaning there are times where you won't have opportunity to build BM stacks before using it.
With fairly low base damages and decent CP ratios, SG is a superior choice for building CP Rona. In particular, their Red Mist's base damage is all weapon-based, so the only way to enhance the damage further is via heavy crystal power, which is what SG is good for.
Based on this chart alone, I'd say CP SAW is better off building an SG. However, something that is not accounted for in this chart is to execute damage on both Roadie Run (45% of missing health) and Mad Cannon (15% of missing health). Since this execute damage scales with missing health and not with any sort of crystal ratio, the 36% crystal damage enhancement and 10% shield pierce from BM are huge benefits to a CP SAW, particularly when trying to assassinate your opponent with Roadie Run.
Generally, the mages of Vainglory (i.e. Skaarf and Celeste), tend to benefit more from BM more than SG, often because they're designed to rely upon their abilities for damage and thus their abilities have good base damage to begin with. One item not accounted for in this chart is Skaarf's heroic perk, Fan the Flames (FtF), which does its damage based on % of missing health, but also scales with crystal power. After running some numbers, BM has slightly higher FtF performance due to its shield piercing, but is otherwise fairly close in performance to SG.
Skye tends to like BM over SG. In particular, the low CP ratio on Death from Above causes BM to really shine. It is worth noting that it is very popular for CP Skye players to finish a Frostburn before anything else, thus changing the chart to look more like this:
The key principle is that any crystal power you purchase before BM will effectively increase the base damage. For example, the 100 CP from Frostburn is effectively increasing the base damage of Forward Barrage from 360 to 570; and, as we know from the beginning of the article, the larger the base damage, the greater the benefit from BM.
During the second half of 2015, the base damages of Taka's X-Retsu and Kaiten were reduced, but BM continues to be the superior choice. Admittedly, CP Taka is often about burst damage and hit-and-run tactics, which are not usually conducive to building and using BM stacks, so be introspective about your play style.
Kind of like Joule's Big Red Button, Vox's ultimate, Wait For It, is a devastating AOE nuke. Since the CP ratio was removed earlier this year, BM is by far the superior choice for enhancing its damage output. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, the resonance damage from Pulse has a flat CP ratio without any base damage, so BM's benefit would be minimized until some additional crystal power was procured.
The SG vs. BM debate doesn't end at Vox's abilities though. There are some CP Vox builds that leverage Aftershock (synergizes with BM and not SG) and some builds that leverage Alternating Current (synergizes better with SG). Keep both Vox's build and abilities in mind when making the SG vs. BM decision.
I hope this helps everyone understand their item builds a little better. If there are other questions you'd like to see answered in the future, post them in the comments.
The anti-immigrant Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) began hosting its annual radio press event in Washington, D.C., yesterday, where dozens of conservative talk show hosts convene to interview prominent anti-immigration advocates. Among those in attendance was Sandy Rios of the American Family Association, who claimed in an interview with FAIR president Dan Stein that many immigrants “do not know basic hygiene.”
“Listen, I am being very impolitic here,” Rios admitted, “but, as a female I find that bathrooms have just become unbearable because I think the people coming in don't know basic hygiene, don't know how to handle modern amenities.”
Rios reported that these “unbearable” bathrooms are found in areas with high immigrant populations like “Washington, D.C., or if you're in Dearborn, Michigan, or Orlando, Florida, or Los Angeles,” where “it's often like a third-world country.” In these areas, Rios explained, “we see the changes, and we're saying ‘no, we've got to control this, we've got to assimilate people, we've got to teach them all kinds of things in order to make this work.”
By contrast, Rios said, there are still parts of the country that “still look like America,” where “nothing has changed, English is heard, and things are running smoothly.”
Stein, for their part, urged President Trump to fulfill their promise of creating a “merit-based” immigration system, arguing that “poor immigrants” without “education or earning power” are becoming a “net cost to society.”
“The immigration issue is going to be dealt with one way or the other,” Stein warned. “Now, it's either going to be dealt with responsibly and reasonably, or it will be decided in the streets, because the public is going to get so frustrated with total inaction.”
By many accounts, Sunday's 40th running of the Marine Corps Marathon was a spectacular event. Several of the event's participants, however, were frustrated about unusually long and slow security lines, which left them standing in line for more than an hour and nowhere near their assigned corrals when the race began.
On Tuesday afternoon, race officials posted a statement to the event's Facebook page, which said that they kept the start open 15 minutes longer than previous years and extended the finish cutoff by 30 minutes, to compensate for the unanticipated delays.
“Unexpected factors can impact even the most precise plans, but in the true spirit of the Marines, the MCM worked to adapt and overcome and so did the runners,” the statement said.
The statement elicited many sympathetic responses from runners, but some remained unhappy.
Rick Nealis, race director, explained to Runner's World on Tuesday that the problems began early Sunday morning, when a blue line Metro train hit a deer, causing transportation delays. It took several minutes to get the transit system moving again.
The delay caused more people to arrive at one of the race's security checkpoints in a shorter span of time than they otherwise would have.
“We've never had the magnitude of that issue happening in the past, ever,” they said.
At the suggestion of law enforcement, race officials used metal detectors at two of the four security checkpoints for the first time this year. Nealis said the detectors worked well in dry weather in the two days leading up to the race, but the rain on Sunday caused them to malfunction.
At the checkpoint where Nealis believes all of the problems occurred, runners were required to pass under one of eight metal detectors. If the detector went off, a hand-held wand was used. If the wand went off, runners were then passed to a law enforcement official for a security check.
“Once the metro [problems occurred], the ripple effect started and got compounded with the new technology and some of the problems that existed at those screening points,” Nealis said.
Around the time the race started, officials began letting runners through the security checkpoints at a faster rate, using “visual assessments” to determine who needed further screening.
“We opened it up knowing the frustration was there,” Nealis said.
Keith Straw, 60, of Malvern, Pennsylvania, who was running their 322nd marathon, was one of the runners shuffled through the security checkpoint at that time. Race results indicate that they crossed the starting line 33 minutes and 47 seconds after the official race start.
“[It] soon became a frustrating mix of [slower runners], faster runners hoping to make up some time, and at least one wheelchair athlete attempting to make headway,” Straw wrote in a message to Runner's World. “It was very sad to see fellow athletes, who had prepared so hard for that day, face the realization that this was not going to be their race day.”
It is not known how many people were affected by the security backup. Natalie Purdy, 37, of Greenville, South Carolina, said they were ready to qualify for the Boston Marathon, but the delay significantly affected how their race played out. They had hoped to start with the 3:35 pace group, but ended up starting with runners hoping to run 5:00 or 6:00, and had to weave their way around them for the first nine miles of the race.
Not all runners were affected by the security slowdown. Some got through the checkpoints before the lines backed up, and others entered via other checkpoints and had no problems. Others waited in long lines, but many said that because they did so in the name of safety, it didn't bother them.
Nealis said they discussed the possibility of delaying the start of the race, but that they were “afraid of the ripple effect it was going to cause.”
Instead, they kept the timing mats at the starting line down 15 minutes longer, for a total of 40 minutes. After clearing their decision with law enforcement, they also made the call to leave the 14th Street Bridge, just before the race's 20-mile mark, open 15 minutes longer.
In a normal year, runners must average 14:00 per mile or faster to make it across the bridge before it opens to vehicular traffic. Those who don't make the cutoff are removed from the race course and are shuttled to the finish area. Nealis also requested that the finish area remain open 30 minutes longer, to give anyone who got a late start time to finish.
Many back-of-the-pack runners found that when they arrived at the finish line, there were no jackets (which the Marine Corps Marathon uses in place of mylar blankets) or food boxes available. Because the finish cutoff was extended, some people who would have ended up on the “straggler buses” were able to cross the line, which created an increased need for jackets and refreshments, Nealis said.
A few of the Marines who were handing out those items may have been too generous early on in the race, creating a shortage later.
“Apparently when it was raining that morning, some Marines, when they're looking at 30,000 pallets of blankets and food say, ‘Let me hand out a jacket to people who are in the rain,'” Nealis said. “[With] the [food] boxes, [there was] almost the same mindset that even though they were instructed to give one box per runner, some runners feel that they can have two or three. And even though they should have been refused, they weren't.”
The race organization is already looking at ways to fix the problems in the future, such as assessing how the metal detectors were operated. Putting a protective roof or cover above the detectors is one possible solution, if rains again.
This year's field, with 23,194 finishers, was the third-largest in the event's 40-year history. The accompanying 10K had a record 7,777 runners. Nealis said he'll also think about the ideal size of the field.
“We close out early—a lot of people want to run—and maybe we're a little generous in trying to accommodate more runners who wanted to experience it,” they said.
The transit authority will not open the Metro earlier than 5 a.m., so getting participants through the staging area earlier is not an option—the race's website advises runners to arrive two hours in advance for the start.
Runners have suggested that the race not allow supporters and spectators into the start area, where officials estimate as many as 50,000 people pass through the security checkpoints. Nealis said he'd rather not prohibit spectators from the start area, because space constraints already limit their access at the finish.
“I'm not ready to ban family members away from taking pictures, clapping and cheering, and witnessing what's going on [at the start],” Nealis said. “I think that's what makes our sport so beautiful, that it is a family experience.”
Next year, Nealis said, the process will improve.
“That's one of the things I love—in my 45-plus years of being a Marine and hanging out with Marines is that we're not afraid to go back to the drawing board and take a look at what took place and was there a way to make things better,” Nealis said. “For those who are frustrated, I understand it, but come back in 2016 because things will be fixed and will be done different. We'll all be smarter.”

Incident Date ~ October 24 2013, approx 12:30pm
Incident Location ~ Philadelphia, Pa 19150
Department ~ Philly PD, 14th and 35th District
14th District Phone Number ~ 215-686-3350
35th District Phone Number ~ 215-686-3350
I'm sitting on the patio drink coffee and I see my neighbor ride up on their bicycle. They hop off and disappears from site towards their back door. I also notice a cop car following them 20 paces behind. It didn't appear that my neighbor noticed the cop.
As my neighbor approaches their back door the cop speeds up and jumps out their squad car.
The cop stops my neighbor. My neighbor and the cop are out of site but I hear my neighbor comply. My patio is not see through so both parties didn't know I was outside. The cop took my neighbors license and walked back to the squad car to check it.
At this point I started videotaping and told my neighbor that I'm watching everything. The cop notices me and crouches back in the car and directs my neighbor to tell me to put my camera away before they get locked up for me filming. You hear me tell my neighbor to just worry about the cop. I also ask “Isn't they the cop? Why isn't they telling me this? This is when they got out of the car and started questioning me. The video shows this cop being shady from start to finish.
The officer pulls off with my neighbor then circles back 2 mins later. As soon as they pulled off I called the 14th District and requested a supervisor to the scene. I told dispatch that an officer in squad car 1424 is in back of my driveway violating my neighbors rights and I need a supervisor. I was told that can't be possible because the car number is from the 14th District and I was calling from the 35th District. I told them I had the right car number and to please send someone immediately. The shady cop must have heard the call and came back before the supervisor came. When the supervisor arrived they didn't acknowledge me as the taxpayer that called them to the scene. They totally ignored me and whispers in the shady cops ear. Then they both get in their cars and pull off with my neighbor.
I told my neighbors family what happened. They went to the 35th District where my neighbor is being held. They were released without any charges against him.
My question is, what was they detained for in the first place? We are still trying to figure this out. As you can see this cop is a total idiot and got in way above their head when pulled that crap in my driveway. They need to be put out there as another cop to watch out for because they have no problem violating the rights of the people. The Philadelphia Police Dept had no problem backing this idiot even when totally out of their area.

The two rattlesnakes seemed oblivious to the cameras snapping away at their every move.
Both males, they were intertwined in a dominance dance on a popular dirt trail along the Bolsa Chica wetlands in Huntington Beach on Friday afternoon, prompting onlookers to stop in their tracks and watch in awe at the National Geographic-worthy moment.
“It was pretty amazing. I've seen a lot of rattlesnakes, but never doing their ritual there,” said photographer Lance Lawson, who has been going to the wetlands for about 40 years.
Lawson was on the lookout for eagles and owls in the area, a popular spot for photographers looking to capture images of local wildlife near the northern end of the wetlands. They noticed two other photographers with their lenses focused on something interesting, so stopped to check it out.
And there they were, the snakes wrapping their slippery, slithering bodies around one another. Onlookers speculated the snakes were mating, but local expert Jason Magee, owner of OC Snake Removal in Laguna Niguel, said the photos show two males battling over dominance during breeding season.
“Likely there was an ovulating female nearby and the males picked up the scent and went into battle mode to determine who was more the dominant snake,” they said via e-mail. “The more dominant snake will be the breeding male. Very neat to see in the wild!”
Magee said the recent rains have made business busier than ever. During heavy downpours, they received a high volume of removal calls from rain pushing rattlesnakes out of their hibernation spots and into people's homes, garages and yards.
“The rain has made habitat bloom and snakes' prey abundant and healthy, in turn bringing more snakes out,” they wrote. “This year is gonna be a doozy.”
The two battling snakes continued for about 20 minutes, drawing the attention of about 20 other photographers who stopped to shoot.
“They were still real passive, they were not aggressive at all,” Lawson said.
At one point, another snake nonchalantly passed behind the intertwined duo. Magee said it was a San Diego Gopher Snake, based on the image.
Lawson said they stayed about 40 feet away to shoot the images. But when the snakes tired of the attention and ducked into nearby bushes, Lawson peeked down to see what they were up to. They continued to be engrossed in one another's company.
“It was very unique, I've never seen anything like that,” they said. “It was kind of an eye-opener. I've gone there a lot, I've seen a couple snakes in the distance, but never on the trails.”
Rattlesnakes have a hemotoxic venom and are fairly docile and won't strike without a reason. But they will aggressively defend themselves and can deliver a lethal bite if necessary. Most snake bites occur when snakes are undetected or being unprofessionally handled, according to Magee.
The California Poison Control System last year issued a reminder that rattlesnakes are more likely to be found along hiking trails with warm weather, and even baby rattlesnakes have dangerous venom. Most bites occur between April and October.

One of the top supermarkets here in the UK have introduced an Ugly Fruit And Veg section! I suppose it's a good idea, but isn't it a shame for those poor old carrots, potatoes and tomatoes that we see every season, the ones that look like bums or other parts of the human anatomy. They'll all be tossed into a corner of their own, the ‘ugly fruit' corner, unloved, lonely and unwanted.
Mind you, the alternative is worse, they are usually tossed to one side and left to rot or fed to the local pigs. At least this way, Mr manky carrot could still end up in a stew or soup. Once they're cooked or boiled, the result is the same no matter how they look. Apparently, most supermarkets hold a ‘beauty contest' on most crops which sees up to 40% being of produce being thrown out.
This particular supermarket will be putting their below par mixed ‘less than happy fruit and veg' into boxes and selling them for £3.50p. They're also claiming that a box will feed a family with fresh vegetables for a week. The initiative is part of a wider trend to decrease waste in farming. So much food has in the past had to force rigorous cosmetic standards for fruit and vegetables.
I think it's a great idea, after all, I'm not bothered if my ‘taters' look like Marilyn Monroe or a trod on chip. At the end of the day, if they're fresh, then it's a win win situation all round. Farmers win because there's less waste, families win because we can get fresh vegetables at a reduced rate and the supermarket will win otherwise they wouldn't bother, would they? I suppose the only losers will be the local pigs, but hopefully they'll still get fed from somewhere.
After a couple of weeks of hints and rumours, the date for the 3rd Tweed Run has been confirmed.
The what?
The Tweed Run, where some 400(ish) cyclists in rather more sensible attire than the excessively revealing Lycra sported by the more athletic of persons parade en-mass around Central London on a range of antique or suitably modern yet eccentric safety bicycles.
Booking for the tickets will open at midday on Saturday 26 February 2011 – and last year sold out within 45 minutes.
The booking page.
The Tweed Run itself will take place on Saturday 9th April.
I was a bystander last year – and took loads of photos – and maybe this year might participate.
On a side line, when some of us has an interview with TfL boss, Peter Hendy a few weeks ago, one thing they mentioned about the Boris Bike was how it has changed the aesthetic of cycling in London away from the sporty clad couriers darting around the place to a more sedate, and undeniably sartorially vastly more appealing exercise.
Also – should you be of the Tweedy sort, then the editor of The Chap Magazine, Gustav Temple is giving a talk next week in Hackney.
Son to stepfather: 'I can't believe you shot me in the chest'
Douglas returned to their DeLand home and found their son, Willie Patterson, in the driveway with several gunshot wounds, reports said.
And then, they heard their son scream in the background, "I can't believe you shot me in the chest."
Moments later, they heard a "pop, pop, pop" on the telephone line, according to Sheriff's Office reports released Monday.
Doris Douglas told Volusia County detectives their husband called Sunday night and said they better return home and get their 36-year-old son "before I kill him."
They drove them to the hospital, where they were treated for non-life-threatening injuries.
When deputies arrived at the Stewart Road home Sunday evening, John Douglas — Doris Douglas' husband and Patterson's stepfather — was on the front porch smoking a cigarette.
John Douglas told detectives Patterson came home drunk and "began to disrespect him," reports said.
Douglas said they asked Patterson to leave, and their stepson refused.
According to reports, Douglas then called their wife and told them "come get them before I hurt them or they hurt me."
Doris Douglas said they couldn't return right away, and John Douglas told detectives they went to their bedroom, retrieved a pistol and confronted Patterson in the kitchen.
Douglas said they fired a warning shot into the floor and told their stepson, "One of us is going to hell tonight," reports said.
Douglas said Patterson turned, and that's when they fired the gun.
During their interview with detectives, Douglas said, "Well I know it was a birdshot, but I was hoping I ain't killed him."
Detectives said Douglas shot Patterson in the chest four times at close range.
Douglas was arrested on an attempted first-degree murder charge. They remain at the Volusia County Jail.

CNN's Jim Acosta is beside themselves after (soon to be former) White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer called for the media to turn off cameras and audio recording devices for a 'silent' press briefing. Acosta, apparently unaware that there was a time when the Press Corps used to take notes by hand, staged a silent protest by tweeting a picture of their retarded socks.
The Spicer off-camera/no audio gaggle has begun. I can't show you a pic of Sean. So here is a look at some new socks I bought over the wknd pic.twitter.com/wO9erspwYa — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 19, 2017
"If they can't come out and answer the questions and they're just not gonna do this on-camera or audio—why are we even having these briefings or these gaggles in the first place?"
STONEWALLED!
Acosta tweeted that they were 'stonewalled' by Spicer's silent briefing.
Make no mistake about what we are all witnessing. This is a WH that is stonewalling the news media. Hiding behind no camera/no audio gaggles — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 19, 2017
The CNN host then whined on air about being passed over for questions. Looks like the White House's war on Fake News is getting under Jim's skin...
It's like we're just covering bad reality television, is what it feels like now.
How will the press corps ever recover? Will the ever-evasive White House confiscate pencils and paper next? Can Jim Acosta walk and chew gum at the same time?

Happy moments: Prime Minister Narendra Modi with their mother.
AHMEDABAD: A comment on Facebook by a youth from Uttar Pradesh about Prime Minister Narendra Modi has put Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials on alert.Police sources said that the comment has brought the focus back on the security arrangements for the Prime Minister's relatives. The comment was posted by one Inzmam Qadri from UP and it reads: " Modi ki Maa ko kidnap karle to jo bhi chahe woh karva sakte hain." (If we kidnap Modi's mother, they will do whatever we say.)Senior police officials said after the central IB officials informed their state counterparts in Gujarat, police reviewed security arrangements made for Modi's mother, Hiraba , who stays in Gandhinagar. The cops, however, refused to comment on the FB post. The comment has been removed from the page after it invited a lot of angry comments.According to the rule books, SPG cover is provided to the kin of the Prime Minister. However, when Prime Minister Modi's mother refused the SPG cover, the state government reviewed the situation and provided discreet security to Hiraba.City police sources said that they received the Facebook comment for the purpose of scrutiny to undertake whatever was required on their part. Investigations into this issue have already been undertaken by the UP police.On the other hand, state IB and home department officials refused to comment on the Facebook post. "Security has already been provided to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's mother Hiraba by the state government," a home department official said.
SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY DEMANDS FALSE FLAG TERROR PROBE
– Top Senator Calls for Investigation of Bush False Flag Terror Plot (Veterans Today, Sep 19, 2012):
Senate Judiciary Committee Chair, Patrick Leahy, Directs DOD Inquiry into Gwyneth Todd Case Accusations have been made against two senior Navy officials that may well lead to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, treason and terrorism against the United States. More importantly, sources report that behind the plot that it has taken years to bring forward may well implicate former Vice President Cheney. As of this writing, the lives of all involved hang in the balance as, too often in the past, cleaning up the crimes of the Bush administration has involved “accidents” as with presidential aide John Wheeler, whose body was found in a Delaware landfill in January, 2011.
YouTube
No arrests have been made and there is even less evidence of an investigation being initiated. Wheeler worked on the periphery of a half dozen secret projects, one of which is believed to have brought about their murder at the order of powerful Washington insiders. Todd, herself, was approached by someone claiming to be an embassy “passport official” at their home in Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald carries a detailed report on what may have been a second murder/kidnap attempt, one foiled.

A month ago, Jeff Steinof the Washington Post wrote a 5500-word article on former White House security staffer, Gwyneth Todd. Todd reported a 5th Fleet under Vice Admiral Cosgriff and Commander Lynn Chow that had gone rogue. The Post printed much and, surprisingly, the article became impossible to locate in 24 hours without having saved the link. Search engines killed it in a process known as “scrubbing.” Veterans Today then published a somewhat different and direct approach, in direct cooperation with Todd herself. Todd has long worked with Veterans Today and had agreed to move from “unofficial” to “official” staff.

Playing Mozart — On Mozart's Violin
Enlarge this image toggle caption Kathy Wittman/Courtesy of the Boston Early Music Festival Kathy Wittman/Courtesy of the Boston Early Music Festival
The violin and viola that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played themselves are in the United States for the first time ever. The instruments come out of storage only about once a year at the Salzburg Mozarteum in Austria. The rest of the time, they're kept under serious lockup. I talked to the musicians who got to play them at the Boston Early Music Festival earlier this week before the violin's New York premiere at the Austrian Cultural Forum New York tonight.
I could feel my heart stop. My fingers were trembling. And I'm pretty sure I had a huge smile on my face as I tucked the violin under my chin. The instrument that Mozart used to perform their own concerts! And professional musicians got the same thrill at the Boston Early Music Festival.
For safety's sake, the violin and viola were flown here on separate airplanes. But the six-person team from the Salzburg Mozarteum who are safeguarding them don't make for a very flashy entourage. There are no huge, beefy guys in shades with crossed arms. No SUVs with blacked-out windows. Instead, there's just a small huddle of frankly not very intimidating-looking Middle Europeans.
"Our main thing is to travel so unspectacular as possible, that nobody should know what is inside the cases," says Gabriele Ramsauer, the director of the Mozart Museums. They and the rest of the team refer to the violin and the viola simply as "The Luggage," and the instruments are being held in an undisclosed location during the tour.
They were made in the early 17th 18th century as workhorse fiddles — sturdy and plain, and meant as tools. They're not as splendid or highly ornamented as the instruments you would find at a royal court during this time, or the instrument a full-time virtuoso would use. But they still are the vessels of Mozart's legacy.
The violin, made in Bavaria by a member of the Klotz family, was the one they most likely used to perform their own violin concertos on tour in Mannheim, Germany; and Paris. The viola is an Italian instrument of about the same period, but its maker is unknown. They're quieter than modern instruments and produce less brilliantly colored tones. They force the audience to lean in to appreciate them.
Backstage after the Boston concert, Miloš Valent said it was hard to describe the feeling they had playing the viola Mozart used in Vienna to jam with friends like Franz Joseph Haydn. "For a musician," Valent says, "who is living with music their whole life and Mozart is someone who is somebody who is really, really important in life, to touch their instrument is something extremely personal."
For their part, violinist Amandine Beyer says they couldn't help but wonder if they were channeling some special spirit when using Mozart's fiddle in Boston. "I had all the time this question! But I tried to call this spirit, no? And to say, 'Are you there?'" Beyer says, laughing. "But I think you can do it with every instrument when you play the music of Mozart."
That's exactly the kind of reaction the Mozarteum is hoping for, says its head of research, Ulrich Leisinger. "We listen to the concert and if we close the eyes, we perhaps even think of Mozart playing the violin," they say. "There are typically two methods to deal with historic instruments. One would be to say that we lock it in a shrine and never let anybody touch it again. But we are entirely convinced that you need to play the instruments because these are the messengers of Mozart's music."
And when the musicians in Boston finished playing, not only did they take their bows — but they also thrust the violin and viola forward for their own well-deserved round of applause.
With special thanks to our friends at Classical New England for providing the recordings of the Jordan Hall concert heard in this piece. Next week, we'll have a complete concert video featuring more performances on Mozart's violin and viola, recently recorded live at WGBH's Fraser Performance Studio.
The Wolf of Wall Street is all about obscene excess in every vice imaginable. Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and their associates do more blow, screw more hookers, toss around more money, and piss on more legal documents than most of us could ever dream of.
So it only makes sense that they'd be more profane than just about everyone else, as well. As it turns out, The Wolf of Wall Street has more utterances of the f-word than any other non-documentary film in cinema history. Find out just how many fucks it gives, as well as which films it had to beat out to get there.
According to Wikipedia, the word “fuck” is used 506 times over The Wolf of Wall Street‘s 180-minute running time. Previously, the record was held by Spike Lee's 1999 drama Summer of Sam with 435 instances. Neither hold a candle to the single most “fuck”-filled movie of all time, which drops a jaw-dropping 857 f-bombs and is itself titled Fuck — but that's because Fuck is a documentary about the use of the word “fuck.”
Scorsese in general is well represented on the list of the most profane movies ever. It seems fitting that The Wolf of Wall Street‘s closest thematic siblings, Casino and Goodfellas, are pretty high up as well. The former comes in at fourth place with 422 f-words, while the latter is in eleventh place with an even 300. Further down the list, Scorsese's The Departed has a “fuck” count of 237.
In truth, the number of bad words in The Wolf of Wall Street is probably the least offensive thing about it. It's certainly the least of Belfort's numerous crimes against humanity. For starters, given the amount of (rather awful-looking) sex the Stratton Overmont boys are having, it's possible The Wolf of Wall Street also has the most fucks, in a literal sense, of any non-pornographic movie.
Team Secret made a surprising announcement, naming a Team Director for the group. The position was entrusted to Clash of Clans World #1 Kemal Sadıkoğlu (37), son of Turkish magnate Kahraman Sadıkoğlu, who owns several marine construction and petroleum businesses worth billions. Hence, Team Secret's announcement has raised more questions than it answered.
We are delighted to announce that @ksadikoglu has officially joined Team Secret as our Team Director. — Team Secret (@TeamSecretDOTA2) April 17, 2015
In true nature of their namesake and logo, the team has not released much, if any, additional details surrounding their plans, status and future.
What we know
On March 26, Matthew “Cyborgmatt” Bailey and Clement “Puppey” Ivanov were on what seemed to be a vacation in Istanbul, Turkey.
Puppey will be doing a short impromptu meet & greet at Adeks Internet Cafe here in Istanbul at 2pm this afternoon! pic.twitter.com/maPnEdQ8Rv — Team Secret (@TeamSecretDOTA2) March 26, 2015
On the very same day, Cyborgmatt did their fans the courtesy of answering a couple of questions addressed on the ask.fm platform:
Q: What exactly are you doing in Istanbul? A: Business and pleasure. (21 days ago) Q: So, will Secret ever look for sponsorship or remain self-funded? A: We will have sponsors. (21 days ago)
Last week, Cyborgmatt answered yet another ask.fm question, stating that a sponsorship announcement is to be expected:
Q: Will there be any announcement for a new sponsor? A: Yes. (11 days ago)
Yesterday, news that Team Secret is currently bootcamping in Turkey broke.

Today, Team Secret announce Kemal Sadıkoğlu as new Team Director.
Kemal Sadıkoğlu, Clash of Clans Word #1 player, is the son of Turkish magnate Kahraman Sadıkoğlu, who owns several marine construction and petroleum businesses worth billions. Kahraman Sadıkoğlu entered the international spotlight nine years ago, when they were kidnapped by terrorists in Iraq, and again four years ago, when one of their yachts was turned into a floating vice den involving underage prostitutes and rich business people.
What it means
Is Kemal Sadıkoğlu a new investor, new sponsor, new meta for how teams function? Will more changes occur within the organization? No one knows for sure. Team Secret representatives shy away from answering questions.
Orchard Park, N.Y. — The Buffalo Bills added some depth to their secondary on Monday, signing former Redskins safety Bacarri Rambo, according to Mike Garafolo of FOX Sports.
Bills are signing former Redskins safety Bacarri Rambo. — Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) November 17, 2014
Rambo, a sixth-round pick out of Georgia, had a rough rookie season with the Redskins. They played in 11 games in 2013 and only eight safeties received a worse grade from Pro Football Focus. Washington cut them two games into the 2014 season.
After cornerback Leodis McKelvin fractured their ankle against the Dolphins in Week 11, the Bills may move the veteran to injured reserve.
"We're working on that, finalizing that," coach Doug Marrone said about a potential roster move involving McKelvin. I think something will come out later today. I think later today that will be all cleared up."
UPDATE: The Bills officially placed McKelvin on injured reserve Monday afternoon.
So maybe it's not January 1st--or even the beginning of the fiscal year, but with all the "new" stuff happening in the Mach 30 community we certainly feel like popping the cork on a bottle of Champagne!
New Tax Status
This very boring looking letter represents a very exciting moment at Mach 30. Last month the IRS has classified Mach 30 as a 501(c)3 public charity; which means the first major hurdle standing between us and a future where humanity is a space faring civilization has been leaped. (It also means your donations to Mach 30 may now be tax deductible!)
New Website
If you've been to Mach30.org lately you've likely noticed this one. We've updated the Mach 30 website to give it a more modern look--and, more importantly, to make it easier for you to get to know us, find what you are looking for, and get involved. Please stop by, take a look and let us know what you think of the new site!
New Members of the Mach 30 family
Saving the best for last! As part of the Open Source Spaceflight Revolution 8 people joined the Mach 30 family as first time donors! Want to add your name to their ranks, or just learn more about the revolution? Visit our campaign page now!
Come see us in the Big Apple!
If you will be in (or close to!) New York City on September 15 come see us at the Open Hardware Summit. In addition to connecting with other members of the Open Hardware Community, Mach 30 board members J. Simmons and Greg Moran will demo the Open Design Engine.
Hope to see you there!
What is the Open Design Engine?
If it takes a forge to develop open source software, then you need an engine to develop open source hardware. Introducing Open Design Engine (ODE). ODE is a web based engineering project management system created to facilitate the design and development of openly licensed hardware projects. ODE provides a critical service to the growing open source hardware community, similar to the role Source Forge played in the early growth of open source software. Open source hardware projects today have to cobble together wikis, forums, online polls, blogs, and online file storage to share their materials. ODE integrates these services into a single system, and provides a destination for users looking for open source hardware projects to build or to extend.
ODE is based on the open source software Redmine and is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPL). ODE is being distributed in a similar manner to WordPress, which means there will be a version available for download that users can install on their own servers (like http://wordpress.org) and a hosted version where users can register accounts and host projects (like http://wordpress.com). The ODE demo will introduce the ODE website to the open source hardware community and provide an opportunity for the community to give feedback on ODE. Visit ODE at https://opendesignengine.net/.

League of Legends is a free-to-play online arena battle game from Riot Games, and the studio recently unveiled an entirely new mode to play in Dominion, but it continues to keep the game updated with new playable hero characters. The next hero on deck is Graves, the outlaw.
Graves, the Outlaw
According to the game's backstory, Graves shares a contentious past with the card-tossing desperado hero, Twisted Fate. Specifically, both men had previously been card sharks and grifters who found their match in each other and became partners for some time until Twisted Fate made a back-alley deal to surrender Graves to the authorities in exchange for great power. Graves was apprehended and only recently escaped, and they now seek their revenge with the only friend they have in the world: a custom-built shotgun.
Twisted Fate betrayed Graves; now this outlaw is out for revenge.
Graves has the following powers:
True Grit (Passive): Graves gains increasing armor and magic resistance the longer they remain in combat.
Smokescreen: Graves fires a smoke canister at the target area that deals damage and creates a cloud of smoke. Enemies inside the smoke cloud have reduced sight range and movement speed.
Quickdraw: Graves dashes forward, gaining an attack speed boost for several seconds. Attacking enemies lower the cooldown timer on this skill.
Buckshot: Graves fires three bullets in a cone, damaging all enemies in the path of the projectiles. Enemies at close range can be hit by multiple projectiles, but each one beyond the first will deal reduced damage.
"They got a saying in the locker: ain't got nothin' but time to plan."--Graves, The Outlaw
Collateral Damage (Ultimate): Graves fires an explosive shell that deals heavy damage to the first target it hits. After hitting a champion or reaching the end of its range, the shell explodes and deals damage in a cone behind the target.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on Wednesday said that it has begun producing chips using its 16nm FinFET+ (16FF+) manufacturing technology. The new process technology will be used by a number of TSMC's partners to make their leading edge chips due next year. Among the first companies to adopt the improved 16nm FinFET process technology from TSMC will be Nvidia, MediaTek, LG Electronics and others.
If TSMC starts risk production of chips using 16nm FinFET+ process technology now, expect commercial products made using 16FF+ fabrication process to arrive in the late third quarter of 2015 at the earliest. TSMC officially anticipates that the 16FF+ volume ramp will begin around July in 2015.
TSMC's 16nm FinFET (CLN16FF) and 16nm FinFET+ (CLN16FF+) process technologies rely on the back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnect flow of the company's 20nm SOC (CLN20SOC) fabrication process, but use FinFET transistors instead of planar transistors. Such hybrid approach to CLN16FF process technologies provides additional performance and/or power savings, but does not allow to significantly shrink the size of chips compared to chips made using the 20nm SOC technology. The proven BEOL interconnect flow means that it gets easier for TSMC to start mass production of chips using its 16FF and 16FF+ manufacturing technologies.
“Our successful ramp-up in 20SoC has blazed a trail for 16FF and 16FF+, allowing us to rapidly offer a highly competitive technology to achieve maximum value for customers' products,” said Mark Liu, the president and co-CEO of TSMC. “We believe this new process can provide our customers the right balance between performance and cost so they can best meet their design requirements and time-to-market goals.”
According to TSMC, 16nm FinFET+ provides up to 15 per cent performance improvement over the 16nm FinFET at the same level of power consumption. At the same clock-rate, chips produced using 16nm FinFET+ are expected to consume 30 per cent less power compared to the same chips made using 16nm FinFET. Products manufactured using 16nm FinFET+ will offer up to 40 per cent speed improvement over chips made using 20nm technology, or will consume 50 per cent lower amount of power at the same clock-rate.
The 16FF+ process is on track to pass full reliability qualification later in November, and nearly 60 customer designs are currently scheduled to tape out by the end of 2015. Among the early adopters of TSMC's 16nm FinFET+ fabrication processes are Avago, Freescale, Nvidia, MediaTek, LG Electronics, Renesas, Xilinx,
“Nvidia and TSMC have collaborated for more than 15 years to deliver complex GPU architectures on state-of-the-art process nodes,” said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of GeForce business unit at Nvidia. “Our partnership has delivered well over a billion GPUs that are deployed in everything from automobiles to supercomputers. Through working together on the next-generation 16nm FinFET process, we look forward to delivering industry-leading performance and power efficiency with future GPUs and SoCs.”
Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE.
KitGuru Says: Keeping in mind that many of 16FF+ adopters are unlikely to make chips using 16FF process technology, it looks like a number of companies, including Nvidia, MediaTek and LG will unlikely offer brand-ne chips made using a next-generation process technology before fall 2015. It is noteworthy that AMD is not among the early adopters of TSMC's 16FF+ process technology.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the West started its “irrational attacks on Russia long before” this spring's events in Ukraine, but insisted that Moscow is seeking to avoid “spiraling sanctions” with the EU and the US.
“We are not interested in confrontation, we are not interested in a sanction spiral,” the minister said in a speech to an audience at the Lake Seliger youth camp in central Russia.
“I can only note that long before events in Ukraine the West's attacks on Russia assumed an irrational form. It all started long before this spring.”
Lavrov accused Western political leaders of “stirring up” anti-Russian feelings among their electorates, saying that their attitudes towards Russia “require a reevaluation.”
“Political leaders in the West incite public opinion, and then claim it is the people who are forcing them to take anti-Russian measures.”
“I think the reason that Russia is under such heavy pressure is that, more than any other country, we are not afraid to talk about our interests and express our opinions. At the same time, we do not claim that they are the absolute truth, and we are open to listening to others. But we hope to get the same in return, and rely on our independence not being punished by others,” Lavrov said.
Lavrov said the United States and other Western countries were “going against the course of history” by attempting to “artificially” hold on to their influence.
“Some countries are trying to restrain the emergence of an egalitarian international arena. And if more unilateral sanctions are imposed on us to this end, we will take measures in response.”
They also claimed that the West's desire to maintain its status as the ultimate international arbiter was a "roadblock" to solving global problems, such as "terrorism, drug trafficking, spread of weapons of mass destruction, food shortages, epidemics, illegal migration and regional conflicts."
Lavrov, who has served as Russia's foreign minister for a decade, said that the old “Cold War blocs” are no longer relevant in a “multipolar world,” and instead called for an emergence of “flexible and networked” alliances.
“We do not consider it a tragedy if some of our partners disagree with us on certain issues – as opposed to NATO, where any step out of line is punished immediately.”
When asked why Moscow hasn't recognized the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics during the Q & A that followed the speech, Lavrov told their audience that Moscow was not interested in the breakup of Ukraine, but said that they hoped the anti-Kiev movements would secure greater rights for Russian-speaking minorities in the country.
“The gains that have been made by these republics should consolidate the region in their quest for what is most important – that they can continue living in these areas as did their ancestors, speaking Russian, teaching their children in Russian schools, and electing their own governors, as well as having the chance to retain some of the taxes they pay as a result of their economic activities.”
They also said that any settlement must be signed after a ceasefire, not “imposed” by Kiev “under the cover of bomb blasts.”
When questioned about the touted use of US-made fuel in the country's four active Soviet-built nuclear power plants, Lavrov warned that the changeover would be “unsafe,” as the fuel rods are incompatible.
“Such experiments could end badly, particularly in Ukraine, where the memory of Chernobyl is still fresh,” Lavrov said.
The California State Senate overwhelmingly passed a measure on Thursday that would ban so-called "revenge porn."
The bill would outlaw distributing an identifiable image of an unknowing person that would "cause a reasonable person to suffer serious emotional distress."
California Sen. Anthony Cannella introduced the measure because law enforcement officials asked for a tool to fight the problem, according to their communications director Jeff Macedo.
"Senator Cannella was made aware that there were no criminal penalties for revenge porn," Macedo told Mashable. "He looked at it as an issue and saw that here's an instance where technology is moving faster than the law."
Though Cannella submitted the bill after the state's Feb. 22 deadline for filing, they were still able to introduce it as an "urgency measure," which means the issue affects "the public peace, health, or safety," according to the California legislature's website. Bills with urgency clauses require a two-thirds vote in both the state's senate and assembly for passage, and they are immediately enacted into law upon approval.
The measure passed by a vote of 37 to 1. The lone detractor was Leland Yee, who represents the state's eighth district.
As it's written, the proposal would make the offense a disorderly conduct misdemeanor for invasion of privacy. First offenders could receive up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the current version of the bill.
Florida's lawmakers raised a similar measure earlier this year, but it never made it through the state's legislature.
For it to become law, California's "revenge porn" bill must now pass in the state assembly, before it is sent to Gov. Jerry Brown for approval. Cannella's office said they are hoping the bill will be passed before the end of the current legislative session on Sept. 13.

Last month, Mike Beltzner shared an early product plan for the next version of Firefox with the Mozilla community and presented our vision for Firefox 4. A big upgrade coming with Firefox 4 is the new theme project: creating a new, sleek, and simpler default theme for the browser. The UX team has been working tirelessly on this – streamlining and modernizing the user interface, particularly on Windows, given the aesthetic changes introduced by Vista and Windows 7.
Note: Plans May Change.
Metrics and Test Pilot have been doing what we can to help guide the UX team as they create an optimized design. A few months ago, Test Pilot released the Menu Item Usage Study, from which we gained valuable insight into how users interact with the menu bar. And a few weeks ago, we released the Main Window Usage Study to capture the remaining major UI elements of the browser, and provide more data-driven recommendations.
Today, we'd like to present some initial findings from this study. Like previous Test Pilot studies, the main window study ran for 5 days and covered Firefox versions 3.5 and up. The sample consists of 9,667 users who have opted into the Test Pilot program AND opted to submit their data.
We usually display study results in charts and graphs on this blog, but for this study, we were inspired by the work of principal designer, Alex Faaborg, and came up with a slightly different kind of visualization. Back in March, Alex created a heatmap to visualize the menu study data (his post is also a great example of how the UX team is using Test Pilot data to inform design decisions). Overlaying the actual UI and putting the data in context was really useful, so with their help, we expanded on the idea and constructed this interactive, web-based heatmap for the main window study:
(image links to heatmap)
Currently, the heatmap can display the usage data in two ways. Selecting ‘Used by x% of users' displays the percentage of users who clicked each UI element at least one time, and ‘Clicks per user' is simply the frequency click count for each item, divided by the number of users in the sample (we normalize for sample size to make comparisons across the different subsets more meaningful). The first approach is useful because it mitigates the effect of outliers, since each person who clicks an item counts only once, whether they clicked the item 1 time or 25,000 times. The obvious drawback is that this metric fails to capture intensity of use, which ‘Clicks per user' does capture.
You can also choose to examine specific subsets within the sample; there are selectors to display breakdowns by OS and by self-reported computer/web skill level. Unfortunately, you cannot combine these subsets yet; that is, while you can look at data for just Windows users or for just Advanced users, you cannot look at data for the subset of Advanced, Windows users. Our sample is too small for such sub-setting right now, but we'll add this ability as soon as our sample size increases.
Be sure not to miss the table to the right of the heatmap – it lists all the UI elements in descending order and also outlines the color spectrum. In addition, if you are viewing data for a subset, the table will show the differences between the currently selected subset and the other related subsets to make comparison easy (the differences for the ‘Used by x% of users' filter are simply one subset minus the other, the differences for the ‘Clicks per user' filter are in percentage change).
We'll discuss results more thoroughly in future blog posts, but here are a few findings that immediately jumped out to us. As always, these findings apply to our sample of Test Pilot users only, and we realize this sample is not likely representative of the population of Firefox users as a whole. Furthermore, It's important to remember that usage data like this is only one part of a rigorous design process, and that it alone will not dictate any design decisions.
The Back button is used far more often than any other navigation element (by which we mean the Back, Forward, Reload, Stop, and Home buttons). 93.1% of study participants used the Back button at least once, and on average, each user clicked Back 66.2 times over the 5 days – that's 3x more clicks than the Reload button, 10x more than the Home button, and over 30x more than the Forward and Stop buttons!
Of all items that are not in the Firefox main window by default, the New Tab Button (Navigation Toolbar) is the most commonly used, both by % of users and frequency count. Looking at click counts, the New Tab Button (Navigation Toolbar) is a more popular way to generate new tabs than the New Tab Button (Tab Bar) that is located in the tab strip by default. The New Tab Button (Navigation Toolbar) is also more often used than the default UI elements Bookmark Star and RSS Icon by click count.
Another conspicuous result is the disparate use of the scroll arrows in comparison to the scroll slider. This holds true for both the vertical scroll bar and the horizontal scroll bar; while 89% of people used the vertical scroll slider, only 21.2% and 16.6% of people used the up and down arrows. And although 42.8% of users used the horizontal scroll slider, only 2.1% and 0.9% clicked the left and right arrows to scroll.
Besides putting the data in a spatial context, another benefit of this visualization is that it is easy to reuse, update, and improve. We plan to add more data, more breakdowns, and the ability to synthesize multiple subsets in the near future. We also want to improve the robustness of our findings by filtering out certain extensions (e.g. some users have the Google Toolbar and might be searching through that channel instead of the integrated search box), and by increasing our sample size.
In addition, the heatmap will be updated over the course of the Firefox 4 beta program. Hopefully, this visualization will help us understand how the various UI changes affect user behavior, and ensure that these design decisions are in fact improving the product for our (beloved) end-users. Look for these updates soon!
Thanks again to Alex Faaborg, and to all Test Pilot users for opting-in to provide us with the data. If you'd like to help us understand how people use Firefox and build a better browser, head over to the Test Pilot website to learn more and download the add-on. And as always, please feel free to download the raw data and supplement our analysis with your own!
Silken Tofu with Avocado Recipe (E'li Dou Fu)
Fen Loves tofu. That's a Fact. Plus she's more than a little partial to the odd avocado, making silken tofu with avocado a dish made in heaven.
Okay, it seems like an odd combination admittedly, but you'll be surprised by how well the slippery slices of tofu go with the delicate, creamy avocado, all of which are drowned with soy sauce mixed with a hint of sesame seed. If I haven't convinced you by my vegetarian mapo tofu recipe, then this is the dish that will surely make you a bean curd fan.
The dish falls under the category of starter, which traditionally is a cheeky excuse to get your diners eating pre-made dishes whilst you stir fry the main course. In any case if you're looking for something to accompany it, my recipe for smacked cucumber with garlic is another cool, sensual dish that pairs really well.
The Origin of Silken Tofu with Avocado
I came across this recipe in Fuchsia Dunlop's book ‘Every Grain of Rice'. In the book, Dunlop explains that they discovered the dish in a restaurant whilst exploring the southern hills of Taipai one Autumn night. The original dish they tried was actually served with wasabi and a little sea urchin – common ingredients in Taiwan's seafood-rich cuisine – which they enjoyed so much they call it a ‘miracle'. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but this is satisfying stuff none-the-less.
The below recipe strips things down to the essentials. but if you have the ingredients available feel free to add a dab of wasabi and sea urchin for a seafood variant with a little more kick. Just make sure the avocado has been chilled beforehand, and you'll have a tasty and refreshing starter that's perfect for satisfying the Fen in your life.
Former FBI Director James Comey went to the Senate earlier this month to testify about Russia colluding with President Trump during the 2016 election.
What they ended up inadvertently doing was throwing former Attorney General Loretta Lynch under the bus.
In their June 8 testimony, James Comey — under oath — said Lynch tried to get the FBI to downplay that probe. “At one point, they directed me not to call it an ‘investigation' but instead to call it a ‘matter,' which confused me and concerned me,” Comey said before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “That was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if we are to close this case credibly.”
Comey said Lynch's request “gave the impression the attorney general was looking to align the way we talked about our investigation with the way a political campaign was describing the same activity.”
Pretty nefarious stuff.
Judge Andrew Napolitano, a legal expert for Fox News, said Monday that Comey's testimony could be highly damaging and could land Lynch in jail for up to 10 years.
“I would actually extend it one step farther. There is enough evidence here, just on the basis of the little snippets given to the Senate Intelligence Committee by former FBI Director Jim Comey, that Mrs. Lynch was either conflicted or working at odds with the Justice Department and in behalf of Mrs. Clinton's campaign and the DNC when they told them to use different terminology for the investigation," they said.
This “terminology may be indicative of a mindset on the part of Attorney General Lynch that they were going to do whatever they could to prevent Mrs. Clinton from getting indicted," Napolitano said.
A Senate probe is now underway. Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairperson of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, asked Lynch in a letter this week about their communications with then-chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
“During your time in the Justice Department, did you ever have communications with Rep. Wasserman Schultz, their staff, their associates, or any other current or former DNC officials about the Clinton email investigation?” Grassley wrote. They also asked Lynch if “any of your Justice Department staff or your other associates” had similar communications.
Said Napolitano: “It is alleged, this document has not seen the light of day if it exists, that there are one or several emails between Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Loretta Lynch concerning the behavior that Loretta Lynch will take to further the DNC interests while Mrs. Lynch was attorney general."
If such emails exist, the former judge said that would be “misconduct in office.”
“It's a felony,” Napolitano said. “Depending upon exactly what they charged them with, it could be five or 10 years in jail. It's very serious. It's the equivalent of obstruction of justice. It's the same allegation they are making about the president.”​

Newly released audits from San Francisco's Office of the Controller shed light on the presence of Uber and Lyft at San Francisco International Airport, showing that the two services experienced breakneck growth at the airport from late 2014 to 2015. Uber dominated Lyft, with almost seven times more rides.
The reports look at the 12 months through September 2015. The ride companies gained legal permission to operate at the airport in late October 2014. At the time, they said they would begin SFO operations within 30 days, although drivers were already unofficially providing many drop-offs and some pickups at the airport.
Over the 12 months, ride-hailing companies tripled the number of trips they provided to and from SFO. In October 2014 — before they were legally allowed to operate at the airport — they provided 101,205 rides. Almost 90 percent of them were drop-offs. In September 2015, app-hailed rides accounted for 319,736 SFO rides, with 58 percent of them dropping off passengers.
During the 12-month period, Uber drivers gave 2.2 million rides to and from SFO, the audit said. That was 6.7 times more than Lyft, which provided 329,262 rides. Wingz, a small San Francisco startup focused entirely on airport rides in personal cars, tallied 8,930 rides.
Harry Campbell, who drives for Uber and Lyft and runs the Rideshare Guy blog and podcast, said Uber's brand visibility across the country and world may account for its airport dominance. “For travelers coming into the city, their default at home is probably Uber, so when they arrive at SFO, they might opt for Uber,” they said.
“This data is old,” said Lyft spokesperson Alexandra LaManna. “As has been widely reported, we have consistently been taking share from Uber over the past year, and our actual market share in the city of San Francisco is nearly three times what this data shows. “
Uber spokesperson Eva Behrend said Uber's focus on improving the ride experience has fueled its success. “We have seen travelers embrace ride sharing at SFO since our launch nearly two years ago,” they said in a statement.
Lyft and Uber have a deep-seated rivalry, with their hometown of San Francisco a prime battleground. Although Uber has a larger market share here — as it does in all the cities where both companies operate — it's unlikely that the sevenfold difference from the SFO report accurately reflects the companies' relative sizes here. In April, Bloomberg said Lyft claimed a 43 percent market share in San Francisco, while Uber said it had 66 percent of the market in March.
Leaked investor reports have shown that Lyft experienced strong growth nationwide this summer. Recode reported that its 13.9 million trips in July were up 12 percent from June. That same month, Uber said that it recorded 62 million trips in the U.S., up 15 percent from the previous month. Almost two-thirds of Uber's business is overseas, where Lyft does not offer service, so globally, it is far bigger.
The controller's office audited SFO's revenue from rides, which is $3.85 per ride-hailing trip. (Vans and other services pay different fees.) The city found that Lyft had underreported the number of its trips, but otherwise complied with all requirements. Wingz also underreported its trips and did not comply with vehicle inspection and background check requirements for drivers with commercial licenses, the report said. Uber correctly reported all its trips and complied with all requirements, the report said.
Passengers during the 12 months took 6.8 million paid ground-transportation trips, the report said — but that includes only taxi pickups, not drop-offs. Of the 6.8 million, 38 percent were with Uber, Lyft and Wingz, counting both drop-offs and pickups.
Limos, courtesy shuttles, vans and charter services accounted for the rest.

In the picture above, the Cessna flight simulator cockpit seen from outside. The cockpit is based on six computers, one used as server to drive the instrument panel (real gauges, GPS, radio stack, etc) and five used to drive one TV each, ensuring a stutter free panoramic view, covering 180° around the aircraft. The computers used as clients for the visuals, are based on the following hardware and software:
- Intel DX48BT2 motherboard
- Intel E8500 CPU (Dual Core, 3.16Ghz not overclocked)
- 4 GB of DD3 system memory, at 1333Mhz
- nVidia 8800GT video card, with 1gig of video memory
- Generic SATA2 500GB hard drive
- Samsung 37" LCD full-hd TV running at 1920x1080 (LE37M86BD)
- Windows Vista 64 Home Basic (really useful to prevent OOM - Out of memory errors on complex photoreal scenery, happening sometimes with FSX) The computer used as server, has in addition the following hardware:
- A secondary nVidia 8800GT (one video output is used for service monitor, used to make maintenance, run FSX, etc; another video output is used for the Garmin 500 GPS; and a third video output is used for the MPID to interact with FSX ATC and Kneeboard. The fourth video output is still free for future expansions, perhaps for a radar weather)
- A secondary audio card, to redirect engine sounds to powerful speakers and ATC communications to an headset
- Windows XP Home Basic (I've avoided using a 64-bit operative system on the server, either because it's useless when there are no scenery views, and also to prevent incompatibilities with older hardware). The instrument panel is a TRC472 sold by Simkits and assembled by myself. I have heavily customized it, because it is sold for a C172, but I'm simulating a C-182. So, I've added a fuel/manifold pressure gauge, a CHT indicator, a rudder trip, plus various controls present on the C-182 and not on the C-172. The tablet PC is a Fujitsu ST5112 and has charts, so I don't need to use paper in the cockpit. The small unit fixed on the control yoke, is my homemade MPID (Multi Purpose Integrated Display), useful to interact with ATC and to use FSX Kneeboard without keyboard and without mouse. Again, all the cockpit is strictly based on a NO MOUSE, NO KEYBOARD and NO PAPER policy!!! The synchronization of the views is done via network by WidevieW and Widetraffic in TCP/IP mode. Software is Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) with SP2 and a lot of custom scenery (in particular, I have satellite scenery covering entire Italy, made by Flight Simulator Center).
Attributing the tweet to Dowd set off a new round of incredulous chatter. Would the president's lawyer really compose a tweet like that on their client's behalf, especially one that seemed so incriminating? One widely shared response, from a person who tweets from the account @nycsouthpaw, focused on a single word in the tweet as grounds for skepticism: “We're supposed to believe John Dowd wrote pled instead of pleaded?”
Others argued that Dowd could very well have used pled as the past tense of plead. Harvard Law School professor Jonathan Zittrain noted, “I've seen lawyers write each. It's not like, you know, hung and hanged.” Indeed, both pleaded and pled are considered acceptable by American usage guides—though, in many newsrooms, pled is considered a rookie mistake, which helps explain why some journalists seized on it.
Pled actually dates back to the 16th century, and though it never gained much traction in British English, it has been gaining in popularity in American English over the past few decades. Some prefer pled because they think pleaded sounds wrong, based on analogous past-tense forms like bleed/bled and feed/fed. Plenty of legal types don't seem to mind pled, at least not in the United States. In fact, when the blog Above the Law polled its readers in 2011, 57 percent of the 1,311 respondents preferred pled to plead.
But what of Dowd himself?
I searched through the LexisNexis news database to try to find their preference for forming the past tense of plead, and I discovered an example from January 2010, when Dowd was representing the billionaire hedge-fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, who was standing trial for insider trading. As quoted in The Wall Street Journal, Dowd said of Rajaratnam, “He's pled not guilty and we intend to try their case and demonstrate that he's innocent.” (Rajaratnam was later found guilty and is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence.)
So Dowd, too, is on record as a pled user. That single word does not betray some nonlawyerly voice—Trump's or anyone else's—so we can't point to it as evidence for who really wrote that tweet. It would be a tidy solution to isolate the use of pled as a kind of “tell” disproving the attribution of the tweet to Dowd, but it is in fact exceedingly difficult to be able to identify such a linguistic smoking gun.
One skeptic on Twitter wrote, “A forensic linguist could rule out Dowd in 5 minutes. Once that happens, Trump has no backpedal.” Actual forensic linguists would be hard-pressed to rule Dowd in or out on the basis of a single tweet, however. The field of authorship analysis requires significant amounts of textual data in order to be reliable. First, one would need to compile past texts firmly attributed to the potential authors—in this case, Trump and Dowd. That could at least establish idiosyncratic patterns of style and usage, but for a low-frequency word like pled, even that approach may prove fruitless. (For what it's worth, Trump had never previously used pled in a tweet, according to the Trump Twitter Archive. Trump's only use of pleaded is from a news article they quoted.)
In response to customers' fears that birth control coverage will disappear if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, on-demand birth control startups are offering discounts.
Aaron P. Bernstein / Getty Images House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, flanked by House Democrats, speaks in support of the Affordable Care Act on January 12.
After a blood clot made it unsafe for them to take birth control pills, Liz Van Voorhis switched to an intrauterine device a few years ago. It was free — thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which in 2012 required insurance plans to cover contraceptives at no cost to customers. Five years later, though, president-elect Donald Trump's pick for health secretary, Tom Price, is on record for opposing that rule. The Republican-majority Congress is moving to repeal the health care law. And Trump has vowed to defund Planned Parenthood. Van Voorhis was counting on the birth control mandate to cover a new IUD in 2017, and would have trouble single-handedly affording a device, which costs up to $1,000. But if that mandate vanishes along with the health care law Trump has sworn to repeal, they fear that they would no longer qualify for insurance coverage because they have diabetes, an expensive condition. “I shouldn't have to make the decision between my health and if I can afford it,” the 37-year-old told BuzzFeed News. Van Voorhis isn't the only woman worried about affording and accessing birth control under Trump: Planned Parenthood's president told CNN last week that the organization has seen a 900% increase in women trying to get IUDs. Those fears have also translated into a reported uptick in business for on-demand birth control startups — like the Pill Club, Nurx, and Maven — that in response are temporarily making it cheaper and easier to order contraception through their apps and websites. These promotions aren't entirely altruistic, of course. In the unprecedented political climate, capitalizing on concerns is also a way to gain new customers. “Our own patients were [asking], especially after the election, ‘What's going to happen to my coverage?'” said Nick Chang, CEO of the Pill Club, a Silicon Valley startup that writes and fills birth control prescriptions. “We have only so much we can control in terms of what Trump and [vice-president-elect Mike] Pence and Price do. But one of the ways that we can help patients right now and prepare them for anything that happens down the line is to give them protection and backup options.”
Nurx An ad for Nurx's December promotion.
Since December, the Pill Club has been offering the Fallback Solo emergency contraceptive for free to customers with insurance; doses vary from six a year to one every three months, depending on coverage. (Emergency contraception is also covered by the birth control mandate.) The Pill Club only writes prescriptions in California, but can ship to people who already have prescriptions across 10 states. Until the end of January, New York City-based Maven is offering customers a free telemedicine visit with a doctor or nurse to get a birth control prescription, or just reproductive health advice. Maven, which can prescribe in 47 states, ships orders to a pharmacy for the customer to pick up. “A lot of women have been writing in, asking questions, talking about how nervous they are,” CEO Katherine Ryder said. (She added that not all patients were worried. When Maven referenced a “stressful” election in an email to clients offering mental health visit discounts, “a lot of people wrote back and said they weren't stressed at all,” Ryder said.) Nurx, a Y Combinator startup that raised $5.3 million last fall, gave new customers $45 toward birth control in December. It's doing so again in January (promo code: “TinyHands”). The startup, which also covers delivery costs, ships to California, Washington state, Washington, DC, New York, Pennsylvania, and, as of last week, Virginia and Illinois.

“We have a lot of users who are concerned that they would lose access to birth control and certain users who were talking about stockpiling birth control,” said Hans Gangeskar, who co-founded the San Francisco startup. Nurx doesn't encourage hoarding, and birth control pills usually expire after about 12 months, but “we always think it's a good idea for women to have an extra pack or two, from a logistical perspective,” they said. The birth control mandate is rooted in the Affordable Care Act, but the law doesn't have to be repealed for the mandate to end. The law says insurance must cover preventive health benefits for women, and leaves it up to the Department of Health and Human Services to decide what counts. In 2011, it decided that birth control counted. (The rule was later clarified to mean that of the 18 categories of birth control that are FDA-approved, most insurers have to cover at least one drug or device in each category. That means, for instance, that some health plans cover certain brands of birth control pills at no cost to consumers, but don't cover others.) The new administration could simply write a regulation that says otherwise. “That policy of requiring no co-pay for contraceptive coverage was huge and allowed many millions of women access to birth control care in a way that made it accessible and affordable,” said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, senior federal policy advisor at the Center for Reproductive Rights, an advocacy group. “That policy and that access is really threatened,” particularly for low-income women and women of color. Still, it's hard to predict how quickly the Affordable Care Act as a whole will actually go away, and whether or not alternative sources of birth control, like startups, could become crucial as a result. The startups also say they are optimistic about staying operational even without the health care law: “You will need the pill whether you have Obamacare or not,” Chang said in an email.
Repealing the law may be more difficult than initially portrayed by the Republicans who repeatedly campaigned on that pledge. Congress moved forward last week on setting up a repeal bill, but GOP leaders — and Trump themselves — are offering mixed messages on if they'll establish an alternative and what that might be. Some 20 million Americans received insurance coverage under the law. Even if the birth control mandate were to go away, that doesn't mean that all women would have to pay out of pocket for it.

You're no Ronald Reagan. No, YOU'RE no Ronald Reagan.
This weekend, some hot Rand Paul–on–Rick Perry action broke out in our nation's op-ed pages. Paul wrote an op-ed last month opposing military intervention against ISIS rebels in Iraq. On Friday, Perry wrote an op-ed of their own calling Paul an isolationist. Today Paul has another op-ed responding to Perry.
As is often the case with intra-Republican squabbles, the dispute has taken the form of a Reagan-Off. All sides take as settled fact the premise that Reagan revealed the truth to the world in its entirety forever and ever, and any revisions to the Party canon must make the case that rival claimants have incorrectly interpreted the Reagan writ. The ritual can be seen in the dueling op-eds.
Accordingly, Paul's initial foray opens, “Though many claim the mantle of Ronald Reagan on foreign policy, too few look at how they really conducted it,” and builds up to a rousing call for “a new approach, one that emulates Reagan's policies, puts America first, seeks peace, faces war reluctantly, and when necessary acts fully and decisively.” In conclusion, Ronald Reagan.
Perry replies that they will see Paul's mere four Reagan references and double them:
Paul still advocates inaction, going so far as to claim in an op-ed last month in The Wall Street Journal that President Ronald Reagan's own doctrines would lead them to same conclusion … Paul conveniently omitted Reagan's long internationalist record of leading the world with moral and strategic clarity. Unlike the noninterventionists of today, Reagan believed that our security and economic prosperity require persistent engagement and leadership abroad. He, like Eisenhower before him, refused to heed “the false prophets of living alone.” Reagan identified Soviet communism as an existential threat to our national security and Western values, and they confronted this threat in every theater. Today, we count their many actions as critical to the ultimate defeat of the Soviet Union and the freeing of hundreds of millions from tyranny. At the time, though, there were those who said that Reagan's policies would push the Soviets to war … I personally don't believe in a wait-and-see foreign policy for the United States. Neither would Reagan. Reagan led proudly from the front, not from behind; and when they drew a “red line,” the world knew exactly what that meant. But in today's world, with today's threats, we still cannot “take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost.” That was President Reagan's warning. Sen. Paul would be wise to heed it.
Paul today replies, oh, no — you don't Reagan my Reagan, I Reagan your Reagan:
This is where many in my own party, similar to Perry, get it so wrong regarding Ronald Reagan's doctrine of “peace through strength.” Strength does not always mean war. Reagan ended the Cold War without going to war with Russia. They achieved a relative peace with the Soviet Union — the greatest existential threat to the United States in our history — through strong diplomacy and moral leadership. Reagan had no easy options either. But they did the best they could with the hand they were dealt. Some of Reagan's Republican champions today praise their rhetoric but forget their actions. Reagan was stern, but they aren't stupid. Reagan hated war, particularly the specter of nuclear war. Unlike their more hawkish critics — and there were many — Reagan was always thoughtful and cautious.
The winner of this debate will meet Scott Walker, who hosts an annual dinner on Reagan's birthday serving Reagan's favorite foods, including macaroni-and-cheese casserole and jelly beans.

Buying and wearing a Spirit Hood is a clear and concise way of letting people know that you're the kind of person who buys and wears a Spirit Hood, and there's really no better indication that you hate life and want to be left alone forever. If anyone does approach you to comment on your scarf, you get to correct them and say "Actually, it's called a 'Spirit Hood,' " which guarantees the end of that and all conversations. Nasty Rabbit is my favorite because, while all of these designs scream, "I'm not normally around people," Nasty Rabbit is the only one that adds "and I'm really quite happy about it."
"If you try to start a conversation with me I swear to God I'm going to ask to babysit your kids."

And just in case you ladies out there were worried that you'd have no way to tell the rest of the world that your spirit animal is Accepted Loneliness, don't worry -- they sell Spirit Hoods for women, too.
Spirit Hoods allow you to wordlessly combine your twin loves of discomfort and impracticality. When the rest of society sees you with a delicately-skinned stuffed animal dripping down your back, they'll know at an immediate glance that they should not invite you to a party or engage in conversation with you, as you will be far too busy punishing yourself for being the kind of person who thinks buying a probably-shedding soft cheetah helmet is a good idea.

Dan's Fashion "Do": If you're hoping for a summer of complete solitude while all of your friends abandon you as "too far gone," I'd recommend buying no less than two Spirit Hoods. (They're only $130 each.) Having a variety of Spirit Hoods is like- oh holy shit -- $130, really? Jesus. Anyway, having a variety of Spirit Hoods is like posting a suicide note that also insults all of your friends and loved ones. It shows everyone that you're right on the edge while reminding them that you're not really worth saving.
Bitcoin Legislation in North Carolina
Jameson Lopp Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 2, 2015
I've lived in North Carolina my entire life. It's a great place to live and has a thriving tech scene in the Raleigh-Durham area that has provided me with great employment opportunities. However, despite the local tech scene, the Bitcoin related activity in North Carolina is negligible. Which is why it was quite surprising to learn that a bill has been moving through our legislature that intends to further regulate businesses that handle digital currency. The following is what I've learned over the past few months regarding “AN ACT TO ENACT THE NORTH CAROLINA MONEY TRANSMITTERS ACT AS REQUESTED BY THE OFFICE OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.”
This bill began its life in the NC House as H289. It was sponsored by three people, but the primary sponsor was Representative Stephen Ross, who just so happens to be an Executive Vice President at Wells Fargo. Surely this is just a coincidence!
After making it out of committee, the bill was then voted on by the House:
H289's History
Once it was passed by the house it was sent to the Senate with the instructions to rewrite the bill using H289 as a framework. This is where the Banking Commission got involved and created S680. You can read the text of S680 here.
S680's History
As you can see here, S680 passed its first Rules and Operations committee reading but was sent to the Finance Committee in April 2015 and has had no further action. Luckily for us, S680 did not make it to the floor for a vote during this session, but it will be on the agenda again in Spring of 2016.
S680 was drafted by the NC Banking Commission but then submitted to the Senate by Rick Gunn as the main sponsor. The involvement and process of the Banking Commission in S680 was enumerated in our recent meetup panel that was attended by some Banking Commission representatives. According to the Banking Commission, they have undertaken this proposed legislation at the request of companies that are seeking regulatory clarity around digital currency. The Banking Commission is not willing to name specific companies, but we can connect the dots with some additional public information.
You may recall that Coinbase publicly stated their opinion of NC's proposed legislation. They noted several of the “positive” points of the legislation, such as:
However, what was not noted was that “permissible investments” only covers the requirements for not operating as a fractional reserve. It does not cover other requirements that I'll outline later.
Coinbase claimed that “North Carolina is a state promoting innovation and regulatory efficiency into its regulatory framework,” but was this proposal really just due to the foresight and hard work of the NC Banking Commission and NC legislators?
I've searched the NC Dept of Secretary of State's database for every Bitcoin company with more than $10M in venture capital and the only company I can find with lobbyists in NC is Coinbase.
Coinbase has hired two lobbyists in NC
I've never hired a lobbyist, but I'm reasonably sure that they are not affordably priced. It appears that Coinbase has not merely been responding to requests from government authorities, but has been actively promoting the idea of enacting additional regulations. From Coinbase's perspective, investing in lobbyists to enact regulations beneficial to their business is a smart move. But if Coinbase stands to gain, who stands to lose?
Those of us in NC have quite a few concerns about this bill, mainly around how it creates a high barrier to entry for people to innovate in the digital currency space. The Banking Commission says that they drafted this bill due to demand from companies for regulatory clarity, which is a reasonable explanation, except that this bill does not at all clarify which business models fall under the money transmission guidelines and which are exempt. I specifically asked the Bank Supervision Attorney from the North Carolina Office of Commissioner of Banks whether or not BitGo's non-custodial multi-sig model would fall under the legislation and they couldn't tell me — it would be up to the Commissioner of Banks to decide. Check out this relevant section from the bill:
§ 53–208.44 (d) The Commissioner may, by rule or by order, exempt from all or part of this Article any person, transaction, or class of persons or transactions if the Commissioner finds such action to be in the public interest and that the regulation of such persons or transactions is not necessary for the purposes of this Article.
The Commissioner has absolute power to follow or ignore any of the regulations set forth in The Articles. What's the point of all of these regulations if the Commissioner is effectively a dictator who is not constrained by them?
The proposed license requirements are quite onerous just from a financial standpoint, not to mention reporting requirements:
Net worth: The previous net worth requirement was $100K. This bill increases it to $250K. Additionally, the Commissioner may for any reason increase the net worth required with no cap that I can see.
The previous net worth requirement was $100K. This bill increases it to $250K. Additionally, the Commissioner may for any reason increase the net worth required with no cap that I can see. Surety bond : A surety bond of $150K is still required and increases based on a company's money transmission volume with a cap of $250K.
: A surety bond of $150K is still required and increases based on a company's money transmission volume with a cap of $250K. Permissible Investments and Statutory Trust: Licensees are required to maintain a market value that is no less than the aggregate face amount of outstanding transmission obligations.
Licensees are required to maintain a market value that is no less than the aggregate face amount of outstanding transmission obligations. Application fee: This fee has been tripled to $1,500.
This fee has been tripled to $1,500. Annual assessment fee: Raised to a base of $5,000 plus an additional fee for companies with transmission volumes greater than $1M:
Annual assessment fee based upon transmission volume
It's worth noting that Xapo and CoinOutlet have already left the state in anticipation of an unfavorable regulatory climate. I suspect that they won't be the last if this legislation passes.
I hope this information is sufficient to gain the community's interest. You may not care about North Carolina, but whatever happens in these first states proposing Bitcoin regulations will likely serve as a model for future states. We are already working with the Chamber of Digital Commerce to craft amendments that would exempt a number of entities and activities from this legislation, but I'd much prefer a multi-pronged approach; my preference would be to see this go the way of California's AB-1326. I'm calling upon the EFF, the Bitcoin Foundation, Coin Center, and anyone else in the Bitcoin community with experience fighting legislation to lend their support. We can use all the help we can get.
A new report is doing circles on the tech streets around you claiming that Intel may have inked a major deal with AMD to licence Radeon graphics technology from the Sunnyvale, California-based chipmaker. According to HardOCP's Editor-in-chief Kyle Bennet's, the two companies have already sealed the deal in what is now being seen as a setback for AMD's arch-rival NVIDIA. “The licensing deal between AMD and Intel is signed and done for putting AMD GPU tech into Intel's iGPU,” claims Bennet.
The development certainly doesn't come as a big shocker as speculative reports on a possible graphics IP deal between Intel and AMD have been making it to the tech headlines for quite awhile now. Understandably so, considering that Intel's deal with NVIDIA is nearing its end.
As the folks at WCCFtech point out, the new graphics licensing deal is primarily aimed to protect Intel from any possible patent infringement claim. In fact, if you remember, the deal Intel inked with NVIDIA in 2011 was basically meant to settle a lawsuit filed by the latter over an alleged violation of AMD's patented technology.
For the uninitiated, both AMD and NVIDIA have at their disposal massive portfolios of patents relative to or directly involving graphics technologies that have come into existence over several decades. Because of the complex build of today's graphics chips, it is next to impossible for Intel (or for that matter, any other company) to build their own ecosystem without drawing flak from AMD and NVIDIA. The only way to avoid that logistical and legal nightmare is to strike a deal with either of the companies.
As for the question why Intel didn't renew the contract with NVIDIA and instead joined forces with AMD, the answer could be actually pretty simple. It is entirely possible that Intel simply received a better deal from AMD. That, coupled with the fact that Intel and AMD have a history of collaboration on industry standards on the CPU side, may have swayed the call in the latter's favor.
Chinese Oppo has launched two new smartphones Oppo A75 and A75S in the Oppo A series with mid-range specifications and with full screen displays. Both the devices are announced for Taiwan and the main difference between these two devices is the inbuilt storage capacity where the Oppo A75 come with 32GB of inbuilt storage while the Oppo A75S come with 64GB of inbuilt storage capacity while the other specifications and design for both the devices are same. The Oppo A75 is priced at NT $10,990 (around $367) while the Oppo A75S is priced at NT $11,990 (around $400). Both the device are listed by official Oppo Taiwan website and the interested users can but both the devices from Oppo Taiwan eStore online.

Viewed comparatively, U.S. income inequality is even worse than you might expect. Perfect comparisons across the world's hundred-plus economies would be impossible -- standards of living, the price of staples, social services, and other variables all mean that relative poverty feels very different from one country to another. But, in absolute terms, the gulf between rich and poor is still telling. Income inequality can be measured and compared using something called the Gini coefficient, a century-old formula that measures national economies on a scale from 0.00 to 0.50, with 0.50 being the most unequal. The Gini coefficient is reliable enough that the CIA world factbook uses it. Here's a map of their data, with the most unequal countries in red and the most equal in green.
The U.S., in purple with a Gini coefficient of 0.450, ranks near the extreme end of the inequality scale. Looking for the other countries marked in purple gives you a quick sense of countries with comparable income inequality, and it's an unflattering list: Cameroon, Madagascar, Rwanda, Uganda, Ecuador. A number are currently embroiled in or just emerging from deeply destabilizing conflicts, some of them linked to income inequality: Mexico, Côte d'Ivoire, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Serbia.
Perhaps most damning is China, significantly more equal than the U.S. with a Gini coefficient of 0.415, where the severe income gap has been a source of worsening political instability for almost 20 years. Leagues ahead of the U.S. on income inequality is India, Gini coefficient 0.368, where outrage over corruption and income inequality recently inspired a protest movement that shook the world's largest democracy. (The data for India is from 2004, however; income inequality has likely worsened since then.) Russia, which has seen three popular revolutions in the last century against the caviar-shoveling oligarchs who still run everything, is also less unequal than the U.S., at 0.422 Gini.
Here's another map, also based on the CIA data, that shows countries by whether they are more or less equal than the U.S. The red countries have greater income inequality, the blue countries less; the U.S. is again purple.
Income inequality is more severe in the U.S. than it is in nearly all of West Africa, North Africa, Europe, and Asia. We're on par with some of the world's most troubled countries, and not far from the perpetual conflict zones of Latin American and Sub-Saharan Africa. Our income gap is also getting worse, having widened both in absolute and relative terms since the 1980s. It's not a problem that the "Buffett rule" would solve on its own, but at least the U.S. political system is starting to acknowledge how serious things have become.

Last night, Teyana Taylor held a celebrity-filled listening party for their upcoming album, VII, in Los Angeles, where the likes of Chris Brown, Nelly, YG, and Big Sean were in attendance. Also in the building was the man himself, Mr. Kanye West, who decided to hype up the crowd with a little inspirational speech prior to the listening.
Now, unlike Pusha T's epic listening session where 'Ye went loco, dancing and screaming "I'm off that Goose right now," they were much more calm last night, driving home how important Teyana's album is for the state of R&B, while also talking about how G.O.O.D. Music is a collective of "Motherfuckers who believe in real music."
"Sometimes I don't talk in the most politically correct whatever the type way, but I felt like I ain't really express how proud I was, of this person, of this human being, that had the fight of this artist that's fighting to make something that they really feels, that really connects in this generation."
In support of the album, which arrives on November 4 via G.O.O.D. Music and Def Jam Records, Teyana released their new video for "Broken Hearted Girl" featuring Fabolous that can be seen below. The album is currently available for pre-order on iTunes here.
Racism hotline a 'ridiculous' solution, anti-discrimination campaigner says
Posted
A new 24-hour hotline will make it easier for hate crime victims to report cases of racial and religious vilification, the New South Wales Government says.
But an anti-discrimination campaigner said the just launched hotline was a "ridiculous" use of money that could be better spent resourcing the police force to improve its handling of the problem.
To Speak Out hotline will be operated by the NSW Police Force Call Centre with support from Multicultural NSW.
Its launch followed reports of an increase in verbal and physical attacks against Muslim women around the country after recent counter-terror raids in Sydney and Melbourne.
Police and Emergency Services Minister Stuart Ayres said the hotline was borne out discussions with community groups.
"They believe that having a dedicated line that is related to religious and racial intolerance is appropriate," they said.
"It's quite easy for us to do. We've got a number of well-trained people at the end of the phone line so we're delivering that."
But lawyer Lydia Shelley, the creator of the online Islamophobia Register Australia, said the hotline was a token gesture that would not help reduce racism.
They said NSW Police needed more officers trained to investigate hate crimes, and better training for officers who dealt with the public at police stations.
"When a woman or a man goes to report an incidence of violence or abuse that they've suffered because they're Muslim ... it is not being documented or flagged appropriately," they said.
"Rather than train their police officers, they've introduced a nice new phone number. That, to me, is just ridiculous."
The number for to Speak Out line is 1800 131 555.

Orioles third baseman Manny Machado, who resumed running the bases Wednesday in Sarasota, Fla., could go on a minor league rehabilitation assignment next week if all goes well.
Running the bases -- and making the lateral cuts that involves -- is the final step in Machado's rehab from offseason surgery to repair a torn patellofemoral ligament in their left knee.
During spring training, Machado was sidelined when running the bases because of a calf sprain, slowing their progress. They have been in Sarasota working their way back to this point.
Wednesday's workout went well, with no problems, according to a club source.
Machado will continue to run the bases in Sarasota throughout the week, including getting into extended spring training games, before the club decides whether he's ready to join a minor league affiliate.
Machado could remain with a minor league affiliate for up to 20 days before they would need to be activated from the disabled list.
The Orioles have yet to determine which affiliate Machado would join, but the club would ideally like Machado to stay nearby. Orioles manager Buck Showalter previously said Machado could do workouts in Baltimore once they start a rehab assignment.
Double-A Bowie is at home from Monday through Thursday, and High-A Frederick is at home for seven straight days starting Wednesday. Low-A Delmarva plays at home from Monday to Sunday.
Showalter has said that front office executive Brady Anderson could oversee Machado's progress once they begin playing in games.
As FPV Drone Racing hits the masses through awesome Championships like the Drone Racing League, so does awareness and interest into the hobby. Since DRL's Level 1: Miami Nights Aired last week across the globe thousands and thousands of people have been talking about it, wowed by it, and now want to compete and beat all of the top racers. With that being said, if you google "how to get into drone racing" - you'll be plagued with a million difference pieces of advice, all taking different routes, with different costs - many of which will fall short of your expectations of a drone racing experience and likely put you off for good. I'm hoping this blog post will inform you to make the best decision for how you should get into drone racing, how you can put your time in most efficiently to become a top racer, as well as helpful guidance on where to go where things go wrong - because if you've seen any drone racing videos you'll know we as pilots crash, and crash often!
With all that in mind, and so much gear and choices of entrance into the hobby, I'll be covering a few of those which I think stand out above the rest to get you racing as quickly as possible, but also in the cheapest form without wanting you to pull your hair out (there is a lot of junk out there too). The options I see are as follows:
Start on a Simulator
Start with a small drone (Line of Sight)
Start with a small drone (FPV)
Start with a racing drone
Each one has it's own little advantages and disadvantages to go with it, and for each in mind I'll be recommending products that suit each.
Starting with: The Simulator
Simulators are a great way to get yourself into drone racing - it teaches you the controls and muscle memory for flying drones, without the cost or hassle of fixing and replacing your drone when you smash it. Most simulators allow you to plug in your Radio Transmitter to the computer via USB, so you can use the same controller you would use to fly your drone once you are ready to buy one.
I appreciate this is not an avenue everyone would want to take - staring at a computer screen can get boring fast if you play alone, and they also lack that realism. You will also require a pretty well spec'd computer to play such sims, but if you have that the initial investment is a piece of equipment you will need for your drone anyway! However, for learning the muscle memory they are ideal, and initially will get you up in the air and competing the fastest (in my opinion).
DRL Simulator
Pricing: FREE
Available here.
Multiplayer? YES
The DRL simulator is awesome for many reasons, the first and foremost is the fact it is FREE. This makes it stand out above and beyond any other simulator for this reason. It supports various controllers including the FrSky Taranis series (X9D, Q7, Horus), as well as Playstation and Xbox controllers if you don't fancy investing in a radio yet. As for the simulator itself, it actually flies very nicely, and is one of the most accurate ones. The drones on here fly a little differently to the other simulator, as it is hand-tuned to behave just like the "Racer 2" from the DRL 2016 season (as well as you being able to fly all of the competition tracks as seen on TV). That does not matter all that much however because learning the stick movements required can still be done with ease.
Rotor Rush
Pricing: Free trial, £4 monthly, or £40 annual membership
Available here.
Multiplayer? YES
Personally I think this is my favourite simulator in terms of feel and how the drone behaves compared to a drone in real life. It also has many of the UK, European and even Global tracks that have featured at real life events - so if you fancy competing against some of the pros from your armchair then this is also the place to do it. I've been lucky enough to fly at most of the tracks featured in the sim, so it has some personal touches I like to it. As I mentioned above, in terms of drone feel, this is the most realistic I've personally flown, but it does come with a price (though it is only the same price as a coffee per month).
Starting with: A small (LoS) drone
They're becoming one of the most popular Christmas presents due to the range in price, but a small drone is another great way to get into racing. Flying Line of Sight (without goggles or a FPV camera), means that you get to learn to fly a drone from the ground up. It is harder to master, because as the drone changes orientation so do the controls, but it will also teach you invaluable skills you will likely require even when you do FPV racing.
There's such a huge amount of different drones around this price range, but I've chosen one that I have personally flown, and flies well. It also takes a beating (crashing), as well as being an drone that is super easy to get spares as well. This particular drone is very similar (near identical), to the small FPV drone that I'll be recommending in the next stage of the article, except for the fact it has a camera on it. You can if you have the technical ability add a FPV camera and goggles at a later stage, with many guides available on YouTube and RCGroups.com (a huge R/C forum).
The advantages of taking this route mean that you can practice indoors without damaging yourself, property or others as well as being able to fly regardless of the weather outside. I'm in the UK, so it is more often than not that we do not get to fly due to poor weather (usually rain :( ).
The drone above will come with a single battery, and will require batteries for the transmitter to function, but you can buy more batteries and all the relevant spares here. If you do not mind waiting for it to ship from China, you can even buy the drone at a cheaper price here too :) The only downside with this down is that it comes with auto-level only - meaning that if you take your hands off of the sticks, it will effectively sit in a hovered state (it will still move around due to wind, but it will stay level).
Starting with: A small (FPV) drone
The drone that immediately stands out is the Inductrix FPV. There is a new "Inductrix FPV Pro" - but this is only in "Bind and Fly" form which requires you to purchase your own transmitter and goggles. If you did want to do this then I recommend a Spektrum DX6 and the goggles linked below (Eachine VR D2 Pro).
However, this kit comes with everything you need to get into it including drone, batteries, transmitter and FPV screen. The only drawback I would say is the FPV screen - it is far less immersive than any type of goggles, though I know some prefer it. This drone is also available in BNF form (if you search Inductrix BNF) - and you can do exactly the same as above and purchase a transmitter such as a Spektrum DX6, and then pair it with the goggles of your choice.
In terms of flying, this is a great little flyer that will teach you the basics just like the LoS one above, but more importantly the basics of FPV. It will allow you to immediately get used to the analog video feed we see, as well as learning the controls without any real risk of damaging it or anything else as they're so small and light. The only disadvantage to this is they can eventually break if you crash from a large height, and they are also not good outdoors unless there is barely any wind. In terms of starting out into FPV with an actual drone though, I would say this is likely the best route.
Another advantage of going down this route is that if you use a good transmitter that allows you to go into Acro mode, you can practice the recommended mode for drone racing - though I would highly recommend testing this outdoors - it is pretty difficult on such a small craft indoors, and is actually way less fun than the auto-level mode (on this drone).
The TINY WHOOP
Now, if you have heard of the TINY WHOOP, then hats off to you - you are already further into the hobby than you realise :) An awesome guy called Jesse Perkins created the TINY WHOOP around a year ago today, by strapping a lightweight FPV camera onto the Inductrix shown above. In fact, it was the sole reason that Horizon Hobby actually started making the FPV Variant, the popularity and interest of it blew up overnight and is one of the most popular Facebook communities for drones on Facebook.
Now, Tiny Whoop actually sell their own variants; kits, prebuilts and parts - all available here - the only reason I've put them below the HorizonHobby link is that you will need to buy a transmitter and goggles separately, and for that reason it will be slightly more complex to get into (but like the rest you can just invest in a Spektrum DX6 and some goggles listed below, you will also need a battery charger but they sell one too!). The spec that Jesse sells and runs themselves personally is by far the best performing brushed micro drone on the market, as well as actually being one of the more robust as their Tiny Whoop Racer (TWR) comes with the frame pre-strengthened in all of the normal weak points.
Starting with: A racing drone
Many of you will naturally just want to jump in the deep end and start with a drone that is capable of racing - and this is fine - but you are likely to progress slower (though you could potentially have more fun than some of the other options). There is also the safety aspect to consider with a proper racing drone like this - we all crash (even the pros), but there is a huge difference between crashing in a safe way and an unsafe way - it's easy to lose orientation of where you are flying, and more importantly where you and potentially other people are as well (but this isn't a lecture on safety). Another thing to consider is that while drones are actually relatively simple, you will need to learn basic soldering skills if you do not have those already, crashes usually involve changing the propellers for the most part - but it is possible to damage a motor or some of the electronics.
With that aside, if you have friends already in the hobby that you can go and learn with, this is an absolute great way to get into it! Similar to above, the drone I would recommend does not actually come with an FPV screen or Goggles - so it is down to you to decide which route you want to take. Personally I am a fan of the Fatshark Dominator HD V3's, but these are also a £500/$550 set of goggles - that is a huge budget breaker for most, especially if you are just getting into the hobby. Recommended below are a set of $70 goggles that offer great functionality to the price and are a good compromise between using a screen, or using proper goggle optics.
Goggles (Eachine VR D2 Pro): Banggood
Drone (Eachine Wizard X220 RTF): Banggood
The drone above is known for it's robustness, but more importantly very low entry in terms of price. It features all of the normal features, software configurations and hardware you would expect on a top of the line racing drone, but at a fraction of the price. This is the ONLY racing drone I would consider at this price range, for pure racing. There are many others out there (Walkera, Blade etc etc), but they are nothing in comparison. There are also more expensive options out there, but I'm not sure personally that it is worth it for when you are just starting out.
Conclusion
Hopefully this has given you a bit of an insight into which direction you should go, rather than just make it an even more difficult decision :).
If you are wondering which I would personally recommend the most - it would have to be either the simulator route or a small fpv drone route - either of which are great at learning the ropes before you take the next step into a racing drone. It gives you the chance to learn the muscle memory you need before you step into the racing game, as well as keeping repairs to a minimum while you do that.
I hope the choices above are of use to you, but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask them in the comments and I'll do my best to reply!

April 1 orders, based on legislation signed on February 19, 1942
The Day of Remembrance (DOR, Japanese: 追憶の日) is a day commemorating the Japanese American internment during World War II.[1] Events in numerous U.S. states are held on or near February 19, the day in 1942 that Executive Order 9066 was signed, requiring internment of all Americans of Japanese ancestry.[2]
Washington [ edit ]
The first Day of Remembrance commemorating the Japanese American internment was in the state of Washington on November 25, 1978, organized by the Evacuation Redress Committee. Co-sponsors included thirty churches, veterans' groups, and other social organizations, as well as the national Japanese American Citizens League (JACL). The event took place mainly at the Puyallup fairgrounds, which had served in 1942 as the assembly center named Camp Harmony. Although initially resistant, the board of the Western Washington Fair ultimately voted unanimously to allow the event to use the fairgrounds free of charge. The National Guard provided several large trucks similar to those used in 1942 to lead a caravan from Sicks' Stadium in Seattle to Puyallup, replicating the route taken by some of the internees.[3] One of the key organizers of the first day of remembrance was Chinese-American writer, Frank Chin.
Jay Hirabayashi performs a butoh dance piece in memory of their parents, Gordon and Esther Hirabayashi, at a Day of Remembrance event in Seattle, Washington, February 22, 2014.
The University of Washington Department of American Ethnic Studies held its first Day of Remembrance program in 1997, and has held such a program all but three of the years since. At the 2008 ceremony, called The Long Journey Home, the university granted honorary baccalaureate degrees to all 449 of their former Japanese American students who had been affected by Executive Order 9066.[4]
The state of Washington has officially recognized the DOR since 2003.[5]
Oregon [ edit ]
Japanese American Memorial (Eugene, Oregon)
The first Day of Remembrance event in Oregon occurred February 17, 1979, less than three months after the initial Washington event. Like the Washington event, it was held at a detention site: the former site of the Pacific International Livestock Exposition, which, in 1942, had been the site of the Portland Assembly Center.[6]
California [ edit ]
In 2013, a ceremony was to be held in San Francisco's Japantown district.[7][8][9] Los Angeles County has officially recognized the day.[10]

In an action unprecedented for a city its size, Detroit declared bankruptcy Thursday, making a final, desperate effort to stabilize its long-beleaguered finances. The city faces numerous problems, which perhaps it could have managed had they come at it one by one like bad guys in an old Adam West Batman episode. New York City's retiree obligations are larger on a per household basis. St. Louis has lost a slightly greater share of its population since 1950. Crime in Detroit is bad, but many cities faced equally desperate challenges during the 80s crack epidemic. However, coming as they did all at once, these problems and many others simply overwhelmed the city, leaving it no better option than bankruptcy.
Detroit has to reduce its $18 billion debt burden, which will be easier inside bankruptcy court than outside, but not by much. In the face of the largest and most complex municipal bankruptcy in American history, the judge and lawyers will have relatively little precedent to go by when addressing questions about, say, cutting pensions and general-obligation bond debt. Some have predicted Detroit's bankruptcy proceedings could last five years and cost upwards of $100 million in legal fees.
The central figure in this drama is Kevyn Orr, the state-appointed emergency manager who now is, essentially, Detroit city government. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder put Orr in charge in March, after having determined Detroit to be in a state of financial emergency and that the elected mayor and city council had no realistic plan for reform.
What's most important to understand about Orr is that they are not from the public sector. They have an aggressive negotiating style honed in their years as a corporate bankruptcy attorney (Orr represented Chrysler in its 2009 bankruptcy). An emergency manager with a public sector background would have been more conciliatory with creditors and Detroit probably would not yet be in bankruptcy. But Snyder, themselves a former tech executive, said that “Detroit can't wait,” and more hardball private sector methods would be required. Orr has acted accordingly.
Detroit's bankruptcy proceedings will involve a zero-sum struggle mainly among three groups: Wall Street (bondholders and bond insurers), retirees, and Orr, acting on behalf of Detroit's 700,000 citizens. Orr believes bankruptcy is in the public interest. Detroit's taxes are already the highest in the state, its near-term prospects for economic growth extremely weak and so, in order to free up more revenues to strengthen basic services and reinvest in the city's future, it must cut the debt. Absent any debt restructuring, payments to retirees and bondholders will soon consume two thirds of all annual revenues.
Orr filed for bankruptcy because they got nowhere in their direct negotiations with creditors. Bankruptcy provides government with a solution to the so-called “hold out” problem. A government can't pay its debt--some creditors get that, and agree to accept less than their full claim, but not all will be willing to take one for the team. Some creditors will hold out, either because they believe their leverage will increase the more desperate the debtor becomes about settling, or they wager they may be able to avoid having their claim reduced altogether. Let the other schmucks take the haircut. Federal bankruptcy law enables a fairer and more efficient debt-adjustment process, by allowing debtors to enact reorganization plans over the objections of a minority of its creditors.
Negotiations with creditors had been rapidly deteriorating in recent weeks, with four separate lawsuits being filed over Orr's restructuring plan, one by Orr himself. The last straw came when the city's pension boards actually threatened to sue to prevent a bankruptcy filing, resulting in a mad dash (literally) to the courthouse late Thursday afternoon.
What are the broader implications of the Detroit bankruptcy? The first trend to watch is how state and local governments' borrowing costs will be affected. Orr has proposed deep cuts to Detroit's so-called “general-obligation” bonds, a controversial move given traditional expectations on Wall Street that these bonds are among the safest credits to invest in. The municipal bond market has already been on edge in recent weeks, following the Federal Reserve's announcement that it may soon scale back its easy money policy, which has recently facilitated extremely low interest rates for governments, just like all other borrowers. While events in Detroit may not cause investors to be more cautious about lending money to, say, Utah or Westchester County, other Michigan municipalities are extremely concerned that investors will punish them for Detroit's collapse.
And will Orr also get away with cutting pensions? Article IX, Section 24 of the Michigan constitution specifically protects accrued public pension benefits from being “diminished or impaired.” But Orr argues that pension costs are unsustainable, that, in bankruptcy, federal law will trump state law, and accordingly has called for “significant cuts in accrued, vested pension amounts for both active and currently retired persons.” Many state and local governments face deeper pension shortfalls than Detroit, and thus will be eager to learn if bankruptcy allows even constitutionally-protected benefits to be slashed.
However long it takes, bankruptcy will cut Detroit's debt, but that's a necessary, not sufficient condition of any revitalization. On its own, bankruptcy can't reform city government, reduce unemployment, bring down the crime rate, or reverse depopulation. Eventually, Kevyn Orr will exit the stage, and leave those challenges for Detroit's citizens and public officials to resolve. In the near-term, the task for Detroit city government is usefully simple: bring down the debt. If progress is made on other fronts along the way, private sector actors will most likely be responsible. Government was not the only cause of Detroit's decline, and will play, at most, a supporting role in the city's revival.

The old and mighty Hambach Forest, an ancient woodland in Germany that lies between the cities of Cologne and Aachen, has been an environmental battlefield for years. On one side, young activists living in trailers and tree houses are fighting to save the forest. On the other, Germany's second-largest electricity producer RWE is trying to clear it.
And technically, they are allowed to do so. RWE bought the forest in the 1970s so that coal can be dug out of there at neighboring Hambach, Germany's largest open-pit lignite mine.
But the highly coveted coal deposits lie beneath the 12,000-year-old forest, whose trees have been chopped down for decades to make space for coal diggers. Only a fourth of the original forest, which used to cover 5,500 hectares, is left. The open-pit lignite mine has even swallowed entire villages.
The controversial clearing work began at the Hambacher Forst with police presence
Crossing the red line
Now the battle is getting real, since RWE's diggers have crossed a sensitive spot for the very first time: The old A4 autobahn, which has been defined as a red line by anti-coal mine activists and citizens' initiatives.
North of this line, there are no trees left anymore. But south of this line, environmentalists have been trying to save what's left of the ancient forest.
For more than four years, about 30 activists have occupied trees in this part of the forest. They've built a permanent camp, and many even sleep in tree houses every night to protect the trees - because those occupied cannot be chopped down with the people in them.
In the eyes of the activists, RWE crossing the "red line" is not just a provocation and an intrusion into their habitat. It also means passing over a symbolic border, one that stood for dialogue and peace talks.
A month ago, more than a thousand people from neighboring villages came together at this very line to form a human chain that was 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) long. Their message was: up to here and not a step further, enough with the logging already.
It was the largest protest against the clearing of Hambach Forest in years, and it led to negotiations with RWE. The energy supplier was asked to stop clearing forest for coal mining south of the red line.
But now that the diggers have crossed this line, activists say RWE has officially pulled out of the peace talks. And so the battle that's been going on for years has reached a new dimension - with the largest police presence that the ancient forest has ever seen.
The energy company RWE has extended the clearing work to an area south of the former A4 route
Large scale police operation
"We counted about 75 police cars and there is a helicopter flying over our heads all the time," says one of the activists, who wants to be called Joe for their own protection.
The 24-year-old has been living in the Hambach Forst for half a year now. "I've never seen anything like this here," Joe told DW. "There's even an armored truck."
"There is a lot of state authority protecting RWE right now - patrolling the forest, searching people, handing out bans on returning to a particular site," they say while a police helicopter whirs overhead.
Previously, RWE employed its own security personnel to protect the loggers. And this security personnel is still present. But why are police now getting involved as well, protecting the logging activities of a private company?
"We're here to enable logging activities and to prevent RWE employees and machines from getting attacked," says Sandra Schmitz, spokesperson of the police department in Aachen, which is responsible for the Hambach Forest.
"We have a legal order to avert danger and to prosecute criminals - and that applies to all people and all institutions," Schmitz told DW. "In past years, the protests have escalated to the point that RWE cannot do its work without police protection anymore," they add.
Asked how dangerous these activists really are, Schmitz replies by saying they don't like using the term activists. "We regard people who throw stones and Molotov cocktails as criminals. They are not afraid to use violence. And we have to stop that."
A few days ago, a RWE employee was hit by a stone, causing a head wound and a road accident that injured several other RWE employees, according to the police. As of now, four people have been slightly injured since the red line was crossed.
Activists go to great lengths to save Hambach Forest from disappearing completeley
Civil disobedience or violent attacks?
What do the activists have to say about the violent criminals accusation? 25-year-old Tam (also a pseudonym) rejects violence, and makes a passionate plea for peaceful protest. Sit-ins and human chains are okay in their opinion, throwing stones and Molotov cocktails not so much.
The activists that have been interviewed by DW so far all seemed very peaceful. They walk around the forest barefoot, love nature, and sit around the bonfire at night playing the guitar.
But there are always new people joining their cause, some from abroad now, while others only stay for a few days, for personal or professional reasons. There is no central organization, and so no one really knows how exactly others are protesting.
"So someone could be picking up a stone at some point with others not noticing it," says Tam. "I distance myself from violence, I don't think that that's a useful strategy," they say.
"We have massive discussions about this issue at the camp all the time - but no one who throws stones will admit it at that moment," Tam continues.
Joe says the violence is usually started by RWE's security personnel, who they say has been hunting activists in the forests with dogs.
Activists live in trees to protect them from being chopped down
Tam and Joe both admit having acted criminally insofar as that they've brought logging operations to a halt by blocking access and damaging RWE property.
"But we have to do something. We can't just watch while nature is being destroyed," says Joe. "The damage that is being caused here can never be fixed again."
"Digging for coal to a depth of 300 meters is an extremely harsh intervention in nature. It causes layers of earth to fault. That is serious business," Joe says.
Cutting down forest will almost always have a negative environmental impact. Trees cool the air and store carbon, in that way slowing down climate change.
And Hambach isn't just any forest. It is 12,000 years old, and boasts an especially large amount of biodiversity. German environmental organization BUND says the forest is home to 142 species important for conservation, which would lose their habitat if the forest were clear-cut.
All of that wouldn't even be necessary, according to Joe. "We don't have to mine coal anymore, because we have enough energy resources from renewables these days. But the coal mining lobbies are hindering our complete energy transition," they say.
For many, coal means jobs and electricity
Is lignite as an energy source still viable?
So far, almost one-fourth of Germany's energy still comes from lignite. The Hambach open-pit brown coal mine alone provides 5 percent of Germany's electricity, and generates 2,000 jobs in the Rhine region. Around 40 million tons of lignite are extracted here every year.
"If you take the energy that is stored here, then you can compare it to the oil resources in Iraq," says Hermann Oppenberg, deputy director of the Hambach coal mine.
Officially, RWE is allowed to extract coal from Hambach Forest until 2040. But electricity production through lignite isn't really profitable any more - there is hardly any money to be made with lignite these days.
Ever since the renewable energy boom, RWE has been in crisis; its stock price have been at rock bottom for months. Shareholders have lost 80 percent of their stock value over the past decade.
In fact, renewable energy could completely replace emissions-intense lignite - which is also the German government's plan. Only a few weeks ago, it finally reached an agreement on a climate action plan. The plan stipulates that by 2050, Germany will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95 percent.
In order to reach this goal, virtually all coal-fired power plants would have to be shut down. After all, one of the biggest climate challenges in Germany is power generation, which creates 40 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions.
A new commission set up by the government is supposed to plan out the reduction of coal-fired power generation after Germany's federal elections in 2017.
Germany would reach its climate goals more easily if it closed all coal mines - that's what many believe
Making a global statement
Until that happens, the activists at Hambach Forest are determined to continue their fight for survival of their beloved forest, despite setbacks.
Tam has been living in a tree house in the forest for over a year now. The first tree they lived in has already been chopped down by RWE.
"It was one of the worst feelings I've ever had in my life, especially because I couldn't be there when the tree fell," they say, followed by a long pause. Just like most of the activists here, they are aware that they won't be able to save the forest. Their protest can be stopped at any time.
"Everything we are doing here is symbolic - because we know that you cannot completely stop a large company like RWE," Joe says. "One day this forest will be completely bulldozed to the ground and our camp will be cleared, we are aware of that."
"But for us, it's about making a statement and showing the public that we are here."
Forest or open-pit mining, what will remain in the end?
For Tam and Joe, this struggle is about more than just the Hambach Forest. They want to draw attention to a global problem.
"The battle we are fighting here has symbolic power for me," Tam says. "We want to set an example for the preservation of forests everywhere in the world. It's important to get active when logging is happening right at your doorstep."
And Joe won't give up that easily either. "The fight against large companies that are destroying our environment will always go on, even if we will eventually lose this battle at Hambach Forest one day."
As long as these protests remain peaceful, the police will tolerate the activists, says Schmitz from the Aachen police department. "That's part of our democracy."
"But it is unacceptable when people get hurt."

These days, an official request to review the reel-to-reel tapes from a typical Columbia Records recording session in the late '50s — say Johnny Mathis, Duke Ellington or Doris Day — brings up boxes upon boxes of reels. But Miles Davis' Kind of Blue sessions hardly dented the tape budget. Three reels of Scotch 190, at the time a workhorse product of the recording industry, hold all that was recorded at those two historic dates in 1959.
It's not much, but it reveals a lot. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Kind of Blue, and Sony Legacy (which owns the Columbia catalog) has issued a 2-CD/1-DVD box set that includes the music, an ornate book, a vinyl copy of the original LP release and, for the first time, snippets of studio chatter. For listeners, it's the closest we can come to witnessing the making of a melodic masterpiece. For Davis and saxophonists John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley, pianists Bill Evans and Wynton Kelly, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb, Kind of Blue was simply another day at work.
From their liner notes to the Kind of Blue reissue, excerpted below, music writer Ashley Kahn looks at the legendary sessions.
FIRST SESSION: MARCH 2, 1959, 2:30 p.m.
LISTEN: "Freddie Freeloader (False Start)"
Take 3 of "Freddie Freeloader" makes it through the familiar theme (loosely based on the melody of "Soft Winds") and on into Wynton Kelly's solo. Before the second chorus of the piano ends, Davis whistles off the take.
Miles Davis: Hey, look, Wynton, don't play no chord going into the A-flat ...
German arm wrestler shows off their single Popeye-esque limb
Boasting muscles a superhero would be proud of, Matthias Schlitte has good reason to be considered the toast of the German arm wrestling circuit.
But a closer look reveals that only ONE of their arms is bestowed with bulging biceps.
The 22-year-old's whopping right forearm measures nearly 18in – and is in stark contrast to their puny left arm.
Eye-popping: German arm wrestler Matthas Schlitte reveals their massively oversized forearm
Strongman: Matthias began arm wrestling seven years ago
Muscular: Matthias's giant arm bears a resemblance to that of cartoon character Popeye's
Despite its odd appearance, Matthias's Popeye-esque limb has strong-armed them into first place in a host of competitions, including the Iron Curtain Armwars in Blackburn and the German Championships in Haltern, this year.
Matthias, who has been involved in the sport since they were 16, said: ‘Many people's first association with arm wrestling is a beer-soaked bar-table and drunken sailors – which is completely wrong.'
Of how they began their career, they explain: ‘In 2004, a little bar in Haldensleben was looking for the strongest arm wrestler in the region – my first tournament and the beginning of my career.
‘Without any knowledge or practise I competed in the amateur-class up to 90kg – being only 16 years old with a weight of 65kg.
‘At first, older and more experienced fighters smiled at me for being so light-weighted, but after winning the contest the opinions changed immediately.'
Little and large: Matthias's right forearm measures close to 18"

The Japan Atomic Energy Agency is planning to melt a small nuclear fuel rod in an experiment at its research facility in March to figure out how meltdowns occurred at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant in 2011, officials said Thursday.
The experiment could offer clues about the uncertain state of the melted fuel inside the three crippled Fukushima No. 1 reactors. Removing the fuel from the reactors will be the biggest challenge in dismantling the plant.
“We hope to use the data obtained through the experiment to improve the accuracy of the analysis of the Fukushima accident,” a JAEA official said.
During the experiment, to be conducted at the Nuclear Safety Research Reactor in Tokai, Ibaraki Prefecture, nuclear fission reactions will be triggered using a 30-cm-long test fuel rod placed inside a stainless-steel capsule.
The agency will study at what temperature fuel starts to melt as well as the rate of melting.
To create conditions similar to the Fukushima crisis, in which reactors lost coolant water due to heat generated by the nuclear fuel, the test fuel will not have contact with water. JAEA is also considering installing a camera inside the capsule to record the process.
Due to the loss of reactor cooling functions during the Fukushima crisis, the fuel inside reactors 1 to 3 is believed to have melted through the reactor pressure vessels and been accumulating in the outer primary containers.
The three reactors contained a combined 1,500-some assemblies of fuel rods that were each around 4 meters long.

A Quebec judge will be subject to an official complaint over comments they made during a sexual assault trial suggesting the teenage complainant was "flattered" by the accuser's attention.

Cab driver Carlo Figaro, 49, was accused of forcibly kissing and licking the face of a 17-year-old girl who was their passenger and touching their breasts and genitals over their clothes. Figaro was found guilty in May and has not yet been sentenced.  They are appealing the conviction.
According to Le Journal de Montreal, during the trial Judge Jean-Paul Braun remarked, "It can be said that they are a little overweight, but they have a pretty face huh?" They also suggested the victim may have been "flattered" because "it is perhaps the first time that they are interested in her." They described the non-consensual kiss as an "acceptable gesture."
The CBC reports that Braun also debated "degrees of consent" with the Crown prosecutor, noting that getting consent for a kiss is different than getting consent to touch someone's behind. They said Figaro's good looks combined with the complainant's sheltered upbringing could explain why they may have liked the attention. They even went into detail about how Figaro doesn't look their age and "likes to wear cologne."
Quebec Justice Minister Stephanie Vallee has said they will file a complaint against Braun with Quebec's judicial council.
Other politicians have also condemned the remarks.
Manon Masse of Quebec Solidaire said this is another example of rape culture and "a person in a position of authority making inappropriate remarks toward women," according to the Canadian Press.
Earlier this year, Federal Court Justice Robin Camp resigned after the Canadian Judicial Council ruled that they were unfit to sit on the bench after they told a rape complainant they should have kept their "knees together."

An army officer has revealed in a blog on Spain's publico.es new site that some of their comrades are having to eat food in an unhygienic state, even posting photographs of tins of food containing worms and mould.
In a blog post entitled "Soldiers are not dogs and nor are lieutenant colonels marquises", Lieutenant Luis Gonzalo Segura de Oro-Pulido criticizes what they describe as a continuing spiral downward of conditions for the men in the forces, with food they actually have to pay for now being delivered in a substandard state, while some officers take advantage of their rank and exploit the men in their charge.
They quote a fellow soldier as saying: "They give us rations which have expired or are about to, with mould and worms inside, even though we have done 41 days of manoeuvres since September and almost haven't stopped since June".
Segura has become a well-known figure among left-wing circles for their open criticism of the army they serve, even publishing a book Un paso al frente (A step forward), and this is not the first time their blog has caused controversy. Segura was jailed in a military prison for breaching the code of conduct of Spain's military.in the summer after their book was published.
In their latest post, Segura quotes a soldier as saying that they have to pay €22 ($27.50) per day in food allowance, but the army deliberately trades in almost-expired tinned food so that the military pays next to nothing for the rations. “They report that they don't know where their [ration] money goes,” the blogger adds of their comrades.
Defence Minister Pedro Morenés has justified the move towards what the government calls “co-payment” for military rations. Arguing that covering 100 percent of the cost of soldiers' food was itself “an exceptional measure” introduced in 2001 when coffers were fuller, Morenés said that army chiefs had been asked to take the necessary steps to stick to low budgets and that soldiers were showing “solidarity with Spanish society” by taking this burden on board.
The blogger goes on to describe a high level of complaints from soldiers who feel they are not being supported properly despite being members of an “elite force” and who often have to take on work which is not their responsibility, such as cleaning and other chores. Even worse, according to Segura, is a case in which members of the Emergency Military Unit in Valencia are being ordered to redecorate the home of the battalion's new lieutenant colonel.
Segura says that it is time that soldiers were allowed to organise themselves in a union, something that is expressly forbidden by law at the present time.
In what's "thought to be one of the largest payouts to an entire community following environmental damage," per the claimants' lawyers, oil giant Shell agreed Wednesday to pay out $83 million in compensation to the Nigerian fishing community devastated by two major oil spills in 2008.
That's a considerable step up from the company's initial offer of $6,000 for the entire community, and it comes at the end of a fierce, three-year legal battle over the spills, which harmed thousands of hectares of mangrove. The settlement allots $53.1 million to the 15,6000 fishermen and farmers whose livelihood was affected -- $3,300 each -- and $30.4 to the larger Bodo fishing community.

"From the outset, we've accepted responsibility for the two deeply regrettable operational spills in Bodo," Mutiu Sunmonu, the managing director of Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, said in a statement. Controversy, however, has centered around the extent of the disaster -- Shell claimed that the two spills totaled about 4,000 barrels of oil, while an Amnesty International review of video footage concluded that the first spill alone accounted for upwards of 100,000 barrels.
Sunmonu argued that "the scourge of oil theft and illegal refining" are the "real" threat to the Niger Delta. Nonetheless, a U.N. Environment Programme report estimates that it could take as long as 30 years for the region to fully recover from the pollution Shell caused during 50 years of oil operations there.
“In effect, Shell knew that Bodo was an accident waiting to happen. It took no effective action to stop it, then it made false claims about the amount of oil that had been spilt. If Shell had not been forced to disclose this information as part of the UK legal action, the people of Bodo would have been completely swindled," said Audrey Gaughran, Director of Global Issues at Amnesty International. They added, "oil pollution in the Niger Delta is one of the biggest corporate scandals of our time."

"I'll eventually learn it by heart," a cleaner told me as they stared at the new bus numbers, which also include English letters, on my 5.5-inch mobile screen.
That was their response to my question regarding plans to revamp the city's bus service, initiated by the Department of Land Transport (DLT), which uses the English letters, B, E, G, R, Y.
The scheme is aimed at helping commuters better navigate the service as the agency is set to rearrange the operating zones, reducing them from eight to four. Each letter represents a colour indicating a specific zone. Y is for yellow, B is for blue and E is expressway, for example.
"That's an 'L', I'm sure," they said with confidence. The number they were looking at was "B53E" -- a proposed change for bus no "555".
Sirinya Wattanasukchai is an assistant news editor, the Bangkok Post.
This lady is very optimistic. Perhaps the government's ambitious plan will encourage millions of Thais who don't speak English to learn it through everyday activities.
But the plan has faced heavy criticism along the way.
I appreciate the DLT's efforts to improve the bus service. But I'm afraid the scheme misses the mark.
Instead of improving the service and providing better connections to ease the lives of local commuters, the DLT has decided to complicate it with impractical alphanumerical sets.
I'm not a nationalist. But this is different from the airport A1 bus service, for example, which mostly caters to international tourists.
The DLT should know that most of its customers who use regular bus services are Thai. Half of them may not be familiar with English, and a few more are English deficient. These commuters use the bus service because there's no other affordable option. This leads to my other concerns: The proposed revamp will see the route for each bus shortened from an average of 31km to 28km.
The department said longer routes mean longer periods of time to reach destinations. But shorter routes mean more connecting points for customers. That also means longer waits at each station due to unpredictable bus schedules, while the commuters will definitely have to pay more fares.
More importantly, the department said it wants to take some buses that overlap with rail lines out of service. This will be a heavy blow to low-income people in the suburbs who cannot afford the efficient-yet-costly electric train system.
Back to the colour code system. I don't think it's necessary since the commuters don't need to know the B53E's operation zone. From 01-999, there are more than enough for 269 bus lines. According to rotmaethai.com, the new colour code could be borrowed from South Korea. But the DLT may have no idea that the colour code in South Korea is used to help commuters identify the functions of a bus -- whether it's a feeder or inter-city service. It has nothing to do with operating zones.
If the DLT has no clue about what commuters need most, here it is: Reliable bus service.
Passengers don't want to wait for too long at bus stops, they do want friendly service, on top of bus stop shelters with properly intact roofs. Perhaps most of all, they'd prefer drivers who don't model their driving on the movie Speed.
Commuters deserve to know, when getting around Bangkok, where and how to connect to the next bus, and approximate arrivals and departures at each bus stop, via GPS, so they can make decent travel plans. They are also eager to know when the 489 NGV buses, which have been seized by customs, will be released to serve them. Or when will the e-tickets finally be introduced, the service improved or the fares raised?
The trial service will start on Aug 15. The agency promises that feedback from the trial period will be taken into account, but I haven't heard how the feedback will be collected.
As the DLT has barely communicated with commuters, even about the service launch, I am not sure they know how to prepare for the changes. Not all bus route details have be provided so far.
As is so often the case with state services, the public bus scheme has been designed by those who don't use it. Those who do use it, mostly low-income earners, will never have a say in improving it.
But I'm glad the cleaners at my office will soon learn G, B, R, Y, E, as well as what they stand for, if she's enthusiastic enough. Who cares if they miss a few buses or spends more time on each trip?
The DLT may think it has achieved its ultimate goal: Improving people's English skills.
Days after courting controversy over their purported remarks against the Congress leadership, senior leader Jagmeet Singh Brar on Tuesday trained their guns at the “coterie surrounding” party chief Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi, saying in a democratic country “so much of power never ever vested” in few individuals.
“Over the years, these few individuals treated ordinary Congress workers worse than street dogs,” they told HT in an interview. “They created a huge wall between the leadership and workers and could always be seen in the company of capitalists wearing Tom Ford and Canali Dark suits.”
Brar, a former Congress Working Committee member, reiterated that both Sonia and Rahul should go on “India tour (Bharat Brhaman)” for two years to connect directly with masses and party workers. “In their absence, a loyal and committed person like Motilal Vora can run the party affairs.”
Brar was served with show-cause notice after they reportedly suggested that both Sonia and Rahul should take a two-year break in the wake of recent poll debacle. However, the senior leader from Punjab later clarified that their remarks were “distorted” by the media and maintained that as part of the organisational reforms they had only suggested that touring the country was the need of the hour.
Asked if Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should assume larger role in the party, Brar said they are already managing party affairs behind the curtains. “With a sweet smile like Rajiv Gandhi's, they have effectively handled crisis situations. I have personal experience but will never reveal that.”
Asked if they are preparing a life outside the Congress, Brar said the ball is in the party high command's court and will largely depend on the leadership's wisdom. “Kaisa salook kiya jata hai woh dekhna hai. I have spent my lifetime in the party.”

UPDATE: Rep.-elect Allen West said media is ‘clearly misled' on their ‘censorship' comment
Florida's Rep.-elect Allen West denied on their Facebook page Tuesday that they said the media should be censored for reporting on the documents released by WikiLeaks. The tea party-backed Republican claims they said the media should be “censured” – not “censored.”
“It has never been my intent to quiet or censor the press or anyone for that matter utilizing their right of freedom of speech granted to them under this country's great American Constitution,” they wrote. “The confusion comes with the word censor…when I meant censure — in context that the media should be harshly criticized for printing the damaging documents Assange has released which so clearly puts our soldiers and country at risk.”
Original story continues below…
The government should censor news agencies that report on US documents leaked by websites like WikiLeaks, according to a tea party-backed Republican who will soon represent the 22th district congressional of Florida.
Speaking with an online radio station, Rep.-elect Allen West said that attacks on the US were not limited to “a bomb or an airplane flying into a building,” but could occur “through cyberattacks” or “through leaking of very sensitive classified information.”
“Regardless of whether you think it causes any harm, the fact that here is an individual that is not an American citizen first and foremost, for whatever reason gotten their hands on classified American material and put it out there in the public domain,” West continued. “And I think that we also should be censoring the American news agencies which enabled them to do this and also supported them and applauding them for the efforts. So that's kind of aiding and abetting of a serious crime.”
Rep.-elect West is not the first to compare the release of confidential US documents by WikiLeaks to a terrorist attack. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, and Rep. Peter King (R-NY) have made similar comparisons. Even CNN bought into the analogy, wondering if WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a “journalist or terrorist” during its coverage of the secrets outlet.
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said the person who gave WikiLeaks 250,000 secret diplomatic cables deserves the death penalty.
Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) said the New York Times, who published documents released by WikiLeaks, “committed at least an act of bad citizenship” and said the news agency deserves “very intensive inquiry by the Justice Department.”
In sharp contrast to lawmakers like Rep.-elect West and Sen. Lieberman, Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) has suggested the world needs “more WikiLeaks.”
“In a free society we're supposed to know the truth,” Rep. Paul said. “In a society where truth becomes treason, then we're in big trouble. And now, people who are revealing the truth are getting into trouble for it.”
Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) has also supported the secrets outlet, saying that “if the public doesn't know what's going on, then they can't vote intelligently.”
London Metropolitan police arrested WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange last week for a warrant out of Sweden, where they are wanted for questioning in a sexual assault case. They were granted bail by a British judge on Tuesday afternoon but is expected to remain in prison while Swedish authorities appealed the decision.

A suspect who allegedly attacked a police officer with a knife and later drove a U-Haul truck into pedestrians in Edmonton, Alberta is being investigated for "acts of terrorism," police in the Canadian city said early Sunday.
The 30-year-old man was detained after a high-speed chase through streets filled with Saturday night revellers and local football fans.
Edmonton Police Chief Rod Knecht told reporters that the suspect was in custody and they think they acted alone, but they aren't ruling out the possibility that others were involved.

An apparent ISIS flag was seized from the passenger seat of the truck, they confimed.
“We believe the individual acted alone," Knecht said. They confirmed that an ISIS flag was seized from the vehicle initially connected with the attack on the police officer.
The chaos began outside the Edmonton Eskimos football game at Commonwealth Stadium at 8 p.m. local time (10 p.m. ET) Saturday when police say a vehicle rammed a traffic control barricade and sent an officer flying into the air.
Knecht says the driver of the vehicle then got out and “viciously” stabbed the officer several times with a knife before fleeing.
The officer was taken to hospital and treated for non life-threatening injuries.
At around midnight, a U-Haul van was stopped at an impaired driving stop north of downtown and the driver sped off with police in pursuit, Knecht said.
The U-Haul hit and injured four pedestrians before it flipped over. Their condition was not immediately known.
Knecht said the apparent ISIS flag would be "part of the investigation," adding that there had been no prior warning of a specific attack.
Witness Brian McNeill told CBC they were with a group of friends in Boston Pizza at 106th Street when the van tore past on the wrong side of the street pursued by police.
"That high-speed chase should have never, ever in a million years have happened downtown," they told the station. "If you've got 20 cops chasing one guy and there are pedestrians that are walking down this road?"
The suspect was injured but not critically, Knecht said.
Marco Rubio, in their land of make-believe where people can't remember what happened 8 years ago, claims they can run the country, however their staff can't even write original speeches! Rubio is being accused of plagiarism after their speech last night in Iowa. It started off really well until they had to use their own words and no longer pick from an old speech by President Obama.
Rubio gave their victory speech last night, their victory of coming in THIRD place behind both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Their speech began:
‘So this is the moment they said would never happen. For months, for months they told us we had no chance. For months they told us because we offer too much optimism in a time of anger, we had no chance. For months they told us because we didn't have the right endorsements or the right political connections, we had no chance. They told me that we have no chance because my hair wasn't gray enough and my boots were too high.'
This opening is almost word for word Obama's victory speech they gave at Iowa caucus from 2008, which they WON, the similarities are astounding.
Obama's speech began with:
‘They said this day would never come. They said our sights were set too high. They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose. But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do.'
As with every knock-off, Rubio's speech was not nearly as powerful and inspiring as Obama's. The President's glorious speech stomps all over Rubio's substandard attempt at stealing the glory. It is apparent Rubio has never had to live in the real world where people aren't allowed to steal intellectual property from others; a world where people can't just plagiarize and get by with bulls****ting.
The Republican party is big on trying to make the Democratic party look bad, and spreading lies about President Obama. There will not be a time when Rubio will publicly admit taking Obama's speech and attempting to make it their own. Obama's speechwriter tweeted in regards to Rubio's speech, “He could've at least thanked Obama for their opening line.”
Obama wowed the crowd with their powerful speech, appealing to people of all ages. Rubio was hoping to do the same piggy-backing off of Obama's work. Rubio may aspire to be Obama and lead in their footsteps, but Rubio will never be anything like Obama.  They are lacking the wow factor, their speeches have no power, and they often fade into the background. How can Rubio lead a country when they can't even lead their own speeches?

Oct. 5, 2014 marks the third death anniversary of Steve Jobs, founder of Apple and the man responsible for launching a series of devices that changed how the world communicated.
Naturally, Jobs' successor as CEO of the world's wealthiest corporation Tim Cook took a brief moment to remember the genius at their company's helm. In a note sent to all Apple employees last week and obtained by iClarified, Cook calls on all 13,000 of all Apple's workers to pause and reflect on the legacy left behind by Apple's iconic founder.
"I hope you'll take a moment to appreciate the many ways Steve made our world better," Cook writes. "Children learn in new ways thanks to the products they dreamed up. The most creative people on earth use them to compose symphonies and pop songs, and write everything from novels to poetry to text messages. Steve's life's work produced the canvas on which artists now create masterpieces."
"Steve's vision extended far beyond the years they were alive, and the values on which they built Apple will always be with us," they add. "Many of the ideas and projects we're working on today got started after they died, but their influence on them - and on all of us - is unmistakeable."
It's not surprising for Cook to cherish Jobs' memory. The two, after all, worked in the same company and shared the same vision. But Cook isn't the only high-ranking executive in a technology titan who looks up to Jobs' genius. Google executive chairperson Eric Schmidt, who has recently exchanged barbs with Cook in the last couple of weeks, says they consider Jobs as their own personal hero.
Speaking with Google senior vice president of products Jonathan Rosenberg at an event promoting their new book "How Google Works," Schmidt didn't hesitate telling a room full of 400 people who their hero in the technology industry and outside it was.
"For me, it's easy. Steve Jobs," Schmidt said. "We could all aspire to be a small percentage of Steve."
This they said amidst the overheating rivalry between Google and Apple since Jobs' passing. Last month, Cook posted an open letter panning rival giants Google and Facebook for their lack of regard for user privacy, and Schmidt fired back saying the new Apple head didn't really have a clue about how Google works. When asked on an interview on Bloomberg about what they thought about Apple's runaway profits, Schmidt retorted that "you can make a small market share with a lot of profits or you can make the same amount of money with a much larger market share with fewer profits."
Nonetheless, Schmidt took a break from the word wars with Cook to honor their old friend Jobs, whom they met in 1993 after Jobs was booted out from Apple and Schmidt was president of Sun Microsystems. They met at a presentation Jobs made of a new computer language called Objective-C. According to their book, Schmidt wasn't all that smitten with the new language but was convinced by Jobs' magical influence nonetheless.
The two eventually became friends, with Jobs inviting them to be part of Apple's board in 2006. Schmidt's place on Apple's board was helpful in incorporating Google Search and Maps into the first-generation iPhone; they even appeared onstage at an Apple event to introduce those features. However, as Google released Android a few years after, the rising tension between Apple and Google forced Schmidt to step down from the board in 2009. Jobs reportedly was furious, telling their biographer Walter Isaac that they were waging a "thermonuclear war" on Android.
Despite the technical and legal battles between Apple and Google, Schmidt still considers Jobs "the best CEO in the world today" and greatly admired the man's "reality distortion field." In their book, Schmidt and Rosenberg calls Jobs the ultimate "smart creative," or the type of person with in-depth technical knowledge and creative passion.
"Exceptional people are worth hanging out with," Schmidt said. "Because there is a good chance they are going to change the world."
