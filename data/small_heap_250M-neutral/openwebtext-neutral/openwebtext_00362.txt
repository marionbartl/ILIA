White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has been fired after fewer than 10 days in the post.
The former Wall Street financier had drawn criticism after calling a reporter to give a profanity-laced tirade against their own colleagues.
President Donald Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and spokesperson, Sean Spicer, both left their posts after Mr Scaramucci's appointment.
Chief of staff Gen John Kelly, sworn in on Monday, sacked Mr Scaramucci.
The president was also unhappy with Mr Scaramucci's performance, the White House confirmed.
Mr Trump's spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, said the president thought Mr Scaramucci's comments to the reporter "were inappropriate for a person in that position".

They have not been moved to another White House role, they added.
Mr Trump had tweeted in the morning about job and wage figures, and insisted there is "No WH chaos", referring to reports about fighting among White House staff.
Mr Scaramucci had boasted of reporting directly to the president, rather than to their chief of staff.

The Scaramucci missile did its job
By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington
Staff in this White House have the job life expectancy of mayflies. Only 10 days ago, Mr Scaramucci burst on to the scene as the fast-talking New Yorker whose fanatical devotion to the president was matched only by their distaste for the established order.
Although their job tenure was short, they managed to do a lot of order-disrupting. Press Secretary Sean Spicer resigned to give Mr Scaramucci a "clean slate". Then, like a heat-seeking missile powered by foul language, Mr Scaramucci went after Reince Priebus, who was unceremoniously cashiered on Friday.
Now it is Mr Scaramucci's turn to wipe down the slate.
If Mr Scaramucci's exit was indeed orchestrated by John Kelly, it could be an indication that the former general is quickly asserting control over what has been a rancorous White House.
Perhaps it is the first sign of order being established, even if the brevity of Mr Scaramucci's tenure - they aren't officially set to begin until 15 August - will be a short-term embarrassment for the president.
Then again, it could be that the pace of change is quickening as the Trump administration approaches the centre of the vortex. Only time will tell.
The resignation of Reince Priebus came on Friday after Mr Scaramucci posted and then deleted a tweet which many interpreted as an accusation and a threat against Mr Priebus.
Mr Scaramucci also called a reporter to attack Mr Priebus as a "paranoid schizophrenic" and accuse them of leaking information to the media.

During the on-the-record phone call, they also made vulgar statements about chief strategist Steve Bannon.
They also pledged to fire every member of the communications team, as part of their crusade against "leakers".

No. The film's starting costs will be 100% funded by TeamLiquid, not through sponsors or donations.
No. The film's starting costs will be 100% funded by TeamLiquid, not through sponsors or donations. So no Kickstarter? How will you cover the costs?
The donation/kickstarter model works for some projects, but we decided not to do it. We believe we can recover the costs through the pay-what-you-want model, even if 99% of people pay nothing. If we ultimately don't recover costs, that's OK, we're just happy something like this can be made.

This isn't going to be a completely unbiased film. Spoiler alert: the Liquid players are cool. You already knew that from watching them in the booth and in interviews. But we feel that there's a side to them that you haven't seen before, and we want to show you that. We believe strongly in our players and our story, and if something negative happens, we're not going to pretend or cut it out. We believe this film can be both awesome and honest.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.

It's been a source of torture for some time now.
Yes, just like watching Derek Jeter's smuggish expression when the New York Yankees used to win.
Wait, what I am talking about? Whether the iPad is a computer.
Apple suddenly began to insist that it is more than a year ago. Microsoft began to laugh at Apple on the subject around the same time.
Well along comes the asupervisorstioned Jeter to seemingly side with Apple. He's now a co-owner of the Miami Marlins.
On Tuesday, the team tweeted a moody and beautiful shot of them in their new office.
And what do we see? Two gleaming iPads -- they look like the latest iPad Pros to me -- and no computer.
A new era begins. pic.twitter.com/WkqL2oyn2O — Miami Marlins (@Marlins) October 3, 2017
"A new era begins," said the tweet.
Well, indeed. An era in which high-flying executives can get all they need from their tablet and keyboard, apparently.
Apple CEO Tim Cook insisted two years ago that they travel with their just iPad Pro and their phone. They said they just didn't understand why people bought computers anymore. (Thank, Tim. Yours, on my third Macbook Air.)
Still, Jeter's office has that odor of stark modernity about it. Right down to that huge hand sanitizer dispenser. Is that what constant iPad Pro usage does to the mind?
Neither the Marlins nor Apple immediately responded to a request for comment.
Who can wait, though, for a revelation from, say, Miami Dolphins coach Adam Gase, that they only uses Microsoft Surface -- proud sponsor of the NFL -- wherever they go and never touches those archaic laptops?
Hamas's Jerusalem bureau chief called on Wednesday for suicide bombings and armed attacks inside Israel in response to the recently announced plans to build thousands of housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
Senior Hamas official Ahmed Abu Haliba, speaking to a Palestinian news source quoted by Israel's Channel 10 news on Wednesday, said Israel's announcements were the Jewish state's attempt to “speed up the construction of the Temple” and that “our people need… a new Islamic intifada to strike at the face of the enemy.”
Abu Haliba called on “all Palestinian factions” to resume suicide attacks “deep inside the Zionist enemy” and said that “we must renew the resistance to occupation in any possible way, above all through armed resistance.”

Abu Halima also called for demonstrations in the West Bank in response to the renewed building.
On Tuesday, former prime minister Ehud Olmert warned that the Palestinians were “on the verge” of launching a third intifada due to their “unbearable” situation.
Do you find museums a place fit for dead people and their leftover histories? Do you find yourself falling off to sleep the moment you step inside a museum? Well, we bet you have not seen these six absolutely whacky museums that will blow your senses away and keep you intrigued for hours. Check them out:
Mayong Central Museum and Emporium, Mayong, Assam:
Mayong Black Magic and Witchcraft Museum. Picture courtesy: onkardeshpande.blogspot.com Mayong Black Magic and Witchcraft Museum. Picture courtesy: onkardeshpande.blogspot.com
Assam and its legacy of black magic are quite well known. Somewhere in the dense, hilly forests of this mystical state lies Mayong village. The hamlet is pretty famous for black magic and witchcraft and has served as a tourist attraction for centuries. Mayong is also known as the Indian capital of black magic. In 2002, the Government of India opened the Mayong Central Museum and Emporium which contains various books, mythological epics and some of the ancient manuscript of black magic and Ayurveda. If you are intrigued by witchcraft and black magic this is a museum you should not miss.
Sulabh International Museum of Toilets, Delhi:
Sulabh International Museum of Toilets. Picture courtesy: Facebook/SIJO K JOSE Sulabh International Museum of Toilets. Picture courtesy: Facebook/SIJO K JOSE
This one is still widely known because of the media coverage it has received. The Sulabh International Museum of Toilets in Delhi traces the history of toilets through centuries, and is considered one of the world's weirdest museums. Established in 1992 by Dr Bindeshwar Pathak, a social activist and founder of Sulabh Sanitation, the museum's major attraction is the replica of the throne of King Louis the XIV. It is believed that the king used this to defecate while conducting court sessions. We highly advise our readers to not practice their skills on any of the precious defecation masterpieces kept in the museum though.
Antarang Museum of Sexual Health Information, Mumbai:

It is absolutely necessary for children and young adults to be aware of their body, their sexuality and the risk of infection associated with casual sex. This museum in Mumbai serves exactly that purpose. The Antarang Museum of Sexual Health Information is dedicated to educating the young and old about the human body, sexuality and HIV-AIDS. It is the only sexual health museum in the entire South Asia. The museum was originally founded in Mumbai in 2002 as a result of the joint efforts of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) and Dr Prakash Sarang, following an increase in the number of AIDS cases. The museum has a huge collection of safe sex props and several full-blown images of sexually-transmitted diseases.
Human Brain Museum, Bengaluru:

A museum dedicated solely to the wonder that is the human brain--that is exactly what this museum is about. Located within the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), the museum displays over 600 samples of the human brain after 30 years of research. This museum was started by Dr S.K. Shankar, Professor and Head of Department of Neuropathology. The motive behind setting up this museum was to help visitors understand how the brain works and to get an insight into the kind of diseases that can affect it.
Baywatch Wax Museum, Kanyakumari:

If you can't visit the Madame Tussaud's wax museum in London, you can visit the Indian wax museum located in Kanyakumari. The Baywatch wax museum has wax figures of famous personalities such as Dr Manmohan Singh, Amitabh Bachchan, Michael Jackson and Jackie Chan, among others. You can even meet South Indian star Rajnikanth and pose with their wax statue.
Shivalik Fossil Park Museum, Sirmaur, Himachal Pradesh:

The Shivalik Fossil Park, also known as the Suketi Fossil Park, has a huge collection of prehistoric vertebrate fossils and skeletons recovered from the geological formations of sandstone and clay from the upper and middle Shivaliks. The park has an open-air exhibition of six extinct mammals formed in life-size models made of fibreglass and resin.
The Google Play Edition of the LG G Pad 8.3 is now receiving the Android 5.0 Lollipop OTA update. Your typical rollout schedule is in place, so it may be a few days before it lands on your G Pad, but you can celebrate that you are the first GPE device to receive the Lollipop update.
It appears the update runs a little over 400MB and requires that you have another one hundred MB of free internal storage beyond that to make the installation.
The LG G Pad 8.3 spent a time as the only Google Play Edition tablet in the Google Play Store. Shortly after receiving the Android 4.4.4 KitKat update in June, the tablet was dumped in a mass cleaning along with a few other GPE devices. It is great to see that the device may have lost a major sales pipeline but has not lost support.
As the name implies, the G Pad 8.3 sports a 8.3-inch display, but that number does not stop there, as the tablet measures 8.3mm thick. At this point, the device is beginning to feel a little dated on the specs sheet. Powered by a Snapdragon 600 processor and 2GB of RAM there is still enough juice to keep the 1080p display lit, and the 4600mAh battery should stand up to all of the new, unexpected, battery drains that have been plaguing many other devices now running Android 5.0 Lollipop.
Head on over to our LG G Pad 8.3 Google Play Edition review for more info on this Android tablet.
Users can begin to hit that check for update button hoping for that OTA. If you've played around with your ROM, be sure to flash back to the stock Android 4.4.4 KitKat ROM before proceeding. From there, we hear the OTA has been captured, so those inclined should be able to find it and flash for themselves, if the wait is unbearable.
What do you say, are you excited for Android 5.0 Lollipop on your LG G Pad 8.3 Google Play Edition?
I will never forget the first time I saw a performance of Eve Ensler's Vagina Monologues. My sister had invited my entire family to see them participate in their college's rendition of the critically acclaimed play. I left the performance feeling invigorated, empowered and inspired, completely ignoring all of the many legitimate criticisms that my pious Muslim mother attempted to bring my attention to at the time.
As the hijab-wearing, politically aware, suburban high school sophomore that I was, I was convinced that this performance and V-Day more generally were emblematic of the kind of work that needed to be done to confront the gender inequalities that give way to violence against women.
Looking back, I understand both my mother's and my own perspectives.
While I was hyped up from the ‘freedom' with which female sexuality was expressed, my mother felt uncomfortably oppressed by a language that reduced women to their sexual organs. Growing up in a culture where male sexuality is expressed so casually and overtly, I found the Vagina Monologue's strategy equalizing. My mother, always critical of the hypersexuality of American culture, felt that this strategy only objectified women more.
I recognize now that my own perspective was, in a way, deeply flawed- not because of my desire for freer expressions of female sexuality (which I still stand by), but because of my self-righteousness and my inability to listen to and accept my mother's perspective. In my dismissal of my mother's voice, I embodied the kind of imperialist feminism that threatens mainstream American feminism today- an imperialism I believe campaigns like Ensler's V-Day perpetuate.
It is because of imperialist overtones that I think that women like my mother feel uncomfortable labeling themselves as ‘feminist,' despite their passion for addressing violence against women and gender inequality more broadly. Mainstream American feminism does not leave room for women like my mother. And, in complete honesty, as I've developed my politics further, mainstream American feminism does not leave much room for me either.
Before I delve into the contemporary cross-section of feminism and imperialism, I want to point out that V-Day and organizations like it have done a great a job of bringing awareness to the phenomenon of violence against women and girls. I commend international women's organizations for the work they do, but I feel I must also express my criticisms in the hopes that they will encourage greater dialogue and a more inclusive, compassionate feminist mindset. I do not wish to fracture the feminist movement, but instead I hope to bridge the colossal gaps created by myopic views of women's rights and monolithic images of women's experiences abroad.
Central to my criticism of international women's work like Ensler's is the message sent about women in non-white regions of the world. Ensler maintains this image of women of color as perpetual and helpless victims of their seemingly isolated cultures of color, not only in the very few sketches of the Vagina Monologues in which women of color are actually represented but more broadly in V-Day's ‘spotlight campaigns.'
In the last decade, Ensler has called attention to the plight of women “Under the Burqa” in Afghanistan, women subject to female circumcision in the DRC (a contentious topic which, despite what mainstream American feminism might have you believe, has many feminist perspectives), and women fighting the rise of religious extremism in Iraq (a problem that is directly linked to US military intervention and occupation).
I do not doubt the severity of these women's struggles, but I genuinely worry about the way that V-Day depicts these women and their cultures. And I genuinely worry for those well-intentioned people who hear these stories without ever having had any introduction to that region's broader cultural fabric.
Because most people know little more about Pakistan than the violence and misogyny described in mainstream American culture, I find myself consistently having to confront people's misconceptions of Pakistan, its people and its culture:
“No, not all women in Pakistan have to wear that…No, not all Pakistani men hate America…As a matter of fact, my Pakistani female cousins are pursuing degrees in law and medicine in Pakistan….” I recognize that it is because of my knowledge of Pakistan and its culture that I have developed a critical lens through which to filter mainstream media's images.
That is precisely why I am fearful for those who do not have personal experiences or knowledge outside of what is fed them. When you consider books like Half the Sky, Reading Lolita in Tehran, and mainstream news more generally, it becomes easily discernable how women of color in parts of the so-called ‘developing' world are consistently represented as victims of monolithic, ‘backwards' cultures. Much like the white savior industrial complex that has developed in light of human rights discourses in contemporary politics, a feminist savior industrial complex has sprung out of mainstream attempts to address international women's issues.
Images of women as victims of violence and oppression abroad elicit pity in Western readers for their non-Western female counterparts. Pity, as opposed to compassion, depends on a hierarchy of experience whereby we, as Western, sometimes white, feminist-minded consumers, observe the experiences of women around the world as not only outside of ourselves, but also below our own. Subconsciously, or even consciously for some, we begin to assume that “our” culture here in the west is better than theirs; we forget to acknowledge that cultures are neither monolithic nor completely isolated.
The kind of orientalization that we do to these cultures, a simultaneous exoticization (us versus them) and subjugation (‘well, we're better than that'), feeds into political structures of dominance that give way to colonialism and war. When people become angry and backlash against Western cultural and political interventions with religious extremism and violence, we suddenly dehistoricize the issue and gasp at their ‘backwardsness.' The mythical binary of West versus East, first critically analyzed by Edward Said in their 1978 classic Orientalism, fuels much of the hatred and narrow-mindedness that exists in today's international political climate.
Mainstream feminisms unknowingly perpetuate this harmful binary and its ingrained hierarchy by offering images of women's oppression without nuance and without demanding self-awareness. Indeed, the type of feminism that V-Day epitomizes, and that many other women's organizations unfortunately embody, does not ask us to recognize the privileges that exist beside our diverse experiences with oppression. It does not ask us to engage in dialogue with ourselves about how our privileges might subjugate others. It does not ask us to recognize our own complicity in mechanisms of power that give way to misogyny in other parts of the world.
For example, we cannot justly view the plight of women in (Saudi) Arabia* as outside the decisions we make to sit by and let our government remain politically and economically allied with the misogynist and corrupt Saud family. If we uncritically absorb images of Saudi women as victims of a monolithic culture, we not only disempower them by framing them as victims (ignoring the fact that many Saudi women are actively fighting for their own freedom) but we also remove responsibility from ourselves, disempowering ourselves from making the kind of political moves that are appropriate for us to make without assuming an imperial international stance.
It is through greater self-awareness, its resulting humility and compassion, and increased dialogue that we can heal mainstream American feminism of its myopia.
In light of these reflections on V-Day and the state of mainstream American feminism, I ask of my fellow feminists: Let not feminism become a tool of Orientalism. Let not ‘feminism' become a reason for war and military occupation (as was expressed by Laura Bush after the invasion of Afghanistan). Let not feminism become a word that is only relevant to a small portion of the world's population, my mother not included.
Instead, let feminism incorporate self-awareness and compassion into its politics. Let feminism become an arena of discussion and dialogue, where people from diverse backgrounds can express their different experiences and beliefs. Let feminism exist in its multiple forms; let it recognize that notions of women's freedom and equality vary around the world and that one culture's idea of women's rights should never be imposed on another.
The next time you see an image of an oppressed woman in Bosnia, in Somalia, or in India, turn your gaze inwards and ask yourself what role you have played in creating a situation where these women have been victimized. By all means, reach a hand out to those organizations, especially the local, grassroots ones, that are working to address the issue, but also recognize that patriarchy is a structure of dominance that is intertwined with other harmful structures of power- and each one of us, especially here in America, benefits from those structures of power in some way or the other.
For more on criticisms of the Vagina Monologues, check this blog out and read Kim Hall's “Queerness, Disability and The Vagina Monologues.”
*Please note, I do not like to refer to Saudi Arabia as such without calling attention to the fact that the Saud family has ridiculously inserted its family name into the title of a region with religious and cultural significance that significantly predates (by centuries) their family.
GOP Joins Dems to Breakup Insurance Monopolies
The US House of Representatives has passed the ‘Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act' by a vote of 406 to 19. This legislation repeals antitrust protections enjoyed by the health insurance industry. This is an overwhelming majority vote supporting the repeal of longstanding antitrust exemptions for insurance companies and the bill has over 70 cosponsors. Representing the 5th district of Virginia, Congressman Tom Periello sponsored this bill to end monopoly protections for health insurance companies.
The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 gave insurance companies exemption from antitrust laws allowing them to legally fix prices, collude with one another, and to divide market turf amongst themselves. Spokesmen from several branches of the insurance industry oppose this legislation with many asserting that it will not help to control rising healthcare costs. The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) estimates that this legislation will save Americans approximately $5 billion per year. President Obama favors repealing antitrust protections for insurance companies.
In an interesting twist, the Senate has not stated whether or not it will consider this legislation despite its massive bipartisan support in the House. The ‘Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act' (HR 4626) is only two pages of text in contrast to the enormous healthcare bill recently stalled in the US Senate. It seems the US House of Representatives has passed a simple, clean bill that anyone can read in a matter of minutes. A total of 253 Democrats voted in favor of the legislation joined by 153 Republicans. The only nays came from a small group of 19 Republicans. The act sailed through the House in merely two days providing easy passage. Surprisingly, the passage of this historic act has received muted attention by the press.
Opinion polls consistently point to frustration amongst Americans over the lumbering and inefficient process of passing legislation marred by corruption from lobbyists. Equally unpopular are amendments loaded with pork that weigh down legislation and drive up costs. This act moved swiftly and lacks any costly amendments. As a test to the Federal process, should this bill move through the Senate it would represent a breakthrough of the gridlock that hampers the US government and fosters rewards for special interest groups over US citizens.
The official US House of Representatives long title of this act is “To restore the application of the Federal antitrust laws to the business of health insurance to protect competition and consumers.” The exact text of the bill reads:
(a) Amendment to McCarran-Ferguson Act- Section 3 of the Act of March 9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1013), commonly known as the McCarran-Ferguson Act, is amended by adding at the end the following:
(c) Nothing contained in this Act shall modify, impair, or supersede the operation of any of the antitrust laws with respect to the business of health insurance. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term `antitrust laws' has the meaning given it in subsection (a) of the first section of the Clayton Act, except that such term includes section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to the extent that such section 5 applies to unfair methods of competition.'.
(b) Related Provision- For purposes of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent such section applies to unfair methods of competition, section 3(c) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act shall apply with respect to the business of health insurance without regard to whether such business is carried on for profit, notwithstanding the definition of `Corporation' contained in section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.

by Whatsblem the Pro
In the wake of what seems to be the beginning of a serious police crackdown on Burning Man, rumors of a general strike have been quietly spreading among the workers and volunteers out in the Black Rock desert early to build the festival's infrastructure. Whatsblem the Pro interviews a cabal of DPW workers who wish to remain anonymous, other than to identify themselves as members of a group known as Reform In Our Time (RIOT):
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: Tell me about your group. Why is it called RIOT?
RIOT SPOKESPERSON: Not because we're trying to start a riot, if that's what you're wondering. RIOT is a quiet organization of people who feel that there are certain issues at Burning Man that need to be addressed. The name is meant to convey our sense of outrage and urgency; when there's a problem that doesn't really need to be solved right away, you can work within the system. When you need change immediately, you might have to kick harder than that! You can't wait for it, you have to make it happen, right now.
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: “In Our Time?”
RIOT SPOKESPERSON: Yes. Some things are just not acceptable, and if we believe in what we're doing, we shouldn't just continue to let those things happen. . . we shouldn't take it, and we shouldn't walk away from it. We should demand change, and if our demands are not taken seriously, we should enforce change.
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: You want change? What changes are you looking for?
RIOT SPOKESPERSON: Our demands are simple: We want law enforcement excluded.
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: You want to kick the police out of Burning Man?
RIOT SPOKESPERSON: People at Burning Man have each other to rely on, and they have Black Rock Rangers. We don't need outside law enforcement, and we can call them in if we do.
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: I'm not sure the various agencies involved would be willing to give up the annual infusions of cash they get from Burning Man without a struggle.
RIOT SPOKESPERSON: You're right, it's all about money in the end. We could find a different way to pay the powers that be, though. A way that doesn't involve filling our city with police officers from other cities when there's no emergency.
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: Would the basic deal with local law enforcement need to change at all, if they stayed just outside Black Rock City and only entered when called in for a specific purpose?
RIOT SPOKESPERSON: That would work. The problem is a huge growth in outside law enforcement officers invading the playa, not the money it costs. We would really appreciate them if they stayed outside and only came in when we really wanted them to.
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: What about radical inclusion?
RIOT SPOKESPERSON: Of cops? (laughs)
If the cops leaved their badges and guns at home and just be burners like everyone else in BRC, we'd welcome them just like we welcome anyone else. We'd even build them a Donut Camp! We're not against cops necessarily, we just don't want outsiders doing law enforcement in our city. We have everything we need to take care of it ourselves without any outside help!
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: You said something earlier about also wanting DPW to be paid. You want them to have a union?
RIOT SPOKESPERSON: We want DPW to have a union if DPW wants to have a union. It's hard to say how much support there might be for that. It isn't a new idea and it may not be the direction we want to go in. Paying DPW volunteers would be a step in the right direction, though.
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: A lot of people seem to think that volunteerism is sort of part of it all. . . and of course, some DPW people do get paid.
RIOT SPOKESPERSON: They should all be paid. Even if it's just minimum wage, they should all be paid. DPW workers volunteer to work long hard hours under very harsh conditions, and many of them turn their backs on perfectly good jobs to go to BRC and do that. They have to spend money just to get to Burning Man. That's enough volunteerism all by itself. Making them work for free on top of what it costs them to drop everything and come to the desert is just unreasonable, especially when paying them a modest wage would still make them the most cost-effective work force on Earth! Making them work for free and then turning an army of cops looses on the playa to harass and bully them? That has to be addressed, as soon as humanly possible!
Really, the main problem we see right now is law enforcement, and everything else takes a backseat to that. We believe the Org has the economic leverage to deal with the current situation, so we want to see our concerns regarding law enforcement taken seriously, and we want something done. If we can't get that. . .
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: That's my next question. . . if you can't get the Org to pay attention, how does RIOT intend to make them?
RIOT SPOKESPERSON: To start, as a show of strength and solidarity, we intend to stage a general strike, to prove that we mean business. On the Friday of the event, at dusk, those of us not doing jobs that are absolutely critical to safety will stop working, lay down our tools, and refuse to continue until the police leave the city. We call on all our sisters and brothers to spread the word and honor the strike. Friday at dusk, without violence, we take our city back!
WHATSBLEM THE PRO: Good luck!

OK, so I knew that Josh Hamilton wasn't exactly a star anymore—a quick glance at their Baseball Reference page tells me that—but I didn't realize things had gotten this bad.
That GIF you see above is Hamilton swinging through a high fastball and looking like a guy who has never held a baseball bat before. Yeah, going into last night's game he'd played once since Sep. 4, etc., but this was dire. It was the second swing-and-miss of an ugly, high-leverage at-bat that featured Hamilton flailing at and missing three straight pitches while the potential winning run waited on second.
Here's their first whiff, on a flat change up that stayed up in the zone:

And here's their second, on another change up that wasn't really interested in doing much but floating high across the zone:

This was a stunningly bad at-bat, one that noticeably sucked the air out of the home crowd. Here was the once-great slugger that the Angels spent $125 million on, at the plate in the bottom of the ninth with a chance to win the game, looking completely helpless. Sure, it was a lefty-on-lefty matchup, but Tim Collins isn't Randy Johnson, and Hamilton actually hit better against lefties this year than they did right-handers.
Hamilton went 0-5 last night and was a complete non-factor, and Angels fans are going to have to suffer through a lot more of this over the next few years. Hamilton is on the books for three more seasons—he'll be making $25 million next year and $32 million per year in 2016 and 2017. On the bright side, at least they aren't signed through their age-41 season.
Toronto Mayor John Tory is optimistic about what he'll be able to accomplish in their new job, but admits there are parts of life at city hall that have been "immensely frustrating."
Just a month into their new role, Tory has already presided over their first council meeting and picked the members who will serve alongside them on their executive committee.
They know, however, that they still have much to learn, including about the people who surround them on council.
"I have to get to know the people better and that's going to take a little bit of time," they said.
Tory has also learned he'll have to adjust to the time it takes things to get done at city hall — and that hasn't been easy in every respect.
"I'm used to working in a world where you sort of, if you have an idea, you have to get people to assess it and get the facts and so on, but that can all be done quite rapidly," Tory said in a year-end interview with the CBC's Jamie Strashin.
'That's democracy'
"And this is a much ... more methodical process that has many more steps in it. And that's fine, I mean that's democracy. But I'm trying to instill on things like the traffic and the transit, more of an environment that says, well if there are common-sense things that you actually can do without having to go through the entire committee structure and reports and studies and consultants, let's just do them."
Tory said he's been impressed by the civil servants working in Toronto's public service and believes they are as eager as they are to get moving on key challenges the city is facing.

"I know that what we've got is a bunch of people who really know what they're doing and want to do the right thing, but I've also noticed there's been a sense of urgency that's sometimes lacking among those people about some of the problems that I came here to address," said Tory.
Tory said that they believe there are still efficiencies to be found at city hall, which could save money. But the new mayor won't be pursuing a strategy whereby they push for generalized reduction targets, as their predecessor Rob Ford did.
"I don't think that's the right way to do it," they said.
Pushing forward
Tory believes there may be opportunities to invest in technology, which might allow residents to access services with less staffing behind it one day.
"I want to make those changes and modernize this government," said Tory.
"I believe there is lots more we can do in that area that will then also free up some resources to invest in student nutrition or transit or whatever," they added.

Tory was elected as the city's mayor in October and formally sworn into their new job in early December.
The campaign was long and saw Tory face off against a handful of high-profile opponents, including Olivia Chow, Ford, and their brother Doug Ford.
Both Chow and the Fords had served time on council prior making their mayoral runs. Tory had not.
The new mayor said there are pluses and minuses with that.
"Because I haven't been here, I'm sort of not really close friends with anybody here on the council, but I also don't have any people that I carry a lot of baggage with, or them with me," said Tory.
He'll have the chance to do that in the months and years ahead — and as soon as next month, as Tory gets set to participate in their first budget cycle at city hall.
Joe Biden should announce he's running for president in 2020. Right now.
Democrats need a singular voice representing the party. And as we saw in the recent Georgia special congressional election, that voice should not be Nancy Pelosi.
Cut the coy. Cut the Mario Cuomo routine. Just throw down Joe. You know you want to.
If you announce now, the next two years become a debate between you and Donald Trump. You become the shadow president.
You've earned it. You deserve it. You regret you didn't run last time. Because you'd probably be president right now. Beating Hillary in the primary would have been tough, but if you had, you sure as hell would have had a compelling economic message in the general election in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin for those lunch bucket voters you know so well. And, therefore, would have won.
Every elected Democrat with an ounce of ambition is positioning themselves to run. But it's just creating 100 Davids against the one Goliath in DC. There is a lot of potential talent coming up through the ranks, but if you've got an old Babe Ruth hanging around the locker room, put them on the field. More importantly, a Biden candidacy now could eliminate, at least temporarily, the emerging rift between progressives and centrists. Biden has respect and credibility from both camps. And they could keep that fight from spilling over into a civil war that could kill chances for 2018 and 2020.
Democrats need a Goliath of their own to focus and dominate the message. And Joe, you're it.
While there is talent in the rest of the potential field, Donald Trump views them all as gnats. And will treat them accordingly. But Biden would drive them crazy. Because Joe is secure about their stature and their standing. He's got weight and gravitas. And love and respect. All the things that Trump wants.
Yeah, you're old Joe. And gonna be older in three more years. And your health may decline. And maybe then you can't or won't want to run. So fine. Then you can pull it down and let some young gun run. But between now and then, you can just be another in an endless field of people thinking about running. Or you can be the one candidate who actually is running. And frame the debate for Democrats.
Yes, I'm an independent-leaning Republican. So, I'm suspect. Why take my advice? I don't see things in terms of what's good for Republican or Democrats. I see things as good or bad for the country. And as a long-time strategist who is just interested in a good contest and a lively but productive debate, I think it would be good for Joe Biden to step up to the plate and start swinging at Donald Trump's fast balls. ‘Cause no other Democrats seem to be able to hit the ball right now.
What's the downside? You could argue that it would keep other, younger Democrats from stepping up. But I would say, if they've got juice, and a compelling, relevant message, they'll develop no matter the circumstances. And if they're ready by 2019, great. Grab a bat and get on the field .
But in the meantime, Joe can command a lot of attention—and authority.
Imagine a scenario that is about to unfold. It is possible Republicans will pass health care legislation this week (or this summer). And if and when they do, all hell will break loose in the battle to frame the debate about winners and losers. Every individual with a concern, every politician with an agenda, and every special interest group with skin in the game is going to be grappling for the microphone. Leaving most Americans wondering what is real and who is right.
Amidst this firestorm, one man, Joe Biden, could stand up and give a speech that would be listened to. Why? Because he's announced he's running for president, which would give them higher standing. Because he's suffered health-related tragedy with their family. And because he's been around the block more than anyone, and frankly doesn't need it, which means they would be a politician who might be, dare I say it, trusted.
Next, imagine Joe Biden barnstorming for Democrats next year for the mid-term elections as the de facto nominee. If things keep going they way they have been, Democrats should take the House. But if Georgia is a bellwether, then there's a good chance the Republicans could maintain control of Congress if they can effectively make Nancy Pelosi the head of the party. Which they've proven they can do.
But not if it's your party, Joe. Not if it's yours. C'mon. Hug it up.
Donetsk (Ukraine) (AFP) - Pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday accused government soldiers of launching a new offensive near a prized but obliterated airport in the separatists' de facto capital of Donetsk.
The claim appears to fit with a mounting death toll reported by the government in Kiev and foreign monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
It also comes ahead of a decision later this month by the European Union on whether to extend its sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.
The insurgents seized Donetsk airport in January 2015.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko vowed to win back the main trophy of the 25-month war -- a pledge that has clashed with the West's efforts to bring peace to the European Union's backyard.
A rebel fighter who identified themselves by the nom de guerre Moskva (Moscow) said the Ukrainian assault began from positions just north of Donetsk last Saturday.
"The entire (airport) terminal was hit by air defence guns," they told AFP.
Such heavy weapons were meant to have been withdrawn from the frontline dividing rebel-run regions from the rest of Ukraine within days of a February 2015 truce being signed.
Poroshenko's military spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told AFP that "the Ukrainian armed forces are observing a state of ceasefire" and blamed the escalation on the rebels.
The truce helped contain the worst violence but failed to bring a halt to one of Europe's bloodiest conflicts since the 1990s Balkans wars.
US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt said on Tuesday they were "shocked by the escalation happening in eastern Ukraine in recent days".
- Hundreds of 'undetermined explosions' -
The scale of exchanges of heavy weapons fire appears to have grown exponentially after weeks of relative calm.
The OSCE said its teams had recorded 305 "undetermined explosions" just north and west of Donetsk between late Monday and early Tuesday.
A man who identified themselves as a 42-year-old Russian volunteer fighter told AFP that eight members of the separatist force had been killed in a town 10 kilometres (six miles) north of Donetsk since Monday.
And a spokesperson for Ukraine's envoy to OSCE-mediated peace talks with Russia said that 26 government troops had died last month alone.
More than 9,300 civilians and fighters from both sides have perished since the revolt against the pro-Western administration installed after the ouster of a Russian-backed president broke out in April 2014.
Russia denies plotting the separatist conflict, which began shortly after it seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, in retaliation for seeing Ukraine pull out of its historic sphere of influence.
But it admits that volunteer and off-duty soldiers were fighting alongside the rebel force.
The self-described Russian volunteer solider blamed the latest spike in violence on attempts by Poroshenko to revise the terms of last year's truce.
The agreement was meant to offer separatist regions limited autonomy and the right to hold local elections -- conditions opposed by numerous lawmakers and nationalist volunteer battalions who backed government troops throughout the war.
The novel "The Transhumanist Wager", by Zoltan Istvan, published earlier this year, raises a number of key questions for futurists, in a way that is intelligent and entertaining, but also controversial and challenging.
This "London Futurists Hangout on Air" will feature a live discussion between Zoltan Istvan and a panel of leading futurists and transhumanists: Giulio Prisco, Rick Searle, and Chris T. Armstrong. Questions covered will include:
• Which aspects of the near future depicted in the book are attractive, and which are abhorrent?
• What do panellists think of the basic concept of the transhumanist wager, and of "the three laws of transhumanism" stated in the book?
• What are the best ways for transhumanists and radical futurists to use fiction to engage the wider public in awareness of the positive potential of transhumanist technologies?
Live questions
Futurists who want to join the discussion about the book and the issues raised are welcome to view the discussion live on Google+ or YouTube.
Viewers of the live broadcast on Google+ will be able to vote in real time on questions and suggestions to be discussed by the panellists as the Hangout proceeds.
To gain maximum benefit from the discussion, futurists are recommended to read at least part of the book before joining the call. (Warning: you may find that, once you start, you will be hooked!)
About "The Transhumanist Wager"
The website http://transhumanistwager.com/ starts by boldly declaring:
"The Problem: You're going to die. The Solution: The Transhumanist Wager"
On Amazon (http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Transhumanist-Wager-ebook/dp/B00AQQSY60/), the book "The Transhumanist Wager" is described as follows:
Philosopher, entrepreneur, and former National Geographic and New York Times correspondent Zoltan Istvan presents their bestselling visionary novel, The Transhumanist Wager, as a seminal statement of our times.
Scorned by over 500 publishers and literary agents around the world, their indie philosophical thriller has been called "revolutionary" and "socially dangerous" by readers, scholars, and religious authorities. The novel debuts a challenging original philosophy, which rebuffs modern civilization by inviting the end of the human species--and declaring the onset of something greater.
Set in the present day, the novel tells the story of transhumanist Jethro Knights and their unwavering quest for immortality via science and technology. Fighting against them are fanatical religious groups, economically depressed governments, and mystic Zoe Bach: a dazzling trauma surgeon and the love of their life, whose belief in spirituality and the afterlife is absolute. Exiled from America and reeling from personal tragedy, Knights forges a new nation of willing scientists on the world's largest seasteading project, Transhumania. When the world declares war against the floating city, demanding an end to its renegade and godless transhuman experiments and ambitions, Knights strikes back, leaving the planet forever changed.

The Capitol in Puerto Rico. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Puerto Rico is going to default, again.
The governor of the commonwealth, Alejandro García-Padilla, wrote in an article for CNBC on Wednesday that Puerto Rico would not make some $1 billion in bond payments on Friday as it struggles with the long-term implications of its massive deficits.
"On July 1, 2016, Puerto Rico will default on more than $1 billion in general obligation bonds, the island's senior credits protected by a constitutional lien on revenues," they said in the article.
García-Padilla also emphasized the need for a long-term restructuring of the island's more than $70 billion in debt, saying Puerto Rico's obligations "must be restructured fairly and equitably" for both the creditors and citizens.
Just hours after García-Padilla's article was published, the US Senate on Wednesday appeared close to passing a bill that will allow Puerto Rico some of the same bankruptcy protections afforded to state. Those protections are not currently allowed under US law. The vote Wednesday was the last procedural hurdle before final passage, which is expected to come as soon as Thursday, according to Bloomberg.
Under the new bill, which is expected to be signed quickly by President Barack Obama, the commonwealth will have to cut some of its public services and establish an outside board to guide the restructuring.
García-Padilla disagreed with the board provision but had been campaigning for the bill's passage on Capitol Hill as recently as Tuesday.
"It creates an oversight board that unnecessarily undercuts the democratic institution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico," their article said. "But facing the upsides and downsides of the bill, it gives Puerto Rico no true choice at this point in time."
Puerto Rico ran deficits with low taxes to attract businesses for a long period of time, but businesses left as some tax breaks expired. This led to a spike in the unemployment, a crumbling economy, and eventually the crisis the island finds itself in.
García-Padilla also used the platform to criticize hedge funds that have been attempting to get returns on their huge investments in Puerto Rico's debt.
"Creditors and bond insurers have initiated multiple lawsuits and last week, hedge funds filed an injunction before the Southern District of New York claiming the 'absolute highest priority' over government resources, including those needed for essential public services," the article said.
"That complaint minces no words and states that, in 'times of scarcity,' bondholders should be paid before essential services."
In closing, García-Padilla acknowledged that the default was just another step in a strong of efforts to turn Puerto Rico around and that there was work left to be done.
Proposition 45, a November ballot measure empowering the state's elected insurance commissioner to rule on health insurance rate hikes, is drawing heated debate and hefty donations from Oakland groups with a stake in health care.
Covered California, the exchange where Californians select health insurance plans, sets healthcare standards that must be met by the insurers, and currently allows for selective contracting with insurance companies. But no agency yet has the power to directly approve or reject rate increases.
Prop. 45, the Public Notice Required for Insurance Company Rates Initiative, would change that, following in the footsteps of Prop. 103, which in 1988 set up a system for defining when car or life insurance rates are excessive. “It's not a specific rate or cap,” said the measure's main proponent, Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones. “[It] looks at the medical costs, the insured utilization, the administrative costs, their profit, and then determines what rate they need in order to cover future claims and make a reasonable profit.”
Health insurance rates have risen 185 percent in the last decade, according to the Secretary of State's (SOS) official voter guide. So far, about $37 million has been contributed to No on 45, while just under $6 million has been contributed to Yes on 45, according to the latest campaign filings with the SOS.
“Voters are going to see a ton of deceptive TV ads from the health insurers,” Jones said. “They should know that it's the health insurers that are opposing the initiative, and that it's consumer groups that are supporting Prop. 45.”
Among the principal players based in Oakland, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. has donated $15 million to defeat the proposition. The Northern California Carpenters Political Action Committee donated $20,000 in support of the proposition.
On opposing sides of the debate are two nurses associations: the California Nurses Association (CNA) in support of the proposition, with a $1 million donation to try to help its adoption. “I understand that unions get accused of being self-interested all the time,” said Martha Kuhl, a registered nurse and secretary-treasurer of CNA, which represents about 86,000 nurses in the state. “But I want to say that nurses are required by our license and by our calling to advocate for our patients.”
But the the American Nurses Association California (ANAC) opposes adoption of the measure. “On one hand, we can keep the new independent commission, established last year to negotiate rates and benefits for consumers and reject plans that are too expensive,” Candace Campbell, a registered nurse with ANAC, said in a radio ad. “On the other, we have Propped. 45, that will give one politician the power to override the rate and benefits negotiated by the commission.” ANAC has approximately 4,500 members and on its webside describes itself as the only professional organization that represents the interests of all registered nurses, regardless of specialization, clinical setting or work environment.
Kuhl of CNA disagreed with ANAC's position, saying that consumers are at the mercy of large insurance companies whose rates continue to go up. About 88 percent of California's health insurance market is controlled by five insurance companies: Kaiser, Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, Health Net and United Healthcare.
The California Association of Retired Americans (CARA), another advocacy group based in Oakland, is urging East Bay voters to support Prop. 45 and take a stand against large insurance companies. Hene Kelly, CARA's legislative director, said the proposition would help retired Californians. “Especially in Oakland, where there are a lot of working class people, it will make a difference when they retire,” they said.
Although many retired people have Medicare, Kelly said, they still have to pay a supplement, and rates for supplements go up each year.
Early voting is already underway in Alameda County, and residents can begin mailing in their ballots or find their polling place at the Registrar of Voters of Alameda County at http://www.acgov.org/rov/.

Less than a week after the Supreme Court's major abortion ruling in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, related restrictions across the country began falling like dominoes.
And that's just the beginning, according to advocates for abortion rights, who say their victory at the court will both strengthen existing efforts to beat back such laws and offer them a new set of tools for future challenges.
“I suspect that we're just seeing the tip of the iceberg,” said Janet Crepps, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented the victorious Texas abortion clinics before the Supreme Court. “This opinion is going to have long term ramifications and ripple effects in current cases and cases we'll be bringing.”
Since Monday, laws restricting abortion and non-abortion Planned Parenthood funding have already been temporarily or permanently wiped out in six states. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed a new case Friday challenging a whopping seven of Louisiana's new abortion restrictions. And on the heels of Whole Woman's Health, Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced an effort to pursue repealing laws in eight states through legislatures. (Even lawmakers hostile to abortion may prefer the less expensive option of repealing a law, rather than having to defend one that is unlikely to stand after the Supreme Court's decision.)
Related: Planned Parenthood Plans to Challenge Abortion Laws
Four of the legal victories were near-automatic. States that had been already blocked by a court from requiring physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at hospitals — laws in Wisconsin, Mississippi, and Louisiana nearly identical to Texas' — had to go home disappointed on Tuesday when the court refused to hear their appeals.
Alabama's attorney general also said they would not appeal to defend their state's admitting privileges law, already on hold from a lower court. "While I disagree with the high court's decision, there is no good faith argument that Alabama's law remains constitutional in light of the Supreme Court ruling," Attorney General Luther Strange said in a statement.
After that, things got even more interesting. A federal judge Thursday put on hold an Indiana law that, among other provisions, forbade abortion on the basis of race, sex, or genetic anomaly, and also required cremations or burials for all embryonic or fetal remains from an abortion. Judge Tanya Walton Pratt cited Whole Woman's Health only in a footnote in the 30 page opinion. But they may have been waiting to make sure the court didn't act in a way that would change their analysis.
Indiana had argued that its new prohibitions on the reasons behind abortion were intended to reduce discrimination and thus did not fall under the usual abortion precedents, which have long said states cannot ban the procedure before viability.
"It is a woman's right to choose an abortion that is protected, which, of course, leaves no room for the State to examine the basis or bases upon which a woman makes their choice,” Walton Pratt replied in their opinion.

Finally, also on Thursday, a federal district court temporarily blocked a different set of restrictions passed by Florida, including defunding Planned Parenthood and requiring additional inspections for abortion clinics. “For all that is shown by this record, the inspection provision is a solution in search of a problem,” wrote federal district court judge Robert L. Hinkle.
“Nobody has contended that the plaintiffs have done anything in connection with the publicly funded programs that is inconsistent in any way with the goals of those programs,” Hinkle continued. “The state's only beef is that the plaintiffs provide abortions.”
As for those abortions, Hinkle wrote, citing Whole Woman's Health, “A patient has a right to an abortion, within limits.”
The new Louisiana lawsuit, filed Friday by the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of abortion providers in Louisiana, challenges a kitchen sink collection of abortion restrictions. One, law, S.B. 33 “imposes a term of decades of imprisonment at hard labor for receiving reimbursement for the costs of collecting and storing tissue from abortions, but not miscarriages, for medical research.” Federal law allows for reasonable reimbursements of costs, but not “valuable consideration,” from the donation of fetal tissue for the purposes of medical research.
Related: Federal Judge Blocks Restrictive Indiana Abortion Law
Other challenged laws include requiring cremations and burials for remains, a ban on a common second-trimester procedure, known as dilation and evacuation, or D&E, and increasing Louisiana's existing waiting period between required counseling for abortion to 72 hours.
"There is no health benefit to a woman in preventing them from granting informed consent to an abortion, after they have visited a clinic, met with a doctor, and been given all the information necessary to grant informed consent, until after a three-day period has passed,” charged the legal complain. It was a seeming echo of Whole Woman's Health analysis of the benefits of Texas' law, which it said had to be balanced against the burden on women.
Another relatively novel restriction, H.B. 488, sounds similar to the admitting privileges provision struck down by the Supreme Court. By imposing new credentialing requirements on doctors, it “limits the pool of physicians eligible to perform abortions solely to those board-certified in family medicine or obstetrics and gynecology, or to residency trainees under their supervision,” according to the complaint.
“What Whole Woman's Health has done is give us a really powerful tool in support of those arguments,” said Crepps. “The court basically has said the legislature cannot pass restrictions that are a sham, where the state is saying they're intended to do one thing but there's no evidence they're going to do that.”
They said the decision would have even more impact in appeals courts like the 5th Circuit, where both Louisiana and Texas sit and which have recently given states wide latitude to restrict abortion. Several 5th Circuit judges had focused more on how much of a burden the laws had put on women rather than whether they were “undue,” in the Supreme Court's words.

The Supreme Court could not have rebuked the 5th Circuit more clearly on Monday. “The Court of Appeals' articulation of the relevant standard is incorrect,” wrote Justice Stephen Breyer. The precedent, they added, dictated that “courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits.”
Planned Parenthood's efforts will be be focused on a range of restrictions at the state level, some of which have litigation already pending. A spokesperson for Missouri's Attorney General, Chris Koster, has already said that admitting privilege and ambulatory surgical center requirements are now called “into serious question.” The group also plans to focus on clinic restrictions in Virginia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and to look at toppling more of Texas's barriers to abortion that were not directly at issue in Whole Woman's Health.
"We will fight back state by state and law by law until every person has access to safe, legal abortion," said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. "No matter how long it takes, these laws will fall." The group did not rule out the possibility of future lawsuits.
It remains to be seen whether Whole Woman's Health will be a tool against pre-viability bans on abortion at 20 weeks, on the much-challenged theory that fetuses can feel pain at that stage. “Everybody needs to sit down with the opinion and see where to go from here,” said Crepps.
“This is a really exciting time for reproductive rights advocates," they added.
Asked when they had last uttered those words, Crepps admitted, “I can't remember.”

One of the most exciting aspects of the PlayStation 3 is that it allows users to install an alternative operating system.
You can't overwrite Sony's GameOS or access privileged resources, but you can run your own applications on the new Cell Broadband Engine processor (called the "CBE processor" or the "Cell" for short).
The Cell is the mighty brain of the PlayStation 3, and this article explains how to access it by installing Linux on the console.
Brief Introduction to the Cell Processor
Before you start the installation, it helps to have a basic understanding of the target system. The Cell is composed of nine processing cores -- eight Synergistic Processor Units (SPUs) and one Power Processor Unit (PPU).
The SPUs were designed for high-speed number crunching, and each operates on multiple values at once. When you read about the Cell's performance in Folding@Home or in the Roadrunner supercomputer, the extraordinary speed is provided by the SPUs.
The PPU, on the other hand, was designed for general-purpose processing. It's not particularly fast, but it's well suited for running an operating system and managing the SPUs. You can think of the PPU as the coachman in an eight-horse carriage; it makes high-level decisions and keeps the horses in line.
An Overview of the Linux-PS3 Installation Process
When installing Linux, the first task is to choose a distribution. FixStars Solutions (recent acquisitor of TerraSoft) provides Yellow Dog Linux specifically for the Cell processor. Many users have also had success with Ubuntu and Debian.
However, IBM's Cell Software Development Kit (SDK) is only supported on Fedora Core 9 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2. For this reason, this discussion focuses on installing Fedora Core 9 on the PS3. The process consists of four main steps:
Obtain the Fedora Core 9 ISO for the PowerPC and burn it to a DVD. Download the PS3 Add-on Tools ISO and burn it to a CD. Reformat the PS3 hard drive to support Linux. Install Linux using the add-on tools.
The rest of this article explains these steps in detail.
Part I: Obtain the Linux ISO for the PowerPC
The PPU's architecture is based on IBM's PowerPC specification, so you'll need the distribution of Fedora Core 9 that targets the PowerPC. The following steps show how to obtain it.
Open a Web browser and go here. Find a mirror site for your location. In the column labeled Content, click on one of the transfer protocols (http, ftp, or rsync). In the mirror's directory hierarchy, open the releases folder, then 9, then Fedora, then ppc, then iso. Save Fedora-9-ppc-DVD.iso to your computer and burn it to a DVD.
Part II: Download the PS3 Bootloader
Open a Web browser and go here. Save the CELL-Linux-CL_date-ADDON.iso file to your computer. Burn this file onto a CD.
To boot an alternative OS on the PS3, you need a PS3-compatible bootloader. The following steps explain how to acquire this.
This ISO file contains many Linux-related utilities for the PS3, but for our purposes, two are particularly important: otheros.bld and kboot. The first file, located in the PS3/otheros directory, is the bootloader called by the PS3 when it starts in Other OS mode. The second file provides a miniature Linux environment that makes it possible to install the full kernel on the PlayStation.
Part III: Reformat the PlayStation 3 Hard Drive
The following steps explain how to set aside memory on the console's hard drive for the installation:
Turn on the PlayStation 3 and navigate to the Settings option in the main menu. If you haven't already, update your firmware with Settings->System Update. The console will restart. Select Settings->System Settings and choose the Format Utility option. Select Format Hard Disk, then Yes, then Custom. You can allocate memory in three ways: assign all of the memory for the PS3, assign 10 GB to Linux and the rest to the PS3, or assign 10 GB to the PS3 and the rest to Linux. I recommend the last option. Choose between Quick Format and Full Format. I recommend the quick version, which only takes seconds. Select Yes to delete all data on the formatted memory. Press Enter to restart the PS3.
Part IV: Install Linux Using the Add-on Tools
At this point, you should have a Linux DVD, an Add-on Tools CD, and a PlayStation with memory set aside for Linux. If everything's in order, you're ready to start installing Linux. The procedure is as follows:
Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to the console. You can navigate through the menu with arrow keys and select options with Enter. Insert the add-on CD into the console. Go to Settings->System Settings, and select Install Other OS. The PS3 will search for a suitable bootloader and find otheros.bld on the CD. Select Start and the PS3 will install the bootloader. When the installation finishes, eject the CD and insert the Linux DVD. Go back to the main menu and select Settings->System Settings->Default System. You'll see options for PS3 and Other OS, and your choice determines which operating system will start when you turn on the console. Choose Other OS and Yes to restart the console. When the PS3 restarts, two penguins will appear above a series of startup messages. Enter the bold-faced text at the kboot prompt: kboot : linux64 xdriver=fbdev video=720p The video parameter is optional and identifies your display (720p, 1080i, or 1080p). The 720p setting works well for most displays. Note: If your keyboard sends gibberish to the command line, it means it was designed for Windows. You'll need a different keyboard to continue the installation. After a brief startup check, a Welcome to Fedora screen will appear. Choose whether you want to test the DVD or not. When the graphical installer appears, choose your language, your keyboard locale, and click Yes to initialize the hard drive. The rest of the Linux installation is standard across all distributions of Fedora Core 9. Configure your network settings, your location, and the drive partitioning. I recommend that you check Review and modify partitioning layout, remove at least 1 GB from the ext3 partition, and add the memory to the swap partition. Once you're finished, the installer will format the partition. The Cell's PPU won't run office applications quickly, so I recommend deselecting Office and Productivity. Click Next to start the full installation.
When the installation finishes, Linux will automatically load when you turn on the PS3. To go back to GameOS, restart the console and press the front power button until you hear a beep. Then, to return to Linux from GameOS, go to Settings->System Settings->Default System, select Other OS, and restart the console.
Congratulations! Installing a foreign operating system on a game console is no small task, and you have every right to be proud. If you'd like to pursue Cell development further, I recommend that you download IBM's free Software Development Kit.

On Friday, August 12th, as part of research into an ongoing intestacy matter, I searched Dublin City Library and Archive's (DCLA) online historic electoral register database. It comprises an indexed set of scanned images of the surviving Dublin city electoral rolls from 1937-1964. I was hoping to find trace of Joseph McGrane, born in 1881, and I was successful. Three days later, I returned to the database to find a notice stating it had been withdrawn.
Subsequent inquiries established that Cork County Council had approached the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) about setting up a similar database, but the commissioner's response had the effect of causing the removal of the DCLA database, apparently because the information could cause “upset” to living people.
Public benefit
The electoral register took its current form under the Representation of the People Act, 1918. While its primary purpose is to record a citizen's right to vote, current and superseded registers have long-established legitimate secondary uses of “public benefit”, such as proof of identity and residency, credit referencing, historical population analysis, legal and probate research, evidence in court cases, crime detection and genealogy and family history.
Copies are routinely transferred to the National Archives, and local authorities deposit copies with local libraries and the National Library.
Until the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, there was no public restriction on the use of electoral register data. The 2001 Act provides for an “edited” register, comprising details only of those who have “opted in”, which third parties can use for commercial purposes. Yet there remains no restriction of access to the “full” register. It can still be inspected by anyone: the hard copy can be thumbed through at local Garda stations and libraries, while online (checktheregister.ie) one can “confirm” any entry where the name and address is already known to the searcher.
The electoral register is the result of an annual canvass noting, by address, each individual resident. It does not provide anyone's age or date and place of birth, nor their occupation, marital status or the relationship between family members. Clearly, the electoral roll does not constitute a census. It's simply a list of people arranged by address, much like Thom's directory. And given that the register is a public record, those canvassed could never have had any expectation that the information would be anything other than in the public domain.
Four facts can be inferred from the DCLA's database: everyone listed is aged 21 or over; those in the 1964 register can now be no younger than 74 and those in the 1937 register can be no younger than 101; few of those still alive will be resident at the same address; and, while not all, most named in 1937-1964 are now dead.
Heavy-handed threat
The DPC's threat of legal action unless DCLA voluntarily removed the database was heavy-handed. Because of DCLA's sensible 50-year cut- off there has been not one complaint. This is a widely accepted policy, one followed in the UK, where “historic” electoral registers for many areas are online up to 1960.
It is not the first time that DPC has blocked genealogists' access to public data. In 2014, DPC took issue with Heather Humphreys, and their department's decision to publish online the General Register Office's (GRO) index to all births, deaths and marriages, from 1845 up to 2013. While the publication of the GRO data was legal, security risks were claimed due to inclusion of dates and places of birth, mothers' maiden surnames, ages, links between marriage partners and marital status – all of the things that the electoral register expressly excludes. After a brief standoff, the department suggested following the practice in Northern Ireland, restricting online access to 100 years for births, 75 for marriages and 50 for deaths. Nevertheless, the online GRO indexes contain far more sensitive information than electoral registers.
The DPC's actions demonstrate a lack of judgment, taken without carefully weighing the facts. There is long-established precedent for general public access to voters' registers, copper-fastened by section 80 of the Local Government Act, 2001. Contrary to DPC's claim, DCLA's decision to publish online “historic” voters registers does not constitute a “further processing” of data beyond the purpose for which it was originally obtained – which was to be a matter of permanent public record. DCLA would be well advised to put on its best poker face and reinstate its database to call the DPC's bluff.

A day after the government announced austerity measures on the non-Plan expenditure side, official data on Friday showed the Centre's has surged to 82.6 per cent of the (BE) in the first half of the current financial year, against 76 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous financial year.
Data showed the government failed to mop up as much revenue as was planned at the time of the Budget, though it successfully reined in expenditure. The government attributed the trend to high refunds, admitting that indirect tax collection target is a challenge though direct tax mop-up pegged in BE would be met.
The Budget had estimated to be Rs 5.31 lakh crore or 4.1 per cent of (gross domestic product) in 2014-15. However, it stood at around Rs 4.39 lakh crore in April-September period.
The deficit had stood at 76 per cent of BE in the year-ago period, even then the government was able to rein it in much below than the target of 4.8 per cent of at around 4.5 per cent. But, for that plan expenditure was pruned by over 18 per cent or over Rs 1 lakh crore.
The target this year stands at controlling at 4.1 per cent of GDP, which seems a far cry at least now.
Total receipts stood at Rs 4.23 lakh crore, constituting 33.1 per cent of BE at around Rs 12.64 lakh crore. At this point, revenues (as portion of BE) were a bit higher at 35.4 per cent in FY14.
All segments of receipts — tax, non-tax, non-debt capital — were lower than proportion of BE in the first half of the current financial year than the corresponding period of the previous year.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters, “We will be very close to achieving direct tax target, but indirect tax could be a challenge.”
They said fiscal deficit is showing an upward trend because of high tax refund. As much as Rs 1.20 lakh crore of refunds were given on both direct and indirect taxes, they revealed.
The second set of advance payments fall due on September 15 and in that respect lower tax mop-up could be a cause of concern.
Non-tax revenues at around Rs 95,000 crore constituted 45 per cent of the target at Rs 2.12 lakh crore against around 48 per cent in a year-ago period.
Non-debt capital receipts were just over Rs 5,000 crore, meeting just over seven per cent of BE at Rs 74,000 crore. At this point of time, these funds constituted over 10 per cent of BE in the previous financial year. Most of these funds at over Rs 58,000 crore are to come from various direct and indirect disinvestments, none of which has materialised so far.
“With tax revenue growth under-performing, the budgeted target in the first half of FY15, revenue buoyancy will crucially hinge upon the success of the telecom auction and disinvestment offerings in the remainder of this financial year,” said Aditi Nayar, senior economist with
On the other hand, expenditure was managed better and contained at Rs 8.62 lakh crore, which meant 48 per cent of BE at around Rs 17.95 lakh crore. At this point of time, expenditure stood at 48.6 per cent of BE.
While plan expenditure was a bit higher (around Rs 2.46 lakh crore) at 42.8 per cent of BE (Rs 5.75 lakh crore) against 42.5 per cent in the first half of 2013-14, non-plan expenditure was a bit lower (around Rs 6.16 lakh crore) at 50.5 per cent of BE (around Rs 12.20 lakh crore) against 51.6 per cent.
On Thursday, the government had announced 10 per cent cut in non-plan expenditure, a practice being followed since global financial crisis erupted in 2008-09.
“In addition to the measures, savings related to the budgetary allocation for food subsidy and fuel subsidies would ease the pressure on non-Plan revenue expenditure side in the second half,” Nayar said.
They said even as fiscal deficit reached nearly 83 per cent of BE in the first half, a sharp slippage relative to the target of 4.1 per cent of is unlikely in 2014-15. If the government manages to rein in fiscal deficit even at 4.2 per cent of GDP, it would meet the fiscal consolidation target, through it would slightly breach the BE.
Revenue deficit, which many analysts give much more importance than fiscal deficit as this part of excess expenditure does not create assets, stood at 91.2 per cent of BE against around 85 per cent in the first half of 2013-14.
England risks becoming ‘knife-edge nation' as protections for job losses are cut back
New rules to be introduced next month risk turning England into a ‘knife-edge nation', where losing your job puts you at immediate risk of losing your home, Shelter warns today.
As ordinary families struggle to make ends meet, the coming month will see the removal of a vital protection measure designed to help people get back on their feet after losing their jobs. Under the coming changes, financial help available to renters during the first three months after they lose their job will be dramatically reduced.
As a Shelter and YouGov poll shows that over half of working families are already struggling or falling behind with their rent or mortgage, Shelter is warning that this could lead to an increase in homelessness.
The research identifies national hotspots where the risk is especially high: Manchester, Bristol, East London, Norwich and Newcastle have been identified as areas of serious concern.
One person feeling the strain is Abi Reilly, a teacher who lives in Reading with their husband and two small children. Abi said: ‘If either of us lost our jobs now, I don't know how we'd afford to keep the roof over our heads. Looking for another job while dealing with the risk of losing our current home would be unbearable.'
The changes this autumn will mean that, in over a quarter of the country, a family paying a typical rent on an average three bedroom home would need to find an extra £100 a month or more as soon as they became unemployed, or risk losing their home.
Six in ten renters surveyed said that having to find up to £100 a month would make it impossible for them to pay their rent, while nearly two in five renters (38%) said that they could not afford to find any extra money at all.
Campbell Robb, Chief Executive of Shelter, said: 'Every day, Shelter sees people worried about what would happen to their family and their home if they fell on hard times. This research highlights the frightening reality that as support continues to be cut, losing your job is increasingly likely to mean losing your home.
'We want the government to keep the support available to families who face losing their homes. Finding another job is hard enough, but without a stable place to live it's almost impossible to get back on your feet.'
Shelter is calling on the public today to ask Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to save the measure at shelter.org.uk/safetynet.
Keeping Facebook safe and keeping Facebook secure are two different tasks, Facebook's Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos said at recent conference. Security, they explained to the crowd, is building walls of defense to keep threats out. But “safety is bigger than that.”
Stamos explained that the “bigger” form of safety was making use of stolen password dumps on the darknet. Instead of simply comparing the password hashes of Facebook users with those made publicly available, Facebook buys the account dumps hidden on the DNMs.
Database breaches containing electronic healthcare records have routinely popped up on marketplaces like the TheRealDeal. Social media has been regularly exploited too. Earlier this year, 65 million Tumblr accounts surfaced for a surprisingly low price.
After the Adobe breach, we learned Facebook that the social media giant mined the Adobe data to find anyone who shared passwords between Facebook and Adobe. The accounts that used the same username (email) and password were “concealed” and received a message with instructions to update their password.
“Recently, there was a security incident on another website unrelated to Facebook. Facebook was not directly affected by the incident, but your Facebook account is at risk because you were using the same password in both places,” the Facebook message said.
Stamos explained that the social media giant hunted the darknet for account and/or server dumps to buy. The team then used a “computationally heavy” method to cross-reference the passwords found in the dumps with Facebook users' password hashes.
Facebook sandboxed the users after matches were found, keeping the possibly-compromised accounts from the public eye—until the account owner changed the password.
“The reuse of passwords is the No. 1 cause of harm on the internet,” Cnet quoted Stamos on stage. They continued “Even though we provide these options, it is our responsibility to think about those people that choose not to use them.”
The ability that Facebook had regarding cross-referencing passwords found in data breaches and those of Facebook users raised several questions. People wanted to know how Facebook could possibly check their credentials against those found online without storing their login data in plain text. The suspicion that Facebook stored account information in plain text or similar encrypted fashion was not held by a lone conspirator.
Chris Long, a security incident response manager at Facebook, explained the process after the 2013 Adobe breach. This was their reply to a commenter on krebsonsecurity.
We used the plaintext passwords that had already been worked out by researchers. We took those recovered plaintext passwords and ran them through the same code that we use to check your password at login time. Like Brian's story indicates, we're proactive about finding sources of compromised passwords on the internet. Through practice, we've become more efficient and effective at protecting accounts with credentials that have been leaked, and we use an automated process for securing those accounts.
“It can do that because passwords can be used to create hashes, but the reverse isn't true: hashes can't be used to recreate the passwords that made them,” Naked Security wrote.
Stamos explained “When somebody logs into Facebook, the password they hand over is passed through a one-way hashing function. If the result matches what Facebook has on record, that user is allowed in.”
Facebook looks for stolen password that are able to pass through Facebook's hashing algorithm. If it passes and matches the hash file on record for a particular user, “Facebook knows it has hit on a reuser,” Stamos said.
They ended by adding: “Usernames and passwords are an idea that came out of the 1970s mainframe architectures. They were not built for 2016.”
Hillary Clinton raised eyebrows Thursday when they quipped that Donald Trump has gone 'off the reservation' in reference to their frequent personal attacks.
The Democratic presidential candidate made the remark in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper.
Clinton was asked whether they felt they learned anything about how to deal with Trump's offensive comments by watching the reactions of Trump's republican opponents.
'I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak,' Clinton responded, hesitating slightly before pronouncing the word 'reservation.'
Hillary Clinton's 'off the reservation' comment came in response to a question of what she's learned about Donald Trump's offensive comments by watching the Republican debates
CNN's Jake Trapper let the comment slide - but Clinton took heat from Native American commentators who deemed their quip offensive
They then went on to say they 'could really care less' about Trump's rhetoric and said he's welcome to continue with their 'insult fest.'
The CNN reporter let the 'reservation' remark pass - but Native American commentators swiftly denounced the candidate's wording.
'She has some battle tested Native women with their campaign, but the way they have interacted with communities of color is mind boggling... "Super predators", "hot sauce" and now "off the reservation" among a huge list of problematic speech and behavior,' said Johnnie Jae of Native Max magazine, according to Native News Online.
In a statement to Native News Online, Bernie Sanders' national tribal outreach director Nicole Willis said:
'This is one of many sayings that marginalize the experience of American Indians and Alaska Natives. I'm disappointed that politicians who should have ample opportunity to interface with tribal representatives still use such expressions.'
Indian Country Today Media Network called the remark 'offensive.'
Later on Friday, in a conversation with former Democratic State Senator and Sanders supporter Nina Turner, Tapper admitted he, too, found the wording offensive.
'A — yeah, a lot of people not aware of it, but the term "off the reservation," very offensive to a lot of Native Americans. Thanks for that reminder,' Tapper said in response to Turner's denunciation of Clinton's comment.
Donald Trump is known to seize at any offensive or bizarre comments made by their opponents - but had not commented on Clinton's remark as of Saturday morning
In a 'Word Watch' story from 2014, National Public Radio explained the history of the saying.
The idiom has been around since at least 1878, and was used to refer to Native Americans who literally wandered off reservations - against the laws of the time.
'Off the reservation is a common phrase, which many people use without considering the context of its original meaning. Namely, that Native American peoples were restricted to reservations created by the U.S. government, and their freedom was severely limited by the terms of the treaties they were often forced to sign,' NPR's Kee Malesky wrote.
Malesky noted the saying, in a political context, has taken on a different meaning. According to the 2008 book Political Dictionary:
'Remaining nominally within a party, but refusing to support the party's candidate... The phrase first surfaced in the Atlanta Constitution in 1909.'
In a comment to NPR, Rob Capriccioso, citizen of the Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians, and Washington D.C. Bureau Chief for Indian Country Today wrote:
'I bristle when I hear the phrase because many of the people who use it nonchalantly have likely never thought about its origin, nor have they probably ever visited a reservation.'
SPRINGFIELD --- Gov. Pat Quinn today called on Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a court order that requires Illinois to approve legislation this spring that would let citizens carry guns in public.
The governor's move ramps up pressure on Madigan, a potential rival to Quinn in the March 2014 Democratic primary campaign, to keep the court fight alive. The Illinois General Assembly is working on fashioning legislation to put a concealed weapons law in place.
At issue is a December decision by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals that ruled Illinois' decades-old ban on allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons is unconstitutional. A three-judge appeals court panel gave Illinois until June 9 — about six months from its December decision — to pass legislation that would give citizens the right to carry guns in public with reasonable restrictions. Madigan lost a request for a review by all judges in the federal appeals court.
But Quinn said Madigan should take the issue further. The governor said the “only hope” Illinois has of keeping its ban on carrying concealed weapons intact is to go to the U.S. Supreme Court. “The attorney general ought to take a look at that, and pursue that, and make sure that this is the law of the land,” Quinn said.
Madigan said they are “waiting to see what the legislature is doing.” They maintained there would be no point of appealing the federal court order to allow concealed carry in Illinois if legislation is worked out to before the court's June 9 deadline for action. They said the U.S. Supreme Court would not consider an appeal of the case that struck down the state's current ban if it is replaced with a new law soon.
“We're watching what's going on, obviously, in the Legislature because, if they pass something…appealing the decision would be moot,” Madigan said.
They also said they do not know what the Supreme Court would “ultimately do” if it considered the case. They noted the federal appeals court order for Illinois to allow concealed weapons had broadened prior U.S. Supreme Court rulings. The Supreme Court has tilted rulings in recent years toward gun owner rights.
Illinois remains the only state that does not allow some form of concealed carry to citizens.
Quinn said the decision on whether to appeal is “up to them She's the lawyer for the people of Illinois, and I certainly respect them prerogatives.”
“But I think this is so serious, I believe in gun safety, and I think the people in Illinois believe in gun safety, and to just have a federal court mandate that we should allow loaded weapons, concealed on a person, and allowed in a public place, that's a pretty, pretty serious matter,” Quinn said.
The attorney general has urged passing a bill in the legislature, where their father, House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, has held debate in the full House. The House is considering legislation that allows concealed weapons as well as many proposals that put restrictions on where they would not be allowed, such as in churches or on public buses and trains.
A 2011 study yields surprising results.
The word “socialist” was, for all intents and purposes, dead and buried after the fall of the Iron Curtain. But it has enjoyed a huge resurgence in popularity since, oh, 2008 or so. The thing is, since we hadn't had any real socialistm for awhile, our understanding of what the term means has gotten a little fuzzy.
So the question is, how socialist are you really? Maybe none at all, maybe a whole lot, and maybe somewhere in the middle. Let's find out.
Below is a series of three pie charts, each depicting the relative income distribution of a hypothetical nation. It's color coded so as to reflect what percentage of the nation's total wealth is owned by each quintile of the population (that's a statistical term that means “fifth” – so the top quintile, shown in green, is the top 20%, or the richest fifth of the population. The bottom quintile, in dark blue, is the poorest 20%). Make sense? Good.
I'm going to ask you to decide which nation you'd rather live in. Here's the catch. You're going to be dropped randomly into the distribution and you have no control over where you land. You have a 20% chance of winding up in the top quintile and an equal chance of being in the bottom quintile. Obviously landing in the bottom quintile means different things in each of the three nations.
So, here are your three hypothetical nations. Which one would you rather be plunked down into?
Now, there's not a right answer. This is about understanding ourselves, not judging or telling people they're wrong. And I'm not keeping score. We're on the honor system and I trust you to be honest with yourself. You don't have to report your decision to me or anyone else.
This is a fun little exercise. It was concocted by Michael Norton and Dan Ariely of Harvard and Duke, respectively. They administered it to more than 5,500 Americans and published their results in 2011. What they found was perhaps surprising.
For starters, only one of the three nations above is actually hypothetical – that would be #2, where the money is distributed evenly. Nation #3, where the top 20% of the population holds 84% of the wealth, is the United States. Nation #1, where the green 20% holds 36% of the money, that's Sweden.
#1 is an idealized socialist paradise where everyone is equal. Sweden is considered by many to be one of the world's most prominent socialist societies. As you can see, it's hardly a perfect example of socialism, but you do have a far more equal distribution of wealth than you have in places like the US.
So, what did Norton and Ariely find? 47% of participants selected Sweden and another 43% chose the hypothetical perfect distribution. Only 10% preferred the US. Head to head 92% preferred Sweden to the US.
How did you answer?
This study is meaningful, of course, because it indicates that a lot of people who say they detest socialism (whatever they think the word means) actually don't. When faced with the question of what kind of system they'd rather live in (assuming they don't get to pick their status), a staggering majority of our fellow countrymen – over 90% – choose the socialist option.
No, you're not automatically a “socialist” if you picked #1 or #2. As much as we love to rely on cheap labels, the truth is that being socialist or capitalist or whatever is a lot more complex question. We don't live life by picking abstract forced choices like these and as I have noted in comment threads elsewhere, social research methodologies are often problematic.
That said, while your answer on this quiz doesn't tell us everything, it damned sure tells us something. Whether it's a deep-seated response to income inequality that you don't think about very often or maybe a certain calculating approach to risk management, if you, like a vast majority of those in the study, picked either of the first two answers, it means that something about systems that distribute wealth in a more egalitarian fashion makes sense to you, at some level.
I believe the study's results also hint at something very useful in our national character. It's one thing to identify with the haves against the faceless, stereotypical have-not horde when we believe we have some control over our destiny. But when faced with a blind draw, we make a very different decision. Fine. But what it also suggests is a path through the sound and fury and hateful rhetoric to a point of human empathy. If we don't want to take our chances on that dark blue section of the American pie chart – and who in their right mind would? – doesn't this translate into a way of thinking about the actual have-nots in our midst?
I have to think on this question some more. I hope you will, too.
The moment meant more for their mother than for former Cardinal Newman basketball standout John Collins.
Collins made their NBA debut for the Atlanta Hawks against the Miami Heat Sunday in the preseason opener at AmericanAirlines Arena. While it was monumental for him, it was even more special for their mom, Lyria Rissing-Collins.
“My mom supports the hell out of me, whatever I do,” John Collins said. “She's always there ready to support me, at a moment's notice. She's definitely excited, probably more excited than I am.”
The experience made it well worth it for Rissing-Collins. All the times they picked up their son from practice. All the times they traveled to their high school games. All the times they watched them play on television as a collegian at Wake Forest.
“It is one of my proudest moments,” Rissing-Collins said before tip-off. “He worked hard and diligently to get to this point. Coming to see their debut warms my heart. Very overwhelming.”
The venue was the perfect spot for Collins to play professionally for the first time. They grew up about 90 minutes north in West Palm Beach. After starring at the high school level, they played two seasons at Wake Forest before deciding to enter the NBA Draft. They became just the third player from Palm Beach County to be chosen in the first round, joining Otis Thorpe and Derek Harper.
South Florida hoops star John Collins from high school to the NBA. Collins starred at Cardinal Newman in West Palm Beach before playing two years of college basketball at Wake Forest. On June 22, 2017 they were drafted at No. 19 by the Atlanta Hawks, and they made their preseason debut at AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami against the Heat on Oct. 1.
“It's kind of cool having my first, true professional game in South Florida, back home,” said Collins, a 6-foot-10 power forward. “It's kind of crazy. I got a lot of people coming to see me but definitely a good experience. I'm happy to get it started back home.”
Collins had about 100 family members and friends in attendance. They were scattered throughout the arena, but their mother sat 11 rows behind the visiting bench. They could be heard cheering on their son while wearing an Atlanta Hawks T-shirt with their name and No. 20 jersey on it.
They called the experience more exciting than when they were drafted last June.
“Because it shows they have finally arrived,” Rissing-Collings said. “It shows that it actually is a reality.”
Before the game, Collins tried to calm their nerves by munching on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich because the feeling was so “surreal.” They had visited the arena several times as a spectator, growing up a huge fan of former Heat guard Dwyane Wade.
“I've been here too many times watching, and now I'm going to play on it,” Collins said. They played 19 minutes in their NBA preseason debut, scoring nine points and grabbing 15 rebounds.
The only negative of the trip for Collins, other than the Hawks' 96-90 loss to the Miami Heat, was that they didn't get to spend as much time with their mother. With the exception of a dinner that consisted of Caribbean-style chicken and rice, the two only briefly saw each other. They will make it up during the season.
Their mother plans to travel to as many home games as possible in Atlanta. They also will make a few road trips, just as they did when they were in college.
That's not to say they aren't disappointed when the hometown Heat chose to pass on Collins when they had opportunity to take them in the first round. The Heat selected Bam Adebayo at No. 14 and Collins was taken five picks later by the Hawks.
“Miami could have picked them up,” Rissing-Collins joked. “But we love Atlanta. Atlanta has welcomed us with open arms. They have a nice fan base there. It's no problem at all. It's a quick drive.”

Baltimore Police Officer Edward Nero was found not guilty on Monday for their alleged role in the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray a year ago.
Nero, 30, was facing misdemeanor charges of second-degree assault and two counts of misconduct in office for their part in Gray's arrest. They were also charged with reckless endangerment for shackling Gray and placing them in a police van without buckling their seatbelt. They pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Judge Barry Williams, who has prosecuted police misconduct for the Department of Justice, determined that the state could not prove that Nero intended to commit any crimes against Gray.
"The State's theory from the beginning has been one of negligence, recklessness, and disregard for duty and orders by this defendant," Williams said in their verdict. "There has been no information presented at this trial that the defendant intended for any crime to happen. Nor has there been any evidence presented that the defendant communicated any information to a primary actor that they were ready, willing, and able to lend support, if needed, to any crime."
"Based on the evidence presented, this Court finds that the State has not met its burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, all required elements of the crimes charged," they added.
Nero is the second of six officers to stand trial in connection to the death of Gray, a black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in police custody on April 12, 2015. Gray died from their injuries a week later, on April 19, sparking citywide protests against police brutality. After their funeral on April 27, the unrest intensified -- residents looted stores and set fires, and protesters threw rocks and other items at police lines.
I think that the present verdict will affect the remaining trials in that the other defendants will be acquitted, as well, in deference to the judge's decision. Barry Slotnick, criminal defense attorney
Baltimore Police Officer William Porter was the first to stand trial, in December, but the jury could not reach a verdict. Unlike Porter, Nero opted for a bench trial.
The verdict in Nero's case could trickle down to the remaining trials, according to Barry Slotnick, a criminal defense attorney.
“The judge who tried the case obviously went along with the idea that a defendant is presumed to be innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” they told The Huffington Post. "What we have here is clearly a case in which there was a conclusion that the judge drew with regards to the intentions of Officer Nero and as a result the verdict came in as not guilty. I think that the present verdict will affect the remaining trials in that the other defendants will be acquitted, as well, in deference to the judge's decision.”
Some residents, according to a local Fox affiliate, wondered if the reaction to Nero's verdict would be as intense as that to Gray's funeral.
"It just comes down to, you don't want another outbreak of people looting and whatnot," Andrew Murphy, a Baltimore resident, told Fox 5 DC. "Hopefully it comes to a peaceful resolve."
Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) asked residents on Friday to put aside their personal feelings and honor the verdict.
"The future of our community will not be defined at the moment of the verdict, but in the days and years that will follow," Cummings said during a press conference.
Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake also released a statement asking residents to keep the peace.

The Baltimore Police Department beefed up security around the courthouse in preparation for the verdict.
"Although the criminal case against Officer Edward Nero has come to a close, the internal investigation has not. With that, Officer Nero's status will remain unchanged. They will remain in an administrative capacity while this investigation continues," the department stated in a release. "The internal investigation is being handled by other police departments. The internal investigation will not be completed until all of the criminal cases against the other five officers are completed because they will likely be witnesses in each case."
The Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police also weighed in, claiming that the state attorney's office was hasty in charging the officers due to the unrest that followed Gray's death.

Meanwhile, Baltimore residents and racial justice organizations are condemning the judge's decision, saying Nero's acquittal is another example of injustice and impunity.
“Like too many other Black families and communities, Freddie Gray's family and the people of Baltimore were denied justice today by a judge's refusal to hold Baltimore Police Officer Edward Nero accountable for Gray's death," Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color Of Change, said in a statement.
The FCC is trying to migrate the subsidies to fund broadband rather than phone calls this year. As it begins the overhaul, the question of who must contribute into the fund is heating up.
It would be "legitimate" to force Netflix and other high-bandwidth companies to contribute to the fund, Cooper, a longtime consumer advocate, said Wednesday during a panel discussion.
"Notice that when I suggest we tax Netflix — which is using the network — to help pay for the network, we get this complaint: Wait, you're hitting consumers," they said.
But this framework has a precedent, they said. Providers of toll and business phone services, who provided "discretionary services," traditionally paid into USF.
"The exact same logic that was in used in the old days for whacking a toll could actually be used to impose legitimate costs on high-bandwidth users and say 'that's discretionary consumption,' " they said. "But we have difficulty bringing ourselves to do that."
Former FCC official Blair Levin said rural phone companies have made it a habit to say the solution is to "tax Google."
"That's an appropriate debate to have, I'm all for it," said Levin, who served as executive director for the commission's broadband agenda.
They stressed, however, that the FCC must address the mechanisms for distributing the money — before it overhauls contributions. Tackling these questions simultaneously is a recipe for "political stalemate."
"If we have [the contribution] debate at the same time we're doing distribution, I absolutely guarantee they won't have it done by the end of the year," they said.
The rural phone industry reiterated the long-held view that websites should pay into the fund.
"Netflix takes up about 10 percent of every telco's bandwidth," said Shirley Bloomfield, chief executive of the National Telecommunications Cooperative Association.
Trump EPA reverses Obama blocks on controversial copper mine
The Trump administration has agreed to stop standing in the way of a proposed mine in Alaska that has inspired a long-running, multimillion-dollar legal and lobbying battle in Washington — in yet another reversal of former President Barack Obama's environmental policies.
In a settlement announced Friday, the EPA agreed to drop its efforts to preemptively block the planned Pebble Mine. The proposed gold, copper and molybdenum mine inspired a pitched battle from opponents including native tribes, environmental groups and commercial fishermen, who feared its pollution would devastate the world's largest wild salmon fishery.
Story Continued Below
The agreement will allow Pebble Limited Partnership to apply for a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers for the mine before EPA continues any work reviewing water issues in the area. Pebble sued in 2014 after the Obama administration proposed restrictions that would have effectively denied that permit before the developer even applied.
“We are committed to due process and the rule of law, and regulations that are 'regular,'” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement. “We understand how much the community cares about this issue, with passionate advocates on all sides. The agreement will not guarantee or prejudge a particular outcome, but will provide Pebble a fair process for their permit application and help steer EPA away from costly and time-consuming litigation. We are committed to listening to all voices as this process unfolds.”
EPA's previous environmental studies of the Bristol Bay region indicated that any large-scale mining efforts would prove too dangerous to the ecosystem. The agency then proposed restrictions that would have made it virtually impossible for Pebble Mine to get a permit it needs to dump waste in nearby waterways, but a judge in 2014 blocked EPA from finalizing that decision after the developer sued.
That lawsuit will end under the deal as EPA starts the process over.
Pebble Mine has attracted fierce opposition from a number of local Native tribes and sportsmen's groups, as well as environmentalists, over concerns that it could damage Bristol Bay, home to the biggest sockeye salmon fishery in the world. In a recent letter to Pruitt, a coalition of Pebble Mine opponents urged them not to reverse course on Pebble Mine, which they said "poses fundamental risks to the salmon fisheries of the region and the economic and subsistence benefits those fisheries provide."
In a release, Pebble thanked Pruitt and President Donald Trump "for their commitment to the rule of law, and the fair and equal treatment of those who would invest in job-creating industries in America."
Pebble CEO Tom Collier said that the project will be smaller than previously anticipated, "with demonstrable environmental protections" and several initiatives making the mine "more responsive to the priorities and concerns of Alaskans."
Under the terms of the deal with Pebble Limited Partnership, EPA will withdraw its proposed restrictions and stop further water-quality studies for at least four years or until the Army Corps of Engineers issues its final environmental impact statement, whichever comes first. At that point, the agency will start a new review process, abandoning the previous proposal that would have effectively blocked the mine. But the deal allows EPA to "use its scientific assessment regarding the Bristol Bay Watershed without limitation," according to the agency.
Pebble has until around November 2019 to apply for its permit, depending on when the court approves the settlement.

Illustration of a typical Imperial male
Also known as Cyrodiils, Cyrodilics[1], Cyro-Nordics and Imperial Cyrods[2], the well-educated and well-spoken Imperials are the natives of the civilized, cosmopolitan province of Cyrodiil. Imperials are also known for the discipline and training of their citizen armies, and their respect for the rule of law.[3] Though physically less imposing than the other races, the Imperials have proved to be shrewd diplomats and traders, and these traits, along with their remarkable skill and training as light infantry, have enabled them to subdue all the other nations and races and erect the monument to peace and prosperity that comprises the Glorious Empire.[4][5] Their hegemony has waxed and waned throughout the eras, and most historians refer to three distinct Empires, the ends of which each mark a new epoch in Tamrielic history.
Cyrodiil , the home of the Imperials
History [ edit ]
An engraving of the Tiber Septim
The Imperial race emerged out of the original Nibenese tribesman, Nedes and Cyro-Nords in the Merethic Era.[1][6][7] They were subjugated by a race of Aldmer, the Ayleids, but a rebellion against these rulers, formed under the guidance of Saint Alessia in 1E 242, would prove so successful that Ayleids were driven to extinction (though they left behind many treasures[8]).[1][6][9] The Alessian Empire united Imperials and pursued campaigns in other provinces, but when the Colovian west broke away, the resulting civil war in Cyrodiil ended the Empire.[6]
The eastern Nibenay Valley region and the western Colovian Estates developed distinct cultures, but still united under the Colovian Reman I to repel an Akaviri invasion in 1E 2703, creating the Second Empire.[1][6] The Akaviri had devastated many human lands, and Reman feared invasion from the Summerset Isle, so they allowed the remaining Akaviri to live and fight for them against the Elves.[6] Soon the Second Empire controlled every province of Tamriel except Morrowind.[6] The events surrounding the attempted conquest of Morrowind led to the end of the Reman emperors, and the First Era, in 1E 2920: the Akaviri Versidue-Shaie, who had earned a position as a trusted advisor, took control following the deaths of the Remans and the disastrous Four-Score War.[10]
The Akaviri Potentates would rule until 2E 430, but eventually assassinations and poor leadership would make the Empire crumble, leading to the Interregnum: for four hundred years, petty states all over Tamriel quarreled with each other, especially Cyrodiil.[1][11] The Imperial Province devolved into a collection of warlords squabbling over a no-man's land of cultural stagnation.[1][12] Eventually, it would take a Nord to reunite the Imperial Province: Tiber Septim was appointed general of the forces of Cuhlecain, a petty Colovian king. They routed all of Cuhlecain's enemies who would face them and their armies on the battlefield, quickly reuniting Cyrodiil. When Cuhlecain was assassinated in 2E 854, Tiber Septim assumed the throne.[6] In a few decades, the provinces would be reunited once more under their Third Empire, and this outsider to Cyrodiil had become the symbol of the whole realm.[1]
Ironically enough, most if not all of the Emperors of the Third Age would be Nordic or Breton, not Imperial. Following the cataclysms of the Oblivion Crisis, the leaderless Empire would once again begin to crumble, but it was an Imperial who seized the opportunity for glory: Titus Mede, a Colovian king, would seize the Imperial City with less than a thousand men and declared themselves the new Emperor, though not much is yet known about this new dynasty.[13]
A color-coded map showing the different regions of Cyrodiil
Society [ edit ]
The defining feature of Imperial culture is its cosmopolitanism.[1] Although some individuals may be the most arrogant bigots in Tamriel,[14][15][16] culturally the Imperials are very conciliatory and congenial, making them skilled diplomats and traders.[1] Even Imperial vampires claim some semblance of civility.[17] It's easy to understand given their geography and cultural schisms: Cyrodiil borders almost every other province, and the historical separation yet underlying unity and interaction of the Cyrodilic regions made the Imperials well practiced at building bridges and maintaining order. Though there are many regions, the two most powerful effectively controlled all regions close to them: the western Colovian Estates and the eastern Nibenay Valley.
Early Imperials in eastern Cyrodiil strongly believed in the Alessian Doctrines, even after the Empire's fall, which made them disfavor many practices, notably farming.[6] They defaulted to mercantilism, and became a wealthy merchant power with a vibrant society that made colorful clothing, conducted elaborate ceremonies, and loved tattoos and philosophy.[6] Through their river network, they were able to export many goods, including textiles, fabrics, moon sugar, rice and armor.[6] Though their beliefs were monotheistic, they often focused on the numinous nature of some facet of society, and many diverse cults operated openly over the years, dedicated to many animal spirits and hero-gods, as well as ancestor worship.[6][18][19] The Colovians, in contrast, took on a more austere but adventuresome lifestyle, in keeping with their Nordic ancestry, and often became mercenaries and pirates.[6][18] The unification under Reman I didn't eradicate these differences, although, of course, the Eight Divines was predominant all over the province by the end of the First Era.[1][6]
The respect and admiration Imperials had for the Tiber Septim is nothing compared to the veneration they have for them as a god of the Nine Divines, regardless of the heresies often espoused about him.[20][21] Their accomplishments inspired them to believe they could do anything they set their mind to.[22] The end of their dynasty was greeted with great mourning, although also with great pride, as their last known descendant, Martin Septim, sacrificed themselves to save all of Tamriel.[23] Imperials know all too well that dynasties are destined to rise and fall; all it will take is time before the Glorious Empire once again reigns over Tamriel.

Notes [ edit ]
Common Cyrodilic names, certain aspects of Nibenese architecture, and Colovian martial tradition (military organization and equipment) should seem familiar, as they are inspired by the real-world Roman Empire.
Imperials were not considered a distinct race within the games until Redguard, but have been a playable race in every major entry since.

BeaverTails, the iconic Ottawa snack, is coming to Toronto.
The puff pastry, typically covered in cinnamon and lemon, is a familiar treat to anyone who grew up skating along the Rideau Canal.
A BeaverTails pastry and a cup of hot chocolate was the reward for finishing the 7.8 kilometre-long skate.
Now, I may not be able to skate backwards (I can go forwards really, really fast, because it's cold in Ottawa and the point of skating the Rideau is to finish and then go home), but I know a treat when I see it.
According to the company's Twitter page, a brick-and-mortar store will soon be opening on Queen's Quay at the bottom of York Street.
Currently, there's a pop-up (adorably referred to by BeaverTails as a cabin) in front of what used to be a Second Cup. The BeaverTails will open up at the former Second Cup in the fall.
So … any day now. And I can just walk there.

I'm exhausted by the Synod. I'm exhausted by the debates about the SSPX. And yet, this video combines both themes in a way that is so radically uplifting, so completely moving that I finished it in tears.
This. This. This.
This is what Catholicism is supposed to look like.
You want to call them schismatics? You're wrong, but go right ahead. The institutional Church gives us an endless parade of perverse clerics trying to tear down Christ's teaching, while the SSPX gives us this.
You can say whatever you want about the SSPX. But until you give Catholics in perfect communion with the Church, Catholics with full canonical status, something this simple, this devout, this powerful, this breathtakingly beautiful…I don't want to hear from you.
The faithful are waiting. Not for streamlined annulments, not for communion for the divorced and remarried, not for female deacons, not for acceptance of sexual perversity.
For this. We are waiting for this.
A senior staff member of Oracle Corp., George A. Polisner, has resigned after the enterprise tech titan's co-CEO, Safra Catz, joined the Trump transition team and stated their enthusiasm for the president-elect.
As we reported last week, Trump recently convened a meeting of tech leaders and their children at Trump Tower in New York.
Prior to the meeting Catz issued a public statement that said:
“I plan to tell the president-elect that we are with them and will help in any way we can. If they can reform the tax code, reduce regulation and negotiate better trade deals, the U.S. technology industry will be stronger and more competitive than ever.”
After the meeting, Catz accepted an invitation to join Trump's transition team.
A veteran of enterprise tech, and a progressive political strategist, Polisner previously held a wide variety of positions at Oracle. During different turns there since 1993, they had worked at Oracle in product development, customer advocacy, program management and most recently managed cloud services.
They made their resignation known yesterday to the company and the public by publishing their letter on LinkedIn. There they criticized Trump for: planning to dismantle social security and medicare; disrespecting Gold Star military families; and “stok[ing] fear, hatred and violence toward people of color, Muslims and immigrants,” among other things.
“I am not with President-elect Trump and I am not here to help them in any way. In fact –when their policies border on the unconstitutional, the criminal and the morally unjust –I am here to oppose them in every possible and legal way.
Therefore I must resign from this once great company.”
Polisner has also created a petition on NotWhoWeAre.us for other Oracle employees who many want to publicly protest Trump and Catz's involvement in their transition team.
Blythe Masters is walking a tightrope to their next career in high finance.
The 46-year-old finance whiz, once the most powerful woman on Wall Street, is in high-stakes negotiations with investors for a $35 million financing round at the technology startup they now head that will value the company at $100 million, The Post has learned.
The company, Digital Asset Holdings, hopes to use the bleeding-edge technology behind bitcoin to shake-up the world of finance — using it to cut costs and speed transactions. DAH hopes to close the funding round by Christmas Eve, but investors aren't holding their breath, sources said.
For Masters, the stage is a bit smaller than at their last gig — where, as chair of JPMorgan Chase's global commodities business, they were thought of as a possible heir apparent to Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.
But Masters was forced from the bank in May 2014 after 27 years — having started as an intern — after a government regulator fined JPM $410 million for allegedly rigging the California energy markets.
The bank didn't admit or deny wrongdoing and Masters was never implicated or charged.
Ten months after they left JPM, Masters signed on with DAH.
While there has been great interest on Wall Street to invest in Masters' new project — a Nov. 21 e-mail from her, sources said, describes the funding round as being “quite materially oversubscribed” — some are growing impatient with DAH's slow progress.
Negotiations about the board composition, shareholder voting rights, and how shareholders could sell stock have been rocky at times, sources said.
While the deal is still being negotiated and could fall apart, JPM is expected to lead the investment round with $7.5 million, according to four sources.
Spanish bank Santander, where Masters are a non-executive chairperson, is expected to invest about $3 million. Other potential investors include Markit, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Nasdaq.
At the same time, DAH's wooing of talent hasn't been so smooth.
Timothy Geithner, the former Treasury Secretary who's now president of Warburg Pincus, the New York private equity firm, recently turned down an invitation to join DAH's board.
A Warburg spokesperson declined to comment.
Spokespeople for JPM, Citi, Santander, BofA, Markit, Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq and DAH also declined to comment.
There's that awful moment, every so often, when you're in your Steam library and go to click ‘Play' on a favourite game. Your eye wanders a few millimetres off the light blue button and there it is. 600 hours played. Gaben is too merciful to spell it out. 25 days of your life, right there, spent playing Rocket League.
Still, it could be worse. Steam could include my PS4 total, I've probably topped a month of full immersion with that. Whatever, it's a lot of time, and it's a rare game that gets this much of my attention. I play an enormous range of videogames, but most will get anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours. A few I'll see through to the finish, let's say a dozen hours or so. Then you get a Bayonetta, a Dark soul or Bloodborne or Counter-Strike, and the sky's the limit. For me these are the games that swallow time, where the Gabenclock ticks up and I barely even notice the rollover into three digits. These are the games I freely give my life to.
The great Rocket League session begins pic.twitter.com/fZ0uRCkQB6 — Richard Stanton (@RichStanton) April 21, 2017
And prime among them is Rocket League. From my first hours I knew this was a classic. Now I'm even more deeply-invested, that judgement is only solidified – it's simply one of the best games ever made. The reason it appeals so much is the controls. You'll notice something about the kind of games I like which is that, singleplayer or multiplayer, they tend to have a skill element to them. I'm not saying I'm great at games, but the feeling of getting better at a game is what I'm chasing, and it's why most of the games I invest in tend to have some multiplayer element. I love to feel my own skill push up in increments, to find myself doing things that once seemed impossible, and – yes, it is true – I love the feeling that you only get from competing against other humans.
This is, I suppose, because in games like Rocket League the skill ceiling is so high that in practical terms it's infinite. I watch the pros play this game, at RLCS and other events, and it mainly takes place in the air – they're unbelievable, and next to that my car has tires of clay. But I feel an improvement, almost every day, in a manner few other games can approach.
There is this aspect of Rocket League that tempts comparison with football, simply because both games share the aspect of learning about a particular ball's characteristics and momentum. Different types of ball, and different types of contact, but I remember playing football every day as a kid and how I'd gradually learn more and more about how to make contact with the ball or play a position - not that I was ever a particularly fantastic player. Improvement never happens in giant leaps: it was minor daily adjustments that over time added up to something more substantial.
In particular I remember when I moved to playing indoor 5-a-side, where the pitch is enclosed by walls - which introduces a whole new dimension to the game, and of course is how Rocket League is played. When I first started I couldn't handle the angles, and players would easily go past me by hitting the ball off the wall. A few games in and I was more or less able to handle it. A couple of months in, I was an expert.
How do I love thee Rocket League
Let me count the ways
I love thee to the depth & breadth & height
My boost can reach
You're out of sight pic.twitter.com/WSWnYkAi5s — Richard Stanton (@RichStanton) April 29, 2017
Ah, the sepia-tinted days of 5-a-side in the North East. The rate of improvement in Rocket League would produce a similar kind of graph: you get slightly better all the time, in almost-imperceptible increments, until one day there's a giant leap. Take flying. My first months were spent mostly on the ground. Then I started to take off a little bit more, and do some falling with style. And now, yeah I'm no pro, but I can go for high balls and most of the time I'll hit them (where it ends up going still needs some work). Take bouncing the ball off the walls: at first I'd just smash it and chase, but now I plan the flightpath and move independently towards the earliest possible contact. Take teamplay. Rocket League for me is ranked doubles with randoms, where you're joining your fate to another for five beautiful minutes, and quickly learning their capabilities and playstyle in the opening moments is like a minigame unto itself — not to mention positioning, when to go and when to stay.
The less-obvious reason for Rocket League's success ties into this last point, which is that its skill-based matchmaking system is quite simply brilliant. I've played enormous amounts of competitive online games, and some are better than others at this, but if the goal is to get equally-matched games then Rocket League is one of the best. I feel like I'm constantly pitched against people who are my equals, and that every win is earned. Yeah every so often you win 8-1, or get a similarly-sized beating, but the vast majority of games take place against opponents where it could go either way.
Perhaps this is what drives the competitiveness. No-one likes getting beat all the time, and equally just riding roughshod over noobs is only entertaining for a minute or two. You want to feel pushed and, thanks to the combination of these endlessly deep controls and wonderful matchmaking, I always am pushed. Here's a strange thing, completely unscientific but what the hell. Last week I went to the pub with a good friend and probably had too many beers. I went home, played Rocket League for an hour or so, and dropped out of gold to silver. That's how sensitive this thing's matchmaking is: it basically breathalysed me.

It's hard to express the pleasure of being challenged like this, always straining at the leash to be just a millimetre better than you are. Forcing yourself to override conservative instincts and go full-bore into something, taking off for that ball you're not quite sure you can reach, and launching into a flip early because you need speed rather than control. Falling from great heights, and tapering your boost to land quickly and shoot off in the right direction.
My Steam ticker for Rocket League will continue to rise: soon enough I'll get official confirmation of that month spent, even if I don't notice, and in the years to come I'm sure it'll hit other dubious markers of distinction. Playing Rocket League is not a transferable skill. It's not a matter of life and death. It's much more important than that.
0 Simon 6 Aug 2008 I got a call from this number at 3:03 am this morning, 6:06 this morning and just now at 10:10. The first two times I answered, there was silence. I kept saying "hello," but no one answered me. After about 10 seconds it would just click and hang up. On the last call I answered and said "hello." A male voice on the other end said, "Pray to not us" and hung up. What does that even mean? Weird. Caller: Unknown Reply !

What Ever Happened?
D-13279 had long ago learned how to tell death from dreaming.
Every month, it happened like this, and there was a moment of uncertainty. When the drugs have finished pumping their way through the circulatory system, there's nothingness.
And it's almost a moment of relief. But then it ends.
That's not what death feels like, they knew. Death doesn't have the hunger pangs, the hollowness of being that comes from want and need. That's not death.
D-13279 knew how to use dreams. They didn't know how they knew, but they remembered a distant time when there were others in their dreams. When their dreams could take them to meet other people, to feel like they were greater than themself.
Dreaming is lonelier, now. But it has still made the mind resilient. Each month, the guards and scientists try to kill the mind, flush the memories, but in dreams the mind can hide. And D-13279 can survive another month with their head intact.
Thirty days go by. D-13279's service is done. They get put under. The guards and scientists try to kill the mind, but in dreams the mind hides. And it repeats. Always the exact same.
"You've committed a crime. It's very important that you pay your debt to society."
They squirm in the chair. Wrists bound in glistening manacles. The room is disgustingly white, and against that backdrop the labcoat is almost invisible, a floating head and clipboard seated in a cheap chair. They continue.
"We're not here to judge or to punish you. We're not your wardens, just guides. Follow us and your debt will be repaid. Society will thank you. After a month, you will be done." She's reading from a paper. Well-rehearsed.
D-13279 nodded. They had lost track of how many times this had happened.
Society, as they called it, was not something D-13279 had ever known. Not anything they remembered. The rote transactions of daily life. The give and take of tokens and goods and services. Utilization by a greater whole, for the good of each cog. D-13279 did not know it.
Each time they slept, and a day ticked by, adding one onto another, D-13279 was able to go somewhere else. Somewhere not here, not in the four walls and a roof, the magnetically sealed door with two slits, one for the eyes and one for trays of food. In their mind, D-13279 went beyond.
In that beyond, there are rows of sleeping people in jumpsuits. The D-class do not move or react. Each night, the D-class grow more like each other. Each month, the D-class grow into the mold the organization wishes to fit them in. The mold the organization has prepared for all the world. And D-13279 can only watch.
But at least it wasn't a cell. It was a community, a community of unconscious souls. Except for one. D-13279 was more awake in their dreams than during the day.
There was a different scientist. This room was longer than it was wide. Each wall held a door, and the longer walls held two large windows into observation rooms filled with technicians. Atop each window was a warning light. The light was green.
D-13279 was holding a briefcase. It was handcuffed to their wrist, but in the opposite hand they held the key. The scientist, satisfied with their latent posing, retreated to an observation room. D-13279 faced the door on the far end, on a narrow wall.
The door opened. A person in a grey jumpsuit walked out. A nametag read "D-13280".
"Hello. I am here to receive your briefcase."
D-13279 nodded furtively, reaching down to unlock their own restraints. Gingerly, they handed the briefcase over. The other D-class nodded, affixing it to their own wrist. They exited the room.
Behind D-13279, the second door opened. A person in a grey jumpsuit walked out. A nametag read "D-13278". They had a briefcase handcuffed to their wrist.
"I have a briefcase here."
This person unlocked their restraints, gingerly handing the briefcase to the waiting D-13279. And then the person left, same way they came.
The warning light above the windows faded from green into red. The mission was over.
Inside the briefcase:
N REPORTING TO N+1 CLEAR: EXISTENTIAL THREATS CLEAR. TRANSUNIVERSAL THREATS CLEAR. LOCALIZED THREATS CLEAR. NORMALCY CLEAR. NOTES: THE OLD WORLD MEN ARE FALLING. THE WAY IS BEING PAVED. WE'LL GET THERE SOON. NEED MORE AMNESTICS, MORE THAN CAN FIT IN A BRIEFCASE. SPECIFICS FOLLOW: 5 7 9 8 3
4 6 8 0 9
0 5 7 9 1
2 1 6 8 0
1 3 2 7 9
The rest is just numbers.
D-13279 knows the world is changing. Every night, it grows more clear. The Foundation is not alone in the multiverse. Each Foundation could reach out, speak to itself in other worlds. Collaborate. Cooperate. Contain.
And eventually, the goal would change. The higher-ups could never be satisfied with just keeping the world the way it was. Not when the world was so fundamentally broken.
It needed to be fixed. The cancer must be excised. And now the organization has the power to do it.
D-13279 feels like they're constantly growing, growing into a mind too large for this body. This can't be allowed to continue, can it?
Who can stop it when the Foundation becomes the foundation for everything?
They can feel it. Each passing day. Every dose of mindkill. Every soul living this far underground. Their mind becomes smaller, their profile slimmer. The mold becomes more attractive. D-13279 cannot hold out forever. Eventually they will be gone, and a new one will take their place. A new person, for this new world.
Some months ago, there was a large room, size of a gymnasium. The ground was covered by fake grass and black rubber bits. In the center, crude structures of drywall for buildings.
Each single-story abode held two to three mattresses on the ground. There were just enough mattresses for the two dozen D-class that lived there during the test. A single structure was set aside, where one D-class would cook food for the rest twice a day.
The raw food came from a hatch in the ceiling, once every three days. The scientists could have dropped ready-made meals, but they didn't. Maybe they thought they could reinforce teamwork by forcing meal preparation.
Twenty days in, when the lights in the room were out, to simulate the night, and only fake torches lit the room, they released a creature into the enclosure. A tall beast, with a face like a sieve and limbs like knives.
When the D-class saw it, the group cowered and hid, and banged on the walls for help.
The test was aborted. The creature was recovered. The minds were wiped, and the subjects were administered a fierce regimen of drugs and altered images.
The test began again. Twenty days in, the creature was released.
When the D-class saw it, the group banded together and struck it with hands and feet. It let out a chatter when it died.
Unsatisfactory. The test was aborted. The creature was reanimated. The minds were wiped, and the subjects were administered a fierce regimen of retraining noises and memetic ciphers.
The test began again. Twenty days in, the creature was released.
When they D-class saw it, the group did not react. Each continued their routines, even as it stalked and killed them. Not a single one made note of it.
Satisfactory. A good test. D-13279 got to carry two briefcases the day after. Need extra room for important details.
N REPORTING TO ALL CLEAR: EXISTENTIAL THREATS CLEAR. TRANSUNIVERSAL THREATS CLEAR. LOCALIZED THREATS CLEAR. NORMALCY CLEAR. NOTES: NTH BEHAVIORAL TEST SUCCESSFUL. MASS DEPLOYMENT MECHANISMS REQUIRED NEXT FOR TARGETING OF CITY CENTERS AND WATER DISTRIBUTION. SUGGESTIONS FOLLOW. 1 3 2 7 9
0 2 4 3 8
9 1 3 5 4
5 0 2 4 6
7 6 1 3 5
Every month is the same. D-13279 used to feel a sense of urgency. As their knowledge grows, beyond this world, into every universe with a Foundation.
This world was not meant for the Foundation, but a tipping point has been reached. They will make the world into one for themselves, and make those in it fit for the world. D-class are just the template. What the Foundation has learned from them will be applied to everyone. And none will ever notice.
The only comfort D-13279 took was that soon, they would be like everyone. And everyone would be like them. And that's some justice, isn't it?
D-13279 saw all of them.
"You've committed a crime. It's very important that you pay your debt to society."
The response: "What?" "No…" "What crime?" "Fuck off!" "What do you mean?" "Where am I?" "Slow down." "Can you repeat that?"
Knowledge is powerlessness. D-13279 could not help a single one of them. But the Foundation could.
Overlapping bricks add up to something. Means nothing more than a brick to building. A building to a mountain. A mountain to a planet.
Every Foundation was there, but they blur together. There's only one Foundation, one for all the universes, and its ligaments are vacant promises, linked hands, and full briefcases. Soon there will be nothing but the Foundation. And the Foundation will be everything.
D-class expand above and below. The researchers can't remember the nights they spent on mattresses in gymnasiums. The civilians will never remember what the scientist said just before they pushed the plunger on the syringe.
As far as everyone knows, the world never changed. No-one will ever know what was lost.
For the record, they said "You're paying your debt to society. Goodnight."
O5-∞+1 sat in a conference room with 12 other men. Each had their own plans. Today, and tomorrow, and so on, they would meet and discuss a common topic, and choose their Foundation's stance. Just like they had for all the yesterdays.
They were the most frightened men on the planet. Each man held their fears close, because they were the only thing that kept them awake throughout the day. Even as the reason for fear dwindled. Even as reality grew ever closer to matching the spine that they had been constructing.
The multiverse couldn't stop them now. The Foundation was bigger than it was. It could only fight back for so long.
Every O5 nodded in agreement when the final resolution was proposed. It was all coming together.
But they were still afraid. You can always add one, and then you have an entirely different number on your hands.
D-13279 kept looking for a key, or a door. Some way outs. The dreams weren't an escape, just a reminder of the bars. They could not evade the mindkill forever. They would die eventually, and a new person would be born from their corpse.
D-1327█ thought about all the people around them. They lived such short lives. Tiny people, easy for the Foundation to move around. No baggage to deal with.
D-132██ thought about fear. The fear that they as they know themselves would soon be dead. The fight for maintaining the world as one knows it. Is that noble?
D-13███ thought about how concentrated things feel. Reality is getting denser, as all the universes collapse upon themselves. Uncertainty is going away. How will the new man think?
D-1████ felt something pleasant bubbling up. They don't need to wonder. They are the new man, tailor-made for this new world. They don't need to worry anymore. They can give up.
And D-█████ was ready.
The loud nights were over.
The quiet days were here.
HILLARY Clinton has been accused of being a “abject, psychopath demon from hell” who is “going to destroy the planet” if elected president – according to outrageous claims circulating online.
The Democratic nominee has been accused of being a demon birthed from the bowels of Hell, a wacky conspiracy suggests. Truth seekers online are going into meltdown over the outrageous suggestion as an FBI probe into their email server rumbles on and rival Donald Trump insists the election race is rigged. Alex Jones – an American radio show host and famous conspiracy theorist who hosts hit show Info Wars – is convinced that Mrs Clinton holds powers from beyond this planet.
GETTY SHOCK CLAIMS: Clinton has been accused of being a 'devil worshipper'
“She is an abject, psychopathic demon from Hell” Alex Jones In an astonishing rant, they said: “She is an abject, psychopathic demon from Hell. “As soon as they get power they are going to try to destroy the planet. “I mean, I was told by people around them that they think she's demon-possessed.” Staggeringly, Jones justified the suggestion by pointing to Clinton's scent. “Imagine how bad they smell man? You can't wash that evil off,” they added. “Hillary smells like sulphur. She's a demon and they stink. “She even smells like Hell.” It is not the first time either – after rumours circulated that they are linked to blood, sperm and breastmilk ritual called spirit cooking.

It comes as a Roman Catholic church in San Diego told parishioners that the devil works through Democratic politicians. The church even warned that voting for Clinton would be a “mortal sin”. The Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the city's Old Town district circulated a pamphlet suggesting “Satan has deceived” Democratic voters. It reads: “Satan has deceived many Christians to convert to worldly values from Christian ones. “The devil does this through the tactics outlined by Saul Alinsky with the outcome as Hillary Clinton has stated.”

Did A Spooky Post On A Videogame Forum Predict The Paris Attacks A Week Before They Happened?
Did A Spooky Post On A Videogame Forum Predict The Paris Attacks A Week Before They Happened?
A Reddit user claims to have found references to yesterday's Paris attack, a week before they happened
On a forum on French gaming site Jeuxvideo, a thread titled 'Attention: The 13th of November' (translated), was started, and someone with username ‘ShaankMaGanache' posted 'Post avant attentat a la kalash'
Which translates to: 'Post before attack with Kalash (possibly a reference to the Kalashnikov, or the AK-47)
They posted a link to another, now deleted screenshot, which they claim mentioned 'ce soir a paris les kheys. Enfin le peuple en PLS. A nouveau.', interpreted as : “Tonight in Paris my kheys/brothers, finally the people will be in fear, again
Just a joke?
However, another Reddit user pointed out that "joke predictions" were common on Jeuxvideo, a site known for its tendency to crack reckless humor, and features similar threats' "100+ threads like this a day)" Later on, ‘ShaankMaGanache' claimed it was all just a joke – they posted on another thread that: “Meanwhile the people my message screen believing that I am the seer” and “I saw the topic I post as many others the message and I am accused of having predicted that this is crazy”
Don't Miss 143 SHARES 300 SHARES 131 SHARES
The same forum also saw another scarily accurate prediction by another user: Translation: There will be a series of attacks starting from this famous date (November Friday 13th) Be careful of ALL vehicles, like planes, trains, metro,... And public places I have my sources Enjoy"
In 1996, when I started researching the conservation genetics of New Zealand's critically endangered parrot, the kākāpō (Strigops habroptilus), little was known of the species' genome. On many occasions after a long day in the molecular lab on the hunt for an elusive gene, I found myself imagining that I had the complete genome of kākāpō at my fingertips. Fast forward 20 years, and that dream has been realised with the sequencing of the kākāpō genome by researchers at Duke University and PacBio, as part of the Bird 10,000 genomes project. It was like Christmas the day the whole genome landed in my inbox (22 January 2016). Elusive kākāpō genes could no longer hide from me and the possibilities for kākāpō conservation and species recovery seemed endless.
Many people will be familiar with the species thanks to a kākāpō called Sirocco (the species' “spokesbird,” who tweets @Spokesbird) and their unusual mating habits. Stephen Fry's narration of Sirocco mating with Mark Carwardine's head on YouTube has had over 6.7 million views. For many others like me, Douglas Adams introduced kākāpō to them in the moving account of the species' plight in the book Last Chance to See. Historically a widespread species, the kākāpō reached a low of only 51 birds in 1995, and the world population now stands at a hard-won 125 individuals. To maintain genetic diversity and ensure species recovery, all birds are now intensively managed by a team of dedicated conservationists.
Conservation genomics – the application of genomic analysis to the management of threatened species – is a fast-emerging field propelled forward by the dramatic advances in genome sequencing. These technological developments have also led to considerable cost savings, and we are to the point where we can once again dream big for kākāpō. In a world first, the Kākāpō 125 Genomes Project is sequencing the genome of every surviving individual of a species.
This ambitious project is a collaboration among researchers from the New Zealand Department of Conservation's Kākāpō Recovery Group, the University of Otago (New Zealand), Duke University (USA), the Genetic Rescue Foundation and NZ Genomics Ltd.
For the Kākāpō 125 Genomes Project, we're using the high-quality reference kakapo genome developed by Duke University and PacBio as a scaffolding to assemble all other 124 kakapo genomes against. This project is being funded by the Genetic Rescue Foundation, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to advancing the scientific techniques required to prevent species extinction through genetic intervention. The Genetic Rescue Foundation makes use of the latest crowdfunding and online scientific services such as Science Exchange and Experiment.com to fund and conduct research. The Genetic Rescue Foundation's latest crowdfunding campaign is currently in progress and in just 20 days has raised over $32,000 toward a target of $45,000.
A genomics approach to kakapo conservation will be a great boost to the recovery program. A genome-wide understanding of genetic variation will help to develop breeding strategies to retain variation at genes important for species persistence, such as the immunity genes and their role in kākāpō diseases. We will also be able to explore the genetic basis of infertility in kakapo; only 60% of eggs hatch (normally this should be about 90% in birds) and sperm abnormalities contribute to infertility. Solving the issue of infertility will greatly aid species recovery by maximising reproductive effort.
Beyond being of considerable significance to kākāpō conservation, the Kākāpō 125 Project will make an important contribution to the emerging field of Conservation Genomics. Our project will provide a genome dataset for every member of an entire species, serving as a much-needed case study to further develop analytical pipelines and methodologies. Only with studies such as ours will Conservation Genomics' true potential be realised.

A review of the new flagship title for Marvel NOW!
A good comic book goes a long way towards cleansing one's palate of a bad event or poor editorial decisions. Comics like Wonder Woman or Animal Man have made DC's hastily implemented New 52 bearable. Brandon Graham's Prophet is a must-read, even if the book was created by industry pariah Rob Liefeld. Good comics are good comics, no matter what context they've evolved from.
I think it's important to make this distinction prior to reviewing Uncanny Avengers #1. I'm not going to pretend that I liked this summer's Avengers vs. X-Men event. The miniseries was underwhelming; it made Civil War look like a treatise of morality and ethics by comparison. At times, it seemed like the series was conceived and organized by overgrown manchildren playing with action figures without any thought of consequence, continuity or characterization.
However, the event happened and it opened the door for a new wave of stories and ideas, a soft relaunch called Marvel NOW! by the marketing powers that be. I love relaunches simply because they offer a possibility for new stories and ideas. There are more than a few intriguing series debuting from Marvel NOW!, including Mark Waid's Indestructible Hulk, a Keiron Gillen/Jamie McKelvie Young Avengers and a new Jason Aaron Thor series.
Another series I was intrigued by was Rick Remender's Uncanny Avengers, a “flagship” series designed to bring the Avengers and X-Men franchises together. Remender has put together an impressive resume of superhero comics over the last year. Uncanny X-Force is one of the best X-Men series since Grant Morrison's run and Venom gained a cult following and acclaim despite its ridiculous concept. Joining Remender is John Cassaday, one of the best comic artists in the industry.
The premise behind Uncanny Avengers is a simple one: Captain America wants to set up an Avengers team geared towards handling mutant issues, an area long neglected by the Avengers. After the fallout of Avengers vs. X-Men, the team seems a bit more necessary, with Cyclops imprisoned for murder and Wolverine managing the X-Men on their lonesome. Remender's initial lineup includes Captain America, Thor, Wolverine, Havok (looking to separate themselves from their murderous extremist kin), Rogue and the Scarlet Witch, who has a fair share of mutant blood on their hands.
The debut issue is a quick read, one that rushes through its story beats with little time for rumination or thought, especially in the second half. A casualty from Avengers vs. X-Men is buried, their murderer confronted, their grave defiled by a group of mysterious villains with nefarious ends, and their body involved in one of the most macabre endings ever seen in a mainstream comic. Instead of downplaying the series' ties to Avengers vs. X-Men, Remender chooses to celebrate in it, making the megaevent a necessary read to understand exactly what is going on.
It seems like Remender is trying to blend classic superheroics with modern storytelling. Narration captions are present in practically every panel, character designs hearken back to an older era and weird villains dance around the page. However, the writing comes off as forced and rushed. The dialogue is generic and uninspired as are the new villains introduced in the issue. For instance, the goat-headed girl seen on the cover of Uncanny Avengers #2 is named the Goat Head Girl.
Characterization also seems to be a secondary concern in Uncanny Avengers. Scarlet Witch comes off as unrepentant for their past actions against mutants, while Rogue seems to have devolved to their 1980's emo personality. Even Captain America, who Remender will be covering in the character's series, seems off somehow. Cap's dialogue during one battle scene is especially cringe-worthy, with Captain America acting more like a nervous superhero on entering their first battle than the leader of the Avengers who has experienced and stopped countless worldwide disasters.
The saving grace of the issue is Cassaday's art, which remains as strong as it was during Planetary and Astonishing X-Men. He's able to cover many of Remender's faults with a strong showing and turns a disturbing last page into one that's utterly unforgettable. The comic is almost worth picking up just to look at Cassaday's work.
In many ways Uncanny Avengers reminds me of Justice League, DC's counterpart flagship title. Both marked the beginning of their companies' respective relaunches, both feature some of their companies' most well-known characters and both have grade-A artistic talent attached. Both also are light on plot and characterization, rely heavily on pushing forward their universes' respective plotlines and are largely unatisfying to read.
As much as I hate to say it, Uncanny Avengers #1 is not a good comic book. It's a below-average superhero comic falling far short of Remender's past work that will appeal to fans of Avengers vs. X-Men but little else. Read at your own risk.
Tens of thousands of Android users are thought to have fallen victim to a newly-discovered malware, which enlists devices as part of a hacker-controlled botnet.
Researchers at security firm Check Point, who discovered the malware, said in a blog post Monday that the malware is "persistent," and is "difficult or even impossible to remove manually."
The malware is dubbed "Viking Horde," after one of the popular apps it poses as. The sophisticated malware campaign consists of a number of games and apps that are readily available through Google Play, the app store for Android devices.
At least five instances of the app have so far been able to evade Google Play's malware scans for almost a month, since it was first submitted to the app store.
When the user installs the app, it will automatically join a botnet -- a network of devices controlled by an attacker -- which disguise ad clicks to generate money.
The app also has full access to parts of the devices it infects, potentially leading to theft of personal data.
Some user reviews claim the app also sends premium text messages, which can be used to make money but also conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against users through persistent message sending.
Most Android phones aren't rooted, which allow the owner to deeply customize the device by opening up access to parts of the operating system that are usually locked down. But if the Android phone is rooted, the malware will download additional components that makes the malware almost impossible to remove.
But the researchers warn that the malware can be used for far more nefarious purposes, such as remote code execution, which allows an attacker to compromise the data on the device.
So far, the malware-ridden apps have been downloaded tens of thousands of times -- likely more. According to the researchers, one of the apps made it as a top free app in the Google Play Store.
At the time of writing, the apps are still in the Google Play Store -- albeit with a considerable 1-star rating from the user reviewing community.
A spokesperson for Google did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication.
Now, if you stand on the beach front at Muynak, instead of staring over the cool blue waters of the Aral, you look out across 38,000 square kilometres of highly saline and polluted dry wasteland. It is almost impossible to describe the enormity of this human-made tragedy; but suffice to say it took them a mere 40 years to drain the fourth largest inland body of water to almost a quarter of its natural size. The sea is now a staggering 150km away from here; the great Amu Darya desert river trickling to a muddy puddle some distance away. As far as the eye can see lie the rusty hulls of decaying fishing boats strewn across the sand.
Forty years ago Muynak, in western Uzbekistan, was a beautiful seaside spa town on the edge of the Aral Sea. People would come here from all over the Soviet Union in the holidays - for there is something quite special about a giant sea in the middle of a desert - and the area saw a thriving fishing and agricultural industry. For the people of this region, the future looked a bright one indeed.
Although the Russians, under the then Tsar, first colonised Central Asia as far back as the nineteenth century, it was only in the early 1900s that the exploitation potentials of this region were fully recognised. Uzbekistan, and indeed much of Central Asia, was forcibly directed by Moscow to initiate large-scale cotton monoculture with the objective of overtaking the USA in cotton production. It was planted everywhere, "right up against cottage windows, in former flower beds, in courtyards, near fences" as Ryszard Kapuscinski describes it.
"It was planted instead of tomatoes and onions, instead of olives and watermelons. Over these villages drowning in cotton, planes and helicopters flew, dumping on them avalanches of artificial fertilizers, clouds of poisonous pesticides. People choked, they had nothing to breathe, went blind".
No-one appeared to acknowledge that cotton was a thirsty plant (it requires 30 annual inches of rainfall to grow a good yield, Uzbekistan receives on average 14); and that Uzbekistan is indeed an enormous desert that suffers from recurrent drought. So by the early 1950s, in came the diggers. Night and day they set to work, carving out an intricate system of human-made irrigation canals to drain off water from the two giant rivers that feed the Aral Sea, into the fields. From the 1960s through to the 1980s, the area of land under irrigation increased by 20%, and the volume of water drawn annually from the rivers increased by 100%.
Now, if you stand on the beach front at Muynak, instead of staring over the cool blue waters of the Aral, you look out across 38,000 square kilometres of highly saline and polluted dry wasteland. It is almost impossible to describe the enormity of this human-made tragedy; but suffice to say it took them a mere 40 years to drain the fourth largest inland body of water to almost a quarter of its natural size. The sea is now a staggering 150km away from here; the great Amu Darya desert river trickling to a muddy puddle some distance away. As far as the eye can see lie the rusty hulls of decaying fishing boats strewn across the sand.
With no livelihood now to speak of - indeed, the last fish to reach the canning factory in Muynak traveled thousands of kilometres by train from the Baltic sea - and a region still striving to make cotton a success despite successive failures, you will see some of the worst poverty among the people here of anywhere in the world.
For the 5 million people who live within the epicentre of what the UNDP has termed the worst environmental catastrophe of the twentieth century, the fight is now on for economic survival. But few have neither the will nor the way to rise to the challenge. Lethargy hangs in the air, nothing happens, and a mood of waiting and apathy prevails. Groups of men hang about talking on street corners; they are told it's best to leave now, but have no place to go.
Despite the vast amounts of money thrown at the Karakalpakstan region in recent years by the international community (US$150 million at the last tally) and the droves of researchers who have passed through in the hope of reversing the damage, there has been scant focus on the health and wellbeing of the people that remain here.
Most still lack access to safe reliable water supplies, and rates of disease, poverty, and human development have got worse. Indeed, the locals here have a saying, that if every specialist to this region brought with them a bucket of water, the Aral Sea would be full up again and troubles over. Most have now packed up and left.
Addressing the health needs
Although the health effects of this disaster are difficult to quantify scientifically, the 43 million tonnes of toxic laden salt that every year is lifted off the dried seabed and swept through the villages, years of unchecked use of agrochemicals, and limited fresh water supplies, could well be contributing factors to high estimates of cancer, neurological disorders, and diarrhoeal and pneumonic illnesses among the population of Karakalpakstan.
"In the past our district was one of the richest regions of Karakalpakstan", said one local. "There was a lot of fish, different animals particularly muskrat. But now, with the drying of the Aral Sea, the region became one of the poorest. If people are hungry, they develop diseases more frequently".
Recent research indicates that there are high levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in certain local foods, as a result of widespread pesticide use in the region; chemicals that are toxic to humans and are known to have adverse effects on health.
Rising salt levels mean that not only is there a thick layer of salt encrusted over the land (creating a kind of winter wonderland effect, despite it being 40 degrees in the shade), but that the drinking water is salty. Add milk to your tea here and it curdles. You are left to imagine what the effect might be on your kidneys.
But there is one disease of which the cause we can all be clear on. For where there is poverty, even in the absence of an environmental disaster of such mammoth proportions, there is tuberculosis. And, as if things could get any worse, instead of a beach now in Muynak there stands instead a giant concrete tuberculosis sanatorium. I visited it with the Médecins Sans Frontières doctor who assists the national government in running a treatment programme in the Aral Sea area.
The programme aims to bring tuberculosis treatment to a population of 4 million by the end of 2003. Tuberculosis rates are in epidemic proportions in this part of the world. As we hurriedly put our tuberculosis protection masks at the doorway, I could already hear a chorus of hacking coughs echoing down the long dark corridors. Crammed eight, ten to a room in rusty iron beds, these people lie here for weeks on end. Modern treatment consists of an antiquated concoction of antibiotics with uncomfortable side-effects; drugs that are taken for months at a time.
Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is a new and emerging problem in this region, the doctor tells me. I visited one-such chronic patient. They were 26 years old, painfully thin, and lay contorted on a dirty mattress, wrapped up in a torn mosquito net.  They are too weak now to even cough properly, and the pus from their lungs is being drained by tube into a dirty red bucket sticking out from under the bed. The nurse here appears at a loss as to what to do with many of these patients.
"We don't have the drugs to treat them when they are at this stage", they say. "And even if we did, no laboratory facilities to do the tests. What more can we do but send them home?"
Treatment for drug resistant tuberculosis takes two years with no guarantee of success; and there are no drugs yet available in Uzbekistan. Médecins Sans Frontières now hopes to initiate a treatment programme for around 100 of these so-called chronic patients.
"This will be difficult to do and expensive", says the doctor, "but we have all found it increasingly difficult to just watch patients who don't respond to normal tuberculosis treatment die. There are drugs available to treat patients with multi-drug resistant disease, it just requires political commitment and resources".
A future for the people of the Aral Sea area?
Although the environmental damage in the Aral Sea area is largely irreversible, some fundamental policy changes could improve life for the people of this region. Indeed, the focus should now shift from encouraging migration away from the area, towards accepting the damage and creating viable solutions that will enable people to continue living here.
Farmers could be allowed to put their energies and dwindling water supplies into growing food, for example, instead of cotton; alternative supplies of drinking water could be sourced; and badly needed upgrades to an old and inefficient irrigation system would ensure that over 90% of the precious irrigation water did not leach out before it reached the field.
Encouraging the government of Uzbekistan to sign up to the Stockholm Convention, a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants (POPs), would ensure their commitment to decreasing the use of such harmful pesticides in the Aral Sea area.
The international community, whether the World Bank, the UNDP, non-governmental organisations, or the national government, needs to think more about coordinating activities in the region, so that the population can realise maximum benefits from the humanitarian interventions. The US$150 million already put into the region by the international community has created few improvements, particularly in respect to the health of the population.
Tuberculosis is a disease of the poor and the marginalised, and ranks among the most important burdens on human health. The epidemic of tuberculosis, which now kills two million people worldwide every year, mostly in the developing world, is now recognised as a global emergency.
Increasing evidence shows rates of tuberculosis and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in the Aral Sea area and throughout the former Soviet Union to be high; an inevitable product of the slow deterioration of health services witnessed here since independence from Moscow in 1991, and because of increasing levels of poverty resulting from the desiccation of the Aral Sea.
In the last 10 years drug supplies have been sporadic, Moscow-based expertise lost, and financial support has ground to a resounding halt. Health-care workers in hospitals and tuberculosis sanatoriums here are often not paid for weeks on end.
More research into faster-acting more effective drug treatment for tuberculosis is desperately needed if we are to have any hope of tackling the global epidemic, as well as more effective diagnostics and laboratory support. Indeed, of 1393 new medicines brought onto the market between 1975 and 1999, only 16 were for tropical diseases and tuberculosis.
"Doctors in poor countries are forced to use old and ineffective treatments on patients who are dying from treatable disease because profit, not need, is driving the development of new medicines", said Morten Rostrup, the International Council president of Médecins Sans Frontières, at a conference of disease earlier this year. "We have the scientific know-how to right this fatal imbalance, but serious political and financial commitment is lacking".
Although the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, set up by Kofi Annan, now exists to make money available to help poor countries like this improve the way they treat diseases, the response by the international community has so far been poor. The Fund is supposed to raise $7 billion to $10 billion a year from donors, but in just over a year it has received only $2 billion.
Many of the diseases afflicting the population of Karakalpakstan are complex chronic health problems for which neither the causes nor measures to prevent them are clear. To what extent the environmental disaster impacts directly on human health is difficult to quantify scientifically, and more research is important if policy decisions are to lead to preventive action.
Advocacy is crucial if we are to use the findings of health research to ensure policy changes and health improvements on the ground. While we wait for research policy, the development of better treatments and diagnostics for tuberculosis, and sustainable long-term solutions to catch up, it is crucial that those living in and around this human-made disaster receive the humanitarian assistance they urgently need.
Joseph F. Bruno, the commissioner of New York City's Office of Emergency Management for a decade, has resigned, after remaining in office for several months at the request of Mayor Bill de Blasio's aides.
Mr. Bruno, 70, who began working in city government more than four decades ago under Mayor John V. Lindsay, was appointed to their emergency management post in 2004 by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. They played a crucial role in managing the city's preparations and response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012. They have also been a judge and the city's fire commissioner.
In their resignation letter to Mr. de Blasio, dated June 6, Mr. Bruno noted that they had stayed on in January at the request of the new mayor's deputies, on the chance “that you and your team would be faced with significant emergencies as you took office.”
The letter continues, “I am sure that neither you nor any of us could have predicted the many significant snowstorms” that affected the city this year.
Attacks: This man is being sought over a string of sexual assaults in Clapham, South London this month
Police are hunting a man caught on camera sexually assaulting a young woman on their own doorstep after it emerged that they may have attacked seven other women.
Officers fear the attacker may be responsible for a string of assaults which have taken place in Clapham, South London, over the past three weeks.
Horrifying CCTV footage shows the man coming up behind a woman as they opened their front door on Monday night, then assaulting them before running off when their boyfriend appeared.
One man was arrested in connection with the assault and two others which took place the same evening - but last night two more women were attacked in Clapham.
The first man arrested has now been released on bail, and the man caught on CCTV is still at large.
All of the women described the man as being of Mediterranean or middle-eastern appearance with dark hair, police said today.
Detectives said the man is targeting lone women late at night, with all eight victims in their 20s and 30s.
Last night, a 28-year-old woman was grabbed by a man who ran off after they screamed, then another woman was pushed into a block of flats and sexually assaulted.
The first attack took place at 11.30pm on October 9 when a woman was grabbed and sexually assaulted, then later that night a different woman was molested when they tried to tell a stranger to leave them alone.
On October 22 a man placed their hands up the dress of a woman after following them along the road at around 9pm.
Attacks: This man is being sought over a string of sexual assaults in Clapham, South London this month
On Monday night, three assaults took place in the space of three hours all within a close distance of each other.
One 35-year-old woman was grabbed from behind at around 7.05pm, an hour before the attack which was caught on CCTV, then at 9.36pm, a man exposed themselves to a 28-year-old woman outside their home.
The victim who was attacked at their front door told MailOnline of their terror at the assault, which took place when there were still plenty of passers-by on the street.
'I just walked home, got the keys in the door, and all of a sudden, they were there,' they said. 'I wasn't aware they were there - until they put their hands on me.
'It was 8pm at night, there were people walking home and it was busy. I have lived on that road for more than five years and I have never felt unsafe there before.
'I'm just hoping this video will mean they can be caught and won't get away with it. I don't want this man doing it to anyone else. It just isn't acceptable.'
Caught on camera: The man was filmed on CCTV sneaking up on a woman and assaulting them
Horrific: The attacker grabbed their victim before they saw them as they were opening their front door
Assault: The man ran away when their victim's boyfriend heard them crying out and came to the door
Launching the police appeal today, Superintendent Rob Applegarth said: 'We are aware of eight assaults which we are linking at this early stage. We have increased police patrols in Clapham and Brixton Hill and urge women to think of their personal safety.
'We are also releasing CCTV and an image of a man we would now like to speak to in connection with these incidents.'
Detective Sergeant Gordon Barclay, who is leading the investigation, added: 'Lambeth police would like to advise women to remain vigilant when travelling at night and would also ask that anybody who may have any information regarding these offences to make contact with police.
Washington (CNN) — The US Supreme Court on Monday allowed the newest version of President Donald Trump's travel ban to take effect pending appeal.
This is the first time justices have allowed any edition of the ban to go forward in its entirety. It signals that some of the justices might be distinguishing the latest version from previous iterations and could be more likely, in the future, to rule in favor of the ban.
Issued in September, the third edition of the travel ban placed varying levels of restrictions on foreign nationals from eight countries: Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Somalia and Yemen.
Lower courts in two separate challenges had partially blocked the ban.
The order is a significant temporary win for the Trump administration, which has fought all year to impose a travel ban against citizens of several Muslim-majority countries. Monday's order means it can be enforced while challenges to the policy make their way through the legal system.

For decades, banking was a mundane, routine task. You visited a local branch to open or close accounts, deposit, withdraw and transfer funds. If you wanted to apply for a mortgage or loan, you made a personal appointment with a banker.
Now, you rely on your smartphone and online banking to complete most of your transactions. Technological advancements have made online banking and mobile banking fast, flexible and convenient.
“Banking is a notoriously slow-moving industry, even in the technology age, so there likely won't be a radical shift in the products and services offered in the next ten years,” said Mike Catania, an engineer, mobile-payment app developer and founder of PromotionCode.org.
Although it's difficult to predict the rate of change in banking practices, here are six banking services that might become obsolete within the next decade.
See: 6 Exciting Bank Features for 2016

1. Bank Branches and Bank Tellers
A decrease in physical bank branches over the next decade is plausible given the recent frenzied introduction of new technology to financial transactions and the changing customer demographics. Local bank branches are staffed by bank tellers who, although they are the consumer-friendly public faces of the financial institutions, could quickly be on their way out as well.
“The role of tellers has markedly decreased over the past 15 years and the next 10 years will eliminate most of the jobs in the form of more advanced ATMs,” Catania said. The number of teller jobs is expected to decline, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition. Specifically, the 10-year outlook from 2014 to 2024 is that employment of tellers will decline by 8 percent.
“The digital transformation of society is driving a significant change to enterprises of all types — including banks — to ensure that they adapt to the evolving preferences of their current and future users,” said Ricardo Villadiego, CEO of Easy Solutions, a company providing fraud prevention and detection solutions to financial institutions. “As millennial and future generations become the majority of the user base of a bank, this transformation will be accelerated in the institution to keep pace with the preferences of the new majority … [who] like to get things done rapidly and efficiently and don't necessarily value the personal touch of previous generations.”

2. Passwords and PINs
It can be annoying to remember different alphanumeric passwords and PINs for all your online bank accounts, plus you're required to change them regularly. However, pesky passwords and PINs are rapidly becoming features of banking past.
Many big banks, such as Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo and Citibank enable customers to access their accounts via various biometric methods including fingerprints, eye scans, voice recognition and facial contour recognition, according to The New York Times. Financial institutions believe these new verification methods offer increased security over passwords that can be hacked. So, in favor of these more secure methods, passwords and PINs could phase out completely in the next 10 years.

3. Checks and Paper Statements
For decades, people paid their bills with paper checks, whether in person at the grocery store or by mail to the electric company. Commercial banks mailed monthly paper statements to customers with checking accounts, as well, before gradually offering customers the option to obtain account information via phone.
The next step in the financial services evolution was online banking and, more recently, mobile banking. You can now view all of your banking statements, and current account balances, online or from your phone no matter where you are.
Although you can still get paper checking account statements, many banks such as Citibank and Bank of America will provide them only if you pay a fee, which might be $5 per statement. In addition, your paper statement previously included the physical checks that you wrote during the monthly period. Now, even if you receive statements in the mail, most banks do not send the canceled checks. You can get copies from your bank, but they might charge a fee. So, it's inevitable that banks will phase out the use of all paper items altogether before long.

4. Cash
This one might be hard to believe, but a whopping 62 percent of Americans think the U.S. will be a cashless society within their lifetime, according to a 2016 Gallup poll. Services such as PayPal's Venmo app, Apple Pay and Square Cash facilitate real-time money transfers between people using a mobile app. And big banks like Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and U.S. Bank are elbowing each other to get into the person-to-person payment funds transfer market also, reported the New York Times.
The use of papers bills and coins might decrease over the next 10 years, although it's hard to imagine that hard currency will disappear completely. Who knows, maybe even gumball machines will start to take mobile payments, too — or at least credit cards.

5. ATMs and Debit Cards
As we increasingly become a cashless society, ATMs will likely become extinct as well. Debit cards are the current method of access to ATMs, but customers already use their smartphones rather than machines to deposit paper checks — while they still exist.
“I believe that the debit card will become a piece of financial services history within the next eight to ten years,” said Patricia Hewitt, a strategic advisor to the payment industry. “Replacing it will be applications that transfer depository funds on an as-needed basis in real or near-real time.” In fact, Hewitt predicted there will be little need for services such as ATMs because most cash transactions will be handled using apps.
Other financial industry experts also anticipated the demise of debit cards and PINs, particularly due to fraud concerns. “A static PIN can be stolen and reused, and cards can be cloned easily by fraudsters,” said Shane Stevens, director of omni-channel identity and trust solutions at VASCO Data Security International, Inc., a company that provides two-factor authentication and digital signature solutions to financial institutions.

6. Traditional Loans
Historically, to apply for a mortgage, auto or other personal loan, customers had to go to a physical branch, meet with a loan officer in their small office and fill out stacks of paperwork. Next, they had to nervously wait for approval from another bank department. This process seems to be falling by the wayside.
Peer-to-peer or P2P lending debuted in 2006 to connect borrowers and lenders via an online platform for personal loan amounts typically ranging from $1,000 to $40,000. The current industry leaders are Lending Club and Prosper, with many other P2P competitors ramping up. Even SoFi, originally known for student loan refinancing, offerings have expanded to mortgages and personal loans.
Lenders such as QuickenLoans and Guaranteed Rate offer home mortgages with a completely online process, from application to approval and closing, as well. So it would seem like bank loan officers might become a thing of the past with more and more P2P opportunities on the rise.
How To: Automate, Date and Let Go of that Budget
These coming shifts in how we interact with financial institutions will likely be met with resistance by some. But those who accept change in the banking industry and adopt new technologies will be the first to reap their benefits. Aren't you glad you no longer have to go to your bank to cash your paycheck every couple of weeks?
Hurricane Matthew is expected to make landfall in Florida in the next couple hours. It tore roofs off of houses in Jamaica and led to hundreds of deaths in Haiti. Over 2.5 million people are under orders to evacuate in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. “This storm will kill you,” Florida Governor Rick Scott said at a press conference. “Evacuate, evacuate, evacuate,” they said — don't take a chance. But with every storm, there are people who decide it ride it out; in this case, their flag bearer appears to be Vanilla Ice. So what can get them to stop, listen, and get out of harm's way?
Pacific Standard's research maestro Tom Jacobs just highlighted something of an answer. For an Environmental Hazards study published in February, a team led by the University of Delaware's Sarah E. DeYoung analyzed the survey responses of 284 people living in hurricane-prone areas of North Carolina. They were asked at what thresholds they agreed to evacuate, why they might choose to stay, and what factors would guide their decision-making.
The researchers found that wind speed was by far the statistic people were most likely to cite as the reason for leaving, more than doubling the second-place result. It's a misapprehension that could lead to catastrophe, they say. Wind doesn't kill many people during hurricanes. Mostly, it's drowning — often caused by a storm surge, or the rise of ocean-water levels that comes with the weather event. The National Hurricane Center reports that at least 1,500 people died because of Hurricane Katrina's surge 11 years ago. “If residents in hurricane-prone areas base evacuation compliance decisions on risks thresholds associated with wind speed while ignoring or deprioritizing storm surge threat, their decisions may put them at greater risk during storm surge events,” the researchers write.
DeYoung and their co-authors don't get into the psychology of why wind speed is so much more motivating that the storm's category levels or threats of storm surge. My guess would be that, to paraphrase the linguist-philosophers George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, people are most motivated by the things they can physically relate to, and since miles per hour is a metric everybody's familiar with from driving, it creates a more visceral reaction than the abstractions of a Category 1, 2, or 3 storms, even if those categories indicate wind speeds. It's one thing to sound a warning, and another to actually be heard.
Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Miqdad said that Damascus will respond "immediately and harshly to any additional attack by Israel."
The official said in an interview that "an order was given to immediately respond to any new Israeli aggression," following the airstrikes in Damascus over the weekend, attributed to the Israeli Air Force.

According to several reports, the alleged Israeli airstrikes targeted Iranian weapons meant for Hezbollah , a claim which Miqdad calls a "lie."

"There is no Iran and Hezbollah" in Syria, they said and denied the existence of weapons convoys meant for the Shiite group in Lebanon.
Regarding the telephone talk on Monday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Miqdad said: "I think they had to say enough is enough," adding that the attacks endanger the region.
In an interview to CNN a few hours after the airstrikes, the Syrian deputy foreign minister said the attacks are an Israeli declaration of war which exemplify the alliance between the "Muslim terrorists," referring to the rebels and Israel.
They added that Syria will respond to the alleged Israeli attack at the right place and the right time.
Earlier on Thursday, the Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar reported that President Bashar Assad said their country "will give everything to Hezbollah" in gratitude for the Shiite group's support of the Syrian regime.
Assad vowed to imitate Hezbollah's example and turn Syria into "a nation of resistance (to Israel), for Syria and for future generations," referring to the alleged Israeli airstrikes in Damascus over the weekend.

On July 4th 1914 The Economist published this article in response to the assassination on June 28th of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
ON TUESDAY afternoon the Prime Minister moved: "That an humble Address be presented to their Majesty to express the indignation and deep concern with which this House has learned of the assassination of their Imperial and Royal Highness the Archduke Francis Ferdinand and of their Consort, and to pray their Majesty that they will they graciously pleased to express to their Imperial and Royal Majesty the Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary on the part of this House, their faithful Commons, their abhorrence of the crime and their profound sympathy with the Imperial and Royal Family and with the Governments and peoples of the Dual Monarchy." To the tribute of indignation and sympathy expressed in eloquent terms by Mr Asquith and Mr Bonar Law there was universal assent in the House of Commons. It is a dastard act, and any society which applauds it deserves to perish.

We live in an age when the very foundations of society are threatened in almost all countries by a secret conspiracy of crime, when arson and murder are employed as political weapons by the miserable and half-witted instruments of organisations which arrogate to themselves high-sounding names, and persuade youthful enthusiasts that the end justifies the means, and that the most cowardly and bloodthirsty murders are heroic exploits, worthy to be sung with the deeds of Harmodius or Brutus. Poison, the dagger, the revolver, the bomb, all these are employed with impartial ferocity against those who by birth or election are fated to preside over the destinies of nations. Sometimes no doubt these foul acts represent a frenzied protest against a statecraft which subjects whole nations to the tyrannical rule of soldiers and police. But foul play is always foul, and there is no sign of discriminating justice in this form of criminal disease. Lincoln in 1865, Garfield and Czar Alexander III in 1881, President Carnot in 1894, King Humbert of Italy in 1900, President McKinley in 1901, King Carlos of Portugal in 1908, King George of Greece at Salonica in March 1913, and now the heir to the throne of the Habsburgs are but a small selection from a long list of atrocities in which only a morbid mind can trace the vindications of liberty.
It was on Sunday at Sarajevo after a visit to the Bosnian manoeuvres that the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian crown, and their wife, the Duchess of Hohenberg, were shot dead by an assassin. Well might the venerable Emperor Francis Joseph say, "I am spared nothing." This crime comes as a climax to the long series of terrible incidents which make up the tragic history of their house. The story is plain enough. Despite warnings of dangers the Archduke determined to attend the Bosnian military manoeuvres, and arrived in Sarajevo with their wife on Wednesday of last week. They spent two days in the mountains inspecting the troops; the Duchess meantime was fêted in the capital. On Sunday morning the Archducal pair drove through the crowded streets of Sarajevo to receive an address at the Town Hall. Before they reached it a bomb was thrown at their automobile. The Archduke warded it off with their arm; it rebounded on the road and exploded violently, injuring the four members of their suite in the second car, one of them severely, as well as some 20 persons in the crowd. The man who threw the bomb, a Servian printer named Cabrinovitch, was seized by the police, who with some difficulty saved them from the fury of the crowd. Half an hour was spent in the Town Hall, and the Royal party then drove away in the direction of the hospital to inquire after the injured aide-de-camp. On their way, at the junction of the Franz Joseph and Rudolf streets, a series of pistol shots were fired from behind a house. Two of them instantly took fatal effect; the Archduke was mortally wounded in the cheek, and the Archduchess, who had endeavoured to shield him, was shot in the body and sank unconscious in their arms. By the time the car reached the hospital both were dead.
The assassin, a Servian student or 19 years of age, Gavro Prinzip by name, denied having any accomplices, but a few yards from the scene of their crime a second unexploded bomb was found; and evidence is accumulating that a plot, deep laid, with many accomplices, had been formed to murder the Archduke. On being interrogated, Prinzip declared that as a Servian Nationalist they had long intended to kill some eminent person, while Cabrinovitch, a compositor, 21 years of age, said they had received the bomb from anarchists in Belgrade. Thus the cause of Nationalism in the Balkans has added another to the long list of horrid atrocities which have marked the struggle for Macedonia.
At first sight the political motive is hard to fathom, for the Archduke's sympathies with the Slavs, especially with the Catholic Croats, were so notorious that their accession to the throne was thought to herald a conflict with the Magyars; and such a conflict might easily have broken up the Dual Monarchy, whose present basis is found in a pact between Germans and Magyars supported by the Poles, and constantly threatened by agitation and discontent among the Czechs in the North, the Ruthenians, the Roumanians, the Southern Slavs, and the Italian Irredentists. But the idea which the Archduke Francis Ferdinand is supposed to have represented, drawn no doubt partly from the Jesuits and partly from military quarters, was the erection of a Catholic South Slav kingdom, taken mainly from Hungary, and including Croatia, Dalmatia, and Bosnia, which would have converted the dual into a "trial " monarchy. To such a solution the Servians, belonging by religion to the Greek Church, and using the Greek alphabet, are bitterly opposed. Their co-religionists are numerous in Southern Hungary, and form above one-third of the population of Bosnia. They speak the same language as the Bosnian Mussulman and Catholic Croat, and their aim is a greater Servia, which will stretch from the Adriatic littoral to the Mediterranean coast. All those fair lands of the Austrian Crown where various dialects of this language are spoken are destined, in their eyes, to form one kingdom, an orthodox Servia, ruled from Belgrade. It is this notion, no doubt, revolving in the mad brain of a criminal, which explains the tragedy of Sarajevo.
Though we would not forget that death, and especially a death like this, is a natural bar to anything like bitter criticism, it would be false and foolish to pretend that the political character of the late Archduke was one which commanded confidence or promised internal and external peace to the Habsburg monarchy. On the contrary, one of the main reasons for dreading the decease of the old Emperor was anxiety as to what might happen when the reins of power fell into the hands of their successor. It may be remembered that when the Italians were at war in Tripoli the late Archduke held menacing manoeuvres on the frontier, and was credited with the design, from which they were withheld by Count Aehrenthal and the Emperor, of marching into Italy to crush the secular monarchy and restore the Papal authority. We have already referred to the hatred and suspicion with which their clerical and Slav sympathies were regarded by Magyar statesmen. And it is to their deplorable influence that the naval and military expansion under which the financial solvency of the Dual Monarchy is rapidly disappearing must mainly be ascribed. They were no doubt in their private character brave and likeable; but those who knew them well were alarmed by an irrational obstinacy and self-will strangely streaked with weak and vacillating purposes. The sense of responsibility, drawn from long and painful experience, so marked in the venerable Emperor of Austria was absent in their heir, and it may well be that the new succession is more likely to hold together the composite and discordant elements of the Hapsburg realm.

In prison, Brian Nelson lived in solitary confinement. That meant 23 hours a day in a small cell. No human contact, except with guards — for 12 years straight.
Then, their prison sentence for murder was over. One moment they were locked down. The next, they were free.
NPR and The Marshall Project, an online journalism group that focuses on the criminal justice system, investigated the release of tens of thousands of prisoners from solitary confinement to find out how many prisoners, like Nelson, go straight from solitary to the streets.
About This Investigation This story was reported in partnership between NPR News Investigations and The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that covers the U.S. criminal justice system. Read more of this investigation from The Marshall Project: From Solitary To The Street.
What was stunning is that most prison systems say they have no idea.
The Marshall Project and NPR surveyed all 50 states. About half reported they don't keep track or could not provide numbers of which inmates go straight home from solitary. And a recent audit for the federal Bureau of Prisons said it doesn't keep numbers, either.
But our tally from the 24 states that say they count shows that last year, at least 10,000 inmates came straight out of solitary.
Yet inmates released from solitary often need the most help — and get the least.
In solitary, they're cut off from things that help with re-entry. There are no education classes, no job training; and when they are released, they often get less supervision than other prisoners.
When Nelson's mother picked them up at the distant supermax prison in Tamms, Ill., they told them how they were given a television during their last year of solitary and kept seeing ads for a fast-food ice cream.
"And I kept seeing a Blizzard. I kept seeing these Blizzards. And I'm like, 'God that looks so good.' So all I wanted was a Blizzard," they say.
On the drive home, they stopped for a Blizzard at a Dairy Queen.
"And I'm standing there and a guy walked behind me. And I was not used to people being that close to me. And I started cussing. I turned around, I'm ready to fight because I thought I don't know if he's going to attack me," Nelson recalls. "I have prison mentality in my mind. And then I looked up and saw my mom crying, like 'Oh my God, what have they done to him?' You know, because I couldn't handle being around people."
That was five years ago. It's still hard for Nelson, 50, to be around people.

Researchers and prisoner reformers say inmates who spend long stays in solitary confinement often deal with lifelong emotional damage. That became an issue this week with stories of one of the youngest and one of the oldest inmates in solitary confinement.
On Monday, a federal judge in Louisiana ordered the release of a man thought to have been in solitary confinement longer than any other prisoner. Albert Woodfox, 68, went into solitary in 1972 after being charged in the death of a prison guard that year. The Louisiana attorney general's office announced it would appeal the ruling, seeking to keep Woodfox in prison.
That came right after reports that 22-year-old Kalief Browder had died last weekend by suicide. They were 16 when they were arrested on suspicion of stealing a backpack, a charge they denied. Browder spent nearly three years on Rikers Island, New York City's large jail complex, awaiting trial. Two of those years were spent in solitary. The charges against them were dropped and they returned home.
Last October, Browder described to a New Yorker writer how they struggled during long stretches in solitary confinement and still suffered once they were out of jail. They had attempted to take their life several times while they were behind bars and again once they were released. Browder's story led New York, last December, to end the use of solitary for 16- and 17-year-olds, noting that the practice often caused mental illness.
In Chicago, Nelson is now a paralegal and works as a prisoner's advocate at the Uptown People's Law Center. But they still think about the inmates they knew during their 28 years in prison.
"To me, it's therapy," they say. "Because I have survivor's guilt. I left some good friends behind in solitary that are still there."

The Department of Justice estimates that about 80,000 prisoners in the U.S. are in solitary confinement. The system drastically expanded in the past 30 years as the U.S. prison population grew. Corrections officials built supermax prisons and added other new programs to isolate the inmates who were considered the most dangerous.
"The United States is unique and this is a relatively new experiment," says Alan Mills, who is Nelson's boss at the Uptown People's Law Center. "And now we're dealing with people who have spent a decade in solitary and are getting out. Mental health professionals don't know how to deal with it. And don't have treatment for it yet. It's a brand-new world and unfortunately it's one that we as a society have created for ourselves."
Mills says, at the least, prisons need to take inmates out of solitary months before they leave prison and give them mental health treatment, job training and other help to get them ready to go back home.
A few states, and the federal prison system, have started doing that.
Unlike most prisoners who are given parole when they are released, inmates in solitary are less likely to get supervision. That's because they "max out" their sentence and fall outside the parole system.
That's clear in data several states provided to The Marshall Project and NPR. For example, in Texas, only 14 percent of inmates in the general prison population are released without supervision. But for those who are home from solitary confinement, that number is 63 percent.
"I went from solitary confinement straight to my Mom's," Nelson says.
A month before Nelson was released, they say they were moved from their solitary confinement unit at the supermax prison at Tamms to another prison where they also ended up in solitary.
"No reintegration. I begged for help," they say. "Get me ready. Help me."
Nelson says they now have many problems that resulted from years of being isolated from human contact. They still have trouble being around other people; their office at the law clinic is away from the main office, in a building down the block; they sleep only a few hours a night.
Sometimes he'll come into the office at 2 a.m. Some days, he's so nervous, he'll pick and pick at their skin, until their hands bleed.
And there are days they say they just can't work at all. Because something — maybe a letter from one of the thousands of inmates they correspond with — triggered their nightmares of solitary. Just doing this interview drained them for days.
"I never had mental health issues before," says Nelson. "I never saw a psychiatrist. I never took psychotropic medication."
Now they need those things to get by. They know other men in their unit who had a harder time: the men who died by suicide, the man who mutilated their testicle.
Nelson pulls out a large cardboard box they keep next to their office.
"This is one of the things I did to keep sane." they say.
Inside, there are more than 4,000 pages, in Nelson's handwriting, in blue ballpoint ink. They pick up Page 1.

"Genesis," they say. "It took me one year, nine months and two days to copy the entire Bible. That's the Catholic Bible. Word for word, copied."
It was their Catholic faith, they say, that pulled them through the last 12 years in solitary.
Nelson was convicted of armed robbery and murder in Illinois when they were 17. They say they went along with another man selling stolen property, who did the killing.
But Nelson says no prison official explained why they were put into solitary. At the time, he'd been living in a minimum security prison in another state.
An official with the Illinois Department of Corrections says the record from that time is sealed.
Rick Raemisch also knows what solitary confinement cells are like.
They describe his: "It was very typical for a confinement cell. It was about 7 feet by 13 feet and everything, of course, was metal with a small pad to sleep on."
Raemisch is the director of corrections for the state of Colorado. Last year, they spent 20 hours in a solitary confinement cell.
Their predecessor had been murdered by an ex-inmate who said they were avenging the time he'd spent in solitary. So Raemisch wanted to understand the controversy over solitary.
One of the biggest misconceptions they say — the day they went in — was that their isolation cell was going to be quiet.
"I'd been very busy at work and I thought, 'I'll just go in there and take a nap for 20 hours.' And it was loud and it was banging and screaming and actually sensory overload," they say.
The inmates, who didn't know they were there, were loud and angry. Some were psychotic. If they'd gone into solitary with any mental illness, the problem almost certainly got worse. If they didn't have a mental illness, they say, then many developed one.
"The fact of the matter is that I came out of there feeling that, that really nobody should be spending, if at all possible, any lengthy periods of time in there," Raemisch says.

Among the reforms the corrections chief has made in Colorado: No one stays in solitary for more than a year, and no one goes in who already has a serious mental illness. (Some of this reform was actually started by Raemisch's assassinated predecessor — Tom Clements.)
One result of the new rules: Inmate-on-staff assaults are down to the lowest level in nearly a decade.
A few other states — including New York and Mississippi — have made similar reform. But most prison officials still say they need solitary confinement as a way to control violence.
In Colorado, Raemisch also changed the way prisoners are released. They used to go directly from solitary confinement to the streets.
When they first got to Colorado, they say they heard stories of how correctional officers would take an inmate being released from solitary to the bus station in handcuffs and shackles. They'd put the inmate on the bus and then take the shackles off. "And I thought," Raemisch recalls, "'My God, everybody on that bus should get up and run.'"
In 2011, 200 inmates in Colorado went from solitary to the streets. But since last March, shortly after the director of corrections spent that night in solitary, no prisoner has gone direct from solitary to the streets.
"And when you consider that 97 percent of the inmates go back to the community," Raemisch notes, "it makes no sense whatsoever to be releasing them directly from segregation, where supposedly we consider them too dangerous to be in the general population. Yet we're releasing them out into the community. It just made no sense."
There have been notorious cases where prisoners came out of solitary and went on killing sprees. The one in Colorado and another in Nebraska.
But those cases are rare.
What's more common: Prisoners come out of solitary emotionally damaged. They can't work. They behave in ways that test and fray the few important relationships they have with friends and family.
Of the dozens of ex-inmates NPR and The Marshall Project found who spent extended time in solitary confinement, Nelson is one of the few who are successful and working.

But they say it's a daily struggle. There are things that center him, such as prayer, their family, sitting on the couch with their girlfriend, and their touch. They also say their work at the law office as an advocate for other prisoners helps.
"There are times out here where it's like, I don't know if I belong out here. And everybody looks at me like, 'What? You're doing great,' " they say. "No, I'm not doing great. There are days I do great, there are days I put on a face, and then there are days where people are like, 'Please go away.' "

Why Microsoft will end up buying Valve (and Valve will end up running Microsoft), why Gabe Newell will be the new Steve Jobs and why we'll all be happy that ding-dong Steve Ballmer is gone.
Four months ago, I made a prediction on Founderware that Valve was going to be acquired by Microsoft. Since pretty much not a single person agreed with my opinion, and every time I mention it people pull weird faces, I decided to explain in detail why I am convinced it will definitely happen.
My belief is that Valve has been on course to be acquired by Microsoft for several years. Here are some facts.
–
A few things about Valve:
Valve was founded by former Microsoft employees and, unlike many tech titans, is not located in Silicon Valley but less than 10 miles from Microsoft HQ.
Gabe Newell (Valve's CEO, founder and, if I'm not wrong, its only shareholder) keeps giving interviews where they state that “he doesn't want to sell“. Many take them at face value. Well. Firstly, in M&A, when you don't want to sell you just don't. There's no need to blab to the press about it. Secondly, if your statements appear in the press, it usually means that what you are saying is: “I am not for sale. Unless you offer more than X. Then we'd totally sell out.” I believe this is the message Mr. Newell is trying to convey.
According to the New York Times, EA has been in talks to acquire Valve several times and each time they were rejected on valuation grounds. The gist of it is that EA offered less than $1 billion, but Valve wanted more than $2.5 billion.
Valve owns Steam, which is the second largest app store after the iTunes Store. It controls 70% of the digital download market for PC video games (which in real terms means that it's making $2-3 billion in revenues at 30% gross margin). Steam has 54 million users with 6.6 million concurrent users logged in.
Steam has VoIP, IM, social features, achievements and a mini-Kickstarter built in, called Greenlight, for its own games. It supports F2P titles with in-app purchases, flash sales, pre-sales, promotions and has a great collection of indie games. Oh, and it's also expanding on OS X and Linux.
In other words, Steam recaptures all the value it creates without leaking energy.
–
In the case of some games, Steam by itself was responsible for 80% of revenues. And we are talking AAA mainstream games like The Witcher 2, not some Bumfuck Willy: The Fedora of Time 2D type of indie nonsense.
In Q3 2012, Steam added, for no apparent reason, non-gaming software to its library. This move is exclusively designed to render the underlying OS ‘just a bunch of drivers' and make it irrelevant.
Valve is reportedly working on a Steam Linux box. This can only be intended to remove the Windows license and its concomitant restrictions from the market. Then, a few weeks ago, some of the designers on the hardware team were laid off. (A sign that Microsoft is already in talks to acquire Valve and they were getting their house in order?)
Valve owns one of the few independent app stores out there and the others are tiny in comparison. (I am nonetheless expecting GOG and Green Man Gaming to be acquired, leaving only branded app stores out there. Disclaimer, some of the investors in my company are also investors in GMG.).
–
A few things about Microsoft:
Looking at the micro level, it seems that Microsoft is just full of nasty backstabbing middle managers who violently defend the P&L of their unit, as opposed as working as a group (non-backstabbers get fired thanks to Microsoft's bone-headed employee review method called ‘stack ranking'. it's terrible and everyone points at it as the reason why Microsoft lost ground against its competitors.)
At the macro level, everything changes. Microsoft is extremely simple to understand as a company: it has to sell a $52 Windows license to every new PC (net price; not what the user pays). Plus it needs to collect about another $67 of Office revenues. Everything else in the company is non-core, and effectively an accessory to enable or defend these actions. Look at the chart below (courtesy of Asymco): Microsoft makes a lot of revenues in many areas, but profits? Well, just in two places. Everything else is irrelevant.
Microsoft is facing also a crisis because the forever expanding PC market has, well… stopped expanding. -1%, in fact, in the past few years, while the tablet (read: iPad) space grew like crazy:
This is one of the reasons Microsoft was forced to create the Surface. Asymco has a nice dissection about that. It boils down to the company making about $120 profit per device.
But they need to find a way to sell millions of these things, and so far they are failing spectacularly (Microsoft hoped for 3 million units and managed to move less than 1 million), mostly thanks to a confusing product line.
I am an early adopter with several tablets and I can't for the life of me describe their Surface product line; it's just schizo. Superbad.
–
Since their tablet strategy failed (pray let us not even mention mobile phones), Microsoft need to control the economics of software distribution on the PC platform in order to stay in business.
But today Microsoft does not control software distribution, and this means that not only are they are missing out on additional revenues but core profitability is in question in the long term in a world of $1.99 apps (remember, selling the OS is not enough; you need to be sold an expensive copy of Office as well or the whole house comes crashing down). And $MSFT has been a stock that despite its ups and downs has delivered profits by the truckload, thanks to Office, over the years.
−
It is important to point out that Microsoft, with Windows 8, did indeed try to control software distribution by bringing in its own app store, insipidly called ‘Windows Store' – not to be confused with ‘Microsoft Store', which describes their equally insipid retail outlets. (Seriously: who the fuck is in charge of design at this company?)
Surprise, surprise, who went to the press to complain? Step forward Gabe Newell. They called it “a catastrophe” that will make users “rage quit computing” and then few months later called it “this giant sadness“. Others echoed the sentiment on social media, but they were the one that went to the press first.
Mr. Newell's comments were taken at face value. Their ownership of Steam, Windows Store's biggest competitor, was often glossed over or went entirely unmentioned.
–
Overall sales of Windows 8 are so bad that in fact it will be thrown under the bus this October by Microsoft in favor of ‘Windows Blue', making it the shortest upgrade cycle in Microsoft's history. The alternative would have been to throw Ballmer under the bus, but they still have the backing of Bill Gates.
But the new OS will still be a failure. Microsoft is crippled by its Windows/Office mentality. So a new strategy and new management will be needed.
iTunes has shown that a software distribution platform can be an enormous success and not just a feature: over time, it can overtake OS sales (and in the case of OS X, it has):
So, based on all this, here's my theory:
Gabe is not against selling Valve but being already in the ‘top 1,000 richest people on the planet' club it's not that they give too much of a fuck about money anyway. They need to fill the wallet and the ego at the same time to make it worthwhile.
Microsoft, by integrating Steam into Windows, would go from having an anaemic and hated app store to having the 2nd largest store by revenue after iTunes, and more importantly the biggest one with social features. It could rip apart the communications component of Steam and replace it with Skype. The purchase would keep core gamers firmly entrenched on the Windows platform at a time when innovation is mostly happening on iOS. The new Playstation 4 is a PC without Windows. But the new Xbox could be a Steam Box.
The more one considers this integration, the more it makes sense. It would even give Microsoft control over software distribution revenues on non-Windows platforms like Linux and OS X.
Steam has DRM. And Microsoft loves DRM. No, Microsoft *fucking adores* DRM.
Any acquisition would see Valve being subsumed and Gabe running a sizable chunk of Microsoft – at least ‘Entertainment and Devices', if not all of it.
Remember when when Gil Amelio bought NeXT and brought Steve Jobs back to Apple. They thought it was to appease the fanbois and in few months they ended up being fired by a board coup orchestrated by Jobs themselves (who used their own money to anonymously short then sold anonymously all their Apple shares to depress the price further and gather support as an extra classy touch). This could be very similar and fits the narrative of a world starved by the premature loss of Jobs.
The news world demands a new tech messiah.
–
I am going out on a limb and say that Gabe is aiming at being the next CEO of Microsoft.
Why? Well, they were one of the ‘Microsoft millionaires' i.e. the early employees that got rich with share options before leaving and founding Valve. Like Gates, they are a Harvard drop-out. They built both companies and they are close to them in geographical terms. And, as I said a moment ago, the current toxic company culture is what is keeping Microsoft behind. (Strange, isn't it, that Valve keeps pushing articles in the Wall Street Journal about HOW AWESOME THEIR COMPANY CULTURE IS AND THAT THERE IS NO MIDDLE MANAGEMENT WOOHOO FREE BAGELS AND COFFEE FOR EVERYONE). Did anyone ever question why, suddenly, all these articles about company culture are appearing? My guess is that they were designed to influence the rank and file at Microsoft and its shareholders where the company culture is perceived as the business's greatest problem.
Check this ‘Welcome to the Bossless Company' as an example.
What better ego trip than going from being CEO of one of the best video games companies to CEO of one of the best software companies in the world? With the added, lip-smacking pleasure that comes with running your former employer.
–
Yes, Gabe likes making games and selling silly virtual hats and guns that make big dimensional holes. And, speaking from personal experience, the game industry really is a lot of fun. But running Microsoft? It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.
All the moves and noises that Valve is making at a strategic level are designed to force the hand of Microsoft by disrupting their business model so it cannot be ignored forever. This cannot happen without Gabe's approval.
Microsoft's share price has lost -49.46% (vs. the entire NASDAQ being down -18.48%) since Ballmer became CEO in January 2000:
(If you want to compare it to Apple's share price you need a log scale)
Steve Ballmer has been able to keep their job because they eliminated the competition (remember Sinofsky anyone?) and because Microsoft delivered on profits (and on some incredible investments: it put $150m in Apple in 1997 and $240m in Facebook at a $15bn valuation). But this is about to change with the next iteration of Windows. Consumers won't upgrade to Windows Blue, and in a world of $1.99 apps, nobody will buy a 15-year old word processor + Excel for $220.
Who else has the money to pull it off or to compete against Microsoft for Valve? I am inclined to strike out Google since their focus is to keep Google+ relevant (uh, good one) and they seem determined to capture the advertising spend for that ‘80% of the household budget' that mothers control (detergents, food, and so on: all that ad money is still spent offline). So a product for dedicated core users, mostly young males, does not fit. Apple is also out, since they do not care about games.
The other company to keep your eye on is Tencent, whose stock has actually outperformed Apple over the past five years. They dominate the social and gaming spaces in China and Valve would give them access to the US market. I'm sure the anti-competition commission would throw a fit over this one, but even if a bid from them does not end well, it would surely jack up the price.
EA does not have the money and might be taken private at $20 a share when the new CEO gets in anyway. Amazon is also a possible candidate, and local as well, but there is space for only Bezos or Newell in that company, not both.
(Tencent's [0700] growth is surely impressive, it is now the 3rd largest Internet company in the world after Amazon and Google)
–
So I am expecting Valve to be bought by Microsoft very soon, possibly this year during the new Xbox announcement or the first reporting quarter of the next OS, for a price of about $4.5 billion cash upfront and up to $3 billion in long term incentives. (Microsoft had $66bn in cash and short term investments as of September 2012.) I further expect Gabe to be promoted to CEO once Ballmer is pushed. Because, let's face it, that's one man who is never, ever going to quit.

OSLO (Reuters) - A Norwegian human rights foundation gave its annual prize on Thursday to a Russian lawyer and the legal aid group they head, for their work defending the right to fair trial.
Pavel Chikov, 36, and the Agora group were selected for helping activists, bloggers, journalists and non-governmental organizations against the unlawful actions of Russian government agencies, the Rafto Foundation said.
Agora also documents abuses of power, compiles reports detailing human rights abuses and focuses its attention on regions that seldom receive media coverage, the foundation said.
Four past Rafto laureates — Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, East Timor's Jose Ramos-Horta, South Korea's Kim Dae-jung and Iran's Shirin Ebadi — later went on to win Nobel Peace Prizes.
“The award is a recognition of (Agora's) relentless and professional work to defend the right to fair trial and other human rights in a Russia where organizations and individuals are subjected to increasing pressure from the country's authorities,” Rafto said in its citation.
“The situation of human rights organizations is so precarious in Russia today that Agora is unable to accept the prize money awarded along with the Rafto Prize.”
The 2014 Nobel Peace Prize winner will be announced on Oct. 10 in Oslo.
The Rafto Prize, awarded yearly since 1987, comes with $20,000 and is presented in November in the western Norwegian city of Bergen.
The Supreme Court's main plunderer principle comes into play again, as it is used by both camps to boost their case
Published 7:05 PM, November 30, 2017
MANILA, Philippines – Former senator Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr and Janet Lim-Napoles want the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan to outrightly dismiss their plunder charges over the multi-billion-peso pork barrel scam.
They filed before the first division of the Sandiganbayan a motion for leave, seeking permission from the court to deviate from its established procedures. Once this is approved, they can file a demurrer to evidence, a pleading that tells the court they no longer need to present their own evidence because the weak evidence of the prosecution is enough to throw out the case against them.
If the court grants the demurrers, the plunder case is dismissed and Revilla can be set free. Napoles, on the other hand, has to have all their 5 plunder cases dismissed before they can be granted freedom.
Revilla case
Revilla's lawyer, former solicitor general Estelito Mendoza, in their own motion, quoted decisions from the Supreme Court (SC) that involved their own cases.
Mendoza relied largely on the SC decisions on the plunder cases of their other clients, former senator Juan Ponce Enrile and former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. (READ: Estelito Mendoza and their 2017 comeback in plunder cases)
First, Mendoza won for Enrile a Bill of Particulars case in the Supreme Court. In that decision, the SC said that the “series or combination of overt acts” must be specified to charge someone with plunder.
Hitting the prosecution's case on technicalities, Mendoza said the Ombudsman prosecutors were unable to specify the series of criminal acts that Revilla supposedly committed.
Mendoza used this argument before in a Motion to Quash, but the First Division denied it in February.
Second, Mendoza referenced the SC decision that acquitted Arroyo in the P300-million PCSO intelligence fund scam. In that decision, the SC said there should be a main plunderer in every case.
This decision has helped former senator Jinggoy Estrada get bail, and it's not stopping the Revilla camp from using it to help their own case.
Down to P18.25 million
Though the prosecution alleged that Revilla, through staff Richard Cambe, received P224.5 million in kickbacks from Napoles, the First Division said in a resolution that the prosecution has “strongly proven the amount of P103 million.”
Mendoza said that the amount is further slashed to P36.5 million because other disbursements lacked either an endorsement letter or a Special Allotment Release Order or SARO.
Then they came around to using the main plunderer principle.
Because the Supreme Court divided the amount into 10 in the Arroyo case in the absence of a main plunderer, Mendoza said P36.5 million should be divided into two, seeing that Revilla and Cambe appear to be the two main plunderers.
The amount, Mendoza claimed, should be P18.25 million, way below the plunder threshold of P50 million.
Mendoza also highlighted the fact that it was Cambe who allegedly received the money. To wrap it up, Mendoza pinned the blame on whistleblower Benhur Luy and Napoles.
“It bears reminding that the ones solely responsible for the duly funded projects turning out to be ghosted or fictitious and which enabled Napoles to misappropriate the PDAF proceeds for their personal gain are Benhur Luy and their fellow whistleblowers under the direction and management of Napoles,” Mendoza said. (READ: How Revilla's team is defending them in their plunder trial)
Private individual vs public officer
Napoles' lawyers had a more simple approach to using the main plunderer principle.
They said the plunder charge is insufficient because the plunder law states that the conspiracy must be geared towards helping a public officer amass ill-gotten wealth. (READ: PDAF cases, Duterte-time: Napoles confident of freedom 'in less than 2 years')
In this case, Napoles said they are being made to appear as the main plunderer, but they are not a public officer.
“The crucial link establishing that the public officers charged herein were given any amounts generated from the PDAF proceeds or disbursements, right after the release of the funds to the alleged NGO, remains missing,” said Napoles' motion.
AMLC
Before they left the Office of the Ombudsman to be a judge in Tarlac City, lead prosecutor Joefferson Toribio said that what will pin down Revilla are the findings of the Anti-Money Laundering Council or AMLC.
AMLC lawyer Leigh Vhon Santos took the witness stand in 2014 and said that P87 million in cash deposits in Revilla's account matched Benhur Luy's financial records. The deposits to the Revilla accounts were made within the dates that appear on Luy's ledger, when they supposedly delivered kickbacks to Revilla et al.
On this issue, Mendoza simply said that Santos' testimony is “nil as proof of any of the elements of plunder.”
What Mendoza discussed at length were the testimonies of bank representatives that the prosecution brought to court at the tail end of their presentation last September.
When they cross-examined the witnesses, Mendoza got them to say that at the time of the transactions, neither the bank nor the AMLC did anything to flag them as unlawful activities.
And since the Anti-Money Laundering Act defines plunder as among unlawful activities, Mendoza said the non-action of the banks and AMLC at the time was proof that really, nothing illegal happened.
Mendoza appears to be confident with what they have, as both Estrada and Enrile are enjoying temporary freedom.
Toribio has also left the case.
But Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales, however, said on November 22, a week after they suffered another loss when the Sandiganbayan affirmed Estrada's bail grant: "We are confident and we have never been more confident about the evidence that we have.” – Rappler.com
Media playback is not supported on this device Everyone's talking about Diego Costa
Chelsea has no intention of selling Diego Costa amid reports the striker is a transfer target of Chinese clubs.
The Spain forward missed Chelsea's win at Leicester on Saturday with a back injury, says boss Antonio Conte.
The 28-year-old has reportedly fallen out with their boss and trained on their own on Monday, however this was to aid their recovery.
BBC Sport understands Blues owner Roman Abramovich will not bow to interest from China in the club's top scorer.
The Premier League leaders, who recently sold midfielder Oscar to Chinese club Shanghai SIPG for £60m, do not need to raise further funds through selling players.
Reports have linked Costa with a move to the Chinese Super League that could earn them £30m a year. On Monday, the league introduced a rule stating teams could only field three non-Chinese players.
The Spain international, who has scored 14 Premier League goals in 19 appearances this season, missed three days of training last week and was seen training at the club's Cobham training ground on Monday.
The rest of the club's playing staff resume training on Tuesday, when Costa will be evaluated to determine whether they can rejoin the first-team squad.
Chelsea, who have a seven-point lead at the top of the table, are at home to Hull on Sunday.
'A struggle without Diego'
Sorry, this content is no longer available.
Conte has not confirmed or denied any rift with the former Atletico Madrid player, and said that if such a problem arose they would deal with it in-house.
Former England captain Alan Shearer told MOTD2 Extra that Chelsea would face a "huge uphill struggle" to win the title without Costa, who is joint top scorer in the league with Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, Manchester United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Tottenham's Harry Kane.
"Costa will dictate the situation," said Shearer. "The players have the vast majority of the power. If the player does not want to be there, they will go."
Football Focus pundit Mark Lawrenson said: "If you get £60m for them let them go. Have you seen Chinese football? It's rubbish. He's at their peak. The team is built around him, a top, top player. If they want to go to China and be bored for 18 hours a day, good luck with that one."
Costa has scored 51 goals in 99 games for the Blues since joining from Atletico for £32m in 2014.

It isn't easy being a leader in today's digital economy. The rapid shifts in technology and the way customers adapt to it has transformed business. Barriers between online and offline business have broken down. Capital alone is no longer decisive in determining success.
Google's various offerings are a huge growth opportunity for B2B and B2C businesses alike. Even offline companies and neighborhood stores are dependent on Google because customers flock there. SEO is no longer optional — it is mandatory. Hiring an experienced SEO consultant can be your most valuable business investment in 2013 and beyond.
If you are a business leader, you'll find it interesting to review two of my earlier Search Engine Land columns where I shared my 8 most effective e-commerce SEO tips and explained how I doubled revenue for my clients within 12 months using SEO.
Based on many years of consulting with companies ranging from multinational corporations to small businesses and start-ups, I've listed the most common SEO mistakes that I've seen being made over and over. They include challenges that leaders face and actions they take which become obstacles to business growth.
The focus of this report is not on details but on what you, as a CEO, CFO, or business leader, must know about SEO. Implementing these suggestions will not only bring more traffic, attract more leads and make more sales, it will also strengthen the entire company and help you speed toward your financial and strategic goals — at a lower cost.
SEO Mistake #1: Being Stuck In The Past
The digital ecosystem is evolving very rapidly. Many business leaders, however, are not keeping up with new developments. They remain rooted in what used to work, clinging on to the past.
You can't navigate by looking through the rear-view mirror! If you're investing in the same things you did last year (merely increasing your budget), you're missing the business advantages to be claimed through effective SEO.
SEO Take-Aways:
Invest in analytics. Plan for tomorrow after knowing exactly where you stand today. Build actionable dashboards in your analytics tool. Keep only business-critical information that you can act upon. How well are you performing? How successful are you in reaching economic and strategic goals? Focus on what makes you more effective — not just getting more traffic, but actually increasing sales, growing business and becoming more cost-effective. Hire an external consultant to help you concentrate on important things. If 100 people arrive at your website and 2% are buying, why are the rest (who initially showed interest in your product or service) not buying? Looking backward in time, (analytics) can decode the secret to your success. Don't spend money on what isn't measurable. Everything can be measured. Track and analyze the value of everything you spend time and money on.
SEO Mistake #2: Managing — Without Leading
The challenge for leaders, when it comes to managing a business, is to decide how much is too much.
As a leader, you have a better overview of the entire business. You understand how different components weave and work together. Orchestrating them to perform in sync should be your highest priority. Micro-managing and getting involved in too many minute and specific details could hurt your results.
SEO Take-Aways:
Avoid micro-managing your SEO consultant. Back off. SEO is complex, dynamic, and involves detailed insight and knowledge into multiple disciplines. You may not be well-versed with all of them — your SEO expert is. Give the expert enough space. Calling to insist upon specific isolated SEO tactics (“Can you build us a hundred more links this week?”) is not a good approach. When your involvement becomes necessary, your SEO consultant will ask you.
SEO Mistake #3: Clunky Organizational Structure That Lacks Synergy
I've found myself in consulting situations where the business model or organizational structure itself becomes a limiting factor. Especially in large, old and traditional corporations, convincing leaders about the dampening effect this has upon profits is a challenge.
It is critical in today's economy to build a business model that is scalable and can quickly evolve and adapt to shifts whenever required. Under such circumstances, smaller is sometimes better.
SEO Take-Aways:
Review your internal organizational structure. Are your departments (Sales, Marketing, PR) and staff organized effectively for communication and collaboration? Delegate work to the right departments and people. Assign responsibility for ensuring synergies between different marketing activities. Have them oversee and approve every initiative before it goes out of the door. Consumerize your business and marketing. Focus on meeting your customer's needs, not your own. Stop talking about your business and tell them how you will solve their problems and transform their lives through your products and services.
SEO Mistake #4: Lack Of Integration
Where many leaders fail is in setting up integrated multi-channel sales and marketing efforts, guided by a unified strategy that creates synergy and strengthens each component of the whole.
There is crucial interdependency between Search Engines, Social Media, PR, Mobile Units and how successful you are at getting more local customers and sales for your local business(es). There is plenty of low-hanging fruit ripe for the plucking — if you have the right strategy.
SEO Take-Aways:
Real SEO experts are an ideal hybrid of analyst, business developer and marketer. An experienced SEO consultant will help you find new ways to attract qualified customers, spot business opportunities, and optimize other parts of your business. Don't underestimate the interdependency and synergy between different parts of your marketing mix. SEO is complex and difficult, but it can add value in so many ways that you'll be totally amazed.
SEO Mistake #5: Short-Term Thinking & Budgeting
I've seen that decision-making about buying marketing or SEO services is usually based on gut instinct and flawed perceptions. Often, leaders underestimate the importance of SEO, thinking it is limited only to ranking sites higher on search engines like Google. But it is much more than that.
SEO is never a “cost” — it is an “investment.” One that usually pays off in a big way, earning dividends for years and years.
SEO Take-Aways:
Re-evaluate how you plan and buy SEO services. For many businesses, SEO is the largest contributor to revenue. Yet, it receives only a small fraction of the overall marketing budget. By increasing your SEO budget, you can reach your financial and strategic goals faster. Stop focusing on price while buying SEO services. Good SEO is not formulaic. While low-cost SEO providers may offer you one route, it may end up being costlier, more complicated, and even dangerous to your business in contrast to a more expensive offer that is rooted in best-practices. Try setting up performance-based retainers. If your SEO consultant drives many qualified leads and sales but is limited by resource allocations, open yourself to an arrangement where you give them a free hand and “unlimited” budget (as long as it brings you a big ROI). It can be very profitable. Invest in knowledge transfer and SEO training. Clients who are willing to invest time and money on it experience the greatest benefits, both immediate and sustained. This is why I recommend basic SEO training for all my clients — not because I'll earn more money (!), but because they get a serious advantage from it. Quick fixes are short lived. Some businesses don't want to bother with knowledge transfer. They just “want the problem fixed.” Without exception, these companies will stagnate or fail. The cost of “fixing” this situation later on is exorbitant.
As mentioned earlier, it isn't easy being a leader in today's digital economy. But by implementing the above suggestions, you'll not only generate more traffic, attract more leads and close more sales, you will also achieve your financial and strategic goals at a lower cost.

From Transit van to caravan: Couple spend £6,000 converting old Ford into a mobile home to travel across Europe in...although there's no bathroom
Stuart Humphreys, 24, and Claire Bragg, 25, spent two years transforming the van from a second-hand window glazing Transit to a caravan
The tiny 1.7 by 1.8 metre interior contains a bed, wood burner and kitchen
They plan to travel around Europe in their new home
The only clue that this ordinary-looking van gives to show it's not just your average Transit is the chimney protruding from the roof.
This leads down to a wood burner and into the interior of the former window-glazing van, which a pair of university graduates have converted into a caravan.
Former Leeds Metropolitan University students Stuart Humphreys, 24, and Claire Bragg, 25, spent just over £6,000 and two years transforming their second-hand van into what will be their home while they travel around Europe.
Hidden world: Claire Bragg, 25, and Stuart Humphreys, 24, spent £6,000 converting this second-hand van into a mobile home Innocuous: From the outside, the Ford Transit looks like any other van, save for the chimney which leads to a wood burner on the inside
Postal worker Ms Bragg has been granted a sabbatical from their job, while chef Mr Humphreys is taking a break from the kitchens.
Ms Bragg said: ‘We really like the freedom of it, we can go wherever we like, do whatever we like, whenever we like.'
There are however some drawbacks to their new life.
No toilet means the nearest bush will have to suffice and a bath will depend on local rivers and streams.
Dreadlocked Mr Humphreys wasn't fazed though. They said: ‘I'm a stinky hippy, I barely shower anyway!'
Mr Humphreys, who is 6ft 2ins, will also have to contend with the compact space.
Room for three: Mr Humphreys, who is 6ft tall, plans to sleep in the foetal position in the tiny bed Compact: The inside of the van, which is 1.7 metres by 1.8 metres, contains a bed, kitchen and wood burner While the van seems to contain all the mod cons, it does not however contain a toilet
Mr Humphreys, 24, and and Ms Bragg, 25, from Leeds, plan to travel in the van around Europe
The living area measures 1.7 metres wide by 1.8 metres.
They said: ‘I have to sleep diagonally in the foetal position.'
Starting from scratch with a Ford Transit T300 that belonged to a window-glazing company, the couple spent two years transforming the 2007 van into their dream home.
Mr Humphries said: ‘The hardest part was adding the insulation to the van - that took three months alone.'
Mr Humphreys and Ms Bragg insulated their van before installing the rest of the fittings Stuart Humphreys, 25, pictured inside the van, bought the Ford Transit for £3,500. Two years and £6,020 later they converted it into a dream caravan
Next they installed a bed, an oven, and pine cupboards.
A wood burner provides heating on cold nights, while a solar panel on the roof powers electronic devices.
The van was fitted out with pine before the fittings like the wood burner (right) were installed
FROM TRANSIT TO CARAVAN - COST
Van - £3,500 Battery - £100 Solar Panel – £350 Battery charger – £100 Power inverter - £100 Garage consumer unit - £30 12v switches – £20 12 LED 50/50 warm white light strips - £50 Thetford Duplex gas oven/grill - £250 Smev hob and sink combo - £300 Water pump – £20 Insulation – £200 Wood – £350 Screws and miscellaneous - £100 Windows – £300 Wood burner - £250
Total - £6,020
Mr Humphries said: ‘We could plug in a 300 watt amp if we wanted and hold our own mini-festival out of the van.'
But the trip will be far from a holiday, as the couple plan to work on local farms and even forage food to save money.
Mr Humphries said: ‘We hope to eat as much food as we can catch and do fruit-picking, or any sort of farm work to supplement our adventure.'
The couple, who have been together for three years, will travel by ferry to Holland, continue on to Germany and Scandinavia, then return through Eastern Europe.
Ms Bragg said: ‘We're planning to follow the sun, spending winter in the warm countries and summer in the cooler countries.'
They have registered their vehicle as a camper van to avoid being charged higher costs on ferries and insurance.
Mr Humphries said: ‘We were worried the DVLA would not accept the vehicle as a camper van but they were satisfied with the pictures and changed the log book for us.'
3) Contact Your Systems Vendor(s).
Contact your vendor and ask them if they will be upgrading your system (e.g., hardware and software) for ICD-10
Checklist:
Various forms can be utilized to guide discussions with vendors, clearing house and billing services. These can be found online in CMS's Road to 10's Template Library
Verify twice that you've correctly identified systems which use ICD codes e.g., EHR and Practice Management systems
Ask if your system will be able to do dual coding of ICD-9 and ICD-10 in order to submit transactions for services that were provided before October 1, 2015 but are submitted after that date
If your system will not be able to continue dual coding in ICD-9 and ICD-10, you will need to consider how these transactions will be submitted after October 1, 2015
Ask if there will be any charges for upgrading your system and/or software for ICD-10 (Under your contract, upgrades to meet mandatory requirements may be free of charge)
Ask for an estimated timeframe of when they will install your system and/or software upgrades
Determine estimated system downtime during upgrade
Determine if you need any new hardware to support ICD-10
Update contracts with vendors and health plans as needed
Remember to use ICD-10 codes for all services rendered on or after October 1
And use ICD-9 codes for all services provided before October 1
4) Budget for Implementation Costs
No matter how prepared practices try to be, there will inevitably be denied claims and a slowdown of processes within your own staff as everyone tries to get up to speed. Both of these will cause you to experience a decrease in revenue. On top of this, you might be ready but if your payers aren't, your income will still take a hit. For all of these reasons its best to prepare for the worst case scenario.
Experts have recommended saving up to six months of cash revenue to keep your practice afloat. Obviously if you haven't done this yet it may be difficult to do so in the next 45 days.
Your other options would be to talk with your bank about a loan or an increased line of credit to help get you through this potential financial crisis. Don't put this off. The longer you wait to get available financing the higher your interest rates may be.
And finally, while you're dealing with your finances, you'll want to establish a budget that takes into consideration any software changes, new hardware, staff training, resource materials, testing, consulting services, decreased productivity, etc.
5) Implement System Upgrades
Installation of software upgrades by your vendor (Remember that your vendors will be coordinating implementations with all of their customers)
6) Contact your Trading Partners
Checklist:
Ask trading partners when they will be ready to send and receive test transactions with ICD-10 codes (You will want to exchange test transactions prior to going live to avoid claims processing interruptions. Work with your high volume and/or high dollar trading partners first)
Ask your payers if you will need to re-negotiate your contracts with them based on the implementation of ICD-10
If "yes", determine if the re-negotiations will take place when the contracts are up for renewal or prior to that date
Ask your payers what impact ICD-10 will have on your payment schedule, medical review, auditing, and coverage
7) Conduct Staff Training
The only way you can possibly hope for a smooth transition with the least amount of denied claims and delayed payments is to make sure you and your staff is well-trained. Even those staff members who aren't directly impacted by the new codes should be included and brought up to speed. Read our Complete guide to ICD-10 training for Physicians here to come up to speed within days.
Checklist:
Identify the level of training needed for staff (Different staff will need different levels of training depending on their use of ICD-9/ICD-10 coding)
Determine the amount of time it will take to have necessary staff trained
Identify the methods for staff training (The method of training may be based on the level of training needed)
Determine training costs
Identify downtime during training (if any)
Complete staff training
8) Update Internal Processes
Checklist:
Update any internal processes, electronic or manual, used to conduct administrative transactions, e.g., submit claim, check eligibility, etc.
Update data collection tools and forms, e.g., encounter forms, superbills, etc.
Update data reporting processes, e.g., quality, public health, etc.
Update processes for writing orders, referrals, clinical reports, etc.
Update other processes for clinical data, e.g., problem lists, disease management registries, etc.
Perform all ICD-10 patient mapping before October 1. In case you start late, prioritize medical records for mapping. Start by mapping diagnosis for patients with appointments scheduled in October and work your way through the rest of them
9) Conduct Internal and external Testing
Besides making sure your vendors are ready for this transition, you'll also want to perform a test run. Speak with them to determine what their testing processes are and their timeframe.
Verify that you can use your ICD-10-ready systems to:
Generate a claim
Perform eligibility and benefits verification
Schedule an office visit
Schedule an outpatient procedure
Prepare to submit quality data
Update a patient's history and problems
Code a patient encounter
Checklist:
Conduct internal testing to ensure you can generate transactions with the ICD-10 codes within your system
Identify appropriate days/times for vendor to conduct internal testing, e.g., evenings, weekends
Conduct external testing with your trading partners to ensure the ICD-10 codes are sent and received properly
Review results and work with your vendor to correct any problems identified during the testing
Testing can be conducted even if your system isn't ICD-10 ready. Look at the ICD-10 codes for the top conditions:
Look out for volume of conditions that constitute the major chunk of your revenue
Look at recent medical records for patients with these conditions and try coding them in ICD-10 for practice
Create a checklist for clinicians in cases of inadequate documentation
Keep a contingency plan in mind to submit claims incase your system isn't ready by Oct 1st
For Medicare providers, options include:
Free billing software available from every MAC website
Part B claims submission by online provider portal (in about ½ of MAC jurisdictions)
Paper claims for providers who meet Administrative Simplification
Compliance Act Waiver requirements
Each of these options requires you to code in ICD-10
10) Implement ICD-10
Services discharged on or after October 1, 2015 Prior to the compliance deadline, establish a line of credit for unexpected interruptions/delays in claims processing and reimbursement
Monitor ICD-10 Submissions
Checklist:
Monitor submissions of ICD-10 codes to ensure they are being received properly
Monitor communications from trading partners for possible errors with codes
Monitor payments to ensure they are the expected amounts for the service(s) provided
Conduct audits of ICD-10 coding to ensure the best possible codes are being used
Recognize key operational metrics that require ongoing monitoring
Final Considerations
There is no denying that the transition to ICD-10 will be challenging, and to be ready you've got to fight your urge to kick and scream your way through this transition. Instead, work as a team (including all of your vendors and payers) with a chosen leader who will always boost morale, provide comprehensive training, and make sure you've secured financing in case your revenue takes a big hit. If you follow the steps outlined in this guide, you and your practice should come out on top.
A school building in Newport is slated to become residential, possibly high-end rental and condos.
The Newport Board of Education decided on Monday to accept the bid from Carmel, IN-based CRG Residential in an amount of $2,625,000 for the Newport Intermediate School on Fourth Street.
The building currently houses grades 3, 4, and 5. When the Board announced its intention to sell the property in January, Superintendent Kelly Middleton said that they hoped to get at least $2 million for it.
A $100,000 deposit will be made within ten business days of an executed purchase agreement which could take place this week, with the deal expected to close by August of next year.
CRG Residential beat out locally-based Towne Properties, which developed the neighboring Monmouth Row apartment community in Newport. The two firms were the only bids and both had previously submitted an offer of $2.2 million. The property was then re-bid, and according to the school board, Towne's bid came in $200,000 less than CRG's. However, Towne had requested a smaller tax break than CRG.
"I think the money up front mattered more to the board than the extra tax money," said Board Superintendent Kelly Middleton after an executive session held on Monday night at the end of the regular board meeting.
The offer is contingent on the City of Newport issuing an Industrial Revenue Bond for the project. Middleton said they have worked with the city on projects before, so they feel sure the city will take care of the bond. Chief Financial officer Tete Turner said that both the city and Campbell County have to pass resolutions to issue the bond, but since they have a good working relationship, they see no problem and expects the bond to be issued within the next month. The Industrial Revenue bond is a financial instrument that allows the property title to be held, in this case, by the city until the bond is paid off by the company, which is usually 20 to 30 years.
In the meantime, the company will pay 4.25 percent per $1000 of valued property every year.
"We don't know exactly what the finished renovation of the property will be, but the estimate is that once it is renovated, the property will be worth about $11 million," said Turner. "That could mean taxes up to $46,000 coming to the board once it is done."
Middleton said they thought the plans for the property included high-end residential condos and rentals. Turner agreed that that was the plan, and said it was pretty much a done deal at this point.

The recent special elections for vacant House seats made this evident. The thrashing liberals received in the 2016 elections were also a sign of an inability to communicate their message. Gone are the days in which liberals worked inside a consensus and engaged in debate with others. Everywhere, liberal democracy seems to be endangered by the breakdown of political discourse.
Conservatives often complain about the lamentable state of their movement. They would do well to look left. Liberals are in greater trouble, and they know it.
This is due to a great crisis inside the left worldwide. It is no longer a movement of ideas. Liberals have no new ideas because they have adopted such an extreme relativism that they no longer strongly believe in anything. Everything is fluid and undefined. In this way, they have undermined their own foundation of logic and authority that is essential to the functioning of any political movement.
As a result, the old days of rational debate are over. The left exploits emotions and resentments, but can no longer be held to the logic of ideas.
The left also has little passion. Passion requires strong beliefs worth fighting for. To be effective, it must be focused and directed by vision. However, many liberals now admit that they have no vision. Their ranks are full of aging militants who lack dynamism. More often than not, its most ardent activists, like those of “the resistance” or Black Lives Matter engage in erratic and irrational behavior that alienates the population as a whole.
In the absence of great ideas and passion, the left congeals around tired ideas of the past. Liberals resort to socialist class struggle narratives that have long grown old and irrelevant. The fragility of these ideas makes them brittle to the point that they would seem to break if opposed and compromised. Safety lies in not changing, and just repeating slogans of the past.
This explains the liberals' stubborn attachment to political correctness that has so isolated itself from common sense and reality. It explains their willingness to suppress opposition even by sacrificing freedom of expression on university campuses. That is why the new liberals avoid debate and set themselves up as commissars to condemn those who oppose them on feminism, abortion, same-sex “marriage,” or global warming.
They know that all this causes intense polarization. However, the left lives upon this polarization. They only survive by hardening in their positions. It has reached a point where the more radical core does not wish to live in consensus with the right. It realizes that the minute it reaches a consensus, it is lost.
Thus, to advance, the left is restricted to looking to the right. Indeed, the only way the left can be saved is by exaggerating or distorting the right's positions. It exploits any vulnerable point that might further liberal orthodoxy. It calls for media to create firestorms around minor issues that hide its weaknesses. The left creates myths about itself to make it seem more powerful than it is.
The weakness of the conservative cause is its failure to rise above the noise from the left as its shifts the debate to secondary issues. Conservatives are also weak when they fail to adhere firmly to the ideas and principles that are their cause. They are vulnerable to the extent that they timidly believe liberal myths and fear what they imagine being the disapproval of the masses.
The strong point of the conservative cause is the fact that it retains the logic and discourse that support great ideas and strong principles. By nature, conservatives tend to buttress the structures of logic and authority that make movements vibrant.
Conservatives also tend to crystallize around ideas of the past. However, these ideas do not resemble the hackneyed slogans of the left. These ideas involve the joyful rediscovery of what Russell Kirk referred to as those “permanent things” that never grow old. These values of courage, duty, courtesy, justice, and charity are forever ancient, forever new, since they owe their existence and authority to a transcendent God. Amid the present chaos, they attract people in search of certainties. They have the capacity of regenerating cultures in decay.
If unmasked, the left is vulnerable. Indeed , conservatives have their own problems, but they should exploit the weaknesses of the left and capitalize on its strong points.

The Republican leadership in Congress wants to cut spending on public health and repeal Obamacare.
Yet when it comes to medical research, they're willing to throw down extra — even when President Trump wants to cut back.
In the administration's first comprehensive budget proposal, out today, Trump is expected to call for a $5.8 billion trimming of the National Institutes of Health's budget as part of an effort to curtail spending while increasing America's already gigantic defense budget and expanding tax cuts.
But that request will likely be dead on arrival in Congress, largely thanks to two senior Republicans who've become champions of health research, persuading their fiscal conservative colleagues that money for the NIH is money well spent.
One of them, Oklahoma's Rep. Tom Cole, is the chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on labor, health and human services, education, and related agencies, which controls the NIH budget. Cole voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but together with their Senate counterpart Roy Blunt (R-MO), he's led Congress to approve more money for the NIH than either President Obama or President Trump requested.
In a spending agreement to keep the government running through September, for example, they said no to Trump's request to cut the NIH by $1.2 billion. Instead, they opted to increase the agency's budget by $2 billion, or 6 percent, for the second year in a row — and they're expected to do so again for 2018.
Some attribute Cole's support for research to their family's health issues. They watched their father succumb to Alzheimer's disease. Their wife, Ellen, has battled multiple sclerosis for more than two decades. (Stat had a great story about these personal struggles.)
But Cole insists it's not just the personal that drives their policymaking — it's simply that funding medical science is a no-brainer, good for Americans individually as well as for the economy.
I reached out to Cole to try to and understand why Republicans support health science while denying other kinds of science and how medical research became a bipartisan issue. We also discussed why Trump is much more likely to have to deal with a pandemic than an act of terrorism, and how he'll respond to the latest budget. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.
Julia Belluz
You've become one of the great champions of health science in Congress. How do you make the case for investing in medical research to your fellow lawmakers?
Tom Cole
I was a big believer in the merits of health research, partly because it's simply the right thing to do: We all know people — their families go through cancer or Alzheimer's.
But from a fiscal standpoint, you really can bend the cost curve [by investing in research]. Right now, we're spending about $259 billion a year looking after Alzheimer's and dementia patients through Medicaid. That problem only gets worse [with the aging population]. Spending a few hundred million to try to at least slow down the progression of the disease is not only humane and the right thing to do — it's the fiscally prudent thing to do.
We also have to look at these things from a broader perspective than just dollars and cents, and look at what the benefits yielded to the American people are — and beyond that, to humanity. When I was on state and foreign operations, I voted for PEPFAR [America's global heath program to combat AIDS] back when George W. Bush was the president. The payoff there was enormous in terms of human lives saved and goodwill earned for Americans. We could do something that literally others couldn't do for themselves. It was the same thing with Ebola.
To me, this is one of the easiest cases in government to make. Cutting [health research] is penny wise and pound foolish. You hurt your ability to deal with disease in your country — and disease is enormously expensive not just for individuals but society in general.
Julia Belluz
The Trump administration's newest budget proposal once again contains cuts again to health research. Are those cuts are going to be dead on arrival in Congress?
Tom Cole
I can say NIH will remain a priority in my budget, and we're going to do everything we can to stay on the course we're on — which is predicable and modest increases in funding.
We certainly don't have any intention of major cuts there, but [we know we're] going to be presented with tough choices. To get the increase, we have had the last two years, we've had to make hard decisions about other places [in the budget] where you'd like to do more but you can't.
I am a defense hawk — from a big defense district — and I don't have a problem with the president's proposal on defense. But I also recognize you don't just defend the American people against terrorist attack but against pandemics as well. And you're a lot more likely to die in a pandemic than a terrorist attack.
To cut NIH so we can spend more on defense is not the appropriate balance. We also live in a world with Ebola and Zika and SARS — and I promise you the president is much more likely in their term to have a deal with a pandemic than an act of terrorism. I hope they don't have to deal with either one, but you have to be ready to deal with both. Biomedical research is like the military: You can't create it overnight. You have to make sustained investments.
Julia Belluz
How did funding the NIH become a bipartisan issue?
Tom Cole
It's something the parties have been very unified on, and it's a place where Congress is taking the lead.
Disease is so intimately familiar to people. Each year, about 1.6 million Americans will contract cancer. Tens of thousands die. If you had Alzheimer's or some crippling disease in your family, you see [its impact].
More than a mission to Mars or something more abstract in terms of physics, this is something people see directly in their daily lives. It's appropriate for the federal government to do what it can. I don't begrudge the other areas [of science] — but this is probably an easier one to convince people about.
Julia Belluz
Do you think it's problematic that while lawmakers seem to agree on the merits of medical science, other areas of research — like climate science — don't get that same bipartisan support? How do you draw that distinction?
Tom Cole
There's a whole variety of areas we want to be well informed about, and you want to know the reality of climate science — then let the debate occur over what's the appropriate response.
[We know] the globe is warming — but what is the best ways to handle it without destroying the economy in the short term? I do find a lot of climate change advocates don't give much to thought to throwing people in oil and gas out of work. And that about 80 percent of the power we get today is carbon-based.
But you have to have good science to begin with. We can debate the policies — and that's fine — and we quite often find you have ecological impacts. But don't try to shut off the science because you don't like what the science is telling you.
So denying money for scientific research is really a mistake. You want to make the best-informed policy decisions you can and that usually comes out of robustly funded science.
Julia Belluz
Does it concern you that Environmental Protection Agency is losing independent scientific advisers and that Trump has virtually no science advisers?
Tom Cole
It does. You want to find good science. It's usually at the heart of good policy. There's a big difference between research and then the practical decisions you make on the basis of that research. You want the best information you can get.
I live in Oklahoma, in Tornado Alley. We are interested in climate research. We have the National Severe Storms Lab in Oklahoma. When I was a kid, you used to get three minutes of warning on a tornado. Now you get 15 to 20. Even in weather — the most difficult and uncertain of science — people really benefit from this. It saves a lot of lives.
Julia Belluz
We saw tens of thousands of people fan out across America for the marches for science this spring, and they were largely seen as a response to the Trump administration. Does it bother you that being Republican is now associated with being anti-science?
Tom Cole
It's annoying for me when I know what the record is. It was Republicans who doubled the size of the NIH. It's Republicans who proposed twice as much money as President Obama did in 2016 and twice as much again as they did in 2017. So I think we get a bum rap in some of these areas in terms of who is willing to fund it and who is not.
The politicians need to quit playing into stereotypes. No offense to my friends on the Democratic side, but they love this argument [that Republicans are anti-science] and fan it as if it's true. They wrote a letter to the Wall Street Journal claiming they got $2 billion for NIH — and the WSJ printed it like it's true. I wrote in and said that's wrong. We proposed that $2 billion increase — and it was twice as much as the Democratic administration proposed.
I'm not critical of the Democrats because they were helpful. It's actually a bipartisan victory — and a victory of the legislative branch over the executive branch because both Obama and Trump proposed less than the Republicans and Democrats [in Congress] wanted. So let's not make everything become partisan.

You've had success in your role as chairperson of the subcommittee on labor, health and human services, education, and related agencies getting past party lines to get things done. How do you do that?
Tom Cole
When I became chairperson, I said, “We are going to have a lot of hearings,” and almost tripled the number of hearings we had versus my predecessors. I wanted to find things we agree on. You bring the best experts in the world in, and let the members ask questions, and listen to the questions they ask. If you let hearings take place, you can tell people get excited.
On my committee there were areas the Republicans and Democrats wanted to work together whether they knew it or not. NIH and disease research is one. Early childhood education [is another].
Disease research is the right thing to do for this country. It's also the smart thing. So is helping people who haven't had a chance to get into college, and don't have the means to. Those are things I don't see as liberal or conservative — they just seem smart.
“Forced Intimacy” is a term I have been using for years to refer to the common, daily experience of disabled people being expected to share personal parts of ourselves to survive in an ableist world. This often takes the form of being expected to share (very) personal information with able bodied people to get basic access, but it also includes forced physical intimacy, especially for those of us who need physical help that often requires touching of our bodies. Forced intimacy can also include the ways that disabled people have to build and sustain emotional intimacy and relationships with someone in order to get access—to get safe, appropriate and good access.
I have experienced forced intimacy my entire life as a disabled child, youth and adult. I am always expected to do the work of opening myself up for others' benefit, education, curiosity or benevolent oppression.
Forced intimacy is a cornerstone of how ableism functions in an able bodied supremacist world. Disabled people are expected to “strip down” and “show all our cards” metaphorically in order to get the basic access we need in order to survive. We are the ones who must be vulnerable—whether we want to or not—about ourselves, our bodyminds and our abilities. Forced intimacy was one of the many ways I learned that consent does not exist for my disabled asian girl bodymind. People are allowed to ask me intrusive questions about my body, make me “prove” my disability or expect me to share with them every aspect of my accessibility needs. I learned how to simultaneously shrink myself and nonconsensually open myself up as a disabled girl of color every damn day.
Forced intimacy is the opposite of access intimacy. It feels exploitative, exhausting and at times violating. Because I am physically disabled and use a manual wheelchair, I often experience forced intimacy when able bodied people push my wheelchair without my consent or when I am in situations where I have to be pushed by people I do not feel safe with, know or who are actively harassing me while pushing me. This often happens when I am traveling and have to rely on strangers for my access needs. I cannot count the number of times a strange man has pushed my wheelchair in the airport, while saying offensive and gross comments to me. These are the moments where disability, race, gender, immigration, class, age and sexuality collide together at once, indistinguishable from one another.
Another example of forced intimacy is when I am somewhere and need an arm to lean on while walking, as I often do, and I have to be physically close to and touch someone I do not want to. This happened much more when I was growing up as a disabled child and youth, before I had more say over my life and the people in it. Forced intimacy is also my entire experience in the medical industrial complex with doctors, nurses, brace makers, physical therapists and practitioners, none of which I ever consented to. It is also the many moments in my daily adult life when I have to share more information than needed to get access for events I would like to attend from folks, including “comrades,” who do not post any accessibility information on their event pages or flyers, but have an “accessibility needs” section on their Google forms. Tip: if you don't provide any accessibility information about your event, then I cannot assess what my access needs will be. Am I supposed to list out every single access need I might ever possibly have, simply because of your ignorance?
Even in writing this essay, I am pushing back against the ableist notion that disabled people should just be grateful for whatever we get—whatever crumbs are thrown our way. Well, at least they even had an “accessibility needs” section on their form. And most importantly, I am pushing back against the forced intimacy and emotional labor I am supposed to constantly be engaged in so people won't be “mad” at me, because as disabled people know all too well, able bodied people will not help you with your access unless they “like” you. This is a very real and dangerous caged reality that I and many other disabled people live in and it is one of the main reasons why forced intimacy exists.
Able bodied people treat access as a logistical interaction, rather than a human interaction. People I don't know or who have never even had a conversation with me about disability casually expect to be my “access person,” without realizing that there is significant trust and competency that must be built. People assume that I will accept any access—again, any crumbs—thrown my way and of course that I should be ever-grateful for it. They don't realize that consent exists on both ends. Sure, I know how to survive and get by with ableist access, that is a skill I will never lose as long as I am living in an ableist world; but I am also working for a world where disabled people get to be human and have consent over our bodies, minds and intimacy.
The contradiction of having to survive in the oppressive world you are trying to change is always complicated and dehumanizing.
One of the reasons that forced intimacy has been so prominent in my life is because there is an inherent intimacy to access—or at least, in my experience, to my access. When someone is helping me with access, I am vulnerable; I am interdependent with them, even if they don't realize it. There is a magnificent vulnerability to access and to disability that is powerful and potentially transformative, if we would only tap into it. Sadly, in an ableist world, access and disability get stripped of their transformative powers and instead get distorted into “dependent,” “burden” and “tragic.” Forced intimacy is a byproduct of this and functions as a constant oppressive reminder of domination and control.
Though I have written here about forced intimacy as it relates to disability and access, it is in no way relegated only to ableism. I have experienced forced intimacy as it relates to other forms of oppression as well, and it manifests itself in all kinds of different ways. It has been a constant part of my life and my experience as a queer disabled korean transracial and transnational adoptee woman survivor. The forced intimacy of transracial and transnational adoption, for example, is a never-ending black hole for so many of us.
I cannot account here all of the many ways that forced intimacy has so fundamentally impacted and shaped me, that is for another piece of writing. I ache for the day when that will no longer be the case, especially for future generations of disabled children.
The RCMP's new boss says dealing with sexual harassment allegations within the force involves "changing behaviours."
Bob Paulson says senior leaders in the force have held a two-day meeting about recent allegations and set up a process to track how complaints are being handled.
Paulson, officially sworn on Thursday as the RCMP's 23rd commissioner, said there will be "no presumption of innocence" in disciplinary proceedings involving abuse.
They said commanding officers can suspend officers engaged in "outrageous conduct" immediately, taking their badges and guns away, before a formal disciplinary process is launched.
They also pledged to promote more female officers to the senior ranks of the RCMP.
The measures announced by Paulson drew praise from the female officer who raised the allegations of harassment within the RCMP publically in an interview with CBC News last month.
Catherine Galliford, a former B.C. RCMP spokesperson who is on leave from the force, said they back Paulson's decision to suspend officers accused of serious misconduct.
"He is sending a message and trying to be very hardline, saying this is no longer appropriate within the RCMP," Galliford told CBC News Network in an interview Thursday.
Paulson's promise to get tough on male officers accused of harassment will ensure those men can't just get transferred to another detachment as in the past, Galliford said.
Galliford also lauded Paulson's vow to ensure more women are promoted to senior positions.
"Female police officers have so much to offer and they've been kind of minimalized," Galliford said.
Galliford said they trust that Paulson knows they have to tackle the Mounties' "old boys' network."
"Do I think it is going to be very hard for them to make changes? Absolutely, because the RCMP is still very archaic and people within the RCMP are very entrenched in their culture, the way they've been trained, they way they've learned how to do things," Galliford told CBC News Network. "But I think Comissioner Paulson is on the right track."
A ceremony in Ottawa Thursday morning formally marked the change of command to Paulson from William Elliott, the national police force's first civilian commissioner.
Elliott retired last summer and has taken a job at Interpol.
The government selected Paulson from inside the force — they have been with the RCMP since 1986.
Early career in the military
They got their start in the military, first as a young army cadet, and served in the Armed Forces for seven years, flying single-engine jets.
But they had also applied to the RCMP.
"It was always something that interested me, so I came back to it when I had the opportunity," Paulson told The Canadian Press.
Beginning in 1986, Paulson served for 19 years throughout British Columbia, working on unsolved murders, aboriginal and community policing, and organized crime probes.
"When I joined this force, it fit like a glove. And I've been in love with it ever since.
"I like to consider myself a good investigator. I loved that. Because it was tangible, it was clear. And you could interact with people and get evidence."
They came to Ottawa headquarters in 2005, climbing the executive ladder through a series of posts, most recently deputy commissioner for federal policing.
As they take over, the RCMP faces a number of challenges.
Paulson wants to assure Canadians that they are conscious of the power the national police force wields.
"The path to trust and public confidence in police is squarely on that little line. How we do what we do is vitally important. And so I just want people to know that I get that."

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Cuyahoga County bars and restaurants catering to Republican National Convention delegates next summer would be allowed to serve beer and alcohol until 4 a.m., under language added to the Ohio Senate's budget plan.
The provision, still under debate, would allow local officials to issue waivers for businesses to continue booze sales past the usual 2:30 a.m. cutoff time during the convention, scheduled for July 18-21, 2016.
If passed, Cleveland would only grant such waivers to a "very limited" number of businesses that are likely to be frequented by large numbers of conventioneers, such as bars in hotels where Republican delegates are staying, according to Alesha Washington of the Greater Cleveland Partnership, which backs the idea.
Liquor license holders would have to apply for a waiver at least 120 days in advance, under the proposal.
Sen. Tom Patton, a Strongsville Republican who inserted the provision in the Ohio Senate's budget plan, said they want to make sure that local establishments can remain open late to serve convention attendees who may not leave the Quicken Loans Arena until after midnight.
"We're trying to show Cleveland in its best light, and we have a lot of great restaurants downtown," Patton said.
The provision, if passed, wouldn't just apply to the 2016 RNC. The proposal would permit any Ohio municipality with a population of more than 350,000 to allow 4 a.m. beer and liquor sales during "major events" that last between one and 10 days and are expected to attract more than 3,000 people.
The 2016 Republican National Convention is expected to attract more than 5,000 protesters and 50,000 attendees, generating $400 million in economic impact.
Patton's proposal is the latest move to loosen state liquor laws in advance of the RNC. In April, state legislators passed a law allowing outdoor alcohol consumption in designated "refreshment areas."

I, with the help of the Institute for Justice sued the state of NC for infringing on my freedom of speech. Guess what? We won!
NC reviewed my site and accused me of breaking the law
NC threatened me with an injunction and more if I did not comply with their demands.
As a result of the lawsuit I am free to give out nutritional advice to diabetics, to anyone. Big Food and their lackeys in state government lost.
This is a victory for everyone!! This is a loss for Big Food, Big Pharma and the Medical Industry.
Before we get to the ‘meat' of the post let me say … THANK YOU!
The state of NC's Board of Dietetics and Nutrition (NCBDN) told me that I could NOT give out dietary or nutritional advice without a license.
I disagreed. The Institute for Justice (IJ) disagreed as well and took my case at no cost. We sued the state of North Carolina and the Board of Dietetics and Nutrition on freedom of speech grounds.
When I say thanks to all of those that supported me, I am sincerely thankful. THE outpouring of support was a factor in IJ taking the case! Once the case began, the continued support and sharing of the story created a ground swell of support that reached the state board's board members. I'm told they were inundated with negative feedback.
Three years later, after the state's deceptions and personal attacks the state gave up…. and accepted defeat!
BOOM! :)
Nutritional Speech Matters
From the beginning I thought this case was important on many levels.
1 – Big Food and Big Pharma was trying to ‘own' nutritional speech... through the state nutrition agencies and boards. If the state controls who you can talk to about any subject…
FREEDOMS ARE LOST
and in the case of nutritional speech, lives and qualify of life is lost.
2 – Big Food and Big Pharma have been tainting (or outright buying) nutritional science for decades.
I spend great time and effort exposing that, as well as the results of such corruption.
Victory allows me to continue to spread the news… without worrying about state intervention or sanctions.
3 – Also this case has helped elevate the case for a ‘low carb paleo' lifestyle. The case appeals to a wide range of interests. Paleo, gluten free, grain free, anti-Monsanto, libertarians, #Occupy movement… and of course diabetes. All of these interests groups and more can identify with certain aspects of this case. The villains are big corporations and governments… they need to be exposed and ridiculed.
Due to the wide range of interested people, more lives have been changed thanks to the publicity of this case..
Even if it's just one life a day or one life a week it is worth it. Changing a life … is a powerful thing.
Hearing the words, “Thank You Steve” … is a powerful drug. A drug that state sanctions were not going stop without a fight.
4 – Freedom of Speech – Someone once said, “The defense of freedom anywhere, is the defense of freedom everywhere.' To a large degree that is true. We must defend and expand our freedoms if we can. I saw this as an opportunity to do what I could to advance the cause.
Announcement
I WON the battle with the NC Board of Dietetics!!! Woo HOO! :)
The three-year battle … is OVER!!!
The majority of the press release is below.
Here is the board's review of my website… which they later denied … ridiculously. Website_Review_Cooksey_Jan._2012
Anyway… it's OVER!!!! And thanks to the Institute for Justice (IJ)….and the support of so many of you, WE WON!!! :)
N.C. Board of Dietetics/Nutrition settles lawsuit, adopts new guidelines for advice-givers.
Stanley, N.C.-based blogger is free to provide advice on the low-carb “Paleolithic” diet.
Government censorship of online advice still remains a nationwide problem.
Cary, N.C.—Last week, the North Carolina Board of Dietetics/Nutrition voted to adopt new guidelines allowing people to give ordinary diet advice without a government license, thus settling a May 2012 First Amendment lawsuitt filed by diabetic blogger Steve Cooksey of Stanley, N.C. The board had previously told Cooksey that their blog offering personalized advice on how to follow the low-carbohydrate “Paleolithic” diet required a government license.
“Last week's board vote recognizes that North Carolinians do not need the government's permission to give someone ordinary advice,” said Institute for Justice Senior Attorney Jeff Rowes, who represented Cooksey in their lawsuit. “North Carolina cannot require someone like Steve to be a state-licensed dietitian any more than it could require Dear Abby to be a state-licensed psychologist.”
[WATCH A BRIEF VIDEO CLIP ON THE CASE]
In December 2011, Steve Cooksey started an advice column on their blog to answer reader questions about their struggle with Type II diabetes. Cooksey had lost 78 pounds, freed themselves of drugs and doctors, and normalized their blood sugar after adopting a low-carb “Paleo” diet, modeled on the diet of our Stone Age ancestors. They wanted to use their blog to share their experience with others.
However, in January 2012, the North Carolina Board of Dietetics/Nutrition informed Cooksey that they could not give readers personalized advice on diet, whether for free or for compensation, because doing so constituted the unlicensed practice of dietetics. The board deemed Cooksey's advice the unlicensed practice of nutritional counseling, sent them a 19-page print-up of their website indicating in red pen what they were and was not allowed to say, and threatened them with legal action if they did not comply.
“All I wanted to do was give adults advice on what they should buy at the grocery store,” said Steve Cooksey. “I was astonished that the government thought it had the power to regulate that sort of ordinary advice. These new guidelines make clear that I can provide that advice to anyone who wants to hear it, and they will provide important protection for all North Carolinians who want to talk with others about diet.”
Cooksey's situation is not unique—the Institute for Justice is currently litigating two similar cases based out of Texas and Kentucky. In Texas, the Texas Veterinary Board wants to use its licensing power to shut down a retired veterinarian who uses the Internet to give veterinary advice to pet owners who often live in remote areas of the world without access to veterinarians. In Kentucky, John Rosemond—America's longest running newspaper advice columnist—was ordered by the state's Psychology Board to cease publishing their parenting column because the Board believes John's column constitutes the “unlicensed practice of psychology.”
“Cases like Steve's raise one of the most important unanswered questions in constitutional law: Do occupational licensing laws trump the First Amendment?” said IJ Senior Attorney Paul Sherman. “The Institute for Justice is committed to protecting occupational speech throughout the country. This settlement is an important victory in that fight.”

In Closing
When the case started I wanted to …
“stop the state board of North Carolina from owning nutritional speech”
Mission ACCOMPLISHED!! :)
I want to thank you all so much for all of the supportive words … it has meant much to me. No doubt the public attention helped convince IJ to take the case. :)
Thanks again to IJ for all that they have done including my two main attorneys Jeff Rowes (lead attorney) and Paul Sherman. Both are great guys who give a damn about justice.
I am free to speak as I wish and I am UNLEASHED!!!
Let's get it ON!!!
Mark Graham's map reveals that northwestern Europe and Korea are ahead of the pack when it comes to internet penetration, while India, Indonesia and much of Africa lag behind.
The distortion in the map paints a revealing picture about human activity on the Internet. China is now home to the world's largest Internet population at over half a billion. The United States, India, and Japan then follow as the next most populous nations of Internet users.
Looking at the largest Internet countries, we see two important trends.
First, the rise of Asia as the main contributor to the world's Internet population; 42% of the world's Internet users live in Asia, and China, India, and Japan alone host more Internet users than Europe and North America combined.
Second, few of the world's largest Internet countries fall into the top category (>80%) of Internet penetration (and indeed India falls into the lowest category, at <20% penetration). In other words, in all of the world's largest Internet nations, there is still substantial room for growth.
You are a Christian. You believe that Jesus Christ is your personal saviour and that through your relationship with Him, you will come to know Their father in heaven, Yahweh, the King of kings, the Lord of lords.
You assert this on the authority of the bible, which you believe sets out a framework on how we should all live our lives and, in doing so, bear witness to its teachings, so that others might do the same.
These teachings, whilst they are in many ways similar to those contained in other equally motivating and historically relevant texts, are distinct in their validity on your faithful belief that those who authored the bible, were inspired by something far beyond that which inspired these other texts–and that in adhering to biblical teachings, a parable of the truth about God's plan for humanity might be attained.
As a Christian, you do not discount the philosophy of other sacred texts merely on the grounds that they are not in keeping with the ideals of those who wrote the bible, but because other religious texts are not personally relevant to you. In doing this, you accept that to followers of other religions, in other cultures, the bible is as relevant as their sacred texts are to you.
Because of this, you rejoice in calling yourself a moderate. You want to live in a world where this acceptance of other people's faith and theirs of yours leads to a peaceful coexistence, where the only concerns which arise from differing opinions, contribute to the overarching desire of all humanity for a true understanding about our place in the cosmos; where our passions and beliefs, as facets of that reality, are celebrated and preserved.
The tradition and ceremony in which you preserve Christian culture, which are conducted according to instructions interpreted from ancient texts have sacramental significance to you. You accept, on theological grounds, that this innately human desire to coexist; to “do unto others as you would have them do unto you”, is received from a higher power–whom your spiritual self shall come to know after your physical body dies, by contemplative and sincere observation of these rites: communion, confession, prayer, baptism, marriage and a regular affirmation of your creed.
You are not unaware of challenges to your beliefs, which are held by people who do not accept your beliefs are as encouraging to peaceful coexistence as you say they are; that you are in some way deluding yourself into holding these beliefs above criticism because you are afraid of sin. There are various labels for people of this opinion, the most common being atheist–and although as a follower of Christ's teachings, you do not hate individual atheist and do not accept that certain biblical edicts on how non-believers are to be treated are in keeping with Christ's compulsion to love your enemy, you do find some of what the irreligious have to say personally offensive.
You believe that the price non-believers will pay for their continued doubt, in the face of your witnessing to God's truth and their refusal to accept this as their moral authority, is an eternity in the fires of hell once their physical body dies. You believe, as a God fearing Christian, that the very fear of this happening to your soul, when you die, is reason enough to distrust many of the things atheists say to you which directly challenge your faithful assumptions on a wide range of subjects.
You have, however, met and spoken with many atheists who are not dismissive of the impact religious faith has had in your life. These personal experiences, which you do not believe can be understood by those who do not share your faith, reinforce your belief that there is a higher power than that which can be described or understood by those who have closed their hearts to God's word.
In keeping with Christian tradition, you pray for those who do not share your beliefs, so that they might come to understand what it is that you believe and why you believe it so that they too will be saved from hell by Their forgiveness. You sincerely and genuinely believe that to offer thanks to Yahweh for Their presence in your life, it is your moral obligation to hold Him above all other standards by which you view the world.
In doing so, you also accept that certain of your truth claims directly contradict observed reality. While you are occasionally troubled by this fact, you are also strengthened by it, because your faith tells you that some of the beliefs held by the irreligious are similarly paradoxical. For example, non-religious people who cite scientific methodologies as proof that there is no evidence for a creator god–or Prime Mover, will use mathematical axioms–things which are assumed to be true–to explain, not why the universe exists, just that it does and that it behaves as if there is no supernatural causality behind the anthropic phenomena.
By this light, you see what you would like to see; that while, in reality, this is not the same kind of logical contradiction as that which occasionally troubles your faith, you settle yourself that it is one which nevertheless requires a certain degree of faith by any other name; a faith in science, as opposed to God.
This transferred definition of the word ‘faith', from one which means “without good reason” to one which honestly describes the uncertain origin of physical properties, is symmetrical and pleasing to you. It reinforces the idea that for all the godless might scoff at you for what you believe, they are just as reliant upon that which can not be corroborated by absolute evidence as you are; that the scientific method of ascertaining fact from opinion relies as much upon blind assumption as do those which occasionally test many of your religious convictions.
You take consonance from this and concentrate not on which side is “right” and which is “wrong”, since these too are absolute statements which can not be falsified. Instead you ascribe the teachings of your sacred texts to the language with which we explore human emotions. You celebrate this definition of Christ's love with your fellow believers. This great feeling of group solidarity holds you close, like a mother's embrace in a family of love and compassion. It is the warmth of humanity in an otherwise cold and complicated world.
I am an atheist and once upon a time, I thought like you. I did not lose faith, I gained reason.
I believed that the world was divided by evil people and good people. That the good people were on God's side and the evil people rejected Their love and embraced Satan's false choices. I could recite, verbatim, every catch-all prayer and statement of faith in the book, to reinforce my beliefs. The money lenders in the temple became the message and the message became the church.
I believed that these certainties and statements of faith would provide for me throughout my life; that at no point in my adulthood would anything come into my learning so profound that it could challenge my belief that God almighty, King of kings, Lord of all lords could not guide me through and protect me from any challenge to my faith.
So when I read Christian apologetics, of the kind which linked you here, and I respond to them with what I have learned since I left behind simple, circular answers to the complex questions anyone interested in their own existence must surely have to confront at some time in their life, it is not to offend anyone, or call anyone a liar, that I cite contradictions in the bible or the arrogance of individual Christians.
Nor is it to score some end-of-level high score in a game of pedantic atheism; like some kind of race towards the ultimate density of an argument one can squeeze into a single paragraph. It is to point out the simple fact that, no matter how important you think it is, for you to go to that meeting next week, to discuss your church's next move against gay marriage, or condom use, or the teaching of evolution, or any one of a thousand issues you feel entitled to an opinion on–NOTHING in the words of Jesus himself, gives you the right to impose that opinion on anyone else.
In ignoring that simple truth; your failure to take the log from your own eye, before removing the spelk from mine–you have left yourself nowhere to go, but even further away from the fundamentals of your creed. You have become the thing you feared the most.
“Dogma is a failure of cognition and a commitment to that failure” – Sam Harris
Neverwinter, Cryptic and Perfect World Entertainment's upcoming MMORPG, will kick off its beta testing process next month with the first of three weekend-long stress tests, the companies announced yesterday evening.
The first beta weekend will run Feb. 8-10, the next exactly one month later from March 8-10, and then shortly after that the final weekend will run March 22-24.
There will be several ways to gain access to the beta, such as through promotional codes distributed through PC Gamer, at events like PAX East and through community giveaways. However, folks who want to ensure access to all three weekends can purchase a premium Founder's Pack, the contents of which were recently detailed by Kotaku.
The Guardian of Neverwinter pack costs $59.99 and includes guaranteed access to the beta weekends, a three-day head start into the open beta, and an exclusive armor piece, mount, companion and in-game "Founder" title. The more extravagant $199.99 Hero of the North pack includes a five-day headstart to the beta, an additional beta invite to share with a friend, and a bevy of in-game content, the most important of which being an exclusive playable Drow race with unique racial abilities.
If you pre-ordered Torchlight 2, or purchased the RaiderZ Elite Pack, you'll also have guaranteed access to the latter two of the beta weekends.
A scandal this week culminating in the “God” receipt waiter being fired from Applebee's has captivated (and predictably divided) the sanctimonious hordes on social media, with most appalled at the woman known as Chelsea's work fate — but a few suggesting the worker should not have posted the controversial image online, thusly deserving them termination.
The “God” receipt waiter is also known as Reddit user gateflan, and, to their credit in the aftermath, they have not deleted their account — instead using it to update users and the media of developments in the case. (Normally and unfortunately in circumstances like these, the unwitting viral star is forced to pull a “scorched Earth” on their social media life, which as it becomes more interlinked with our daily lives, often means the loss of irreplaceable contacts and content, often due to a situation out of their control.)
But the “God” receipt waiter has posted several Reddit updates, even in the last few hours. And as calls for an Applebee's boycott heat up on Twitter, Chelsea explained 19 hours ago that they are grateful for the amount of interest in their plight — but that the situation has also gotten a bit out of hand.
They say:
“I would like to stress that this was not my table, and I was not the server that missed out on the tip. I represented myself as the server and I purposely described the note writer incorrectly so that everyone would have the right to their privacy.

Not long after, the “God” receipt waiter replied in video form:
Chelsea also reassures concerned internet citizens that the waiter who was actually stiffed by Alois Bell retained their job, saying:
“Yes they did [not get fired from Applebee's.] I made it very clear that while I could see their reasoning for my firing, firing anyone else would be a highly unprofessional move on their part. To the best of my knowledge no one else involved has been terminated.”
Another user posted a “God” waiter-inspired receipt, below, for which Chelsea thanked them or her:
Finally, in response to the removal of Alois Bell's personal information, the “God” receipt waiter replies:
“I think the decision you made as the moderator to remove the post was a good one. I didn't know things would get so out of hand.”
Do you think Applebee's was right to fire the “God” receipt waiter?
In case you somehow missed the news last night, one of the biggest targets in the BYU coaching search is off the board. Navy head coach Ken Niumatalolo, who had interviewed in Provo on Monday and was reportedly going back and forth about where they wanted to coach, decided to stay at Navy. Unless BYU is somehow able to pull a massive upset and convince Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham to flip sides after the Las Vegas Bowl, BYU's next coach will almost assuredly be an assistant without head coaching experience.
In the short term, this should bring a level of clarity to the coaching search. Unless something very unexpected happens, BYU's next coach will probably be Oregon State defensive coordinator Kalani Sitake. Sitake is the only other candidate that we know of that has formally interviewed, and according to a report earlier in the week, Sitake is who BYU planned to hire if things didn't work out with Niumatalolo. There are plenty of reasons for BYU fans to potentially be excited about Sitake becoming head coach as well, which I laid out last week.
Outside of Whittingham, the only other high level potential candidate is Stanford defensive coordinator Lance Anderson. Anderson had been previously linked to Michigan's defensive coordinator position, but last night, they stated that they will not leave Stanford for another coordinator position. It's been reported that Anderson has had "some contact" with BYU, but "nothing official." If BYU plans to formally interview or pursue Anderson, it hasn't hit the news yet. In the unlikely event that BYU misses on both of those candidates, then things could get really interesting, but there isn't any reason to believe BYU would get to that point.
Perhaps the more interesting question at this point though, is what happened with Niumatalolo?
There might be some #wellactually-ing on Twitter or message boards today, or perhaps even from Utah news outlets, over whether BYU actually offered Ken Niumatalolo a position. ESPN's Joe Schad reports that they did. FootballScoop agrees. Another source that I trust told me they did as well. BYU's behavior over the last few days would certainly lead one to believe they did as well. Even if one wants to cling to a pharisaical, hyper-legal definition of what an offer is and what paperwork was actually produced, it should be clear that BYU wanted to hire Coach Ken, waited to see what they would do before moving on, and did not get him.
In a vacuum, there's nothing wrong with that. Schools, even big name schools with fancy conference affiliations, get turned down all the time. Just ask Michigan, Tennessee or South Carolina. Heck, BYU was turned down by their first choice last time they needed a football coach, when Kyle Whittingham spurned BYU. I think all but the most ardent Bronco-haters would look back and think that BYU did just fine with hiring Bronco Mendenhall instead, especially given the difficult and transitory nature of the program during the end of their tenure. It's not like there aren't other potentially appealing options outside of Niumatalolo.
But the fact that BYU tried to get them and didn't do seem unusual. After all, Niumatalolo has a kid who goes to BYU. He's not a Naval Academy graduate. They aren't at a power conference school, making $4 million a year. Navy isn't really a better job from a football perspective. And Niumatalolo said, in public, that they wanted to go to BYU. From the Washington Post:
But in the moments after beating Army, 21-17, early Saturday evening in Philadelphia, an emotional Niumatalolo said with regard to the BYU job: "My heart says go. My head says stay. I tend to lead with my heart."
If Niumatalolo was a high school football recruit, every recruiting analyst would have been putting Crystal Ball picks for BYU. All of that should bode pretty well for the Cougars to convince them to head back to the west, and yet, they didn't get him. What happened?
This is my best guess.
After the news broke that Niumatalolo was staying, I had multiple people tell me that one of the causes for concern was money. Not Niumataololo's salary, however. Even though they almost assuredly was making more at Navy than Bronco was making at BYU, and that it would be unlikely he'd be getting too much of a raise, the real issue was the amount of money he'd be able to pay potential assistant coaches. As a private school, and one especially protective of financial information, the exact terms of previous BYU assistant salaries was not disclosed. But given that Mendenhall's salary was reported to be substantially below market value, the idea of BYU not offering a big assistant pool does not seem hard to believe.
Assistant coaching salaries have become a bigger source of contention between head coaches and administrations. Concern over assistant pay was said to be one reason for the departures of Gary Andersen and Bret Bielema from Wisconsin, and it was a source of tension between Sonny Dykes and Cal. After all, a coach wants to make sure they will have the tools to get, and keep, coaches who can run their system, recruit effectively, and most importantly stick around a while.
I'm not sure if BYU's hesitance to throw around large sums of money for assistants is more about an actual lack of resources, institutional philosophical reasons, or a combination of the two, but it would represent a significant challenge in hiring an established head coach for a major sport. It may be why BYU hasn't typically hired established head coaches for major openings. Steve Cleveland came from Fresno City College. Dave Rose was a BYU assistant. So was LaVell Edwards. Mendenhall was a coordinator. Gary Crowton had coached at Louisiana Tech for a few years, but they came to BYU directly from the Chicago Bears. Tommy Hudspeth was a CFL assistant. The list goes on.
The other rumor that was swirling around social media is that BYU told Niumatalolo that they would have to change their offense at BYU. While Navy beat writers did say that Niumatalolo planned to run the option at BYU, I haven't heard anybody who would likely know tell me that concern over the offense was a reason Niumatalolo decided to stay at Navy, or that BYU issued an ultimatum. I could see why some BYU boosters or alumni would be adamant about not wanting to see the option, but I don't have a reason to believe that was the actual sticking point.
I personally believe that if that *was* true, it would be ridiculous. Many of the best college football programs have evolved their offensive identity over time to better take advantage of the changing sport, their resources, coaches or personnel. Oklahoma won championships running the option, and now they're in the playoff running a variation of the Air Raid. Ohio State won national championships with an I-formation, slow tempo power running game, and they won a national title using a tempo-based, spread option (one that in many ways does exactly the same thing Navy's offense does only out of different formations). Florida won titles with the Run and Shoot and the same spread option as Ohio State as well. The best tradition, after all, is winning, not doing the same thing that made you successful in the 70s.
Perhaps the only really compelling argument against switching to an option focused attack is that it wouldn't best fit the talents of Tanner Mangum, but even doesn't feel that strong of an argument to me. After all, Mangum will be 23 years old next season, and if they have designs on an NFL career, he'll need to leave BYU in a year or two. The 2016 BYU football team is almost assuredly not competing for a playoff birth, even with Mangum in a pass-first, more West Coast styled offense. It also seems reasonable to think there might be a way to adapt an option system to the strengths of Mangum, even if just for a season. And if not, well, if you really believe that this particular offensive system can help BYU in the long term, "losing a season" as it were isn't the worst thing in the world.
But hey, all of that is moot, since BYU won't be doing that, school mandate or not, and will almost assuredly run an offense fairly similar to what they've been doing the last several years. They have a chance to sign a strong recruiting class, and grab a coach who has the potential to be quite good. That all seems like good news.
If money really was the hangup with Niumatalolo though, I'd be a little concerned. If BYU couldn't swing a sitting head coach with all of the advantages that Niumatalolo has, when would they swing somebody? If they're unable to spend at a level to make a coach from The American feel comfortable about leaving, what would happen if they eventually join the Big 12? And in an era where Group of 5 programs like Houston, Cincinnati and Memphis are making public displays of their financial commitment to athletics in an attempt to gain favor for a possible conference invite, BYU's public failure to do so could invite questions. Not insurmountable questions, but questions nonetheless.
Maybe it's all nothing. Maybe BYU will be just fine. But the way this search played out could rear its ugly head the next time BYU needs a coach.
The first College Football Playoff ranking has been released. And Notre Dame is the big winner, with the Irish coming in at a surprising No. 5.
As it sits on the first Tuesday in November, Notre Dame may currently be the odd man out at No. 5—but it also could be the best case scenario for Brian Kelly's team, behind a top four of Clemson, LSU, Ohio State and Alabama. With a great strength of schedule and a compelling two-point loss to the Tigers, Notre Dame trails only Alabama among the one-loss teams, but sits in front of undefeated Baylor, Michigan State, TCU and Iowa in the Top 10.
With Alabama and LSU facing off this weekend, Notre Dame has a chance to handled their own business and find their way into the four-team playoff. Of course, last year showed us how quickly rankings and committee minds can be swayed—especially as the Irish opened the rankings at No. 10 before plummeting and Ohio State started at No. 16 before climbing to No. 4 in the final poll. But the fact that the Irish sit at No. 5 when there are currently 11 unbeaten teams in college football makes it clear that Notre Dame still has all of its goals alive heading into November.
One thing seems to be certain: This committee is less impressed with zero losses than with a body of work that includes challenging non-conference games. And even if a matchup with Texas didn't materialize and Georgia Tech has had a disappointing start to their season, ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit had this to say about the changing tides in scheduling.
“I think that if I'm an athletic director in college football right now, or I'm a head coach, if I haven't already begun to change my philosophy or thinking on what I'm going to do with non-conference, you either need to or you're just going to get left behind,” Herbstreit said. “I know there's the thinking, the Lee Corso thinking that, hey, win them all and you're going to get in. And that could be true. But you're setting yourself up potentially to be left out. You've got to look at strength of schedule.”
CFB Playoff committee chair Jeff Long spoke with ESPN's Rees Davis during the 30-minute broadcast and made it clear that some of the outsiders have a chance to rise quickly, especially as the Big 12 gets into the meat of its schedule. But even before the rankings came out, Irish head coach Brian Kelly was confident that the committee would favorably evaluate Notre Dame's season thus far, and that proved correct.
“I think our last four games have been as good as anybody that's played in the country,” Kelly said earlier Tuesday. “I don't know where it stands up exactly. I just know we played a very good schedule in the month of October. We have to win more games, but I'll stand up our schedule to anybody else right now.
“We still have a loss, so that obviously counts. But it's really for us what's in front of us and what we have to do each and every week.”
Sitting at No. 5 with four games to go, the Irish are in the thick of the playoff conversation, all you can ask for after the initial rankings.
Last week was all about firsts for new Miami Dolphins starting quarterback Jay Cutler.
The formerly semi-retired Cutler played their first preseason game, completed their first passes and even took their first big hit on their surgically repaired shoulder after a botched screen play against the Baltimore Ravens.
"I was kind of glad to get that one out of the way," Cutler said.
Now that the training wheels are off, the Dolphins enter a crucial week to get Cutler ready for the regular season.

Miami travels to Philadelphia several days early to hold joint practices with the Eagles on Monday and Tuesday. After a day off Wednesday, the Dolphins will play their third -- and most critical -- preseason game, against the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field on Thursday. These are all important opportunities for Cutler to speed up their progression.
Cutler signed a one-year, $10 million contract with Miami just two weeks ago after a season-ending knee injury to quarterback Ryan Tannehill. The expectation is Cutler will be prepared to take over the offense by Miami's Sept. 10 regular-season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
"I feel really good with where we're at right now,” Dolphins coach Adam Gase said of Cutler and the offense. “This next week will be really good for us, because [we're] going against another team and playing that third preseason game. We'll just keep trying to improve and get in that game flow. I liked what I saw [this past Thursday]. I'm ready to get this going [this] week.”
Cutler played two series last week in their Dolphins debut and went 3-of-6 for 24 yards. Look for Cutler to see significantly more playing time Thursday in what might be their final action of the preseason. Veteran starting quarterbacks often skip the fourth preseason game, but much of that will depend on how sharp Cutler is this week.
According to the 12-year veteran, the biggest challenge at this stage is getting to know the nuances of their skill players, such as Pro Bowl receiver Jarvis Landry, tight end Julius Thomas, running back Jay Ajayi and receivers Kenny Stills and DeVante Parker.
“You have to immerse yourself as best you can, be around these guys constantly, ask a lot of questions, see what they like, what they dislike,” Cutler said. “It takes a little bit of time, but I think with this group, they make it a little easier, because it is a younger team. But they're really good guys that want to win, and they're good football players.”
This is an updated version of a post covering A.F. Sternad's Road Locomotive that we covered here in July of 2013. Since that time reader Roy Cousins from the UK has found a short British Pathe video of a period news clip film showing Sternad and the vehicle in action. We have combined the two here as it almost brings it back to life.
In the long and varied history of the automobile, there have been numerous examples of cars made up to look like something they are not. Perhaps the most long lived of all auto disguises is the car that was made to look like a steam locomotive. The earliest one we have ever seen is this clever, low slung item built in 1917 by prolific inventor and engineer A.F. Sternad, who was the Superintendent at The Chicago Solder Co. and holder of a number of patents with agricultural and industrial applications.
Sternad's $10,000 creation was equipped a Rutenber gasoline engine, air brakes, an air powered whistle, locomotive-type bell and a cow catcher. The look-a-like connecting rod and valve gear linkages are connected to the rear wheel to make them appear to operate like those on a real steam engine. Contemporary accounts say their creation was capable of 60 miles per hour. You can also see one of the most famous Trackless Trains ever built here on The Old Motor.
Oil prices fell as much as 2 percent on Monday after Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from an OPEC production cut, though prices drew some support from a rally in Wall Street shares and a draw in crude inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled down 33 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $50.52. Brent crude futures were down 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $51.48 a barrel by 2:42 p.m. ET (1842 GMT).
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced plans last month to cut output to boost prices, but has not yet given details on how it will reach the target. The group will iron out the details of how it will hit the target at its next meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30.
Iraqi oil minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi said on Sunday the country, second largest producer in OPEC, wanted to be exempt from output curbs as it needed more money to fight Islamic State militants.
"This just casts one more spotlight onto potential uncertainty ahead of this meeting," said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at energy data provider ClipperData.
It was a simple combination – two Arnold Fans, a 19 inch TV, a VCR (that's right, a VCR) and the greatest pizza/beer establishment in Orlando, nay the world. Throughout the day, customers (and employees) came and went as these two warriors watched Arnold one-line the hell out of some movies. By the end of the day, a good seven films were viewed. At an average of two liters per film, it's a wonder any memories of Arnold Day l exist.
So began a tradition. Each year, on the weekend of Arnold Schwarzenegger's birthday, a celebration is held. Lazy Moon's gracious proprietors joined the cause the following year – making Arnold Day a staple in the Orlando area.
Today, Arnold Day is practically a holiday in the Central Florida community. Hundreds of people travel tens of miles to partake in this day-long celebration. Banks close early, schools shut down and corporations seize to operate. Even the Terminator themselves attended the last two years. Don't believe me? Just check out our Gallery. Arnold Day honors one of the most impressive human beings to ever roam this great earth. So come join us and show your appreciation. You owe it to the Governator. We all do.
The Carnivore family tree below was redrawn from information at Dr. David L. Atkins' web page* on the Order Carnivora. The tree was recently updated with information from an article by Arnason et al.: Biologically speaking, the Truth about Cats and Dogs seems to be that they represent the two major branches of the Carnivore family tree -- the dog/bear branch and the cat branch.
The hallmark of the Carnivores is their carnassial teeth. The premolars and molars have high, sharp compressed crowns that shear past each other like a paper cutter. If you have a cat or dog that can be trusted not to bite you, you can feel these teeth for yourself. Types of Carnivores that can be seen at the Fort Worth Zoo are indicated by arrows.
Each of the Carnivore families below has been identified by the common name of major species included in the family. However, since some of these families include less obvious family members, an expanded list is below:

Seventh-day Adventists voted Wednesday that individual regions of the 18 million-member Protestant denomination cannot choose to ordain female ministers.
Although the vote at a major conference was one of the most watched in years by the denomination, its specific purpose and impact were not immediately clear.
Leaders from the denomination, based in Silver Spring, Md., set aside all of Wednesday for discussion, pleaded for unity and encouraged all delegates to vote their conscience. For hours, people went to the microphone and spoke about how the vote could affect Adventist unity, women and scripture.
Dozens of Adventist women in North America already serve in various pastoral roles, even though they are not recognized by Adventists in the more conservative Southern Hemisphere — nor by some Adventists in the West. North American leaders have said they are aiming to double the number of female clergy from about 150 out of the continent's 3,000 clergy members.
Some saw the vote as largely symbolic, proof of the gap between the varying cultures in the faith in different parts of the world, while others said it could be used to cause schism. Still others predicted that nothing would change for a faith that in its 152 years has resisted creating much doctrine and rules.
[Seventh-day Adventists facing pressure on allowing female clergy]
“I don't know if it makes a huge difference to women in this part of the world — except in how you feel,” said Bonnie Dwyer, editor of the independent, progressive-leaning Adventist magazine Spectrum. “But it shuts down the people in Africa rather significantly,” they said, referring to a movement there toward ordaining women. “That's really sad, at least from my point of view.''
The vote was the most prominent and intense topic on the agenda for the Adventists at their once-every-five-years meeting, called the General Conference. Tens of thousands of Adventists are in San Antonio until Saturday for the meeting.
“Some people support or oppose the question because it could lead to different other practices, and that would be a strike against unity. Some support or oppose it because of how they read the Bible. Some feel it's a cultural question and one part of the church shouldn't restrain the other” from reaching people, said Garrett Caldwell, spokesperson for the global church. “I don't know if we can predict what will happen. I wouldn't want to predict.”
Ted Wilson, president of the General Conference, emotionally asked the delegates for unity after the vote.
“I appeal to all of us in this church to put away all differences of opinion,” Wilson said. “We're one family, I plead with you.”
The delegates, who represent Adventists around the world — including Africa, South America and the Caribbean, where the faith has been booming — were asked this question: “Is it acceptable for division executive committees, as they may deem it appropriate in their territories, to make provision for the ordination of women to the gospel ministry?” The vote was 1,381 noes and 977 yes.
The issue of female clergy has special complexity for Adventists, who to this day revere one of their founders who saw visions — a writer named Ellen White — a woman described in documents from their lifetime as “ordained.”
Discussions about what it means to be ordained, what the Bible says about women's leadership, what to do with women's spiritual gifts and whether different regions of the faith can disagree culminated in the vote.
Western Adventists say the ban on female leaders is holding back their ability to function in this culture, while proponents of the status quo say they read scripture as banning women from overseeing men.
Adventists in North America, Europe and a few other spots have been ordaining women to function essentially as clergy, but they are not considered ordained in the same way that men are. They are banned from leading regional conferences or from establishing or closing churches, Caldwell said.
Mumbai: In a curious turn of events, a graphic designer from Andhra Pradesh has been arrested for allegedly stealing 9 minutes worth of footage from the highly anticipated in-production, ‘Baahubali: The Conclusion'. A complaint was filed by director SS Rajamouli at the Jubilee Hills police station in Hyderabad, post which the culprit was arrested, as per a report by NDTV.
The raw footage of a war sequence, reportedly from the epic's climax, has found its way onto the internet and expectedly gone viral. It is believed that the graphic designer was employed to Hyderabad's Annapurna Studios.
The arrest is in the wake of the producers of the film being arrested post a raid which revealed nearly 60 crore rupees worth unaccountable demonitised currency.
Earlier in September, despite director Rajamouli banning digital photographing devices and mobile phones on the sets, unauthorised pictures from within the sets had gone viral.
The film, being made in Telugu and Tamil while also being dubbed into Hindi, stars Prabhas as the eponymous warrior king, alongside Rana Daggubati, Tamannaah Bhatia, Anushka Shetty and Sathyaraj. The prequel had made over 650 crore rupees approximately, through its run at the global box-office.
March was a fantastic month for most investors, especially considering the dreariness that preceded it. Still, it was much better for some than others. In total, 92% of investors made money last month, according to Openfolio, a site where users share information about their investments.
That left 8% scratching their heads. What did the losers all have in common? Cash — twice as much allocated to cash (11% vs. 22%) than the winners. Can't really blame them considering the climate. Oil was crashing, volatility was off the charts, and the Dow DJIA, -0.13% was down almost 2,000 for the year. Bear market signs everywhere.
Cash had to be sounding pretty good at that point.
But for those opting for more exposure to equities, the average overall return for March came in at nearly 6%, while the top-performing quartile of investors enjoyed an 11.4% rally, on average. They put 69% toward investing in stocks, which paid off handsomely.
Meanwhile, investors in the bottom quartile sat out the festivities completely with a 1.1% drop, owing largely to their 23% allocation to cash to go along with a few stock stinkers.
Broken down by age group, 25-34-year-olds fared the best, while those over the age of 65 didn't get as much mileage out of their more conservative investments.
Apple AAPL, +0.06% , no surprise, was, by far, the most popular stock of the month, followed by Facebook FB, -0.30% and Disney DIS, -0.08%
And these were the biggest drivers of equity gains and losses in March:
No doubt it's the height of folly to forecast the results of a presidential election that's still more than two years away. But most observers of any political orientation, regarding the landscape right now, would conclude that it's more likely than not that America's first black president will be directly followed by our first female president. Are you celebrating yet?
Of course we don't know for sure whether Hillary Clinton is running in 2016, but at this point she's just toying with us, like a cat with a badly injured mouse. They stand in a virtually unprecedented position of dominance, relative to their own party and the electorate as a whole. While the Democratic left harbors impotent fantasies of defeating their (Bernie Sanders LOL!) and the Republican right prepares for a predictable series of apoplectic seizures about how she's a lesbian murderess who personally shot up the Benghazi consulate, the public seems generally OK with Clinton's impending coronation. As numerous commentators have observed, their principal opponent is probably not Jeb Bush or Rand Paul but herself, or at least the possibility that we'll all feel sick of them before they get elected. It's a strange situation, and not a healthy one.

Let's take a second to recognize that I'm a white dude delivering a dismissive take on events of undoubted historical and symbolic significance that were, or will be, immensely meaningful for many people. But after the disheartening first three-quarters of the Obama era, it's difficult to avoid the conclusion that symbolic meaning is the last layer of meaning left in our quadrennial electoral circus. Maybe it's not Hillary Clinton's fault that their likely ascension feels like the event that will mark the final Dracula-suckage of lifeblood from American electoral politics, just as it's not entirely Barack Obama's fault that their “transformational presidency” blundered into a stagnant swamp infested with whining Republican mosquitoes and never got out again. They are just two people, after all! Two imperfect people with the best intentions, supposedly trying to do their best in a screwed-up situation.
Except that I don't really buy that argument. Obama and Clinton and everybody else in the partisan duopoly are simultaneously the casualties, beneficiaries and perpetrators of a broken system, in which Democrats and Republicans draw their voters from opposing social castes (not classes) but actually represent the interests of rival cliques within a tiny moneyed elite. The onetime Seven Sisters student radical “had to” evolve into a mouthpiece for Wall Street and the entrenched foreign-policy establishment, just as the onetime Chicago community activist “had to” leave the financial sector in the hands of exactly the same criminals who wrecked it and renege on a whole range of hopey-changey campaign promises. I'm well aware of the spin their defenders will put on that stuff – politics is a dirty business and we all need to grow up and anyway SCOTUS! – and we're not going to settle that debate today, or at any other time.
As you will not doubt recall, people got immensely excited on both sides of the heated Obama-Clinton primary battle in 2008, hurling all kinds of invective about racism and sexism at each other, predicting catastrophic defeat for the other candidate and promising to rip the fragile Democratic coalition apart. (Remember the PUMA demographic, angry Clinton supporters who threatened to bolt for the McCain-Palin ticket out of spite? Ah, memory!) Whatever that was really about – and my former Salon colleague Rebecca Traister has explored it in depth – it had very little to do with those two candidates, except in their roles as symbols or signifiers.
All that fevered discussion about who rigged the Nevada caucus and who made the most obnoxious comments on TV feels like a lifetime ago, the product of an innocent age when politics seemed charged with possibility and hope. But the thing is, it wasn't all that long ago and we weren't innocent. We should have known better and basically did. It's just that presidential elections exert a seductive allure that keeps suckering us back into the tent, like a bunch of Ohio farm boys at a 19th-century carnival, hoping against hope that this time the magic will turn out to be real. It's a lot easier to write snarky, dispassionate analysis now than it will be in a year or so, when progressives are trying to gin up excitement for a nonexistent Elizabeth Warren campaign or we all have to have a hysterical meltdown about Ted Cruz's “surprising” poll numbers from a fondue dinner held in an Iowa cornfield.
There's no precise historical parallel, at least in the contemporary party-politics era, for the commanding position Hillary Clinton appears to hold roughly 16 months out from the first caucuses and primaries. It's not that there haven't been heavy favorites or heirs apparent in previous elections – that's a feature of the system. But it seems not just possible but probable that Clinton will face no serious or significant opposition within their own party, which as far as I can tell is a brand-new situation for a non-incumbent candidate. Warren is nowhere near foolish enough to torch their political future on a futile campaign of resistance. While Joe Biden will almost certainly run if Clinton doesn't, he's not enough of a masochist to take them on directly and endure yet another public humiliation. If Sanders runs (and he'd have to change their political registration, for one thing) he'll make the Dennis Kucinich campaigns of 2004 and 2008 look like devastating political whirlwinds.
If there's a historical precedent to Hillary-zilla it is to be found in the Republican Party, where big-money donors and a Washington-based establishment have long done their best to control the presidential nomination process and quell populist uprisings. Specifically, it's Ronald Reagan in 1980. Most Republicans assumed going into that campaign that Reagan – who had been waiting around as the conservative savior since nearly wresting the nomination from Gerald Ford in 1976 – would sweep to victory in the primaries and then drive cardigan-clad malaise-monger Jimmy Carter from the White House and restore America to its true greatness. They were ultimately correct about all that (except for the “true greatness”), but Reagan actually faced brief but spirited opposition from George H.W. Bush, who played the role of responsible centrist in that campaign and memorably denounced Reagan's “voodoo economics.” Bush emulated the Carter-McGovern strategy of slogging through all the meaningless straw polls and small-town dinners in the fall of 1979 while Reagan stayed home in California, and after winning the Iowa caucus Bush momentarily looked like the front-runner. Reagan ultimately swamped them in the South, of course, but Bush won six primaries and more than 3 million votes, essentially forcing themselves onto the ticket as the vice-presidential nominee. Who's going to put up that level of resistance to Hillary Clinton?

I guess the 1988 Republican campaign also looks similar, but only at first glance and only in the rear-view mirror: After two terms as Reagan's vice president, Bush coasted to the nomination just as everybody expected. (And then to victory over Michael Dukakis, one of the more bathetic also-rans of recent political history.) But those who remember that era in Republican politics can testify that the intra-party divisions were highly acrimonious. Sen. Bob Dole won the Iowa caucus and several Midwestern primaries, and deserves a special footnote in American history for decrying the lies and dirty tricks of Lee Atwater, Bush's infamous campaign strategist. Televangelist Pat Robertson terrified the world that year by packing a few caucuses with their followers (he got 82 percent of the vote in Hawaii!), thereby compelling all future Republican candidates to pay ritual obeisance to the Christian right.
There is certainly a cadre of disgruntled liberal Democrats who aren't thrilled about the incoming tsunami of the Clinton campaign, and in the age of social media they'll get to vent their spleen repeatedly in the months ahead by promising to draft Warren or vote Green or get so stoned that Rand Paul appears palatable. But it's not at all clear that they represent a significant voting bloc, or that any plausible candidate wants to be their standard-bearer. This tells us a number of things about the contemporary Democratic Party and about politics in general, none of them terribly encouraging.
Among the obvious notes here is the fact that electoral politics has increasingly become an oligarchic or dynastic enterprise, open only to the immensely wealthy and/or the immensely well connected. If we get a Clinton facing a Bush in the 2016 general election – which is not just plausible but reasonably likely – that would mean that 50 percent of the major-party presidential nominees over the last 28 years and eight electoral cycles have had one or the other of those surnames. If politics is a blood sport for the new aristocracy -- an American cognate to fox hunting, with you and me as the fox – that does more than symbolize our widening social inequality. It embodies it, and enacts it. You can't separate the fact that only rich people can run for president from the fact that both parties are fueled by rich people's money, or from the fact that beneath all their partisan bickering Democrats and Republicans have vigorously collaborated for more than 20 years on a set of deregulatory, low-tax and cheap-credit economic policies that have made rich people a whole lot richer. It's not like those are unrelated coincidences.
I'm not saying there are no differences between the two parties, or that given the binary choice with a gun to my head, I might not prefer Hillary Clinton as president to whomever the Republicans nominate. (This is a topic for another time, but Democrats clearly have the most to fear from Rand Paul, who represents a potentially significant reboot of the Republican brand.) Generally speaking, the Democratic Party stands for what might be termed the metropolitan caste in American life, a diverse group of people who live in or near major cities and tend to support a range of rights-based issues around race, gender, sexuality and related factors. You can't say the party represents that caste with much force or courage, and it does so more by following than by leading. Democrats took years to commit fully to a pro-choice position, were late to the party on marriage equality, and are still way behind their metropolitan base on marijuana. Nonetheless that's a big contrast to the Republicans, who at least for marketing purposes view the metropolitan caste as a bunch of socialistic tree-huggers who will take away your guns and your F-150 and compel you to drive a Prius to your gay marriage.

But what Hillary Clinton and Obama and most other prominent Democrats of the 21st century definitely don't represent is any form of progressive or class-based economic philosophy. Elizabeth Warren's election to the Senate caused such a stir because they appear to be a mild exception to this rule. As former Bill Clinton aide Bill Curry wrote recently in Salon, the deregulation of the telecommunications and financial services industries under their onetime boss in the '90s was a more far-reaching and corporate-friendly policy shift than anything in Ronald Reagan's wildest trickle-down dreams. That marked the moment, Curry says, when “issues of economic and political power [grew] invisible to Democrats.” When Ralph Nader ran for president in 2000 on precisely those issues, they were viewed as a traitor who cost Al Gore the White House. But if the Democrats had nominated a pro-lifer and Gloria Steinem had run as an independent, it might well have split the party in half.
All of which brings me back to the final point of similarity between Hillary Clinton and Reagan, the man who dominated one election cycle from end to end and the woman who hopes to repeat that feat. They could hardly be more different as political personalities and (one imagines) as human beings, and their electoral appeal is directed at totally divergent audiences. But both function in the political marketplace first and foremost as powerful symbols: Reagan was a symbol of American manhood and the mythical American past, while Clinton stands (I guess) for the upward progress of American women and a more egalitarian future. (It's not entirely accidental that both have provoked exaggerated hatred among their opponents.)
I write about the movies, and would be the last person on Earth to tell you that symbols don't matter. But they often do not mean what they seem to mean, and neither Clinton nor Reagan actually represents what they seem to represent. Reagan did little or nothing for the working-class white Americans who elected him, and if Clinton reaches the White House they will not be there to serve metropolitan women. Beneath the scrim of symbolic meanings, which are meant to reassure and distract and most importantly to win elections, the same force works through both of them: the force of money and those who wield it.
Friday, June 21st is the official first day of summer (mother nature may have missed the memo) and with summer comes the end of the school year and the beginning of family vacations to sunny destinations, the ceremonial opening of back yard pools and public beaches. Hooray! My kids love playing in the water, any water from bathtub to ocean counts and they are all in. I usually keep my posts light but this one tackles the more serious topic of water safety. While its no one's a favourite topic, it's so very important for all of us.
While I knew that accidental drowning is the second leading cause of death in children 5 and under (behind car accidents), I did not know that roughly half of all children who drown do so within 25 yards of a parent or another adult. What?!?! Why? How is that possible? Well, have you ever seen someone drown? I certainly have not, and apparently neither have most of us. And that is exactly why. Dr. Francesco A. Pia explains that real life drowning looks absolutely nothing like the dramatized drowning we see on tv and in movies and even in public service announcements (but is that really all that surprising?). Real drowning involves far fewer dramatics. Unlike that picture right there, there is no purposeful arm-waving or terrified cries for help. Rather, real life drowning looks an awful lot like… well, not drowning.
Dr. Pia coined the phrase “Instinctive Drowning Response” and explains it as the way our bodies are programmed to act when we start to drown. We have no control over this behaviour and can't consciously override it. The instinctive drowning response is characterized by the following behaviours as outlined by Dr. Pia in the US Coast Guard's On Scene magazine:
Except in rare circumstances, drowning people are physiologically unable to call out for help. The respiratory system was designed for breathing. Speech is the secondary or overlaid function. Breathing must be fulfilled, before speech occurs. Drowning people's mouths alternately sink below and reappear above the surface of the water. The mouths of drowning people are not above the surface of the water long enough for them to exhale, inhale, and call out for help. When the drowning people's mouths are above the surface, they exhale and inhale quickly as their mouths start to sink below the surface of the water. Drowning people cannot wave for help. Nature instinctively forces them to extend their arms laterally and press down on the water's surface. Pressing down on the surface of the water, permits drowning people to leverage their bodies so they can lift their mouths out of the water to breathe. Throughout the Instinctive Drowning Response, drowning people cannot voluntarily control their arm movements. Physiologically, drowning people who are struggling on the surface of the water cannot stop drowning and perform voluntary movements such as waving for help, moving toward a rescuer, or reaching out for a piece of rescue equipment. From beginning to end of the Instinctive Drowning Response people's bodies remain upright in the water, with no evidence of a supporting kick. Unless rescued by a trained lifeguard, these drowning people can only struggle on the surface of the water from 20 to 60 seconds before submersion occurs.
Here is a video taken by Dr. Pia during a drowning rescue. It shows just how un-dramatic a real life drowning is (don't worry… its not gruesome and it is a rescue). During the video Dr. Pia explains that in a younger child the involuntary arm movements may be even less splashy and look more like the dog paddle.
Twenty to Sixty Seconds. That means that in the time it takes to refresh your drink, check the chicken on the grill, or send a text message a child could drown without so much as a peep to alert you to their struggle. Terrifying! Vigilance around water is the only proven way to prevent accidental drownings in young children. Swim lessons are a great idea for many reasons (my oldest absolutely loves their swimming classes and they're a great way to keep them in the water all year round) but according to the Canadian Paediatric Society and the Red Cross, swimming lessons (even those that claim to teach toddlers how to float to avoid drowning) are simply not reliable enough in children under 4 years old. (Source). Another great idea is an Infant and Child CPR Course. I don't know about you, but if I see my kid in trouble I want to feel confident taking control of the situation. You can sign up for an Infant and Child CPR course right here at Fab Baby Gear. Let's all have a safe and swimmy summer!!

You can't understand your data unless you control extraneous variance attributable to the way you select samples, the way you measure variable values, and any influences of the environment in which you are working. Using the concepts of reference, replication and randomization, you can control, minimize, or at least be able to assess the effects of extraneous variability in five ways:
Procedural Controls — used primarily to prevent measurement variability by reference.
— used primarily to prevent measurement variability by reference. Quality Samples and Measurements — used primarily to identify sources of measurement and environmental variability by reference.
— used primarily to identify sources of measurement and environmental variability by reference. Sampling Controls — used primarily to correct sampling variability by reference and randomization.
— used primarily to correct sampling variability by reference and randomization. Experimental Controls — used primarily to correct measurement and environmental variability by reference and randomization.
— used primarily to correct measurement and environmental variability by reference and randomization. Statistical Controls — used primarily to correct environmental variability by reference.
Procedural Controls
Procedural controls include the field, office, and laboratory procedures that specify how activities related to data generation should be carried out. Forms of procedural control include Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), chain-of-custody (CoC) procedures, survey scripts and instructions, checklists, calibration procedures, training courses and so on. Procedural controls are the main way to minimize extraneous variation before it occurs.
Quality Samples and Measurements
When a physical sample is collected, especially for laboratory analysis, there are a variety of samples that can be collected to verify that the analyses produce valid results. The aim of quality tests is to identify quality problems and sources of undesirable variability. Some quality samples and tests allow corrections to data points to correct bias. Quality samples used to assess variability in the collection and measurement of the experimental samples include:
Replicate samples — multiple samples collected of the same subject to assess variability. Replicate samples may be collected by splitting a large sample into two or more subsamples (called split samples). Alternatively, discrete samples may be collected sequentially (called co-located samples). Most replicates are co-located samples because they are less time-consuming to collect. Co-located samples of mixable media (e.g., fluids like water and air) will usually be very similar compared to co-located samples of non-mixable media (e.g., solids like soil). Duplicate is a generic term for a replicate sample that may be either a split sample or a co-located sample.

Trip blanks — distilled water placed in sample containers and sealed in the lab. Trip blanks are carried by the field sampling team and returned to the lab with the test samples. If any aspect of the sample handling and transport process might have compromised the quality of the samples within their containers, the effect should be detectable in the trip blank. It is very rare for trip blanks to contain contaminants.

If any aspect of the sample handling and transport process might have compromised the quality of the samples within their containers, the effect should be detectable in the trip blank. It is very rare for trip blanks to contain contaminants. Rinse blanks — distilled water that has been poured over reusable sampling equipment that has been decontaminated. Rinse blanks are sometimes called field blanks, rinsate blanks, equipment blanks, or decontamination blanks because they are a test of the cleanliness of the sampling equipment.

Atmosphere blanks are a test of whether any air pollutants or windblown particulates might have contaminated test samples during the process of collecting the samples.

Preservative blanks — preserved samples of distilled water. Preservative blanks are used to assess possible contamination of the acids, bases, and other reagents used to preserve test samples.
Analytical results from these samples are usually checked during data validation and exploratory data analysis. Except for replicates and blind samples (which are usually averaged), they are not included in datasets to be used for statistical analysis. Other QA/QC samples used to check laboratory procedures include:
Laboratory blanks — distilled water or purified solid prepared in the lab to assess contamination from reagents, glassware, and analytical hardware. These samples are sometimes called method blanks because they are a test of the laboratory method.

PE samples are usually used to certify laboratories for a particular type of analysis rather than check quality on a specific data collection task.
— samples containing known concentrations of specific compounds. PE samples are usually used to certify laboratories for a particular type of analysis rather than check quality on a specific data collection task. Calibration samples — samples containing known concentrations of an analyte similar in chemical behavior to the analytes of interest. These samples are used to calibrate instruments and assess method bias.
— samples containing known concentrations of an analyte similar in chemical behavior to the analytes of interest. These samples are used to calibrate instruments and assess method bias. Matrix spikes — samples of the media being analyzed that have been spiked with known concentrations of a representative analyte. These samples are used to check for interferences between the analytes being tested and the sample matrix. Matrix spike duplicates are routinely analyzed by laboratories to assess measurement variability.
Analytical results from these samples are usually checked during data scrubbing. They are not included in datasets to be used for statistical analysis. Most of these QA/QC samples are used only for chemistry laboratories. Quality samples for other types of laboratory analyses (e.g., geotechnical, radiological, biological) are usually limited to replicates.
These are commonly used quality samples but there are many others possible. You create the samples to fit the experimental situation. Don't feel limited to laboratory samples. You can use the same approach to create tests or other methods of variance assessment. If you understand the possible sources of variation in your data, you can create relevant quality tests for survey questions, industrial processes, or whatever your study will involve.
Sampling Control
Some types of samples have inherent properties that may introduce extraneous variability into data being generated. For instance, differences in sex, age, and social class, may introduce extraneous variability in sociological surveys. Environmentally related examples might include: soil type, geologic strata, species, location and depth, and season (or other time unit). Applying sampling controls involves grouping the data by the control factor and calculating statistical analyses for each homogeneous group. Stratified sampling designs are one form of sampling control.
Sampling controls can be used to prevent, identify, or correct all kinds of extraneous variation. As a consequence, they are used to some extent in most statistical studies.
Experimental Control
Statistical studies can be categorized into two types — observational and experimental. In an observational study, the phenomenon under investigation is a characteristic of the objects being sampled. The concentrations of arsenic in the soils of a waste management facility would be an example. Variability and bias in observational studies can be assessed through the use of control samples. Control samples (like quality samples) are groups of samples that don't have the condition being tested but are otherwise identical to the experimental group. Adding an offsite (or background) area to the study of the waste management facility would be an example of a control group.
In an experimental study, the phenomenon under investigation is assigned to the objects being sampled. Testing a pollution cleanup technique on several plots of contaminated soil would be an example of an experimental study. In such a study, the cleanup techniques would be randomly assigned to the plots in a manner that would help control some of the variation in the plots.
So, the difference between experimental and observational studies is that in an:
Experimental study, samples are randomly assigned to controlled conditions.
Observational study, samples are randomly selected from preexisting conditions.
Another way to control variability and bias is through the use of placebos. A placebo is usually thought of as a faux drug because of its association with statistical tests of pharmaceuticals, but it can be any item or action that gives the appearance of being a valid treatment. For example, give two patients blue pills, one of which has some active ingredient and the other does not. To test a new pesticide, spray two agricultural test plots, one of which contains the pesticide and the other contains just water. The key is that the subject or data generator can't tell the difference. In Season 5, episode 14 of the television series House, the nurse can tell which patients are being given the placebo during Dr. Foreman's drug trial because the real pharmaceutical has a strong odor. This would not be a good example of an effective placebo.
Placebos are a type of blinding. In any experiment, there are subjects or samples, experimenters, data collectors or generators, and data analysts. Sometimes, one individual will fill several roles, such as the experimenter who designs the experiment and then generates and analyzes the data. But whenever there are humans involved, there exists the possibility of intentional or unintentional bias. Blinding is simply the act of denying one or more of the study participants with information that might induce them to behave differently.
To test the effects of a pharmaceutical, for example, a single-blind study might involve not telling subjects whether they are receiving the active drug or a placebo. A double-blind study might involve not telling either the subjects or the data generators (the nurses who collect physical measurements on the subjects or the lab technicians who analyze blood samples) who received the drug and who received the placebo. A triple-blind study might involve not telling the subjects, the data generators, or the data analysts who received the drug and who received the placebo. It's ironic that the less informed the participants are, the better the statistics. Too bad government doesn't work that way.
Statistical Control
Special statistics and statistical procedures can be used to partition variability shared by measurements so that extraneous variability can be assessed. For example, partial correlations quantify the relationship between two variables while holding the effects of other variables constant. A covariate is a continuous variable that is incorporated into an analysis of variance design to eliminate extraneous variability so that tests of the grouping factors will be more sensitive. Statistical controls are typically used when variation cannot be controlled adequately through other means.

John McDonnell claimed a victory for Labour in opposition after George Osborne dropped their commitment to running a Budget surplus.
The Conservative Chancellor effectively dropped any commitment to their party's flagship policy in a speech to business leaders in Manchester today, saying the Government must “be realistic” about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade.
The target to remove the Budget deficit by 2020 was a pillar of the Conservatives' policy and its withdrawal represents a humiliation for Osborne. During their six years in Government the Tories have delivered aggressive cuts driven, in part, by Osborne's changing political strategy for deficit reduction.
The idea of a surplus at a time of low borrowing costs attracted widespread criticism from economists, including the IMF, for cutting public spending too much and reducing investment.
The shadow Chancellor welcomed the Conservatives u-turn, saying the change showed the policy was “not robust or flexible enough” for the economy's needs.
“It is only a shame they were not realistic sooner, as under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has been unequivocal in its opposition to failed Tory austerity,” they said,
“In fact, there were no credible economists that could be found to support the Chancellor's surplus target in the first place. And we are not dropping our Fiscal Credibility Rule as it's robust and flexible enough to provide to invest our economy needs.”
“The truth is as Labour consistently warned, George Osborne's recovery built on sand was underpinned by a fiscal rule that is not robust or flexible enough to equip our economy for any potential shocks it may face or to provide the investment that our economy so clearly needs.
“He should now lay out a programme of government investment and support for businesses, bringing forward shovel-ready projects particularly in those areas the hardest hit by long-term economic decline.”
McDonnell unveiled Labour's competing Fiscal Credibility Rule earlier this year, which would demand the Government balance the books in the current account every five-year period, but retains the ability to borrow for investment, which provides greater returns in the long-run. The rule would see debt decrease as a proportion of GDP over the course of a parliament.
After March's Budget Osborne was widely criticised for failing to meet two of their fiscal targets, with public debt as a proportion of GDP rising and failing to meet their own cap on welfare spending. Abandoning the Budget surplus mean the has failed on the third.
For all those "Arrested Development" fans, you know the song merely as G.O.B.'s signature music when he's doing their magic act.
But the song is actually "The Final Countdown," by one-hit wonder Europe. And it's hilarious (let's just say it didn't age well from the time it was first released in 1986).
We're leaving together,
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?
It's the final countdown
The final countdown
Oy.
But that makes it the perfect song with which to troll North Korea.

The subtitle should read: A Crash Course. This is an ambitious task for a blog, but you'll get the idea. Poetry can create legacies (Virgil's Aeneid) and manufacture national histories (Epic of Gilgamesh); it may, serve the less ambitious purpose of capturing a widow's teardrop or the laughter of school children. It may be a simple literary catharsis. It was first an oral tradition and second a written discipline. Although, in reality it resists that term- there are no rules.
To the beginning then, or somewhere near that time, starting with Homer's Iliad, a Greek epic dated circa 1250 BC: it spans over 12,000 lines rather long and exhaustive for a glance on the underground. That tells us one thing early epics were detailed and convoluted narratives. Such poetry wasn't really for private consumption, not something used to smooth over things with the wife. It went far beyond the individual as it was concerned with mythologizing a national history.
Fast forward to Classical Greece and Rome and we meet the more familiar theme of love. Classical poetry was song, read aloud to an audience and the poets in their genius would find inspiration from slavery and war to create powerful metaphors. Consider this passage from the romantic Roman poet Ovid, their passion sadly resulted in exile, but here they cleverly compare war with love:
Lovers all are soldiers, and Cupid has their campaigns:
I tell you, Atticus, lovers all are soldiers.
Youth is fit for war, and also fit for Venus.
Imagine an aged soldier, an elderly lover!
A general looks for spirit in their brave soldiery;
a pretty girl wants spirit in their companions.
Both stay up all night long, and each sleeps on the ground;
one guards their mistress's doorway, one their general's.
The soldier's lot requires far journeys; send their girl,
the zealous lover will follow them anywhere.
Ovid (43BCE- 17AD)
Love and War
Catullus- the more vengeful lover:
And now they no longer wants you: and you
weak man, be unwilling to chase what flees,
or live in misery: be strong-minded, stand firm.
Goodbye girl, now Catullus is firm,
they don't search for you, won't ask unwillingly.
But you'll grieve, when nobody asks.
Woe to you, wicked girl, what life's left for you?
Who'll submit to you now? Who'll see your beauty?
Who now will you love? Whose will they say you'll be?
Who will you kiss? Whose lips will you bite?
But you, Catullus, be resolved to be firm.
Catullus (70BCE)
Advice to Himself
Lovers' problems are timeless: obsession, envy and failure. Catullus was a proud man and thought rather well of himself: “Woe to you, wicked girl, what life's left for you?” We cannot leave the classical world without one last word: homosexuality. Remember that the Greeks were particularly candid about love. Love for boys and girls aged 14, men loving one another was manly, women with women, orgies with wine and grapes, cross marital relations (swinging) this was all celebrated rather openly. See Sappho for an introduction.
After classical civilization, poetry takes a naturally Christian turn. Much medieval poetry is religious penned by intellectual giants such as St Ambrose, St Thomas Aquinas and Dante. However, all was not lost for the secular lover, romance continued at court and there was plenty to write about.
It pleases me when they make me madder,
Makes me muse, or in gaping rent!
It's fine if they play the scorner
Laughs in my face, or at fingers' end,
For, after the bad, the good will sound,
And swiftly, should that be them pleasure.
If they want me not, I'd rather
I'd died the day my service commenced!
Ah, alas! So sweet they did murder
Me, when they gave them Love's assent,
And tied me with such knots around,
That I desire to see no other.
Cercamon (1137-1152)
Quant l'aura doussa s'amarzis
To finish lets go to the latest hits. Latest to me means last one hundred years so don't be disappointed but how could you with behemoths such as Robert Frost, W H Auden and T S Eliot. Frost and Auden are kinder than Eliot as they are not resistive to common language. In other words most people can read them on the underground without explanatory notes and Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage. I nominate Frost for our second entry. Have a look:
My Sorrow, when she's here with me,
Thinks these dark days of autumn rain
Are beautiful as days can be;
They love the bare, the withered tree;
They walked the sodden pasture lane.
Them pleasure will not let me stay.
They talk and I am fain to list:
She's glad the birds are gone away,
She's glad their simple worsted gray
Is silver now with clinging mist.
The desolate, deserted trees,
The faded earth, the heavy sky,
The beauties they so truly sees,
They think I have no eye for these,
And vexes me for reason why.
Not yesterday I learned to know
The love of bare November days
Before the coming of the snow,
But it were vain to tell them so,
And they are better for them praise.
Robert Frost
My November Guest
We can all take a piece from this poem. It is beautifully layered: the icing describes nature in the month of November detailing the flight of birds and withered trees. But the biscuit base, if you will forgive an awful metaphor, is about sorrow. Three strands of it to be precise: “Sorrow is a complex statement; it could mean a lost one, winter's chill or depression”. But Frost is describing a beauty in sorrow: “the beauties they so truly sees, they think I have no eye for these”. We haven't started with rhythm and structure, context and language. An obvious fact emerges: it is as infinite as language and without limitation.
A poet is, before anything else, a person who is passionately in love with language

I can't tell you the latest hits, they are yours to discover, but perhaps this has peeled back one branch to bring the giant pastures of literature into view.

Toyota will be the first automaker to invest in the American Center for Mobility.
The Japanese automaker's Toyota Motor North America and Toyota Research Institute subsidiaries are contributing $5 million to the self-driving vehicle research center being built in Ypsilanti Township.
Other automakers and suppliers are also expected to use and contribute to the facility, which is now expected to cost $110 million. Maddox called a previous $80 million cost figure a "rough initial estimate" before several amenities were added.
So far, John Maddox, president for the American Center for Mobility, said the center has secured $91 million in public and private funding.
The head of Toyota's research institute, which has an office in Ann Arbor, touted the center's benefits, saying the closed course facility provides a great place to safely test driverless vehicles.
“As we move forward with the development of autonomous cars, we must remember that not all test miles are created equal," Gill Pratt, CEO of Toyota Research Institute, said in a statement. "The road to creating a car as safe, or safer, than a human driver will require billions of test miles including simulation, real-world driving on public roads, and closed-course testing where we can expose our systems to extreme circumstances and conditions."

In a phone interview, John Maddox, president for the American Center for Mobility, said Toyota will be able to help the center prioritize what is built there and how programs targeting education, standards and testing are run.
"That's a huge incentive," Maddox said.
The release noted that "as an ACM contributor,
Toyota will become a member of a government-industry team which supports the American Center for Mobility's efforts, to create a large-scale test environment in Southeast Michigan for autonomous vehicles. Toyota will also get to book the facility for testing further in advance than others, which will be invaluable over the next few years, according to Maddox who noted that Mcity, a self-driving testing facility in Ann Arbor, has expanded its booking opportunities because of strong demand.
“We expect a similar, high usage rate at ACM. In fact, maybe even higher,” Maddox said.

The center, which is expected to open in December, is on a 335-acre site about 30 miles southwest of downtown Detroit that once housed the famed Willow Run bomber plant. It is expected to be a major player in the race to build and test driverless and connected vehicles and has been designated by the federal government as a self-driving proving ground and research hub.
The center's plans calls for a 2 1/2-mile high-speed highway test track; multilane intersections, alleys and traffic circles; a 700-foot curving tunnel; two triple-decker overpasses; a cybersecurity lab; an electrical substation large enough to power a city; and driverless shuttles. Maddox noted that the $110 million price tag will allow for the addition of a bypass for the tunnel and an urban area with two sections, one offering modern, smart-city features and another designed without them because autonomous vehicles would need to travel through both types of environments.
The race to develop safe driverless cars and regulations to govern them is intensifying with legislation approved by a U.S. House committee just last week giving the federal government the final say over self-driving vehicle performance.

Google's self-driving project, led by ex-Hyundai CEO and president John Krafcik, is expected to be graduating from Alphabet's moonshot shop “soon.” That's according to Krafcik, who spoke at the Nikkei Innovation Forum in Palo Alto in October.
While the timeline of the project's impending spinout isn't any clearer two months later, the self-driving project is evidently preparing to separate from the mothership by hiring several of its own executives to positions X, formerly known as Google X, already has.
The first was Kevin Vosen, who was hired to be the self-driving arm's chief legal officer. Now, Alphabet's self-driving shop is looking for a head of real estate — or someone to secure new space for the autonomous company when it “graduates” from X.
In other words, the project is moving away from having to depend on X for things like dealing with regulation and expansion.
More interesting than the position itself — which indicates Krafcik and their team are looking for a physical space to hold the new company — is the description of the company included in the posting. The listing says that it expects to grow “significantly” as it breaks away from X. And not just in terms of staff, but also its physical size.
“Our path forward includes significant growth in both team size and geographical footprint,” the job listing reads. “Now we [sic] searching for a Head of Real Estate and Workplace Services to help usher our project into this next chapter.”
While vague, it's one of the first times the self-driving project has given any official indication of its growth ambitions. A representative would not comment on how much it expects to grow.
The project emphasizes talent acquisition and retention in the post — an issue that has become increasingly important as more players attempt to build or produce self-driving cars.
One of the responsibilities of this high-level position would be to “use the workspace and amenities skillfully (e.g. food, fitness) to add to the ‘top line' of the business by attracting and retaining talent, while maintaining efficient spend on the ‘bottom line' operational expenditure and operational expenditure costs.”
Already the self-driving project has a physical presence in Mountain View, Calif.; Austin, Texas; Kirkland, Wash.; and Phoenix, Ariz. It recently hit the two million mile mark of miles driven.
Update: This headline was updated to include Alphabet's X. Originally it read Google's self-driving car team is hiring executives as it prepares to spin out from Alphabet.
Defence pact sparks anti-US protest in Philippines
Updated
Riot police in the Philippines have used water cannon to disperse hundreds of demonstrators who protested against their country's signing of a US defence agreement.
The US President, Barack Obama, ended their visit to Manila on Tuesday with a reiteration for greater US cooperation with its allies in the Asia-Pacific region.
Washington and Manila signed the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement shortly before Mr Obama's arrival in the Philippines on Monday.
The deal, which will have an initial 10-year term, sets the framework for increased rotation of US troops, ships and warplanes through the Philippines.
Activists say the defence agreement reverses democratic gains achieved when huge American military bases were shut down in the early 1990s.
They tried to make their way to the US embassy in Manila on Tuesday, but were stopped by riot police. At one point, the protesters ripped and burned a giant US flag.
'Allies never stand alone'
Mr Obama said the accord and their visit demonstrated their country's commitment to a "rebalancing" of resources and diplomacy towards the fast-growing region.
They also pledged US commitment to defending the Philippines against external attacks.
"Our commitment to defend the Philippines is ironclad and the United States will keep that commitment because allies never stand alone."
Mr Obama's comments came amid tensions between the Philippines and China over remote uninhabited islands in the South China Sea.
They said that while Washington did not take a position on the sovereignty of disputed territories, such issues must be addressed peacefully, not with "intimidation or coercion".
Washington has "a constructive relationship with China" and has no desire to contain or counter Beijing, they added.
Mr Obama wrapped up their two-day trip by visiting the Manila American Cemetery, where they honoured fallen US soldiers of WWII.
Their visit to the Philippines was the final leg of an Asian tour that also took them to Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.

Share. We played the next great horror experience and (barely) lived to tell about it. We played the next great horror experience and (barely) lived to tell about it.
Outlast is a gorgeous, Amnesia-inspired first-person horror experience that takes the genre back to its roots. You play as the world's bravest/stupidest writer, who decides that maintaining their journalistic integrity entails sneaking in to an abandoned insane asylum and checking out what's what. There are no weapons to be found in Outlast, so you're forced to endure the darkness armed only with a night vision camera and the ability to run. And just in case you were wondering, said camera drains batteries like an electronic device with a vendetta, and you're going to have plenty of reasons to run.
Before my demo, the team at Red Barrels, which is comprised of ex-Ubisoft designers who worked on Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, told me about some of the crazy things they'd seen the brave attendees of PAX East do while playing their game. Some bolted out mid-demo, others stumbled out unhealthily pale, and one guy almost destroyed the entire booth in a fit of panic.
Exit Theatre Mode
Of course I figured that these were just PR tactics to drum up some atmosphere, like when schlocky horror movies in the ‘50s required you to sign a waiver beforehand just in case the giant rubber spider on screen scared you to death. In short, I was a nonbeliever. In reality, I was a complete idiot who had no idea what they were about to get themselves into.
I entered Red Barrels' dark booth, donned a pair of headphones, and journeyed forth. About five seconds after making my way into the dilapidated structure, I realized that I'd made a huge mistake.
IGN's own Mitch Dyer may have put it best when they told the team at Red Barrels that they absolutely appreciated their game, but that there was no way in hell they were ever going to play it again. Playing through the demo was easily my most uncomfortable experience of PAX, but it's also one that I can't stop thinking about. Outlast is filled with nearly every type of scare imaginable – shapes dash out the corner of your eye, lights conveniently shut off when you enter certain rooms, and bodies that seem dead suddenly burst to life. And the fact that all of this is rendered with such gorgeous visual fidelity makes the mere act of opening a door a Herculean task.
Exit Theatre Mode
While the first half of the demo had me crawling through the asylum in in fear of what was around the next corner, the second half turned into a terrifying blur once the creature was introduced. Looking like a cross between Killer Croc and the ghouls from Amnesia, the hulking monstrosity pursues you like the Nemesis is Resident Evil 3, crashing through doors and barreling through any debris that might stand in its way. I honestly feel bad for any kids who may have been in close proximity of Red Barrels' booth while I was demoing Outlast, because the only things coming out of my mouth were a wide array of four-letter words.
I finally evaded the ghoul by getting lost down a series of hallways, busting through the door of a random room, and hiding underneath a filthy bed. I shut off my camera and simply sat there in the darkness, the only sound coming from my character's own panting. Part of me whispered (OK, screamed) that this was as good a place as any to take off my headphones , turn around, and walk out of Red Barrels' godforsaken chamber of horrors. But for the benefit of you all and this preview, I went against my better judgment, mustered up the courage to turn my camera back on, and was instantly met with the lovely sight of my nightmarish pursuer staring right at me. Never before have I completely loved and loathed a team of designers so very, very much.

“Once there were fields of grass waving tall in the wind as far as the eye could see. The Spanish travelers came and described them – the finest pasture, an abundance of pasture, enough for all the flocks and herds. They brought their cattle and sheep, their horses and mules, and with them the weedy plants. They began a process of change and a devastation that was left to us as a legacy. The needle grasses and wild rye disappeared and we were left with foxtail and Medusa's head. The June grass, blue grass and poppies have gone. We have inherited the poverty grass, tarweed and thistle.” – Raymond F. Dasmann, The Destruction of California
The majestic and widespread grasslands that carpeted the California land- cape for centuries before the European invasion are gone. But the individual grasses are still here, and in recognition of their historical and environ- mental importance, the Cali- fornia legislature in 2004 declared that the most domi- nant native grass, purple needlegrass (Stipa pulchra, formerly known as Nassella pulchra), as the official state grass. (Remember that a photo can usually be enlarged just by clicking on it.)
Why Purple Needlegrass? Even tho most people have probably never heard of purple needlegrass, this grass was selected for many good reasons. For one, it was the most widespread perennial native grass found on the grasslands of California before the alien annual grasses were introduced from other countries. It is still the most common native bunchgrass in places where it has not been crowded out by the alien non-natives. The flowers have a slight purple cast when they are young, but from a distance a field of needlegrass can have a silvery sheen. Its roots may go down as far as 16 feet where it can find water to survive the dry California summers. Its large, fibrous root system makes it useful for preventing soil erosion in sites with poor soil conditions and low fertility. It provided valuable forage for deer, elk and other wildlife. So it is an excellent representative of California's heritage.
An acre of purple needlegrass may yield 200 or more pounds of seed. This prolificacy made it an important food source for the Native Americans, who would store the dry seeds for months, then toast them or grind them up to make a pinole. If the dry grass was burned in the fall, it tended to produce an even more abundant seed crop the following year. And it is the grass preferred by the California Indian Basketweavers Association for teaching children the art of basket weaving.
And … It Even Plants Itself! The needlegrass seed is attached to a very long stiff hair or bristle (awn) which develops two bends when the seed and awn dries out. Changes in the moisture of the air between night and day cause the awn to alternately twist and unwind until it manages to strike the soil. Over several days, this causes the seed attached to the awn to push downward into the soil. Stiff hairs on the seed are pointed backward and prevent the seed from backing out. This also protects it from birds and mice as well as from any wildfire that might sweep over the grassland. So the seed doesn't just fall to the ground and take its chances – it actually plants itself! (Unfortunately, it also plants itself in your clothing as you walk thru it, and in your dog's fur where it can work its way into the animal's skin.)
Smith School Visits the Granada Native Garden Jo Lucas's 5th grade science class from Smith School, in Livermore, spent the morning at the Garden recently. This was a good time, because so many flowers are in bloom and the weather was so agreeable. They toured all four plant communities of the Garden, learned about flower parts and flower reproduction, and explored the sticky wonders of our gumplant (Grindelia sp.). Finally, the three mosaic tables at the Garden provided a good place to enjoy their lunch.
Quote du Jour “(Steve and Laurene Jobs) had planted wild grasses native to Northern California around the perimeter of the property. Some neighbors grumbled at first, but most came to appreciate the way the color and character of the vegetation would change with the seasons. In spring the plantings would explode with wildflowers, and in summer the untrimmed clumps of grass would shimmer in the wind.” – Brent Schlender & Rick Tetzell, in Becoming Steve Jobs, p. 148

According to a survey by tech giant Cisco Systems, about a fourth of professionals ages 18 to 50 would leap at the chance to get a surgical brain implant that allowed them to instantly link their thoughts to the Internet.
The study was conducted on 3,700 adults working in white-collar jobs in 15 countries.
“Assuming a company invented a brain implant that made the World Wide Web instantly accessible to their thoughts, roughly one-quarter would move forward with the operation,” the study found.
Generation Y professionals, those born in the 1980s through 2000, were only slightly more apt to say they would get the surgery, at 26 percent, versus 21 percent of Gen Xers or those born from the early 1960s through the early 1980s.
The study posed dozens of technology-related questions to professionals in 15 countries including the U.S., Japan, China, Russia and France.
“I really think it's the cool factor. When they see something that's cutting-edge, they really don't stop to think about the implications,” said Liz McIntyre, a privacy expert and co-author of the book, “Spychips: How Major Corporations and Government Plan to Track Your Every Purchase and Watch Your Every Move.”
“Especially people who work in technology but also just average people, I think they look at the cool factor and they don't stop to look at the implications for themselves like their privacy and civil liberties, never mind the bigger picture for all society,” McIntyre said. “It's part of this whole wave now where the (tech) industry feels like they have an in, and they're going to push it right through on the cool factor.”
They said many people have become “brainwashed by the industry” to the point where they think they can't live without being connected to the Internet.
“Look at all the people carrying smartphones; those are tracking devices,” McIntyre said. “What's the next step? We already have singularity. Having sensors implanted in people everywhere will be the next step.”
All commercial products have sensors, and some day all people could be implanted with brain chips, allowing the people to interact with the products and with each other in a whole new way. To many, that sounds like a brave new world that's both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time.
“So you will have a God-like feeling of how people are thinking and feeling at all times. It will get to a point where you won't have a choice. People will become more like machines,” McIntyre said. “There will be a central intelligence, and they will all act on it. You're part of it. You talk about mind control? Everything will be known. Everything will be part of this collective, and if you don't participate you won't have a place in this civil society.
“I think it is very Orwellian.”
McIntyre said the tech industry is likely very close to being able to produce a brain implant, but industry insiders know they still have much work to do in terms of public acceptance for their radical ideas. That could be one of the reasons why Cisco conducted its study – to get a feel for how close the market is to accepting such a product.
“They're not far, because we already have devices that can be implanted in the body,” McIntyre said. “I think the main barrier to that (brain implant) is public acceptance, and I question the study by Cisco because they have a vested interest. The more people they can portray as being accepting of this, the better it is for them.”
McIntyre, who speaks on technology and privacy issues around the world, said the people with whom they come in contact are not so eager to be chipped with an RFID, let alone a brain implant that would connect their thoughts with cyberspace.
“You know, when I talk to real people every day, they don't want implants,” they said. “Even tech people, privately they're a little bit scared. I have people come up to me wherever I go saying, ‘You know I would have said something, but I work for this company or that company,' and they have real concerns but are prevented by their job constraints from saying anything. It's really not normal (to be so accepting).”
Katherine Albrecht, co-author of “Spychips” and founder/director of Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering, said they also have doubts about the credibility of Cisco's study.
In 2005 they interviewed hundreds of people for their doctoral dissertation at Harvard University and asked them if they would be willing to take an RFID implant.
“Everybody I asked, they all said, ‘No way,' and some said, ‘Over my dead body.' Some said things like, ‘You'd have to get me over the barrel of my shotgun first.'”
But the number of people open to such an extreme fusion of technology with the human body could very well be growing.
Albrecht said many younger people have been brought up to think all technology is “cool,” and they've also become less sensitive to what they call “body modifications.”
“We've got piercings. We've got tattoos. We've got implants, people putting silicon in their bodies, implanting weird things,” they said. “In Japan, there is a trend for putting a doughnut shape in your forehead, so the younger generation has been desensitized to this body modification.”
But they still doubt that 26 percent of Gen Y'ers are ready for brain implants, as the Cisco survey suggests.
“I would be very skeptical of the research methodology that was used because in my experience it certainly wasn't one in four (for RFID chips),” they said “I surveyed several hundred and almost unanimously they were against it, so either this study is flawed or something drastic has changed in just the last nine years. If you think the Internet is invading your privacy just wait till we have implants.”
McIntyre said Cisco and other technology companies will continue to fight the public relations war with the goal of warming people up to the idea of brain implants. But RFID chips will likely come first. They're already used widely for pets.
“I think right now it's a public relations game trying to promote this technology and trying to convince us all so we readily line up,” they said. “That said, those of us who are thinking about this need to stand up and make our voices heard, because if we're not heard with a different viewpoint, then people will think almost everyone in society thinks this is normal so I must accept it, too.”
The study also found that more than 40 percent of respondents would allow their carrier/provider to have access to all their data in exchange for a free smartphone with unlimited data plan. More than seven in 10 Japanese professionals said they would sacrifice having sex for a month if that's what it would take for them to keep their smartphones.
McIntyre said Americans, generally, are more trusting of technology and technology companies than Europeans.
“And you can see that reflected in the privacy laws,” they said. “Europe's privacy protection laws are much stronger. America is much more interested in making a profit. Not that that's bad, but because of that and the competition and the way our society is set up, we tend to go with the way society is set up and how we're going to make money. Whereas, if you look at those other countries, many of them know what it's like to live under repressive regimes in Eastern Europe. They had a gulag. Their neighbors disappeared.”
Among the other findings of Cisco's survey were:
When it comes to self-driven cars, the majority of Gen X and Gen Y professionals do not expect them to be available by the year 2020. About three in 10, though, do believe they will be available, allowing for an easier commute leaving them free to get work done.
Roughly eight in 10 Gen X and Gen Y professionals believe middle-income workers will have robots that can assist them with various activities – although most do not expect such robots to be available by the year 2020.
About one-quarter of Gen X and Gen Y professionals would be willing to move to Mars or another planet if their organization were to open a branch there.
Charlotte Iserbyt, former education adviser to President Ronald Reagan and author of the book, “The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America,” took up the Cisco study this week in their blog, “ABCs of Dumb Down.”
When one-fourth of a couple of generations is willing to line up for brain implants, the implications are chilling, they wrote.
“The article describes an addiction of proportions in which substance addiction pales by comparison,” Iserbyt wrote. “Imagine what the statistics may be with current young generations whose lives are shaped by addiction to technology from infancy through formative years of schooling dominated by ever more intrusive cyber ‘learning.'
“Prediction being fulfilled and even going beyond the book, ‘1984' (but 30 years later) with willing humanity so controlled that people volunteer to subject themselves to physical implants to ensure connection to their slave masters?”
Bomb robot pulls object out of a black backpack at Hollywood Transit Center (KATU photo). Inset: Police arrested 59-year-old Wilfredo Reyes on suspicion of leaving the suspicious backpack on the MAX train. (Photo: Multnomah County Sheriff's Office via the Portland Police Bureau)
Police arrested a 59-year-old man who they say left a backpack that looked like a suspicious device on a Green line MAX train Friday.
The suspicious object forced police to shut down the MAX platform at the Hollywood Transit Center.
The Portland police explosive unit evacuated the area and later found the device was not explosive.
Police say Wilfredo Reyes left the backpack on the train and then called 911 around 12:20 p.m. to report the backpack as suspicious.
Around 2:30, a KATU photographer captured video of a bomb robot pulling an object out of a black backpack.
Portland police say the item was not a device, and that it seems someone left it on the MAX so that people would think it was an explosive.
"It had items that were protruding from it that you would associate with something that is of a suspicious nature," said Sgt. Chris Burley with the Portland Police Bureau.
Interstate 84 westbound was closed for more than an hour at I-205 to I-5. Halsey Street was also closed both ways near the Transit Center.
Halsey and the Interstate have since been reopened.
The MAX line reopened just before 4 p.m. after shuttle buses served stations between Northeast 7th Avenue Station and Gateway Transit Center for several hours.
Police said they gathered evidence at the scene that led them to Reyes. They found and arrested them near West Burnside and 5th Avenue shortly after they determined the suspicious object wasn't dangerous.
Just two weeks ago today, a deadly stabbing took place on a MAX train at the Hollywood Transit Center, killing two men and leaving a third seriously injured.
A robot and bomb-sniffing dogs were sent through a large memorial for the victims to investigate.
Reyes was taken to the Multnomah County Jail where they face charges of false report, second-degree disorderly conduct and interfering with public transportation of a hoax device.
Their arraignment is scheduled for Monday.
Following the deadly MAX stabbing, TriMet spokesperson Roberta Altstadt said TriMet has increased security on the MAX. They said that will continue.
Apple released iOS 10.3 earlier today and included in it were a host of new features. As usual, however, there are a number of under-the-hood changes as well. Tier3 found out that iOS 10.3 fixes a bug that in Safari allowed for scammers to trick install ransomware and force users into paying fees.
The report explains that the flaw allowed ransomware scammers to display popup windows in a sort of endless cycle. The user would end up on an attacker website that posed as a law enforcement site informing them that they had to pay a fine for some sort of illegal action. In most cases, this ransomware targeted users viewing pornography or attempting to illegally download music or other content.
Researchers from Lookout describe how hackers were able to capture users and trick them into paying the ransom fee. Essentially, the hackers would prevent users from accessing any function of Safari until the ransom fee had been paid.
The scammers abused the handling of pop-up dialogs in Mobile Safari in such a way that it would lock out a victim from using the browser. The attack would block use of the Safari browser on iOS until the victim pays the attacker money in the form of an iTunes Gift Card. During the lockout, the attackers displayed threatening messaging in an attempt to scare and coerce victims into paying.
The flaw was first discovered when a user was led to the website pay-police dot com and thereby lost control of Safari. The screenshot above shows how the user ended up on the site and the endless cycle of popups that they experienced.
Users could fix the issue by clearing their browsing history and cache, but with iOS 10.3 Upgrade, the flaw has been fixed entirely and thus users should no longer get trapped in the endless cycle of JavaScript popups.
The hackers abused the handling of pop-ups in Mobile Safari in such a way that a person would be “locked” out from using Safari unless they paid a fee — or knew they could simply clear Safari's cache.
Tired of waiting for the actual game to come out? Well, here you can create your own species and evolve it just like you would in Thrive! This game is different from the other roleplays in this subforum, because it's not actually a roleplay. Here are the rules:Everyone starts with a single-celled Eukaryote described at the bottom of this post. You get to choose one mutation per turn. If your mutation is close to impossible, like asking for wings when you are still a single-celled organism, I will not incorporate it. I will then roll a die to see whose mutation worked and whose failed miserably. The dice rolls are as follow:2 - The mutation will have a slightly deleterious effect on the creature3 - No effect4 - The mutation partially succeeds5 - You get exactly what you asked for6,7 - You get an even better mutation that the one you asked forEvery organism will have an endangerment ranking assigned as follows:Extinct (EX) – No remaining individuals, sucks to be youVery Critically endangered (CR-) – Should be extinct, but I had mercy on youCritically endangered (CR) – Almost dead, will probably die next turn unless you change somethingEndangered (EN) – You will probably live unless there is a bad event or someone evolves to specifically target youVulnerable (VU) – Fairly safe, but might die in futureNear threatened (NT) – Not as good as the least concern, but you shouldn't worry muchLeast concern (LC) – Don't worry at all, unless there is a meteorite, or volcano, or earthquake... then you might dieReproductive systems allow for a larger diversity in a population and this leads to better adaptations, so I have decided to incorporate them in this game. There are two types you can have—horizontal gene transfer and vertical.For vertical gene transfer,You will then be able to do a second vote with NO modifiers applied to it and the following point breakdown:1 Opposite of what was intended2 Slightly worse than what was intended3 No effect4 No effect5 As intended6 Better than intendedFor horizontal gene transfer,You can choose an existing adaptation of another player and add it to yourself with the following rolls:1 No effect2 No effect3 No effect4 Success5 Success6 SuccessYou are not required to make a sex vote, but in a dire situation… Will you risk the odds?Also, you can have only one type of reproductive systems at the same time, and it takes one successful vote to switch between them.Every species will be labeled according to the trophic level it occupies. Primary producers are plants (and the hypothetical algae that you should assume is always there). They are eaten by primary consumers, which are herbivores (or zooplankton). They, in turn, are eaten by secondary consumers, which are carnivores. The one tertiary consumer eats both secondary and primary consumers and is the apex predator. Check which species you are, who your prey and predators are. An increase in the population size of your predator will lead to a decrease in your own population size. If you have toxins or some other defense mechanism that your predator has not evolved to circumvent, you have no predators and are limited only by your ability to catch food. If you want to switch trophic levels you need to vote for it. If two creatures occupy the same trophic level, they will compete until someone goes extinct.You are able to invest die rolls into toxins. So if I vote for toxin A and get a 4 on my role, I will have 4 points for that toxin. If I decide to improve toxin A and get a 5 on my role, I will have 9 points invested in Toxin A. If, afterwards, I decide to develop another toxin and get 4, I will have a 9 for toxin A and a 4 for toxin B. When another species decides to get a resistance, it has to have more than or equal to the amount of points invested into the resistance than the other organism has in developing a toxin, so to combat my toxin someone needs to vote for resistance twice and have a 9 or above, but they would still be affected by toxin B. Hope this makes sense. I think this creates a nice, realistic evolutionary arms race situation.If you need an example of a similar game in action, check one out I hosted a while ago: Here After millions of years, the planet has finally reached a state of equilibrium. The climate changes have become less severe, and although it still goes well below zero in the winter and far above 50 degrees Celsius in the summer, life is slowly but surely taking a grasp. Eruptions and earthquakes are still fairly common and cause death to thousands of species every few months. However, this has only increased the pace of evolution, as organisms less fit to survive are completely wiped from the face of the planet.The first and only species isthough this is surely only temporary.Protobactum Thrivum is a simple Eukaryotic bacteria cell, consisting of only a nucleus and a membrane. It lives at the very bottom of the sea, feeding of the compounds that were created when the planet first formed. It makes energy by metabolizing glucose in its cytoplasm, a fairly inefficient process. Without chloroplasts or any DNA coding for chemosynthesis this organism is very dependent on its constantly changing environment and is thus given the title of Endangered. It cannot move and can only hope that its food (random proteins and sugars) will be carried close enough by the currents to be engulfed.Doesn't form colonies and cannot be seen without a microscope.Bottom of seaENHere are all of the rounds so far:These are links only to the round.

A Keepa reader who is a Young Woman leader in their ward shared with me this letter they have sent to youth leaders in their ward. They have given permission to share it with you.
-oooOooo-
Dear youth leaders and teachers,
Here is a thought I would have shared at the last teacher meeting if we'd been in town. I do hope that none of what I say offends anyone since it is a sensitive topic.
As I look over the youth lessons for August and think about the needs of our Young Women, I am sad to think that in a good faith effort to save the young men and women of the church from the consequences of sin, teachers all over the church may be preparing object lessons that deny the power of the atonement and wound some of the most vulnerable members of our congregations.
August's lesson called “Why is chastity important?” encourages participants to “think of and share other analogies that teach the importance of chastity.” It does not take much imagination to foresee that teachers may be preparing object lessons involving licked cupcakes and chewed gum to teach the principle of chastity or sexual purity.
Young women may be more likely to get these lessons than the young men. I heard them as a youth, and within the past year in our ward, a fifth-Sunday teacher training lesson explained how to use one of these object lessons, resulting in a sister in the ward, a convert, leaving the lesson in visible distress.
Here are why these lessons can be problematic.
1) They teach victims of rape and sexual abuse — male or female — that they are damaged beyond repair. You can see comments about this from kidnapping survivor Elizabeth Smart.
As one church member wrote, the chastity in which the Lord delights (see Jacob 2) is not merely virginity, and cannot be taken away by another person, especially not by violence or abuse.
As you prepare to teach the lessons, do note that the Church is now careful to distinguish between virtue (behavior showing high moral standards) and chastity (sexual purity). As another church member commented, virtue is more broad and encompassing than sexual purity alone. Virtue includes chastity but virtue does not equal chastity, and more importantly virtue does not equal virginity. Married men and women can be chaste and virtuous.
2) These object lessons equate women with food, comparing them to something to be consumed. That's rather creepy.
3) For those that have made mistakes in their lives, either minor or major, and that's all of us, these object lessons teach us that we are beyond the power of the atonement. See Isaiah 1:18 and many other scriptures for what the Lord has to say about that.
Our young men and women are growing up in a complicated culture and need to be armed with the power of the truth and an understanding of the beautiful and healing message of the gospel, and not be burdened with damaging cultural messages. There are many better ways to teach the proper role of human sexuality and the power of the atonement than through vague euphemism and flawed object lessons.
I do appreciate all the work all of you do on behalf of my children and the other children of the ward…
Many thanks!

WETASKIWIN, Alta. - Volunteers with an animal sanctuary south of Edmonton are celebrating the safe return of a blind goat named Daisy who they believed had been abducted from their property earlier this week.
The Farm Animal Rescue and Rehoming Movement near Wetaskiwin had offered a $10,000 no-questions-asked reward for the return of the animal.
On Wednesday night, they posted the news on their Facebook page saying they had been found and is "unharmed as best we can tell."
The group's founder, Melissa Foley, said Daisy had been quickly reunited with their best buddy, a blind sheep named Merlin who had been distressed since the seven-month-old goat vanished.
Daisy ended up at the sanctuary after their eyes and tongue were eaten by crows shortly after they were born.
They vanished Sunday night from the rescue group's property about 10 minutes outside of town and since then members of the group had been searching the rural area, knocking on doors, and pleading online for help finding them
"We were in touch with an animal communicator - somebody who was saying they could talk with Daisy, or whatever - so we were following up on that," Foley explained Wednesday night.
"She said (Daisy) was a few kilometres down the road from us in a field. So while we were doing that our neighbour called us and said they found Daisy just 500 metres from where we actually were looking."
Foley has no idea what actually happened, but suspects "it was probably just a couple of punks thinking that it was just going to be a really funny thing to do, maybe not realizing at the time that they were taking an animal like Daisy with very special needs."
They believe their efforts at reaching out to students at the local schools, telling them about Daisy, had an impact.
Foley said Daisy seems just fine: "Whoever had them was taking care of her."
Less than an hour after Daisy's return, the group had received more than 500 messages of congratulations on their Facebook page. Foley said she's not surprised at the huge outpouring of support their group has received online and in person.
"Anytime we've ever needed our community for anything, they've been there."
Nestled in the Warp Disruption Field Generator tiericide post is a little gem. Focused heavy interdictor points will now scramble. They will turn off MJDs. They will turn off MWDs. That is the focused point. A common misconception on the forums is that the bubble will also scramble, that is not the case. You only get the scramble effect when you load the script and pick a single target.
It is a massive change with just that. A Tech II scrambler right now reaches 9 km. Overheated you get 12 km, and overheated under bonuses you get 15 km. A Tech II hictor point will reach out to 37.5 km. The closest you can get to that right now is an overheated Lachesis with skirmish bonuses and a 100 mil ISK faction scrambler with 35 km of range. Hictors will not require bonuses or overheating. In the Lachesis, it can receive remote repair while tackling a target. It is worth mentioning that the Lachesis can almost fill the role the hictor is getting. Anything that the hictor will do to ruin the meta or break the game can theoretically already be achieved.
Ship Quality
What the Lachesis cannot do is sport solid DPS and tank numbers. The Lachesis doesn't offer a selection of weapon systems or tanking choices. Hictors on the other hand, can fit rails, missiles, lasers, and projectiles at very nearly the DPS values of HACs, as well as coming with a 20 % resistance role bonus. You can easily fit a ship with over 100K EHP, 500 DPS, and a 37.5 km scrambler. And while they are not exactly fast, they can reach very respectable speeds for Tech II cruisers.
I am saying that I think these will be very good for some styles of play. In fleet where these do a little worse than HACs at damage, and cannot receive remote repairs with the field active they may not shine. In small gang and solo situations that call for well rounded capabilities and where kiting and being able to fight against kiting are terribly important abilities, they are going to be incredible. Hictors will both be able to grab anything that comes into regular warp disruptor range, and they will be able to hold enemy ships off, far from regular scramble range. For example, imagine a Vagabond versus a Broadsword. This Vagabond, scrambled maybe 30 km off the Broadsword, will wriggle like a land-bound fish. A scrambler will be useless for the Vagabond because it will never get close enough, and a warp disruptor will not do much good either. To add to the insult, the Broadsword may have twice the EHP of the Vagabond, and only slightly less DPS.
People have not been calling the Vagabond “cancer” in the small gang environment. That distinction has gone to the Orthrus. A more apt comparison may be the RLML Orthrus VS the RLML Onyx. To start, the Orthrus has 65K EHP and the Onxy has 125K. The post nerf Orthrus does 440 DPS and the Onyx does 420 with navy ammo. The Orthrus goes 2950 m/s and the Onxy goes 1750 m/s. The Onyx has a 39 km faction scrambler and the Orthrus has overheated a 70 km long faction point or a 26 km faction scrambler. The Orthrus has a short cap life while the Onyx runs a cap booster. And hilariously, the Onyx passive tank is 310 DPS tanked to the Orthrus 140. This comparison is not quite so clear-cut. A skilled Orthrus that started at an appropriate range could dodge an Onyx. The Onyx is very slow compared to the Orthrus. But they have the same weapon range, and the Onyx is going to beat the Orthrus in the DPS race at any range. If the Orthrus gets caught inside 40 km it is going to die. Fighting heavily outnumbered, the Orthrus will still do better with its ability to kite away very quickly, but the Onyx has a whole lot going for it, particularly when it is a member of the slightly larger fleet.
Meta Implications
Short range is going to take on a new meaning as these ships pick up in popularity. Scramble range and gate spawn range have traditionally defined short range as about 10-15 km. With this new scramble range, people are going to have to fit their ships with the idea that they may get stuck 35 km away from the guy they are trying to fight. Mid-range becomes short range. Short range becomes useless. You do not want to be the guy with blasters scrambled 30 km off the fight. Even autocannons barely qualify as useful, and only if they are on a hull with a falloff range bonus. I could even easily imagine two hictors having each other scrambled at 30 km apart and neither one would be able to close range or pull distance very quickly.
Keep in mind that nothing stops someone from filling their highslots with fields, as long as they can handle the capacitor requirements. In a fleet setting, one hictor can grab a bunch of victims.
Afterburners are going to be big next season. If you really want to end up 8 km away from your target, you may find that a lot of that ground is going to have to be covered while using an afterburner. Ships that get a bonus to afterburner performance are going to get a boost with more prevalent scrams. Tech 3 cruisers and the Sansha lineup will be pretty nice.
Value Judgement
This is a controversial addition with winners and losers. What we currently think of as mid range kiters are going to have a harder time of it. The meta is going to shift. And while I might make predictions, the reality is that we will not know exactly how things are going to shake out until we see them in practice. This is not an easy balance question like “Should we nerf the Ishtar?” This balance pass is not needed, although I suspect that it may be a part of the capital propulsion module question. Maybe CCP think we need a specialized ship for turning off capital MJDs? Maybe CCP plans to make capitals immune to the effects of regular scrams?
In general I am happy to see the meta shift every so often just to keep things interesting. A stagnant meta is a boring meta to me.
Next Chapter >
I'm an absolute idiot.
This will likely not come as a surprise to some of you, but it's something that I feel that I need to confess.
Earlier this year, after a monstrous trek across Ireland, Wales and England, I attended the annual – and typically brilliant – Players Classic show held at the Goodwood Circuit. It's one of my favourite shows of the year, as it brings so many factions of car culture together in one place. There's only one issue, and it's a good complaint: the show only takes place for one day, and as such it gets a bit hectic.
Over the course of the day, I had to prepare my own car for track (which didn't happen, I missed the noise testing bit), cover the event as a whole and shoot five or six spotlights. Generally, this isn't an issue and it's a typical enough day in the office. In fact, everything went pretty much better than planned, right up until I was waiting for the boat back to Ireland, some 12 hours after the show had ended. It only took one misguided finger tap on my iPhone to accidentally delete my notes and the last two digits of the owner's phone number.
Ricky, if you're reading this, I'm sorry.
Still, I don't think this Ford Escort should be confined to the ‘what could have been' folder, because of my incompetence (why there wasn't an ‘undo' option, I'll never know). This is a car that I would love to shoot in detail at some point in the future, so maybe we can consider this as an appetiser of sorts.
Typically, I'm used to seeing MkI Escorts in rally trim (when involved in motorsport), but the in the UK there appears to be a lot more track-focused builds. This is likely due to how much more accessible rallying is in Ireland versus the huge availability of race circuits in the UK. Either way, the Escort is suited to the task.
Walking around the car, it's clear that the build didn't happen by accident; it looks every part of a ground-up project. A stripped, clean and smooth body, inside and out, features the bare essentials for track duties. A naturally aspirated Cosworth YB on ITBs is at the centre of the setup, and although it's impossible to gauge power figures from just looking at it, one would expect somewhere between 250 and 300hp.
In a car that's going to comfortably be sub-tonne in weight (even sub 900kgs isn't exactly eyebrow raising in the MkI world), it's definitely not going to be lacking.
The interior reflects the minimal and focused approach required for optimum performance. The Escort wasn't 100 per cent track ready, thus the lack of harnesses, but I vaguely recall the owner telling me that they had brought the car both for the show and to have it noise tested. Vehicle noise is a huge part of preparing a car for track use in the UK.
This is definitely one of those cars that I'd like to revisit as I'm certain I'm not appreciating the full story behind it. As far as track Escorts go, this is arguably as good as they get, while staying loyal to its bloodline. It's simple, but that's all it needs to be.
In the meantime, I'm off to buy a pen and notebook to avoid this happening again.

CLOSE President Trump's former campaign chairperson, Paul Manafort, and a former business associate, Rick Gates, were indicted Monday in the first charges of the Russia probe. File video from the Republican Convention shows Manafort and Gates with Trump. (Oct. 30) AP

WASHINGTON – Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called “appalling” the muted response among GOP lawmakers to revelations that President Trump's former campaign aide sought to obtain damaging information about Hillary Clinton from people they believed had connections with the Russian government.
“That is serious stuff as it relates to collusion,” Perez told reporters at a breakfast in Washington hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.
Ex-Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to a charge that they lied to FBI agents about their contacts with a professor they believed was linked to the Kremlin during the campaign – one of the first prosecutions in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.

While Mueller did not allege collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, the filings show the professor offered Papadopoulos "dirt" on Trump's election opponent Hillary Clinton in the form of "thousands of emails" — months before the Democratic National Committee revealed that its computer servers had been hacked.
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the DNC's emails were hacked at the behest of the Russian government.
“We now have pretty clear evidence there was an undeniable attack on our democracy,” Perez said Tuesday. “The Russians were trying to traffic in the (Clinton campaign) emails” to get Trump elected, they said. “The rot went all the way to the top of the campaign."
Also on Monday, a grand jury indicted former campaign chairperson Paul Manafort and their associate Rick Gates on charges that they secretly worked on behalf of pro-Russian factions in Ukraine, then laundered millions of dollars in profits through foreign bank accounts. Both pleaded not guilty.
In the hours after the indictments and guilty plea were unsealed, Republicans began to slowly respond.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said they didn't want to speculate on something they hadn't read – and then said they had “nothing to add, other than nothing's going to derail what we're doing in Congress.” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said they believed the election results had nothing to do with Russian interference. "I think Russia meddles in everyone's election," they told CNBC.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also sidestepped questions. "Special Counsel has their job to do, and we're going to concentrate on what we're doing here," they told reporters.
Even so, some rank-and-file Republicans, like Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois did respond clearly to the latest revelations. "The American people deserve answers, transparency & the truth. Important to allow Mueller to do their job," they said in a tweet.
As I've said from day one, the American people deserve answers, transparency & the truth. Important to allow Mueller to do their job. — Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) October 30, 2017
Still, Perez said it's "troubling to me to see such appalling silence from so many Republican leaders. The silence isn't just deafening, it's appalling.”
In this, Perez said, Republicans are repeating the history of the Watergate scandal that ultimately brought down Richard Nixon's presidency – when it “took way too long for all to many Republicans to realize they need to put country over party."
Trump hasn't been quiet on the indictment news – but they have been dismissive of it. In an early morning tweet, Trump called Papadopoulos a "liar" and "low level volunteer" on the campaign, seeking to downplay any suggestion of collusion between their campaign and Russia.
“There have been some courageous Republicans” who have been speaking out, Perez noted. “I hope there are more who do so.”
Perez also responded to news reports that Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC helped fund a dossier produced by a former British spy that makes controversial claims about Trump's ties to the Kremlin, including salacious anecdotes about their activities in Moscow. The firm that performed the research, Fusion GPS, was paid by a law firm working for Democrats.
“Opposition research is not simply something that ought to be done. It would be malpractice not to do it, especially when you have a presidential candidate who blew convention out a window,” said Perez.

Inconsistent Policy Evaluation: A Case Study for a Large Workfare Program
NBER Working Paper No. 21041
Issued in March 2015
NBER Program(s):Development Economics
Evaluations of workfare programs in poor rural economies have typically ignored two features that policymakers stress: involuntary unemployment and the expected welfare losses from work requirements. The paper generalizes past evaluation theory and methods to incorporate both features, and shows that doing so can switch the policy ranking in favor of welfare over workfare. A case study for India's massive National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme indicates lower impacts on poverty than suggested by past methods, despite a more “poor-poor” incidence. A basic-income guarantee would dominate net workfare earnings in terms of the impact on poverty for a given budgetary outlay.

Of the many brews that are sipped and savored in Drinking Buddies, not one is made by Anheuser-Busch – or any other nationally distributed beer. In fact, unless you're a student of Chicago's budding microbrewery scene, chances are you've never heard of most of the brands making cameo appearances in the film, which was shot in part at three-year-old Revolution Brewery in Chicago.
In what may go down in cinematic history as the Sideways of the Chicago craft beer scene, Joe Swanberg's smart, 90-minute romantic comedy starring Olivia Wilde immerses viewers in a local brewing culture just starting to ferment. “It's a celebration of the passion of the craft beer world,” says Swanberg. “We were there in the craft beer timeline at the moment when the industry is going through this really exciting thing, and Drinking Buddies can be a little snapshot of the Midwestern chapter of it.” (The film, which opened in limited release last weekend, will show in 12 cities starting this weekend.)
Known for their ultra-low-budget, largely improvised films known as “mumblecore,” Swanberg has paired their first use of big-name actors like Wilde with a story line that reflects one of the country's most notable, small-business success stories: how thousands of scrappy craft beer makers have cut into Big Beer's sales in recent years. The connection between indie films and the growing craft beer movement isn't lost on Sawnberg, who's a homebrewer himself. “I do suspect that the craft beer crowd is also a crowd that appreciates independent films. That cultivation of taste naturally carries over into the kinds of movies they watch,” they say.
With some $30 million in supermarket sales of craft beer over the past year, according to market research firm Information Resources, Chicagoland is now the sixth largest market nationwide for craft beer sales. While hardly a pioneer in the craft beer movement, the area now has about a dozen local breweries and brewbups that serve their own ales and lagers. “There is a strong, local community of craft guys that have really risen up” in the last three to four years, says Information Resources beverage analyst Dan Wandel.
Since Swanberg had a modest budget –- they declined TIME's request for specifics — they and their producers basically sweet-talked their way into an enviable stash of free beer and merchandise that helped give the film its local look and feel. Unlike the makers of Skyfall, who famously accepted $45 million last year in exchange for a few scenes of Daniel Craig swigging from a Heineken bottle (neither shaken nor stirred), Swanberg received no money for the screen time they gave not just to ales from Revolution, but also those from Chicago-based Half Acre, Three Floyds in northwest Indiana, and neighboring Michigan brewers Founders and Bell's.
Three Floyds One of the many beers shown in the film.
“It wasn't like a typical product placement where people were paying us to have their stuff displayed in the movie. It was all just these breweries being cool and sending us stuff to be helpful,” says the director. A high school friend, who works at Three Floyds, gave the actors a crash course in brewing and lent them a rare bottle of the brewery's top-rated Dark Lord Russian imperial stout to use as a prop. Other swag included everything from t-shirts and hoodies worn by the actors to signs hanging inside the bar where a few scenes were shot. Co-star Jake Johnson even wore one brewer's clothes in order to look more like one himself.
About the only beer-related item Swanberg actually paid for was the privilege of shooting inside the gleaming new brewery that Revolution built in early 2012. For a mere $4,000, Swanberg and their crew basically took over the brewery for three days. “It was a pain in the ass,” says Revolution Brewery owner Josh Deth. “It was an independent movie, but they still brought a crew of 30, 40 people and lunch trucks outside.”
Despite the hassle of having a film crew on the premises, the brewery owner okayed the shoot, they say, because “it wasn't just some art film. They got some star power. It was something significant.” What's more, since the filmmakers paid them -– instead of the other way around –- “it was the opposite of product placement,” they say. “I think the thing is like a commercial for Revolution.”
Well, almost. You'd have to pay close attention to catch the brief mention of the brewery – I missed it altogether until my second viewing. Nor will you get bogged down in dull discussions of beermaking. Craft beer sales now comprise 10% of the $99 billion U.S. beer market — up from 8.5% last year. Despite the industry's rapid growth, it doesn't make sense to create a feature film that only a hardcore beer geek can love.
“While I want the craft beer community to embrace the movie, I know that's a smallish community, and I want the movie to reach people who don't think about beer ever,” says Swanberg. Chances are, you'll be thinking about it a lot more after watching a film where everyone's always got a beer buzz going — thanks to all that free booze on set.

Defenders of the NFL players' "protests" during the playing of the National Anthem repeatedly cite the "constitutional rights" of the players, but this is nonsense and can be shown so with a simple thought experiment:
Imagine a white NBA player who announced they would sit during the playing of the National Anthem on the national holiday named for Martin Luther King Jr. (a day on which the NBA plays several nationally televised games each year) on the grounds that King was a plagiarist, a serial adulterer and a fellow traveler.
Would those defend the NFL players also back this player? Of course not, and nor would the NBA. The defense of the NFL players had NOTHING to do with the US Constitution, the freedom of speech or any such thing. These players are receiving approbation for one reason and one reason only: because our Cultural Marxist rulers approve of the CONTENT of their protests. No such "constitutional rights" are applicable to badthink.
THIS COPPER WIRE is worth a lot of money, which is why it is sometimes targeted by thieves.
But after another recent incident of live conductors being cut and electricity poles damaged in the hunt for the copper, ESB Networks has sent out a nationwide warning.
They are asking people to be vigilant of the fact the live lines are being targeted, as well as the dangers posed by the activity.
ESB Networks said they are aware of a number of incidences recently where copper conductor was removed and electricity poles damaged.
This dangerous activity affects the supply to customers in the affected areas while crews from ESB Networks assess the damage and carry out repair works.
We apologise to customers that may experience loss of supply due to these incidences; not only are the perpetrators of these crimes putting their lives at risk, they are also endangering the lives of members of the public with this activity. Added to that is the inconvenience caused to local residents while the repair works are carried out by ESB Network crews.
ESB Networks are actively working with the Gardaí to tackle the problem and are “vigorously pursuing every feasible means of protecting the electricity network”.
They said that the public have “an important part to play in helping put a stop to this type of theft”, and appealed for people to be vigilant.
In the midst of empty lots and abandoned buildings, turn-of-the-century factories dwarf a windowless structure nearby. The freshly painted brick building bears no signage—or, for that matter, any indication about what goes on within its walls.
Inside, owner John Domres is hard at work producing Buffalo, New York's next craft brew.
It's become a familiar scene for the Rust Belt city. Since 2011, five breweries have opened within the city limits, with another four in the surrounding suburbs, and more in the making. Brewers like Domres are turning to abandoned or underutilized factory buildings to operate their breweries. The structures are, after all, affordable and abundant, with the openness needed for a modern facility.
Domres, who has great pride in their hometown, named their operation Buffalo Brewing Company, and thinks of the endeavor as a way to pay homage to Buffalo's extensive brewing history. And it's true: from the early 1800s until the mid-1900s, nearly 35 breweries supplied beer to more than 2,100 saloons that operated within city limits.
It was said of Buffalo at the time that if you collected all of the beer brewed in the city during the course of a year and poured it over Niagara Falls, it would flow for over a minute and a half.
In the late-1910s, the United States boasted approximately 1,400 breweries, but with the enactment of The National Prohibition Act that saw the ban of alcoholic beverages in the country in the 1920s and early-1930s, many of these brew houses shuttered for good. By the 1970s, beer production in the city, and the country as a whole had all but dried up.
In 1974 only 69 breweries remained and Buffalo was not immune to the demise of the industry as local institutions failed to have the resources awarded to macrobreweries—large national and international breweries. At this time, only two breweries remained open—Iroquois Brewing Company and William Simon Pure Brewery—as the city's population started a steep decline.
“None of these local breweries tried to venture far our of the Buffalo area,” said Michael Rizzo, co-author of Buffalo Beer: The History of Brewing in the Nickel City, as they explained the downfall of the local brewing industry. “The larger corporate brewers were able to ship in beer at below cost making it detrimental for smaller brewers to stay open.”
Macrobreweries like Labatt Beer and Anheuser-Busch meant the city's two remaining breweries shuttered for good by 1971. The demand for artfully crafted brews morphed into a preference for affordable beers with a consistent taste.
The ‘90s and early 2000s saw a small wave of nanobreweries and microbreweries open in Western New York, as Ellicottville Brewing Company, Pearl Street Brewery, Flying Bison Brewing Company and Southern Tier Brewing Company realized the potential in catering to avid craft beer enthusiasts.
The eventual passage of 2014's Craft Beer Act, which alleviated a lot of red tape for aspiring brewers, helped the movement truly bloom. Under the law, breweries can sell pints of their beer on site in addition to growlers and merchandise, without having to obtain an On-Premise Liquor License.
The Craft Beer Act made it easier for places like Resurgence Brewing Company to operate by cutting costs and easing restrictions. When the brewery opened this past summer (in a former boat engine factory along a once-seedy thoroughfare that spans the Buffalo River, no less), it became the first beer garden in the area.
“One of the hardest things was finding a building,” Ware said. “Even though Buffalo has a lot of vacant buildings, it had to be the right building with the right setup. And we finally found it.”
Originally from Buffalo, Ware spent years working in New York City selling beer for Samuel Adams. They always felt drawn back to their hometown and saw the absence of a beer garden, like the one they used to frequent in Astoria, Queens, as a shining opportunity. They settled on the former Sterling Engine factory, which sat empty for nearly 30 years.
“I'd come back to Buffalo to visit and I could feel a change in attitude in the city,” Ware said. “Buffalo is really coming back with a hip vibe and people are really into it.”
In the 10 months Resurgence has been open, it has exceeded its growth goals.
“When people come back to visit Buffalo,” Ware says, “we'd like them to think, ‘You've gotta stop for chicken wings, and you've gotta stop for Resurgence.'”
Buffalo's other breweries have stories with similar themes: a love of Buffalo, an unexpected coolness, and new-found fervor for adaptive reuse.
Corey Catalano and their partners, Matt Kahn and Wes Froebel, came up with the concept behind Big Ditch Brewing Company, which occupies an old Verizon service center in the heart of Buffalo's downtown, four years ago. Then, there were only two breweries operating within the city limits.
“There was definitely a vacancy in the Buffalo market at the time,.” Catalano says. “Now there are plenty of breweries, but I don't see a cap for the future of brewing in the city. The more local choices you have the better it is for all of us.”
When Ethan Cox, co-author of Buffalo Beer and President of Community Beer Works, opened a brewery with their friends in 2012, they knew it had to be in Buffalo.
“It's our city. It's where we wanted to be.”
They predicted a warm reception from Buffalonians, but never imagined just how dedicated they would be. In fact, the term “Buffalove” gets mentioned throughout conversations about the craft beer movement.”
The city's brewing history is another recurring theme. It's nearly impossible to miss the remnants of Buffalo's brewing past; the architectural remnants still dominate the city. Corner pubs built in the late 1800s and early 1900s, bookend the majority of roads within the city limits.
Domres depends on this nostalgia to set Buffalo Brewing Company, which they plan to open in September, apart from the area's other breweries. He's eager to showcase their collection of city brewing memorabilia and to take part in Buffalo's annual Beer Week in the fall.
Domres, in the end, puts it simply: “You're finally feeling like Buffalo is on the uptick, and I think breweries are a huge part of that.”

The rediscovery of Gurney's Pitta 25 years ago today (June 14) brought hope for a beautiful bird feared extinct for over three decades. But the bird's future still hangs in the balance, as destruction of lowland forest has reduced the Thailand population by around 90% since 1986. Since the rediscovery in southern Thailand, further populations have been discovered in neighbouring Myanmar. The only bird endemic to the Thai peninsular, Gurney's Pitta Pitta gurneyi has been the focus of an international conservation effort, but these efforts are not matched by adequate protection of the bird's last Thai home. Maliwan Sopha, Director of BirdLife Partner Bird Conservation Society of Thailand (BCST), said: “The quarter-century reprieve for this bird has been squandered because successive Thai governments have allowed rubber and oil-palm plantations to expand at the expense of remaining forest. This has destroyed most Gurney's Pitta habitat, causing the population to crash from an estimated 50 pairs throughout southern Thailand to as few as five pairs today, at a single site.” While Thailand has an enviable record in establishing protected areas, these are all in hilly and mountainous areas. This is bad news for the large proportion of Thailand's wildlife confined to lowland forests. The Royal Forest Department responded to the rediscovery by setting up a wildlife sanctuary centred on the nearby mountain, Khao Nor Chuchi, but neglected to include an adequate area of lowland forest. 75% of the pittas were left unprotected, in Bang Khram National Reserve Forest. Since then, rubber and oil-palm growers have gradually eaten away the remaining forest. Many also hunt wildlife for food and the pet trade. Khao Nor Chuchi forest, an Important Bird Area, arguably supports the richest lowland forest bird life of any site in Thailand. The continuing decline in Gurney's Pitta has happened in spite of valiant conservation efforts by BCST in partnership with the Department of National Parks, the Royal Forest Department, the RSPB (BirdLife in the UK) and local community bodies, with the support of the UK's Darwin Initiative and the Oriental Bird Club. DNP officials have tracked the continued loss of pittas and their habitat, but have been powerless to intervene. “We find bird nets set both inside and outside the sanctuary”, said one anonymous official. “Hunting, collection of forest products and illegal logging are rampant. When we survey for Gurney's Pittas, the rubber and oil-palm growers monitor our movements. They then cut down the spiny palms in which the pitta nests, reasoning that if they kill off the pittas they will more easily be able to clear the remaining forest.” Despite the uphill struggle facing conservationists, there is still hope. Replanting and regeneration of forests has helped stem forest clearance, and some local villagers practice sustainable management of their plantations, with regenerated forest areas for wildlife. However, this could all be in vain if the Government doesn't seriously tackle the many land tenure issues in the area, by delineating the boundaries of the Wildlife Sanctuary and Reserve Forest, and strictly enforcing the laws relating to encroachment.
We here at Right Wing Watch regularly observe how strange conspiracy theories and absurd right-wing nightmares percolate through conservative message boards and fringe websites all the way up to Fox News and the Republican Party, until they eventually become “mainstream.”
In a new feature, we'll look at five of the week's most absurd conspiracy theories and maniacal claims.
5. Satan Behind Sexual Misconduct Allegations Against Herman Cain
Herman Cain has finally put all those allegations of extramarital affairs and sexual harassment from different women to rest, saying that all of them were lying and are working the Devil. Cain told Real Clear Religion that Satan was behind the charges of sexual misconduct, several of which were made long before they even ran for president, as part of a plot to bring down their campaign, which they suspended before the Iowa caucus. After explaining how they were the real victim, Cain said that they now preach about their experience in fighting the demonic spirits which supposedly manufactured the scandal.
4. Grover Norquist Is Palling Around With Terrorists
In an interview with Glenn Beck, Center for Security Policy head Frank Gaffney said that they saw terrorists meeting with Grover Noquist back when they shared an office in Washington, D.C. Rather than alert the authorities, apparently, Gaffney instead decided to wait over a decade to reveal Norquist's terrorists allies. Norquist notes that on the date of their supposed meeting with terrorists, they aren't even in Washington.
Gaffney's claims that Norquist is a terrorist fellow traveler are so farfetched that leaders of the American Conservative Union decided to kick Gaffney out of the annual right-wing summit CPAC, but that hasn't stopped them from winning over Beck and other anti-Muslim zealots such as Jerry Boykin, David Horowitz and Pamela Geller. Cathie Adams of Eagle Forum has found even more definitive evidence that Norquist is a secret Islamic agent: “he has a beard.”
3. Obama Will Nuke Charleston
After the right-wing conspiracy that President Obama was planning to set off a nuclear bomb in Washington, D.C. and blame it on Syria, we now have gotten word that Obama has shifted their menacing plan to Charleston, South Carolina. Survivalists have been fretting about a secret plan to nuke Charleston that went awry after generals refused and, as a result, were swiftly fired by Obama.
This conspiracy theory follows claims made by Alex Jones of InfoWars, who cited comments made by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about how Iran could give nuclear weapons to terrorists targeting US cities like Charleston, of an imminent false flag attack: “Graham is quite literally saying that if we do not launch a war with Syria, South Carolina may be nuked. And this ultimately reeks of yet another false flag being orchestrated by the United States government in order to send us into war, or at the very least a threat.”
2. Military, NFL Facing Feminization
Did you know that President Obama is personally selecting new hats for the Marines to make them look “feminine” and “French”? The New York Post story about Obama's wretched plan to make male Marines seem “girly” was quickly picked up by Fox News, the Washington Times, Newsmax, all the news sources you'd expect not to do basic research to see if Obama was actually involved in uniform cover design process.
Shockingly, they aren't.
But maybe that was all a plot to take away attention from the “chickification” of the NFL, which Rush Limbaugh bravely exposed. “You don't put the NFL in pink for a month!” Limbaugh said, referring to Breast Cancer Awareness Month, “I don't think there's any question, folks, that there is an attack on masculinity. And it's not new. Basically the modern era of feminism, that's what it is, is a critique against masculinity.”
1. Fainting Lady An Obama Plant
When a pregnant, diabetic woman nearly fainted during President Obama's press conference in the Rose Garden, “Lady-Patriots” was on the case to expose them as an Obama plant! Naturally, Sarah Palin, Matt Drudge, and Fox News were happy to join the usual suspects like WorldNetDaily and InfoWars. “Lady Patriot” Sharon Scheutz foiled Obama's false flag fainting to “take the focus off the disastrous website” and make people “feel warm and fuzzy for our hero President.”
“There are a lot of idiots out there,” they write.
Indeed there are.
Apple is widely expected to unveil its new smaller iPad next week, on October 17. The smaller tablet will have a 7.85-inch display with a lower resolution than the 9.7-inch model currently available.
The so-called iPad Mini will be a direct rival to Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle Fire, which are both seven-inch tablets and offer a smaller, less-expensive alternative to the existing iPad.
However, the new device is not thought to be capable of connecting to the internet via 3G or 4G and instead will rely on Wi-Fi. The Guardian, citing unnamed "industry sources", said that while the iPad Mini would be Wi-Fi-only, Apple will also release a new version of the existing iPad, which will be compatible with mobile provider EE's 4G network.
EE, formerly known as Everything Everywhere, will offer access to the new high speed mobile network from the end of October. Rival providers should be able to offer the ultra fast network in early summer 2013 after the auction of airspace used to run 4G services.
Launching the iPad Mini without 3G or 4G connectivity would keep costs down, which could allow Apple to price the tablet in line with its 7-inch rivals. The tablet is tipped to go on sale on November 2, but it is unclear whether this will be in the US only.

Drew Doughty can wear all the Blue Jays hats they want. Their team is still 13 games under .500 and near the bottom of the American League standings.
Dustin Brown on the other hand, he's repping their Dodger lids perfectly. Not only did they tweet out a pic earlier this summer showing a handful of new LA hats they had just purchased, but the Dodgers are now 3-0 when they throw out the fist pitch.
It was back in the summer of 2008 when number-23 first took the bump at Chavez Ravine. LA's Blue Crew went on to win the game that night, downing Milwakue's Brew Crew 5-3.
Two years later the Kings captain was invited back again. Prior to throwing out the first pitch for the second time, Brown and then-Dodgers catcher Russell Martin even goofed around in the dugout – as shown in the video below…
Before that night was over, the Dodgers had downed the Cubs 9-7. Brown was 2-0.
Then, last night, they returned for the trifecta. This time, two of their three boys (Jake and Mason, pictured below) were in tow for the festivities. They played catch on the field about an hour before game time and then eventually, all three headed to that little patch of dirt made famous by Valenzuela, Hershiser and Kershaw. Brown tossed a strike and the Dodgers out-slugged the Cardinals 8-5. A baseball hat trick for Dustin Brown and the Dodgers are now 3-0 when they kick off the game.
While Magic and Ned Colletti try to figure out how to get them back for a few more games this month, as their team is embattled in a tough playoff race, Brown's teammate Alec Martinez had some other words of advice on Twitter.
After being spotted arriving to their seat about 20 minutes late (true to the ‘Dodger fan' cliche), Martinez tweeted – “Good thing they hit harder than they throw #dontquityourdayjob #juuuustabitoutside”
We'll have a full interview with Brown up on MayorsManor later this morning. You won't want to miss this one. They dished on Drew Doughty, shares some thoughts on the Kings resigning Dustin Penner and reveals for the first time that they have offers on the table to play overseas during the upcoming NHL lockout. UPDATE: interview posted here
In the meantime, if you've never watched the video we shot the night the Kings brought the Stanley Cup to Dodger Stadium, click here. Matt Greene was, by far, the star of the show.

Swansea v Cardiff
Venue: Liberty Stadium Date: Saturday 8 February Kick-off: 17:30 GMT Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website
Swansea's decision to sack boss Michael Laudrup four days before facing rivals Cardiff has ensured this weekend's south Wales derby is shaping up to be an even bigger game than normal.
Under Brendan Rodgers and then Laudrup, Swansea have had two excellent seasons in the Premier League, capped by finishing ninth and winning the Capital One Cup last year. But since winning that trophy 12 months ago, Swansea have only won eight of 35 Premier League games, and lost 18.
That is relegation form.
The Dane leaves a side in 12th place, but only two points away from the bottom three. After their success last term, I never in a million years expected them to be in this type of trouble now.
So what went wrong for Laudrup?
Chairman's choice
Given where Swansea find themselves, it is not a massive shock. They have won one in 10, and football is very cut throat - it is a winning business.
My manager at Celtic Martin O'Neill said to me that even the best managers are only three or four games away from the sack. The fans get very disgruntled and start asking questions.
Laudrup's Premier League record Before cup final After cup final 27 Played 35 33% Win rate 23% 30% Loss rate 51% 1.4 Ave goals scored 1.1 1.3 Ave goals conceded 1.5
Replacements Garry Monk and Alan Curtis are Swansea through and through; they have got years of experience at the club between them and they will rally the troops.
The fans will be right behind them from day one and the derby is a perfect game in many ways. It will be a brilliant atmosphere.
Laudrup has brought great success to Swansea. Whichever club they join next will be inheriting a very good manager.
 They are part of Swansea's history and they can be proud of the job they have done.
One or two things this season have gone against them and the threat of relegation from the Premier League is so great now that clubs feel they have to act. We have seen it from Sunderland and Cardiff this season and chairperson Huw Jenkins will be hoping that it will keep their club up this season.
Jenkins is very shrewd and wise. The last three or four appointments they have made have been spot on - the next one from them will be exactly the same.
Missing Michu
Michu's goals and link-up play were invaluable for Swansea last year
The obvious change to Swansea's play this season has been the loss of forward Michu through injury.
The 27-year-old was immense in their first season last year, and by early February had already scored 15 times in the league, with Swansea collecting 34 points from their first 24 games.
Michu's final total of 18 Premier League goals last season was only bettered by Robin van Persie, Gareth Bale, Luis Suarez and Christian Benteke.
Analysis "The board have been unhappy for a while. Not only for the performances but the spirit some of the players have been showing. "As I understand it, Michael Laudrup was happy to carry on with Garry Monk on the coaching staff but the board have said 'no, we have to change, we have to change now'. "He signed a contract extension to take them through to next season, but we have always thought they would leave this summer. If you look at the way they left Mallorca, it's very similar - a good first season, the second not so good."
But the Spaniard has only scored twice in the league this term, as knee and ankle injuries have restricted them to just 12 Premier League appearances.
Record signing Wilfried Bony has come in and done well, but while they have scored 16 times this season, he's only managed seven in the league and Swansea are 10 points worse off than at this stage last season.
Bony was brought in to play ahead of Michu, and not having the Spaniard available has changed Swansea's style of play. Watching them in the last 10 or 15 games you have seen Bony isolated up front on their own, and it's not their game to drop off and link with the midfield, which was Michu's strength.
Michu was great last season at drifting around between the lines and they were so hard to pick up. With Bony on their own, there was a change of shape, and their play became a bit predictable.
Swansea still have lots of possession, but it's that cutting edge that they lack. They can be easy to play against.
Losing Ki
Another man who has been sorely missed by Swansea in recent months is South Korean midfielder Ki Sung-Yueng.
Laudrup decided to let them go on loan to Sunderland last summer as they brought in Jonjo Shelvey from Liverpool, but Ki has arguably been the Black Cats' best player under Gus Poyet and that decision now looks like an error.
Ki brings real energy to the midfield and they get the ball moving quickly. Shelvey is a goal threat - he's Swansea's second top scorer in the league - but they can also be careless in possession and Ki gives them a better shape.
They have come on leaps and bounds with another full season in the Premier League and maybe they can come back into the Swansea side next year.
Strange signings
Swansea ended January and start February with a run of four games against teams around them - Fulham, West Ham, Cardiff and Stoke.
They had the chance to strengthen the squad at the end of the transfer window and really push on.
Europa hangover? "Swansea have been outstanding in the Europa League. It's not a distraction, and you should never moan about playing in Europe. As a player, the Cup Winners' Cup final and Uefa Cup finals I played in are among the highlights of my career. I don't remember beating Motherwell or Derby in the league but you don't forget those big European nights. The bottom line is they have a big enough squad and they should relish it."
They may have beaten Fulham in the first of those games, but they made some strange signings before the defeat at Upton Park, which was as badly as I've seen them play in 18 months.
Look at Saturday's opponents, Cardiff. They signed Wilfried Zaha and Kenwyne Jones in the last week of January and both played a big part in their win against Norwich last weekend.
Zaha is a £10m winger, they have a point to prove and has aspirations of making the Manchester United and England squads, and the moment they came on they lifted the whole crowd.
A signing like that would have done Swansea the world of good and helped to replace Michu. Instead they signed Marvin Emnes from Middlesbrough and David Ngog from Bolton.
Emnes, to be fair, did well at Swansea a few years ago, and scored the winner in a derby game against Cardiff. But that was in the Championship and I doubt either player's arrival has excited the home fans.
They have scored five goals between them this season in the second tier.
Great expectations
In many ways Laudrup was a victim of their own success.
They leaf a Swansea side that are in mid-table and still in the FA Cup and Europa League. It was not a disastrous performance, and you have to remember that the club were in the fourth division and playing at Vetch Field 10 years ago.
But when you win a trophy and spend £12m on a striker - which would have been unthinkable just a few years ago - you raise expectations among the fans, the media and the boardroom.
Feeling the pressure?
Steven Caulker scored the only goal when Cardiff beat Swansea in November
You never want to lose a derby and a win for Cardiff would take them level on points with their rivals. As the away side, and with a derby win under their belts already this term, they have nothing to lose at the weekend and will thrive on the disarray at the Liberty Stadium.
Swansea did not turn up in the first game back in November, and Cardiff thoroughly deserved to win 1-0. They controlled the game.
Both sides have spent a lot of money in recent years, have players on very good wages and big contracts and relegation would be unthinkable at Swansea. Financially it would be crushing.
I said at the start of the season that Cardiff would go down and I stand by that, although they have given themselves a chance with the players they have signed.
It is possible of course that both sides will go down but I cannot see it - even if Tuesday's developments reveal the very real worry at Liberty Stadium.

A dog ran amok at Andrew Lloyd Webber's “Cats” this week.
Spies at the Neil Simon Theatre tell us an audience member's service dog “got away from its owner and ran after [the character] Bombalurina, performed by actor Mackenzie Warren, during the opening number.”
Luckily, a fast-moving usher “intervened and returned the wayward canine to its mortified owner.” A spokesperson for the megamusical confirmed the incident, adding, “In the storied history of ‘Cats,' this is the first time one of the actual cats was involved in an incident with a dog. We're pleased to report that no animals or humans were harmed in the dust-up, and the performance continued without a hitch.”
Meanwhile, Webber, composer of “Cats” and “The Phantom of the Opera,” is publishing their autobiography, “Unmasked,” on March 6 before their 70th birthday later the same month.
A group of superbly preserved dinosaur fossils discovered in Montana are giving scientists a fuller understanding of the history, evolution, and appearance of the giant theropods known as tyrannosaurs.
Right down to what their faces looked like.
In case you thought otherwise, it turns out the dinosaurs didn't have lips.
The newly discovered fossils include the skeletons of an adult and subadult tyrannosaur, along with the lower jaw and other scattered remains of juvenile dinos that together comprise a new species.
It's been named Daspletosaurus horneri, or “Horner's frightful lizard,” after famed paleontologist Jack Horner.
The fossils were uncovered in the Two Medicine Formation of northwestern Montana, a region well-known for producing fossils of duck-billed dinos such as Maiasaura, as well as the first dinosaur eggs discovered in North America.
(Learn about new insights into Maiasaura: “Montana Dinosaur Species Grew Fast, Died Young, May Have Been Warm-Blooded“)
The fossils are so “excellently preserved,” paleontologists said, that they've made possible a new, closer-than-ever comparison between the anatomy of tyrannosaurs and that of birds and reptiles, living and extinct.
And the results show that, at least above the neck, the giant theropods bore the closest resemblance to crocodylians — the reptilian group that includes today's crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and gharials.
“It turns out that tyrannosaurs are identical to crocodylians in that the bones of their snouts and jaws are rough, except for a narrow band of smooth bone along the tooth row,” said Dr. Thomas Carr, a paleontologist at Carthage College, in a press statement.
Different textures of bone have been found to correspond to different types of soft tissue, Carr explained, so scientists can study fossilized bones to determine where there might have been a beak, for example, or horn tissue, or scales of various shapes and sizes.
(Read about soft tissue found in fossils: “Dinosaur Blood Cells, Soft Tissue Discovered in 75-Million-Year-Old Fossils“)
And the textures of the D. horneri skulls strongly resemble those in crocodylians, giving the dinos what the researchers describe as a “mask” of large, flat scales, accompanied by patches of thick, armor-like skin on the snout and jaw.
“In crocodylians, the rough texture [in the skull bones] occurs deep to large, flat scales,” they added.
“Given the identical texture, tyrannosaurs had the same covering.
“The armor-like skin would have protected tyrannosaurs from abrasions, perhaps sustained when hunting and feeding,” Carr said.
“We did not find any evidence for lips in tyrannosaurs,” they added. “The rough texture covered by scales extends nearly to the tooth row, providing no space for lips.”
But the comparison of the fossils provided insights into much more than what the dinosaurs looked like.
It also yielded clues about how physically sensitive tyrannosaurs were, especially around the snout.
The key clues here were foramina — the grooves inside bones that hold nerves and arteries.
The network of these grooves inside the tyrannosaur skulls is, again, nearly identical to those of crocodylians, suggesting that D. horneri had sensory organs like those found in modern crocs, providing the dinosaurs with a kind of “sixth sense.”
“Our findings of a complex sensory web is especially interesting, because it is derived from the trigeminal nerve, which has an extraordinary evolutionary history of developing into wildly different ‘sixth senses' in different vertebrates,” said Dr. Jayc Sedlmayr, an anatomist at Louisiana State University, who contributed to the research.
The trigeminal nerve is responsible for a wide variety of sensory abilities in all kinds of animals, they said, such as “sensing magnetic fields for bird migration, sensing infrared in pit vipers to identify prey, guiding mammals' movements through the use of whiskers, sensing vibrations through the water by alligators, and turning the elephant trunk into a sensitive hand similar to what has been done to the entire face of tyrannosaurs.”
And in addition to how D. horneri looked and how it felt, the discovery of the new species is also teaching scientists about the unusual history of the dinosaurs' evolution.
D. horneri lived in what's now Montana from about 75.2 million to 74.4 million years ago.
But that is much more recent, and slightly farther south, than the only other known species of Daspletosaurus — D. torosus, which lived millions of years earlier.
“Daspletosaurus horneri was the youngest, and last, of its lineage that lived after its closest relative, D. torosus, which is found in Alberta, Canada,” Carr said.
The physical similarity of the two tyrannosaurs, combined with their separation over time, suggests that D. horneri evolved directly from D. torosus, they noted.
“The close evolutionary relationship between the species taken with their geographic proximity and their sequential occurrence suggests that together they represent a single lineage that changed over geological time, where D. torosus has morphed into D. horneri,” Carr explained.
This is rare, non-branching kind of evolutionary development is known as anagenesis, wherein one species descends directly from another.
“Although uncommon in many evolutionary studies, anagenesis has been reported in some duck-billed dinosaurs and horned dinosaurs,” Carr said.
“Daspletosaurus, and these other dinosaurs, point the way forward in picking out the evidence for anagenesis in the fossil record.”
This unusual evolutionary discovery was made possible not only by the find of the fossils themselves, but also thanks to new dates the team obtained for parts of Montana's Two Medicine Formation.
(Read about another recent dino find: “Huge T. Rex Fossil, a ‘Fantastic Specimen,' Unearthed in Montana“)
Using a technique known as radiometry, the team was able to more accurately date the rocky stratum near where the fossils were found, which made clear how distant in time the two dinosaur species really were.
“The new radiometric dates we measured from the Two Medicine Formation not only help support that D. torosus and D. horneri did not live at the same time, but also help us refine the timeline of environmental and ecological changes recorded by the Two Medicine Formation,” said the University of New Mexico's Dr. Jason Moore.
Dr. Eric Roberts, a geoscientist at James Cook University, added, “New age dates presented in this study are just the tip of the iceberg.
“Ongoing work in this field will provide unprecedented improvements in the dating of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs from western North America over the next few years.”
The team reports their discovery in the journal Scientific Reports.

ENOUGH FLUFF, 恭禧发财!
RDAs
Wotofo Ice Cubed – Think Sapor, except with Velocity style posts. It has AFC, it's square (with flattened corners so it looks fine at a few different angles), and top airflow. The glass chamber is pretty tiny as well, so flavor should be good. Seems very functional for a (sort-of) gimmicky atty. Alternative link.
Focusecig Hobbit – If you were ever looking for an RDA which would suit an iStick Mini or a Council of Vapor Mini Volt, this might be the ticket. It's 17mm, and set up for single coil builds. You're meant to tuck your wick into the two holes in the deck, which is a setup I haven't seen before in other atomizers. Nifty. Alternative link.
RTAs (dual coil)
Geekvape Griffin – Possibly the largest deck I've ever seen on a 22mm RTA. Enormous airflow, easy wicking, and reasonable juice capacity without being overly huge. It tops fills, and the 510 pin is adjustable. It even looks pretty good. If you're exclusively an RDA user and are looking to get into tanks, this might be the one. Alternative link.
Goblin Nano – Basically a drop top Goblin Mini, and it's compatible with 510 drip tips. It's hilariously small, holds 2ml of juice (supposedly), but is otherwise identical to the Goblin Mini. If you want a tank that's shorter than most drippers out there, here's the solution. Alternative link.
EHpro F1 – Similar idea to the Big Dripper. Press the drip tip and juice goes to the bottom. I really like how the wick is visible from the sides. The airflow design is frankly ridiculous, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. It's an oddball for sure. Alternative link.
RTAs (single coil)
EHpro Bachelor – Take the Rose RTA and give it features competitive in 2016 and you have the Bachelor. Top fill, generous wicking space, juice flow control, a glass tank, removable drip tip. They even sell replacement coils (not coil heads) for it. Literally just pre-wicked coils you can drop in. I like the concept quite a bit. Not the greatest looking atty in my opinion, but the price is fair and it seems very functional. Alternative link.
Wotofo Serpent – To quote a review on Fasttech, “Tank very much! Qualitatively made! I recommend buying!”. I believe that sums it up. Seriously though, if you like a lot of airflow but don't like how much juice your dual coil tanks are going through, give it a try. Supposed to be dead easy to build+wick as well. Alternative link.
Gennies
SXK Corolla – While not technically a genny by some definitions since it's designed for fiber wick (cotton etc) and not mesh, it's close enough in my book. Look elsewhere if you want wide-open lung hits, the Corolla is meant for mouth-to-lung vapers. I kind of dig the bit of flair on the top cap personally. It also comes with red/orange acylic in the drop down menu. Alternative link.
Geekvape Avocado – Another not-a-genny genny. Velocity style posts and generous airflow here. I have heard from several Avocado owners that it has some mysterious issues with fluctuating resistance readings, so be cautious. Alternative link.
HCigar Fodi – Call it an ugly alternative to the Avocado. Cheaper as well, and without the resistance reading issue (as far as I have heard anyway). Alternative link.
IVOGO Velocity – Calling this authentic is kind of a joke. Yes, Avid Vaper never made a Velocity genny, so technically… It does look kind of neat though. Alternative link.

'Spider-Man' VR Support Happening; Sony Confirms New 'Spidey' Game In E3 2017 Line-Up!
By Miguel Paolo Togonon, | June 07, 2017
Marvel teases "Spider-Man" PS4 as one of the best games PlayStation 4. (YouTube)
The latest details for "Spider-Man" PS4 game will feature a confirmed E3 2017 appearance and VR support features.
It seems that Sony revealed their line-up of video game titles in this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo as president Shawn Layden told Glixel (via PlayStationLifeStyle) that these games include "God of War," "Uncharted: The Lost Legacy," "Spider-Man" PS4, "Days Gone" and "Gran Turismo Sport."

It is theorized that developers Insomniac Games could feature a full-gameplay trailer of the "Spider-Man" PS4 game, not to mention its official video game title. With the upcoming Marvel movie "Spider-Man: Homecoming" a month away from the event, the publication stated that showcasing the game featuring the web-slinger could build a powerful wave of momentum for both projects.
Sony also teased a second wave of VR games for the "PlayStation 4" as Layden teased a number of titles getting the virtual reality treatment soon.
With that said, can gaming and Marvel fans expect the new "Spider-Man" PS4 game to have VR features soon?
Senior vice president of games and innovations Jay Ong told GameSpot that they are excited about the possibilities of having VR projects in their Marvel games, noting they do not want to make VR games for the novelty.
Ong added that the new "Spider-Man" PS4 could be one of the best video games in the PS4 and fans are interested to see how the web-slinger swings from building after building in their point-of-view.
Insomniac Games obviously did not give any further details, but Ong did tease some information could be coming in the near future after being asked when we might here more about Marvel Games and VR by saying “soon.” They then continued by stating that there are absolutely things in the works, but they and Marvel are just not quite ready to announce them yet.
Both Marvel and Insomniac Games stated that they will be showcasing new gameplay for "Spider-Man" PS4 within the year. Marvel did promise gaming fans that the game will launch this year. Marvel Digital Media vice president and executive editor Ryan Penagos hinted that "Spider-Man" will indeed launch this year alongside "Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite" on September.
Gaming and Marvel fans will just have to wait for further announcement for the "Spider-Man" PS4 at E3 2017.
"Spider-Man" is speculated to launch sometime in 2017 for the PS4.
After WhatsApp triple talaq, two women beaten for not leaving the house in Hyderabad
India
oi-Gulam Rabbani
Even as the Supreme Court of India decides on the validity of triple talaq, a couple has been arrested in Hyderabad for assaulting their daughters in law for refusing to leave the house. Two US based brothers sent across triple talaq messages to their wives through WhatsApp. When the two ladies refused to leave the house, they were allegedly assaulted by the parents of the boys.
The brothers Abdul Sohail and Abdul Aqil had also put up a display photo of triple talaq on their mobile phones to convey the message to their wives. According to the complaint the two ladies living in the Moghalpur area of Hyderabad were assaulted when they refused to leave the house. Following the complaint the police arrested Mohammad Hafiz and Athiya Begum.
The two brothers had left for New York to work with a private firm. Abdul who had married Heena in 2012 and has two children. Abdul Aqil married Mehreen Noor in 2015 and have one child. As per the complaint, the two brothers had since the past two months sending messages seeking a divorce.
The two women told the police that around five days back they had received a message seeking divorce. The two brothers even put up triple talaq as their display picture on WhatsApp. However we refused to accept it as we had done nothing wrong, they said.
The two women were asked to leave the house. They sat outside the house in protest.
When the cops intervened their father-in-law said that their sons had divorced them as per the Sharia law. The two women complained that when they refused to leave the premises they were assualted.

TELL US – ANY GUESSES WHO THE GUY IS? FRIEND? NEW BOYFRIEND?
Louisville scored tied it in the top of the 9th to force extra innings and then scored 3 in the 11th to come back and win against Durham last night. The good news is that Rookie “of the year” Davis started and walked no batters while striking out 10. The bad news is that they gave up 4 earned runs on 9 hits over 4.2 innings of work. Ismael Guillon was very good out of the bullpen, striking out 7 in 3.1 shutout innings. The Louisville pitching staff combined for 19 strikeouts and only 2 walks on the night. That's good hurlin'. Chad “Wallops” Wallach was the hero, going 3 for 5 with the go-ahead solo dinger in the 11th while also scoring twice. Tyler “Good Day” Goeddel was 2 for 4 with a walk and 2 RBI and Zach “Soft J” Vinej was 1 for 5 with 2 RBI. Everyone in the starting lineup recorded a hit, too, which is also good.
Up Next: Cody Reed gets the start against Gwinnett tonight at 7:05 PM ET.
Pensacola was off last night. They will face off against Mobile tonight at 6:35 PM CT with Keury Mella getting the start.
Woof. Jonathon Crawford lasted only 2.2 innings, giving up 8 runs (4 earned) on 5 hits with 4 walks and 2 strikeouts. The rest of the pitching staff was bad, too. Daniel Sweet “And Sour” was 2 for 4 with 2 runs scored, a triple, and 2 RBI. James “No Nickname” Vasquez was 2 for 3 with a walk and 2 runs scored and Reydel “Mean” Medina “and Mode” was 2 for 5 with a double, 1 RBI, and also had 2 runs scored.
Up Next: Wyatt Strahan starts against Palm Beach tonight at 7:05 PM ET.
Dayton was off last night. Wennington Romero starts tonight against South Bend at 7:05 PM ET.
Hunter Greene wasn't in the lineup last night, but it didn't matter because Billings exploded for 14 runs. The pitching, as you can expect, was bad. Jhon “H-O” De Jesus got exactly one batter out while surrendering 5 runs on 3 hits. Zac “Cornell” Correll later struck out 2 in 2 scoreless innings, which was good. Montrell “We Are” Marshall was 2 for 5 with a double and 6 RBI. Morgan “Nordstrom” Lofstrom was 2 for 4 with 2 runs scored and 2 RBI while Mark Kolozsvary also had 2 RBI while going 3 for 4 with 3 runs scored.
Up Next: Billings is off tonight.
The Baby Reds gave up 4 in the top of the 9th to lose 7-5. Jose Castillo started and pitched okay, giving up 2 runs on 3 hits with no walks and 4 strikeouts. Raul Wallace was 1 for 3 with a double and 3 RBI, Reshard “Funroe” Munroe was 2 for 2 with a walk, a double, and 2 runs scored, and Miguel Hernandez was 2 for 5 with a run scored.
Up Next: The Baby Reds play the Baby Indians tonight.

Jenkins 2.0 has been released! Please give it a try and provide your feedback.
Why
We need to claim our rightful place in Continuous Delivery. We have lots of pieces that address these modern needs, but we are not communicating this very well. We need to revisit out of the box experience, so that Jenkins itself speaks that story and makes it clear what we are aiming for. Our software needs to speak for itself and tell people where we are going, so that the community can better focus efforts on the important parts. And we need to do this while keeping what makes Jenkins great in the first place, which are the ecosystem, the community, and the extensibility that recognizes that one size does not fit all and let people do what they want to do.
Call to action: testing!
Rough Timeline
Here is a rough timeline of the release/launch:
February 29: Create "alpha" release released
released March 16: "feature complete" and cut alpha-4 release. Focus on making sure features landed work well released
released March 23: beta release with announcement, calls for testing to broader audience. Launch jenkins.io released
released April 1: Unscheduled Beta 2 with a number of bug fixes
April 6: Create first release candidate (RC) released
released April 20: Create 2.0 proper release with last RC
April 26: More coordinated launch marketing activities commence
Discussions
We'd like to validate that what we are proposing here actually solves people's problems. That will help us modify and prioritize the plan.
To collect those feedbacks in a manageable way, we have prepared a number of "2.0 planning tickets", divided under several themes called "epic tickets" in JIRA. This page and its children walk you through the main parts of those epics and details, and takes you to the actual tickets.
For historical archiving, here are earlier conversations that were done as mega threads:
As a community member and a future user, we'd like YOU to COMMENT and VOTE on those tickets. If you have more serious thoughts that do not fit in a comment or a vote, please feel free to post emails to the dev list or file additional tickets and link to the 2.0 planning tickets and/or epic tickets. The only thing we are trying to avoid is having more of the mega threads that nobody can keep up with.
Changes planned for 2.0
Overall pitch and its slide version.
User-visible changes
Introduce a new subsystem in Jenkins that moves job configuration in SCM and makes job creation automatic.
Better out-of-the-box experience
A revamped new-user experience would help the numerous people who set up Jenkins for the first time. An important part is guiding new users through the installation of important plugins.
A more powerful plugin manager. A revamped UI for configuring jobs, views, build agents, etc. An easier to use "New Item/View/Agent" dialog.
JENKINS-31095 — More consistent terminology
JENKINS-32357 — Tabs on the job configuration page
A new web site, which could include curated documentation, more visible events and blog, and/or a usable plugin index.
Internal changes
Servlet 3.1
Servlet 3.1 enables alternatives to poll Jenkins for changes every ten or so seconds through use of Web Sockets. This will require use of a fairly recent servlet container (Jetty 9.1+, Tomcat 8).
JENKINS-23378 Raise minimum requirement to servlet 3.1
Emphasize UIs created in JavaScript, provide a simple framework for JS libraries that plugins can make use of.
Changes planned for a later release
Based on this discussion, the following proposals are currently considered for a release later than 2.0.
It's cumbersome to set up Jenkins in config management tools such as Chef. A proper API for configuring Jenkins would make this easier. The CLI isn't enough.
Proposal on the dev list
Being considered for a later 2.x release
Move parts of file storage into a database and/or make it pluggable.
Backward compatibility policy
Deprecated methods remain around forever, polluting code and documentation and making new development more cumbersome.
Move Groovy out of core
Enable more flexible upgrades of Groovy.
JENKINS-29068 Split Groovy out of core
Hiding core libraries from plugins
Better isolation of the libraries core uses from plugins, so that "not breaking plugins" doesn't have to be a concern for use of libraries that should be internal to core, as it is today.

EA Sports unveiled NBA Live 18 at the 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo on Saturday and confirmed a new mode and demo release date.
According to IGN's Andrew Goldfarb, EA Sports formally introduced a new mode called The One, which will allow players to track their journey in one of two settings. The first is The Streets, which is for players who want to play in competitive five-on-fives in prestigious pickup-game locales.
There's also The League, which allows players to track their journey through the NBA.
According to the game's explanatory trailer released Saturday, The One is being billed as "an all-new way to pursue your legacy."
It also notes that "the respect you earn on the streets matters just as much as the rings you earn in the league."
In The Streets, players will be able to prove their worth at famous courts such as Venice Beach and Rucker Park, while also participating in the Drew League to bolster their skills and acquire new gear.
In January, EA Sports announced the NBA Live franchise wouldn't produce a game for the 2016-17 season and would push the release for its newest game to fall 2017.
"We have been on a journey with NBA Live and want to deliver something that's truly innovative and disruptive in the marketplace," EA Sports CEO Andrew Wilson said at the time, per Polygon's Samit Sarkar.
A demo is expected to be made available to the public in August.
Did Drake and Future really make What a Time to Be Alive in six days? That's the same amount of time it took God to create the Earth. And Drake and Future have earned their seventh day of rest for "Diamonds Dancing". Future goes high soprano, the saxophone comes in cool, and the hook is simply "diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing"—an extremely fun alliteration, especially when said over crushingly low drums. The five-minute track ends with a stereotypical Drake lamentation over ambient noise that will not convert anyone who thinks they are a melancholy cornball. But if you love that shit, well, it is perfect. Could "Diamonds Dancing" be shorter? Yes. Could the chorus be longer? Yes. But God fucked up some Earth shit, too. Who needs pollution and murderers? But sometimes you accept the worst and turn your face to the best in order to live. What a time to be alive, indeed!
Listen on Apple Music.
SAN FRANCISCO — Moscone North has been packed with exhibitors for the last three days as they peddle their latest wares to the Apple faithful. We combed through all the booths, and while there were a ton of underwhelming products, Macworld 2014 did feature some really cool stuff and a couple surprises.
After some fierce debate among the Cult of Mac editors, we've settled on seven things that are truly deserving of a “Best of Macworld 2014″ title. So without further adieu, here they are:
BearExtender Edge
BearExtender revealed their newest WiFi extender at Macworld this week that promises to expand your WiFi signal to the farthest corners of your house.
The BearExtender Edge is optimized to work with iPhones, iPads, Macs, and AirPort Extreme but you can connect PCs to it as well. All you do is plug it into an outlet, run through a quick setup – no app required – and you'll be off and running with Wifi coming out your ears.
No word on a price yet, but BearExtender told us it will probably come in around $70 when it ships later this summer.
Cloak 2.0
Cloak is a VPN app that just hit version 2.0 on iOS and the Mac. If you've never heard of a VPN, it's a way of connecting to the internet securely and anonymously, but unlike most VPN tools, Cloak's interface is fantastic, and thanks to new features for VPNs in iOS 7, it can automatically know when to turn on and off.
You can add trusted networks so that all of your traffic won't go through Cloak on your home WiFi, for example. Cloak can also be told to trust your cellular connection or not.
IN1 iPhone Case
Among all the new iPhone cases at Macworld the IN1 impressed us the most. It's basically the Swiss Army knife of iPhone cases, packing a screw driver, tweezers, two pens and more. It's gimmicky, but it's still one of the cooler cases we've seen. Think Inspector Gadget with eight tiny, useful tools.
Petcube
For those pained with guilt for leaving Fido home alone all day, Petcube lets you interact and play with your pet anywhere you have a data connection.
The tiny box is equipped with a camera to keep your eye on your kitties and features a motion detector that can alert you when your pet is rummaging around. And if you need some quality playtime, Petcube is armed with a laser that you can aim around the room with your iPhone for some feline fun.
Glowdeck
I've never wanted a wireless iPhone charger until I laid eyes on Glowdeck.
The beautiful wooden box doesn't just juice up your depleted iPhone though. It's armed with Bluetooth speakers, a noise canceling mic for speaker and voice commands, an LED display, a USB port, and it can turn your music into a light show with the LEDs under the box.
Glowdeck launched as a Kickstarter project just a few days ago and has already passed its funding goal. They're aiming to ship units this August with the black Glowdeck running $195 while the gorgeous cheery wood unit will cost you $250.
Henge Docks Horizontal Station
Henge Docks had a seriously cool MacBook dock on display. The Horizontal Docking Station's metal chassis hugs the MacBook and offers more plugs than you could dream of. Plus it's great for eliminating cord clutter.
There's support for a Kensington lock in the back. The dock can power up to three external displays, and your windows are saved and automatically adjusted when you dock and undock.
OlloClip for iPad
Olloclip has been knocking it out of the park with its arsenal of iPhone lenses, but now it's ready for a bigger screen with the Olloclip iPad lens. It's identical to Olloclip's iPhone 4-in-1, with a fisheye, wide-angle, 10x and 5x macro lenses. It will only fit the iPad Air and Retina Mini (the regular Mini is slightly thicker).
Olloclip CEO Patrick O'Neill said lots of iPad users take photos and video with their devices, especially video. “The big screen is great for framing,” they said.
However, the company was always nervous about the etiquette implications. They didn't want to be responsible for iPad owners holding up their tablets at events and blocking other people's views. “We didn't want to be the brand that got blamed for that.” So don't get too photo crazy at the next concert with your iPad.
Mass graves with up to 2,000 Japanese soldiers found on Iwo Jima
Two mass graves that may hold the bodies of more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers have been discovered on the island of Iwo Jima, one of the bloodiest and most iconic battle sites of World War II.
A team of Japanese researchers has discovered 51 remains in two areas listed by the U.S. military after the war as enemy cemeteries.
One grave could contain as many as 2,000 bodies. Recovering all the remains will take months.

The battle on the tiny Pacific island saw 6,821 American and 21,570 Japanese lives lost. The bodies of 12,000 Japanese soldiers have never been found.
Officials at Japan's health ministry, which supervises search efforts on the remote island, confirmed that 51 bodies had been recovered and two sites believed to be burial grounds had been found.
But they could not immediately confirm the potential size of the mass graves or other details of the Kyodo news agency's report.
The discovery of the remains would be one of the biggest breakthroughs in decades toward finding the bodies of roughly 12,000 Japanese who remain missing and presumed dead after the 1945 battle on the island, which has been renamed Iwoto by the Japanese government.

Securing the island was seen as key to the U.S. because it had three airfields that could be used to launch raids on Tokyo and Japan's main islands
The island was seen as key to the United States because it had three airfields that could be used to launch raids on Tokyo and Japan's main islands.
Virtually all of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers tasked with defending the rugged, volcanic crag were killed in the battle, which became a symbol and rallying point for the United States in the Pacific war after the country's flag was raised on its highest ground, Mount Suribachi.
The battle claimed 6,821 American and 21,570 Japanese lives. Dozens of remains are recovered every year, but about 12,000 Japanese are still classified as missing in action and presumed killed on the island, along with 218 Americans.
Fighting began on February 19, 1945, but Iwo Jima was not declared secured until March 26.
Japan surrendered in August of that year, after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
According to the Kyodo report, searchers dug near a runway at a base used by the Japanese military - the only full-time inhabitants of the island - and at the foot of Suribachi.
It said the operation began early this month based on information from the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.
The report said the main site is estimated to have about 2,000 bodies and the Suribachi site 70-200 bodies. It said the recovery effort was expected to take several months.
SCP-2541
The opening image of a video played by SCP-2541.
Item #: SCP-2541
Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: Any recovered instances of SCP-2541 are to be stored within a standard anomalous item locker. Use of SCP-2541 is restricted for personnel with clearance below Level-2 unless given permission otherwise. SCP-2541 is not to be used for recreational use by Foundation personnel.
Description: SCP-2541 is the designation for a series of anomalous video tapes which initiate a complex cognitohazardous effect on human subjects who view one of them. Instances of SCP-2541 have been discovered in several forms, including VHS tapes, DVD discs and digital video files, though all are functionally identical and all feature an icon of a stylized yellow lemon somewhere on their packaging. Currently, the Foundation has 328 distinct instances of SCP-2541 within containment.
Upon playing an instance of SCP-2541, human subjects who directly view SCP-2541 will appear to fall into a catatonic state. From the subject's perspective, they will believe they are arriving at a building titled "Your II's Only" (SCP-2541-A), and are greeted by an instance of SCP-2541-1. Should a subject be allowed entry into SCP-2541-A, they will arrive in a non-descript dimly-lit room filled with other subjects under the effects of SCP-2541 participating in group intercourse. In addition, subjects also report seeing several other non-participating instances of SCP-2541-1 around the perimeter of the room.
Subjects report heightened libido and a greater genital sensitivity while within the area of SCP-2541-A, and report the feeling of intercourse with all subjects within SCP-2541-A as feeling akin to actual intercourse. Regardless of any actions subjects believe they are doing within SCP-2541-A, from an outside perspective they will only appear to be speaking aloud to themselves and orgasming, when appropriate.
Instances of SCP-2541-1 appear to be are humans typically of above-average height dressed in black attire with a single yellow lemon pin affixed to their shirt. Instances of SCP-2541-1 under no circumstances ever participate within the group intercourse occurring inside of SCP-2541-A, though may be asked to turn around or provide subjects with various non-harmful items. Instances of SCP-2541-1 are also the only known instances capable of ceasing the cognitohazardous effect upon affected subjects. Instances of SCP-2541-1 only cease the effect if one of the three following conditions are met:
A subject approaches an SCP-2541-1 instance and requests to leave.
A subject has spent more than eight hours under the effects of SCP-2541.
A subject expresses repeated inappropriate or unwanted behavior upon other subjects or instances of SCP-2541-1.
Upon ceasing the effects of SCP-2541, the instance of SCP-2541 will conclude playing and the subject will regain all bodily functions as normal. Subjects will remember their experience under the effects of SCP-2541 as if they were actually present at a group intercourse session.
Addendum 2541-1: Below is an interview Researcher Victoria Forsythe initiated between themselves and an instance of SCP-2541-1. As recording equipment within SCP-2541-A is impossible, Researcher Forsythe repeated phrases as they were spoken by the SCP-2541-1 instance so they could be recorded. Extraneous phrases have been removed.
<Begin Log> Researcher Forsythe: Ah, hello! SCP-2541-1 nods. SCP-2541-1: Evening ma'am. Researcher Forsythe: This may be a weird thing to ask, but is it possible that I could ask a few questions about this place? SCP-2541-1 nods. Researcher Forsythe: Excellent. First and foremost, could you explain a bit about why this place exists? SCP-2541-1: I could. Silence. Researcher Forsythe: Will you explain why this place exists? SCP-2541-1: For people to have sex in. Researcher Forsythe sighs. Researcher Forsythe: But why go into all the effort of making it the way you did? SCP-2541-1: I didn't make it. Bobs did. Researcher Forsythe: "Bobs?" SCP-2541-1: Robert and Rupert Weissman. The people that run this place. Researcher Forsythe: Is there some way I can contact them? SCP-2541-1: If you got any complaints about this place, you can take it up with Customer Services. Researcher Forsythe: I don't- Researcher Forsythe interrupts themselves and exhales sharply. Researcher Forsythe: Let me try this again. Why did "Bobs" make this place? Why make an anomalous conceptual sex club when they could just make a normal one? Silence. SCP-2541-1: You're Foundation, aren't you? Researcher Forsythe: Excuse me, how do you- SCP-2541-1: If you want specific answers, I'll give you Bobs' phone number. If you want just what I know, all I know is that as long as people are in here, this can be the only conceptual sex club in existence. Researcher Forsythe: How do you know about the Foundation? How did you know that I was Foundation? SCP-2541-1: One, you're repeating everything I say in a very non-subtle way, like you're trying to record what I'm telling you. Two, you're trying to interview a security guard rather than fucking a bunch of people in a magic sex club. Researcher Forsythe: That still doesn't explain how you know about us without us formally knowing about you. SCP-2541-1: I'd guess that most people in the Foundation would rather keep their kinks private. You'd be surprised how many Foundation employees are some of Inevitability Industries' best clients. <End Log>
Post-interview, a survey among several Foundation employees had discovered that ██ Foundation personnel were clients of Inevitability Industries, hereinafter GoI-7058.
Addendum 2541-2: After receiving the phone number for the Persons of Interest known as Robert and Rupert Weissman (PoI-7058-A and PoI-7058-B), Researcher Forsythe proceeded to contact and conduct an interview with them in order to further understand both SCP-2541 and GoI-7058.
I'm proud to announce that I have won a major art competition.
Oh all right. (Modesty, James. Modesty!). I am one of several climate change sceptics to have been celebrated and immortalised in an exciting new, prizewinning art installation at Anglia Ruskin, one of Britain's largest universities. (h/t Liam Deacon)
It comprises a faux-stone slab (made out of plywood) engraved with my own name and that of five other British climate sceptics – Christopher Booker, Nigel Lawson, Christopher Monckton, Melanie Phillips, Owen Paterson – beneath the legend “Lest We Forget Those Who Denied.” The sculpture has been described as an “oil painting with a difference” because a continuous stream of engine oil drools symbolically over the “deniers'” names, like tragic sea otters after an Exxon spill.
The piece, which won the university's 2015 Sustainability Art Prize, was the creation of third year fine art student Ian Wolter.
Wolter has explained their meisterwerk thus:
“With this work I envisage a time when the deliberate denial of climate change will be seen as a crime because it hinders progress towards a low carbon future.”
The prize – £250 and a certificate – was presented to them by the head of the university's art department.
Among those who have praised the work is the director of the university's Global Sustainability Institute, Dr Aled Jones.
Dr Jones told me:
“It's a very impressive installation, complex and very political.”
I quite agree and am hugely proud to find myself in the distinguished company of some of Britain's finest journalists and most brave and outspoken politicians, including a former Chancellor of the Exchequer and the former Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
Jolly well done, young Ian! And thank you for caring.
It is hard to deny that Adobe's Flash Player had become more than an option when you surf the web. Not long ago we found most of the websites just based on html, css and eventually animated gifs. Video clips were just on subpages and most of us didnt really miss the obtrusive advertisment, often displayed on the banners on commercial websites like magazines.
While you can eventually ignore video websites like Youtube you find more and more pages you cannot even access—you have to skip over a Flash intro to enter the website, click through Flash-created menues, click on Flash animated maps where your current location is and other, often annoying tricks.
There were many FreeBSD users who tried to move Adobe to release their Flash Player plugin not only for Mac OSX, Linux and Solaris but simply to compile a BSD binary what we can use on BSD workstations. Not much of a reaction yet..
These instructions here may help you to get around this little inconvienience. There might be some quirks, but you will get along with a FreeBSD Firefox port and the Linux plugin and the nspluginwrapper written by Gwenole Beauchesne.
It is critical to understand that the individual states of the United States, like national governments, have a responsibility to secure their critical infrastructure — including electric power grids, air traffic control systems, financial systems, and communication networks—as well as the data that has been entrusted to them by their citizens.
The private sector typically pays higher wages than government, especially local government. So corporations tend to attract more specialist staff. That's a problem for all citizens.
Thanks to an increase in network and cyber hacking threats, people with specialist knowledge in IT security are in short supply. Combine that with the fact that the private sector usually pays higher wages than local government … and the scarce supply of security specialists is naturally gravitating towards the private sector.
But central and local government, even though they are constrained by tight budgets, have a significant need for tight security.
– Central government can find itself facing sophisticated cyberattacks through to opportunistic tax frauds.
– And regional government can be storing sensitive information about millions of citizens and state assets.
But there is an answer. Even if local government is struggling to add specialist employees to the IT team, there are at least specialist tools which can audit the entire network on a daily basis, and represent a significant step to security threats prevention
Elastic Detector from SecludIT is one such tool, and one which many consider to be the most comprehensive due to its broad control surface and actionable reporting. Based on a daily update of security threats, Elastic Detector audits the entire network and alerts IT teams to any vulnerabilities found.
Better still, SecludIT also supplies remediation sheets or fix tips, so even IT teams without specialist security training can address many vulnerabilities.
Elastic Detector deep automation also helps to deal with tight budgets as the staff needed to run the tool is far reduced, plus most operations benefit from auto-pilot mode.

University Business School ESMT Berlin Now Accepting Bitcoin
The international business school ESMT Berlin has just announced it will be accepting bitcoin for tuition and degree certification. The school will be the first German University to accept cryptocurrency as payment.

ESMT Berlin Accepting Bitcoin a ‘Logical Consequence of Digitalization'
ESMT Berlin is a leading business school in Germany that offers MBA accreditation, PhDs, and master's degrees. The private university, located in Berlin, has been well established for 14 years. Now the school will be accepting bitcoin for all of its education programs. The university detailed that digital currencies offer money transfers without the need for third-party intermediaries.
“Integrating bitcoin as a routine method of payment is a logical consequence of digitalization,” explains Georg Garlichs, CFO of ESMT. “Especially for international transactions from countries without a well-functioning banking system, the digital currency offers great advantages through the immediate, practically free-of-charge transfer. This makes bitcoins attractive to us as a means of accepted payment.”
German Interest in Cryptocurrency & Blockchain Grows
Germany has been quite keen towards researching and developing virtual currency and blockchain solutions. ESMT Berlin has a broad range of studies concerning blockchain innovation and what it means for business and society. Furthermore, a few other schools in Germany have been researching the blockchain subject as well such as Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. ESMT Berlin describes Bitcoin as the “most well-developed blockchain application.”
“In addition to reducing transaction costs and providing P2P marketplaces, blockchain also facilitates individual marketing of personal data,” details Christoph Burger, blockchain expert at ESMT. “This is a feature that offers the data owner an improved position when negotiating with the users of data, especially in the age of big data.”
Other Universities See Potential in Bitcoin
A few other universities worldwide also accept Bitcoin for services for tuition and supplies. The largest school in Cyprus the University of Nicosia was the first school to accept bitcoin back in 2013. Other universities who accept the cryptocurrency include the University of Cumbria, King's College in New York, and others. In Boston, you can use the decentralized currency at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) COOP store for textbooks and school supplies.
ESMT Berlin will join the list of accredited schools worldwide that see a future with Bitcoin's innovation and technology. Hopefully, these universities spark more academic interest in cryptocurrency solutions.
What do you think about ESMT Berlin accepting Bitcoin for school services? Let us know in the comments below.

Eugene Lang is a adjunct professor, School of Policy Studies, Queen's University, and Fellow, Canadian Global Affairs Institute. They served as chief of staff to two Ministers of Defence in the Chrétien and Martin governments.
"Most military advisers find it a very odd stance that Canadian politicians have taken, that we don't get on board with ballistic missile defence [BMD]," asserted retired chief of defence staff Tom Lawson in a recent interview.
But the Canadian decision to remain outside the U.S. BMD system – a position that has transcended four successive governments – is odd only if you think of BMD in a military, national security and foreign policy context. It is not odd at all if you consider BMD to be fundamentally a domestic political issue. And that has been the central reality around BMD in Canada for about 15 years.
Story continues below advertisement
Canada's first forays into BMD discussions with the United States began during the Jean Chrétien government. In those days, the military leadership in Ottawa was pressing the politicians hard, especially the defence minister, for Canada to sign on to BMD. What this meant in practice was never entirely clear, because Washington was going ahead with BMD with or without Canada. The United States did not need nor seem to want anything from Canada financially. Nor did they have designs on Canadian technology to build their system or Canadian territory to place it.
In Ottawa, BMD was presented to ministers by both military leaders and civilian national defence officials as a "no-brainer." It was a free insurance policy for Canada, offered up by the benevolent Americans. If we were part of the system, we got the benefits at no cost to Canadian taxpayers. If we were not part of the system, we would have no guarantees that the United States would use its system to shoot down a rogue missile headed toward Canada (few in Ottawa believed a state possessing a ballistic missile would ever intentionally target Canada).
At the time, the George W. Bush administration had some interest in Canada being a part of BMD. This was chiefly to ensure certain data collected by NORAD was available to the BMD operators, requiring Canada's consent. There were also suggestions that some Bush administration officials desired Canada's political support for what was a controversial system in many countries at that time.
In Ottawa, there were others – particularly some senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs – who were reticent or even hostile to Canada joining BMD. Their primary concern was the risk that BMD would lead to "the weaponization of space," allegedly the last truly peaceful domain that needed to be protected from the depredations of the United States.
But there was another much more powerful faction of BMD critics that emerged and grew in strength over time, particularly following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in early 2003. These were Members of Parliament in both the Liberal and NDP caucuses for whom the foreign and military policy and conduct of the Bush administration in Iraq, and eventually in Afghanistan, was anathema to Canadian interests and values. And by 2004, the Liberals, in a weak minority government position under Paul Martin and supported on confidence votes in Parliament by the NDP, were highly attuned to the concerns of MPs and public opinion generally. Opinion polls at the time indicated that among Canadians, George W. Bush was the most unpopular president in decades.
It is in this political cauldron that BMD got thrown. Canadian support for the program began to be seen by many politicians not as a national security issue for Canada, but rather as tacit, if not explicit, support for the foreign and military policy of a deeply and perhaps irretrievably unpopular administration in Washington. Canada joining BMD was never going to happen as long as George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld were in office.
The central lesson from this history is simple. If the U.S. president is popular in Canada – or at least not reviled – and U.S. foreign and military policy is not seen by large segments of the Canadian population as an affront – Canadian involvement in BMD should be achievable politically.

Meaning the most propitious time for Canada to sign onto BMD was during the tenures of Barack Obama and Stephen Harper. The Conservatives under Mr. Harper were supportive of BMD when in Opposition and claimed to be trying to bolster Canadian national security while in office. At the same time, polls showed that Mr. Obama had higher approval scores in Canada than most prime ministers ever achieve. But for whatever reason, the opportunity for Canada to sign onto BMD during that period was never seized. That is indeed odd.
Sadly, for the BMD proponents, things have changed for the worse south of the border. As long as Donald Trump is in office – the most divisive, erratic, rhetorically militaristic, if not frightening U.S. President in modern history – it is hard to see how the politics of BMD in Canada would work for any Canadian government.
The Oxford English Dictionary traces the word to the Spanish word hombredad, meaning manliness, modified after the Sicilian word omu for man. According to a different theory, the word comes from Latin humilitas (humility), which became umirtà and then finally omertà in some southern Italian dialects.[2]
The basic principle of omertà is that it is not "manly" to seek aid from legally constituted authorities to settle personal grievances. The suspicion of being a cascittuni (an informant) constitutes the blackest mark against manhood, according to Cutrera. An individual who has been wronged is obligated to look out for their own interests by avenging that wrong themselves or finding a patron but not the state to do the job.[3]
Omertà implies "the categorical prohibition of cooperation with state authorities or reliance on its services, even when one has been victim of a crime."[4] A person should absolutely avoid interfering in the business of others and should not inform the authorities of a crime under any circumstances, but if it is justified, they may personally avenge a physical attack on themselves or on their family by vendetta, literally a taking of revenge, a feud. Even if somebody is convicted of a crime that they have not committed, they are supposed to serve the sentence without giving the police any information about the real criminal, even if the criminal has nothing to do with the Mafia. Within Mafia culture, breaking omertà is punishable by death.[4]
Omertà is an extreme form of loyalty and solidarity in the face of authority. One of its absolute tenets is that it is deeply demeaning and shameful to betray even one's deadliest enemy to the authorities. For that reason, many Mafia-related crimes go unsolved. Observers of the Mafia debate whether omertà should best be understood as an expression of social consensus for the Mafia or whether it is instead a pragmatic response based primarily on fear, as implied by a popular Sicilian proverb Cu è surdu, orbu e taci, campa cent'anni 'mpaci ("He who is deaf, blind and silent will live a hundred years in peace").
It has also been described as follows: "Whoever appeals to the law against their fellow man is either a fool or a coward. Whoever cannot take care of themselves without police protection is both. It is as cowardly to betray an offender to justice, even though their offences be against yourself, as it is not to avenge an injury by violence. It is dastardly and contemptible in a wounded man to betray the name of their assailant, because if they recover, they must naturally expect to take vengeance himself."[5]
Reddit
Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman were 22 years old when they sold Reddit, a popular online community, to publishing house Condé Nast for between $10 million and $20 million.
They sold it within two years of starting the company.
The pair shared the experience and the drama that followed during a live podcast taping of "How I Built This" with NPR's Guy Raz in San Francisco in August.
"This was 16 months of work that was going to mean more money for me than my entire family — my mother and father — had made in their entire lives," Ohanian told Raz on stage.
Reddit, the so-called "front page of the internet," is now valued at $1.8 billion. But before it became the eighth most popular site on the internet, Reddit nearly met an early end.
In the years following the site's sale, the company was almost taken over by by internet trolls. Users protesting internal issues at Reddit tried to shut the site down, and a revolving door of CEOs did little to stabilize the startup's reputation. Ohanian and Huffman, who took a hiatus from Reddit, were absent during much of that time. Meanwhile, their relationship soured.
Here's how the duo bounced back to save Reddit. (Check out the podcast for the full story.)
Ohanian and Huffman were friends before they were cofounders
The pair met on the first day of college — their dorm rooms were located across the hall from each other at University of Virginia — and played countless hours of PlayStation 2 over the years. As juniors, they hatched an idea for an app (not Reddit) and went into business together.
After a fateful meeting with investor Paul Graham over their spring break, they joined the inaugural class of Y Combinator, a tech startup accelerator, and set out to create Reddit.

Reddit grew to become the 11th biggest site in the world with 70,000 unique visitors by 2006. When Ohanian and Huffman sold it that year to Condé Nast's parent company, Advance Publications, they joined the media giant as part of their contracts. For three years, they worked on a celebrity-gossip news aggregator, Lipstick.com, that used Reddit's underlying tech.
After eight years of living together, Huffman parted for San Francisco and Ohanian spent some time in Armenia, where their dad's family came from. Their friendship began to falter. They rarely spoke, about Reddit or their lives outside the office, they told NPR.
"When our contracts at Condé Nast expired, we kind of just said, 'Great, see you later," Ohanian said during the taping
"I didn't feel animosity, it was neglect," Huffman said.
They came together when Reddit needed them
In 2015, about five years since Ohanian and Huffman left Reddit, the company looked like it might go under. Internet trolls were spewing messages of hate across the site, and many moderators — users who supervise Reddit's thousands of forums — took their communities offline in protest of a key Reddit staffer's departure. The Southern Poverty Law Center pegged Reddit as an online bulletin board for the most violently racist content on the internet.
At the same time, Ohanian and Huffman started to repair their friendship.
"We never really exercised the muscles that founders have to exercise that best friends don't," Ohanian explained during the podcast. "It's great to be able to start a company with one of your best friends, but the conversations you have as cofounders are very different from the conversations you have as friends. We didn't have enough of the hard ones often enough."
The pair met for dinner in February 2015 and began to take inventory of the events and actions that caused their relationship to fall apart. They agreed at that first dinner to work on it.
"We actually saw my therapist [together]," Huffman told NPR.

While they made strides in mending their friendship, operations at Reddit continued to unravel. Ellen Pao resigned as interim CEO in June 2015.
Ohanian served as a board member of Reddit at the time. They called Huffman for back-up.
"I remember my friends being like, 'Why are you running into that burning building?' And it just felt like, at the time, I had no choice. I really, really loved Reddit," Huffman told NPR. They said the computer engineer in them — not the CEO — believed they could fix Reddit's code and reclaim the site from trolls. Huffman was installed as the new permanent CEO in July 2015.
The number of employees at Reddit doubled in the year that followed, which helped Huffman address the company's myriad issues. Reddit improved a feature to block users and debuted a quarantine for offensive content, making it harder for people to find.
The company also launched Android and iOS apps, and within one year, more than half of the site's users viewed Reddit on mobile devices. Monthly unique visitors ballooned to 243 million.
Ohanian and Huffman remain close friends.
One very important fact has been largely absent from the coverage of the sexual assault case against Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and, until latterly, leading candidate to be the next president of France. The hotel housekeeper whom they allegedly assaulted was represented by a union.
The reason that this is an important part of the story is that it is likely that Strauss-Kahn's alleged victim might not have felt confident enough to pursue the issue with either their supervisors or law enforcement agencies, if they had not been protected by a union contract. The vast majority of hotel workers in the United States, like most workers in the private sector, do not enjoy this protection.
This matters because under the law in the United States, an employer can fire a worker at any time for almost any reason. It is illegal for an employer to fire a worker for reporting a sexual assault. If any worker can prove that this is the reason they were fired, they would get their job back and probably back pay. (The penalties tend to be trivial, so the back pay is, unfortunately, not a joke.)
However, it is completely legal for an employer to fire a worker who reports a sexual assault for having been late to work last Tuesday or any other transgression. Since employers know the law, they don't ever say that they are firing a worker for reporting a sexual assault. They might fire workers who report sexual assaults for other on-the-job failings, real or invented.
In this way, the United States stands out from most other wealthy countries. For example, all the countries of western Europe afford workers some measure of employment protection, where employers must give a reason for firing workers. Workers can contest their dismissal if they think the reason is not valid, unlike the United States where there is no recourse.
Imagine the situation of the hotel worker had they not been protected by a union contract.  They are a young immigrant mother who needs this job to support their family. According to reports, they likely did not know Strauss-Kahn's identity at the time they reported the assault, but they undoubtedly understood that the person staying in the $3,000-a-night suite was a wealthy and important person. In these circumstances, how likely would it be that they would make an issue of a sexual assault to them supervisors?
Housekeepers are generally among the lowest-paid workers at hotels, often earning little more than the minimum wage. It is a high turnover job, meaning that any individual housekeeper is likely to be viewed as easily replaceable by the management. If this housekeeper did not enjoy the protection of a union contract, is it likely that they would have counted on their supervisors taking their side against an important guest at the hotel? Would they have been prepared to risk their job to pursue the case?
We can never know how this particular woman would have responded otherwise – as, fortunately, they did have the protection of a union. However, it is likely that many similar assaults go unreported because the victims do not feel they can risk their jobs to pursue the case. They simply have to accept sexual harassment and even sexual assault as "part of the job".
There is a special irony to this situation given Dominique Strauss-Kahn's prior position. The IMF, along with other pillars of the economic establishment, has long pushed for reducing the rights of workers at their workplace. Specifically, they have pushed countries around the world to adopt measures that weaken the power of unions. The IMF has also urged western European countries to eliminate or weaken laws that prevent employers from firing workers at will. These laws, along with unions, are seen as "labour market rigidities" that prevent labour markets from operating efficiently.
In the dream world of the economists' textbook policies, all employers would have the ability to fire employees at will. There would be no protective legislation and no unions to get in the way. In that economist's dream world, then, powerful executives could be fairly certain that they would have licence to molest hotel workers with impunity.
We all know the indie flicks that deal with two teens falling in love and how they're basically a dime a dozen, throw-away films that are best enjoyed with a bucket of ice-cream and a box of tissues. They're annoying; they get in the way of good, decent films, and end up being ignored. However, what if you took the concept that has plagued many a bargain bin and closing-down sale and actually tried. A labour of love has brought the most worn-out plot and given it a whole new set of characters to play with. It's all done under Studio Ghibli so of course it's going to be easy on the eyes.
Set in Japan in the run up to the 1964 Olympic Games, the animated film, “From Up on Poppy Hill” is told from the perspective of Umi, a daughter who has lost their father to the Korean War and cares for the family with their sisters. They honour their father by raising signal flags for passing ships on their sea-side home. One day a poem appears in the newspaper, later revealed to be written by the love interest Shun. Shun is a boy at the school who is outspoken and brash, but their confidence hides their insecurities stemming from being an adopted child. Shun is also part of the school's newspaper team located in the clubhouse. The clubhouse is in danger of being demolished, and all the children help out to make it look new. From that, Shun's and Umi's relationship flourishes.
Now, I know what you're thinking. That is the most cliched plot I have ever laid my eyes upon. 99.9% of the time you would be right in assuming that this would turn out as a sappy, tired mess. However, common logic doesn't seem to apply to Director Goro Miyazaki. The story, which could have drivelled on like any Nicholas Sparks adaptation, edges its way along at just the right pace so there's sincerity without coming off as if it has been written by a teenager whose concept of love was almost entirely forged by rom-coms.
The banter between Umi and Shun seems genuine and evolves throughout the film so that the chemistry between the two can bring a smile to the face of even the most jaded cynic. Even given a twist that comes a bit out of nowhere, you still want them to succeed even if it does make things more than a little creepy. This is ultimately where the film's biggest strength lies. The characters are not over-the-top to the point where I laugh rather than battle the lump in my throat, and for a while that lump was winning. You really do care about the characters in this film. Everyone is given a distinct personality and isn't just relegated to “This is John Doe and they are here to spout exposition.” You care, you feel, and you empathise. This is a master class on how to write every type of character regardless of gender, age, or disposition.
The minor characters of a film are the foundation, which the main ones can develop off of, and this film certainly delivers on that front. The clubhouse in jeopardy is home to the various clubs and societies of the school. Within one tour of the place you find an abundance of peculiar strays that have found refuge in the love of chemistry, astronomy, philosophy etc. You find out the Astronomy Club is wearing away researching sunspots, even though they have absolutely no significant findings. Yet their passion for something that no one else cares about is uplifting and hilarious.
The film also has the lone philosophy scholar, who would happily discuss the inequities of man but can't master simple ideas like hygiene. They also have a feud with the Chemistry Club for constantly blowing their room up. They call them, “Third-rate alchemists.” It's little lines like this, given to characters who really don't forward the plot, that really give this film a personality of its own. Everyone seems to matter, no matter how insignificant.
For all the character development and the beautifully paced story-line that make this film, there is but one flaw that I found to be oddly irritating. The twist in the relationship between Shun and Umi is resolved in the space of about 40 minutes and is never mentioned once it's sorted out. This one glaring contrivance amidst a symphony for the senses throws it off just a touch, but the more I think about it, the more it annoys me. Don't get me wrong, the film is wonderful, but this one thing eating away at common sense drags it down to a slightly lower standing in the grand scheme of things.
In summary, “From Up On Poppy Hill” is a beautiful film in every sense oft they word. The animation is top-class as always from Studio Ghibli, and the story is sincere enough to save it from the world of teenage irrationality. With one minor flaw, it is merely like seeing a small imperfection on a perfectly sculpted figure. Please watch this; it will make anyone who views it unimaginably happy.

After years spent as one of the nation's most ardently liberal members of Congress, former Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) became a paid Fox News contributor at the start of this year, and on Sunday their new role cast them as a defender of the tea party, accusing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of engaging in “political targeting” ahead of a presidential election.
The IRS director voluntarily divulged this information during a Washington, D.C. speech on Friday, saying the agency was sorry for the actions of several employees in Cincinnati who closely examined groups with names containing the words “tea party” and “patriot” to see if they were violating their tax exempt status as non-political organizations.
Conservatives like columnist George Will and former Rep. Allen West (R-FL) spent most of Sunday making as much hay out of the IRS announcement as possible, and Kucinich was along for the ride on “Fox News Sunday.”
“I am a liberal Democrat,” they said. “I'm not someone who's celebrated tea party politics. But we cannot — this is not tolerable — we cannot have a condition in America where people's politics are the basis for IRS attacks.”
Confronted on whether the situation was “just a bureaucratic foul-up” by lower-level IRS employees, Kucinich balked. “The tone is set from the top,” they said. “That's the problem we have to look at here, the tone that's set. We are in a hyper-partisan, intensely partisan condition in Washington. The polarization is damaging to our country and we're seeing another symptom of it here.”
Asked by host Chris Wallace if what the IRS engaged in was “political targeting,” Kucinish replied: “How can it not be?”
To answer Kucinich's rhetorical question, groups like Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity, two of centers of gravity in the Republican Party, are also considered non-political, tax-exempt organizations by the IRS. As the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pointed out in a Federal Elections Commission complaint last July, these groups remain overtly political organizations at their core but retain tax-exempt status by carefully treading the line set in election law, which allows these groups to attack candidates or pending legislation, but not to ask for someone's vote.
There's also a troubling history of conservatives using nonprofits and shell companies to get around campaign finance laws, perhaps giving historical precedent for IRS agents to put tax-exempt groups with overtly political names under the spotlight.
The IRS, however, backed off conservative-leaning churches last year when pastors began openly engaging in Republican advocacy as a test of their “religious freedom,” so it wouldn't be surprising if that happened again here. Republicans on Capitol Hill are already gearing up for a series of House hearings about the agency's latest disclosure.

In addition to ushering in a tidal wave of new notebooks and mobile devices, Intel's Broadwell microarchitecture has also found its way into a plethora of recently introduced small form factor systems. We have already taken a look at a couple of them, like the excellent Intel NUC NUC5i5RYK and Gigabyte Brix S BXi7H-5500 The low-power characteristics of Broadwell simply make it well suited to the tight spaces and constrained thermal envelopes of small form factor systems. But another side benefit of Broadwell is that it also allows manufacturers to cram higher performing parts into the same (or smaller) spaces than previous-gen, Haswell-based parts.Take the Intel NUC5i7RYH we're going to show you here, for example.

The NUC5i7RYH's specifications are impressive considering the machine's size. There's a 5th-gen Core i7 CPU inside the rig (dual-cores, quad-threads) that can turbo up to 3.4GHz, Iris 6100 series graphics, support for dual-channel memory, M.2 and 2.5" SSDs, 802.1ac and USB 3.0.Like most other NUC systems, this particular model is a barebones unit, so it must be built up with a drive and memory before it can be used. It includes a processor, WiFi, the motherboard and enclosure, but you'll need RAM and storage. The NUC5i7RYH is one of the somewhat taller NUC systems that can accommodate both M.2 and 9.5mm 2.5 drives though, so you'll have plenty of flexibility when it comes to configuring your storage setup. Both the M.2 port and SATA port can be used simultaneously.Although we didn't receive a full-retail ready package, we should also mention that the Intel NUC5i7RYH includes a basic accessory bundle: there's some documentation, a VESA mount, and a power-brick in the box. Intel also includes an array of tips for the power adapter for multiple regions. Some previous NUC systems didn't even ship with power cords (they had to be bought separately, depending on the region), so Intel has solved that problem with this generation of NUC systems.
This story appears in the August 2017 issue of National Geographic magazine.
Even on the starriest of nights, the human eye sees just a tiny fraction of the cosmos. So if the curve of the Big Dipper or the four points of the Southern Cross appear magnificent, consider how many more phenomena must exist out of view.
That prospect is what led astronomer Natasha Hurley-Walker to a radio telescope deep in the outback of Western Australia. The telescope, called the Murchison Widefield Array, is made up of thousands of antennas that see through celestial dust and detect “radio light”—revealing colors and objects in a spectrum not visible to humans, even with the aid of optical telescopes like Hubble. Stretched across nearly four square miles of desert, the antennas—cheaper to produce and maintain than typical dishes—look like “an army of mechanical spiders,” they say.
In the past four years, Hurley-Walker and a team of researchers—from the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Perth as well as other institutions in Australia and New Zealand—have stitched together more than 40,000 images taken by the telescope.
The result is a groundbreaking portrait of the entire southern sky. It exposes hundreds of thousands of galaxies millions of light-years away. And it shows in unobscured, blazing color the radio glow of the Milky Way, lit up with the remains of exploded stars and intense magnetic fields. This sweeping survey, says Hurley-Walker, “allows people to see the sky with radio eyes.”
Them research is far from finished. Hurley-Walker is now working with an international team to develop a radio telescope many times bigger and more sensitive than the Murchison Widefield Array. Its technology could pick up fainter signals, which would unveil millions more galaxies and—if their wish comes true—“the birth of the very first stars.”
The CrossFit Games Open presents a truly exciting time of year for the CrossFitter, with the opportunity to push your physical and mental limits like never before. But sometimes, that means our bodies do the craziest things - like pee during a workout.
Do you guys remember this video?
Quite frankly, I found the concept amusing at first. So many times had I commiserated with others about double unders, heavy cleans, and the correct color of pants one should wear when faced with any potentially offending movement. But wait a minute - I've never had children (that's called being nulliparous, by the way). Why am I losing urine when things get tough? Does this happen to other nulliparous athletes? What about women who've had multiple children (multiparous) or abdominal surgeries? And why on earth is a gynecologist condoning that losing urine during exercise is okay?!
PERFORMANCE BOOST: In Pursuit of the Elusive Double Unders
It's Called: Stress Urinary Incontinence
In the video, Rory McKernan calls the condition exercise-induced urinary leakage. In science, we call it stress urinary incontinence (SUI). SUI is defined as an involuntary loss during coughing, sneezing, or physical exertion. In a 2001 study, scientists in Norway examined the prevalence of SUI in their elite female athletes.
Researchers studied almost 600 women from the Norwegian national team and found that, of the 87% who answered the survey, 26% of elite female athletes recalled instances of SUI. Additionally, 49% of those elite athletes were identified as having an eating disorder by the DSM-IV. Of those women, half of them had SUI.
The Anatomy Behind Peeing Yourself
The female pelvic floor (the basement) is made up of fascia, ligaments, and muscles that provide a “hammock” to the bladder and uterus. The endopelvic fascia is continuous with the visceral fascia of the trunk (that's the stuff that keeps your insides where they belong) and functions to encapsulate your organs and respond to changes in volume and displacement as you move.
LEARN MORE: The Top 5 Ways Fascia Matters to Athletes
The connective tissue of the endopelvic fascia supports the urethra, bladder, uterus, and cervix, extending into the diaphragm.
By this connection with the diaphragm and visceral fascia, changes in lung volume will increase pressure placed on these structures. This increase in intra-abdominal pressure is what we want when we take a big lift, securing our insides and providing support not only to them, but the lumbar spine.
The muscles that create the hammock are the levator ani (in red, to the right) and coccygeus, which are referred to collectively as the levator plate. When we are standing, these muscles lie on the horizontal and function just like a hammock supporting a person.
Weakness in these muscles may be due to a multitude of reasons: multiple vaginal births, multiple pregnancies, peripheral nerve injury during vaginal delivery, or generalized idiopathic weakness.
Clinically, I have seen women who have had one vaginal delivery without complication, and weakness in the levator ani due to substitution from the anal sphincter. This movement pattern dysfunction may lead to stress incontinence because the woman can't engage the basement and is instead using the posterior third of the levator plate.
When the levator plate does not function as one continuous group of muscles, the hammock on which the pelvic organs sit becomes weakened, and something not good is bound to happen - like falling out of a hammock.
RELATED: Spine Stabilization: How Your Core Should Be Working
How to Stop Peeing Yourself
To be continent (i.e. not pee on yourself), a person must have a quiescent (dormant) bladder, functioning musculofascial support, and a functional urethral sphincter. When a person is incontinent, either due to stress or urgency, one of these elements has failed.
In the case of SUI that we experience in CrossFit, it usually is due to weakness in the hammock and poor urethral sphincter control. Occasionally, there may also be a physiologic reason that a person is incontinent, at which point it is wise to seek out a gynecologist or urologist - one that believes peeing your pants isn't acceptable.
Like any other muscle group, we know if we train it for function, it will improve. If SUI is something that you are dealing with, laugh about it with your friends, but get it addressed. Pelvic floor muscle training with a women's health physical therapist is often the first line of treatment, followed by behavioral modification, and perhaps pharmaceutical intervention. Losing urine during a workout isn't okay, and isn't a badge of honor as to how hard you worked.

Banknote of 2014 - Press Release
Dennis Lutz & Robin Hill - IBNS Banknote of the Year Co-ordinators
The International banknote Society (IBNS) announces that its voting membership has for the first time ever selected the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago to receive it prestigious “banknote of the Year Award” for 2014. With over 130 new banknotes released worldwide in 2014, nearly 3 dozen were of sufficiently new design to be eligible for nomination. The 50 Dollar polymer Trinidad and Tobago note was followed in voting by the 5000 Franc note from the French Pacific Territories (Tahiti) and the 10 Dinar bill from Kuwait.
Now in its 54th year, the IBNS has over 2000 members worldwide. As a nonprofit educational organization its objectives are to promote, stimulate and advance the study, collection and dissemination of information related to paper money. From all significantly newly designed and widely circulated banknotes released in 2014, the IBNS membership nominated notes from 12 different countries to place on the ballot. Nominees represented three continents (Europe, Asia & Africa), the Middle East, and 4 island nations (2 in the Americas). Past “banknote of the Year” winners include Kazakhstan (2013, 2012, 2011), Uganda (2010), Bermuda (2009), Samoa (2008), Scotland (2007), Comoros (2006), Faeroe Islands (2005) and Canada (2004).
The 2014 winning banknote was produced collaboratively by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago and De La Rue Currency of England. It is the first Central Bank in the Caribbean to issue polymer currency. While the 50 Dollar award-winning bill fittingly commemorates the Central Bank's Golden Anniversary, “it is meant to be used for all your purchases, like you would any other money.” The note is virtually identical in size to United States bills with a face value of almost 8 U.S. Dollars, 7 Euros or 5 British Pounds at early May 2015 exchange rates.
The stunning design, predominantly gold in color, interprets an artist's rendering of a red hibiscus flower and truly striking image of a red capped cardinal bird in flight against the clear transparent polymer plastic window. The back of the note features a young female masquerader in an award-winning Carnival costume along with the Central Bank building. Modern polymer banknotes have enjoyed increasing popularity since their introduction in 1988. They offer durability as well as enhanced security features and have become a favorite of many collectors.

GRAHAM — Donald Lee Hamlett knew the way to their ex's heart was through their favorite band, Pearl Jam.
When a judge put a restraining order on Hamlett, 37, of 874 E. Market St., Burlington, in May — ordering Hamlett not to make direct or indirect contact with the woman — Hamlett penned a letter to Eddie Vedder, the band's frontman.
In the letter, Hamlett begged Vedder to reach out to their ex on Facebook or through the Internet and convince them to return, said Burlington police officer Michael Juarez.
Farfetched, but there are worse ideas: If there's a rocker today who empathizes with the common man and knows how to fight for a cause, it's Vedder — a 25-year veteran of benefit concerts and social causes.
The plan backfired when Hamlett neglected to attach the necessary postage for their pages-long screed.
The mail was marked return-to-sender, and through some happenstance, ended up at their ex's home. They contacted police, turning over the letter in which Hamlett allegedly admitted they were risking going to jail for attempting to make third-party contact with the woman.
That's just what happened. Burlington police placed Hamlett in custody Thursday night. They were being held without bond, per state law in domestic cases, until a hearing before a District Court judge. Their first appearance was scheduled for 11 a.m. Friday.

Lev Nussimbaum: from Eastern European Jew to Caucasian Muslim prince extraordinaire
Since the widespread Rachel Dolezal scandal, which involved an American woman claiming to be of African-American descent, discussions about cultural and ethnic appropriation have become increasingly heated and reconsidered. As controversial as the scandal may have been, it was certainly far from being anything new. There have been numerous cases throughout history where Europeans, for instance, have appropriated the cultures of others and misused them towards their own benefits and ambitions. When this occurs in relation to ‘Eastern' peoples, it is often accompanied, one may argue, by a heavy dose of Saidian Orientalism. As a Jewish native of the Caucasus with an Eastern Mizrahi upbringing, at one stage in my life I became particularly interested in the life of Lev Nussimbaum, an Ashkenazi Jew from Eastern Europe who posed as an ‘exotic' Muslim prince from Aran (renamed ‘Azerbaijan' in 1918) and to have documented their adventures under the pseudonym ‘Essad Bey', and later – according to American author Tom Reiss – ‘Kurban Said'. In their book The Orientalist, Reiss examines Nussimbaum's life, and how they shed their identity as a European Jew to become the famous Azerbaijani author. Under the pen name Kurban Said, Nussimbaum's work (as per Reiss' findings) became so popular that the love story Ali and Nino (currently being made into a film by director Asif Kapadia) came to be revered as the national novel of Azerbaijan.
Raised in Baku, Nussimbaum travelled across the Caucasus, the Middle East, and Central Asia whilst fleeing the Bolsheviks with their father. Later, the pair emigrated to Germany, and it was there that Lev crafted their identity as Essad Bey and wrote several books about the exotic peoples they claimed to have encountered earlier on. With hostility and hatred towards Jews on the rise, Nussimbaum fled the Gestapo for America, where they continued with their writings. Their works about the Caucasus, their childhood home of Azerbaijan, and Persia in some ways seemed to mirror the writings of William Walker Atkinson on India and South Asia. In a piece entitled American Orientalism, scholar and filmmaker Vivek Bald wrote about a former American lawyer and how they founded a publishing firm for books concerning Hinduism and spirituality. Like Nussimbaum, Atkinson wrote under several different Indian-sounding pseudonyms such as Yogi Ramacharaka, Swami Panchadasi, and others, in an effort to pander to European and American audiences. It has often been suggested that authors like Nussimbaum and Atikson exploited the Eastern traditions and cultures they wrote about for their own personal gain.
According to Bald, when ‘Oriental goods' started making their way to the West, many Europeans and Americans (particularly the former) with colonial attitudes began to appropriate ‘conquered' cultures and assert their dominance as superiors over the savage-yet-passionate Easterners. The undefined ‘Orient' became a sort of monolith through which Europeans could fantasise about ideas that might not have been acceptable in their own societies. Images of harems, belly-dancers, and the like often transformed into fantastical and erotic escapes; and, because they so sexualised Eastern peoples, it was not considered inappropriate to view them as unintelligent, backwards, and lustful.
It may be said that Nussimbaum, like others before and after him, assumed an ‘exotic' identity in an escapist attempt to shed what they considered ‘boring' or quotidian
In many ways, it could be said that Nussimbaum's view of the ‘East' played out in more or less the same way. In their book Twelve Secrets of the Caucasus, Essad Bey wrote about the various peoples inhabiting the region. Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Chechens, Georgians, Ossetians, Persians, and a host of others all provided rich subject matter for Nussimbaum. Written primarily for German readers, Nussimbaum often wrote about these peoples in a light much now might not deem particularly ‘rosy', and painted them in many instances as a wild bunch with a penchant for swindling, beastly rituals, and savagery. Like Iran to its south, Azerbaijan, though predominantly Shi'a Muslim today, is a country with a strong history of Zoroastrianism (azar meaning ‘fire' in Persian, and the name of the country referring to the Achaemenid satrap Atropates, ‘Protected by the Fire'). It is also known for its religious diversity, having been home to Eastern Christians and Jews for many centuries, if not millennia. According to Reiss, Nussimbaum was incredibly fascinated with Islam and the Arabic language, their infatuation leading them to ultimately convert officially in Berlin's Turkish Embassy. It could be said, possibly, that their conversion had an influence on the author's intentions with regard to their writings.
While Nussimbaum's conversion might certainly have been genuine, it could be argued that it gave them a rather false sense of validity. To me, the most peculiar thing about the enigmatic author was their encounter (whether it actually occurred or not) with the indigenous Mizrahi Jews of the region – the same group that I belong to. We speak a Jewish dialect (Judeo-Tat) of Tati, an Iranian language closely related to Persian. Being a Jew, Nussimbaum's writings on the Mizrahis of Dagestan and Azerbaijan should in theory, one could say, have been more familiar. However, it seems that Nussimbaum wrote even more harshly about them than any other group, as if in an attempt to distance themselves from their origins and further emphasise their new identity. Such efforts may come as striking, as Azerbaijanis and other Muslims of the region lived in relative peace with members of other religious communities. Amongst other things, Nussimbaum wrote that the native Jews practiced strange blood rituals with their Muslim neighbours, and that their women washed the feet of men with their hair, both of which ‘observations' have no historical basis or validity whatsoever. In a way, these sensual examples further evoke a sort of sexualised imagery about the practices of the region, far removed from its realities.
As Reiss posits in The Orientalist, Nussimbaum was at one point exposed as a fraud, and as such, had to change their pen name from Essad Bey to Kurban Said, such that they could regain some legitimacy for their writing. A sort of Orientalist Romeo and Juliet with similarities to other ‘Eastern' romances such as the Persian Khosrow and Shirin (in which the Zoroastrian Sassanid monarch Khosrow falls for the Christian Armenian princess Shirin), Ali and Nino tells the story of Ali, an Azerbaijani Muslim man, and Nino, a Christian Georgian woman, set in Azerbaijan, Iran, and other nearby countries. Reiss' assertion that Nussimbaum was Kurban Said cannot be taken for granted as a fact, as the relationship between the two is still being debated amongst scholars. Writers such as Betty Blair of Azerbaijan International, for example, are convinced that Kurban Said was in reality an Azerbaijani author by the name of Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli – a view also held by many Azerbaijanis. However, due to what many have claimed to be Orientalist overtones throughout the novel, as well as the presence of hot-headed characters acting on their ‘Caucasian' and ‘Asian' emotions, their obsession with revenge, and Ali's aggressiveness, others have rejected Blair's argument and instead hold Nussimbaum to be the more likely author amongst the two.
Regardless of whether or not Nussimbaum was Kurban Said, their life as Essad Bey is nonetheless interesting. Overall, their Orientalist tendencies, it could be argued, seemingly came from some sort of self-loathing and the desire to belong (to a greater degree) to the region they were raised in. As a Jew in the early-mid 20th century, it makes sense that there may have been other reasons (e.g. anti-Jewish hatred and the pogroms) for their desire to reject their European or Jewish identity; but, if they simply wished to save themselves from fascism, why were their writings so sensual, so egregiously incorrect and full of factual errors, and over-the-top with respect to the Orient? While the Jewish predicament certainly complicates the reasoning, it may be said that Nussimbaum, like others before and after him, assumed an ‘exotic' identity in an escapist attempt to shed what they considered ‘boring' or quotidian. Unfortunately, such newly-forged identities often turn out to be mere caricatures of those they strive to represent and their way of life.
“Every day, once a day, give yourself a present,” Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) tells Sheriff Harry Truman (Michael Ontkean) early on in the first season of Twin Peaks. “Don't plan it. Don't wait for it. Just let it happen. It could be a new shirt at the men's store, a catnap in your office chair, or two cups of good, hot black coffee.” Every self-respecting fan of the groundbreaking cult series knows this quote — in fact, it currently sits at the top of the Quotes section of its IMDb profile — but for good reason. It's a fair warning for anyone heading into Twin Peaks, a series that gives as much as it takes, as long as everyone's willing to do exactly as Coop suggests: wait and see.
Patience is hard to come by these days, which is why Twin Peaks: The Return still feels like such a gift. Yet, for an entire summer, showrunners David Lynch and Mark Frost stole Sunday night from every fan who tuned into Showtime each week. Never once did anyone have a clue what to expect, from its four-episode premiere on Sunday, May 21st right down to its two-episode finale on Sunday, September 3rd, and never once did anyone walk away truly underwhelmed. They may have been disappointed, or confused, or even aggravated, but there was rarely a moment that the series didn't stir up some kind of severe emotional response. It was event television … and totally by design.
“The original run of the show really benefited from the fact that nobody knew about ‘binging' back then,” Frost recently told Digital Spy. “To roll out the episodes one week after the other gave people time to digest and theorize and talk amongst themselves. The Internet has obviously enhanced that ability exponentially. I don't particularly enjoy binging myself… I steered us away from Netflix in this instance right from the start, because I didn't feel that was the right format to roll out this particular show. With Showtime, we were able to more or less replicate the original experience – one a week, take your time, think about it, write about it, talk about it, then come back for more.”
Granted, Twin Peaks: The Return was hardly the ubiquitous watercooler show that Showtime initially hoped for, but there was admittedly a select contingent of diehard fans that relished the show's mysterious glory online. For over three months, the series kept them in a tailspin as they theorized over every little detail through Reddit threads, Twitter debates, and in-depth podcast episodes. Once “Starring Kyle MacLachlan” materialized on the screen, it was as if every fan put on their Wire best, hitting the drawing boards with stickies, Post-it notes, and index cards at their disposal. Within hours, there were countless theories, memes, and hot takes, all to varying degrees of intrigue.
Then again, that was always going to happen with Twin Peaks. The series' faithful has carried the torch for over two decades, throwing annual festivals and publishing monthly gazettes, all during era when virtually nothing was happening in the franchise. So, it wasn't surprising to see such a reaction when The Return finally premiered last May. What was surprising was how Lynch and Frost were able to keep them in the dark from beginning to end. After all, mystery is as rare as patience in today's day and age, both are incredibly undervalued, which is why you get pedantic movie trailers and on-demand models are all the rage. Today belongs to the consumer, not the artist.
That logic has never worked for Lynch — or Frost, for that matter — which is why creative control was always going to be paramount for The Return. Let's not forget that the whole thing nearly collapsed on itself, back when Showtime initially balked at the idea of committing to 18 episodes as opposed to the original order of nine. To both parties' credit, Lynch and Frost held their ground, the network relented, and the rest is history. Or rather, the rest is now a testament to what happens when earned auteurs are left to their own devices, and are allowed to exercise their greatest strengths. Because, like “Part Eight”, The Return is one giant nuclear explosion of blistering ingenuity.
Where else could you find something as deeply disturbing as The Woodsmen? Or as emotionally satisfying as Big Ed and Norma's much-delayed embrace? Or as downright beautiful as the last three minutes of “Part 17”? What show featured 237 damn good performances from venerable actors and actores, ranging from Jim Belushi to Laura Dern, Matthew Lillard to Naomi Watts? Scratch that, what show had this much venerable talent from beyond the grave? For many, The Return was one last chance to wave goodbye to fallen heroes like Miguel Ferrer, Catherine E. Coulsen, Don S. Davis, and even the Thin White Duke himself, David Bowie. It was surreal, to say the least.
Even more surreal was how the show eerily echoed our own state of being. Despite the fact that Lynch and Frost toiled over the script years ago, The Return wound up saying more about 2017 than almost every other film or television show. In many ways, we were Agent Cooper/Dougie Jones, mutely stumbling around an American wasteland that's been ravaged by untenable evil. That image of them standing underneath the gunslinger statue at the end of “Part Five”, to the moody sounds of Johnny Jewel's “Windswept”, unconsciously captured the zeitgeist of 2017 America. Here's this beacon of hope and goodwill … standing alone and silent as darkness takes over.
There were a number of similar stirring moments throughout the 18-hour limited series. The aggressive expansion of the RR Diner, for one. That brilliant exchange between FBI Deputy Director Gordon Cole (Lynch) and Federal Bureau of Investigation Chief of Staff Denise Bryson (David Duchovny). Pretty much every time Diane Evans (Dern) confessed something to Cole and their team. But, above all, there was this unnerving notion that the evil that was once confined to the whispering woods had now taken over, and that it was the good of Twin Peaks that had receded to the Sycamores. It was a complete 180, but one that felt totally in line with everything going on in Trump's America.
Politics aside, there's still no disputing that The Return was a technical and logistical marvel. The fact that Lynch and Frost were able to successfully resurrect the cult franchise is still confounding. As we learned in 2016 with Chris Carter's fumbling of The X-Files revival, it doesn't matter how many original pieces you put back together, it's almost impossible to conjure up that magic again. But that's the thing: Lynch and Frost weren't interested in dusting off old potions. No, they were far more invested in the next thing, which meant pivoting the series into something both unexpected and supremely modern — and there wasn't a single person stopping them.
Every episode was written by Lynch and Frost and every episode was helmed by Lynch. There weren't any compromises, there weren't any hesitations, it was all unadulterated filmmaking. “It's a runaway train, but it's a beautiful trip,” Lynch recently told The Hollywood Reporter on the production of the series. “It's every day. Picture it, when you get there in the morning, it's like there's a giant ravine. And as you're working during the day, you're building a glass bridge. It's a delicate bridge and it's made of glass. And once you've got everything done for that day and it feels correct, boom, the glass turns to steel and you can cross over. And then you've got to do it again the next day.”
Even during would-be exit interviews, Lynch can't help themselves from crafting startling visuals. But, that's who they are, and that's what we got all summer with The Return. It was a Kafka-esque experience in a Kafka-esque year, and the type of event that will never be replicated again, even if they and Frost decide to reunite for a fourth go-around in the Pacific Northwest. Both haven't ruled out another strange and wonderful trip, and seeing how we waited over 25 years for this one, neither will the fans. But, in the meantime, there's still plenty to be mined from The Return, and one can expect more theories, takeaways, and impressions in the years to come. That's the real gift.
Now, if only we could all fit in the MoMa.
Microsoft said late Tuesday that it has added several new capabilities for OneNote for the Mac and iOS, including imported files from email and OneDrive for Business storage.
All of the improvements are aimed at continuing to make OneNote the digital framework for storing notes and other reference materials—and, not coincidentally, to do so as students begin thinking about back-to-school purchases of laptops and tablets.
OneNote users can use the software in a variety of ways, from crafting to-do lists to storing personal notes and files. In an academic environment, however, storing files digitally “handed out” by professors and aides could be a common use case.
Microsoft Notes can be dynamically reorganized with the new OneNote apps for Mac and iOS.
Instead of simply dumping the attachments into a folder, OneNote for Mac allows a PowerPoint deck to be dragged into the note itself, to be collated along with supplementary materials. Users can then open the deck in the OneNote app itself or in PowerPoint.
PDF files can be saved as a “printout” and annotated, as well. In addition, notes themselves can be saved in an email as a PDF—or, using a new feature for OneNote for Mac, they can actually be inserted into the message body itself.
For iPhone or iPad owners, another new feature is the ability to take a file attachment that's been emailed to them and open it in the OneNote app.
Both Mac and iOS owners can now pull formatted text from other sources and preserve the formatting in their own notes--a capability that can already be found in OneNote for the Windows platform. Both platforms can also access password-protected notes, which will “lock down” with the password re-enabled after moving to another app.
Mac and iOS users can also rearrange their notes on the fly. And, when they're all done, they can save their work to either their personal OneDrive or their OneDrive for Business.
A few days ago, Microsoft launched OneNote for the Kindle Fire, evidence that Microsoft is holding to CEO Satya Nadella's pledge to migrate its service across as many platforms as possible—even its historical rival, the Mac. But as Microsoft adopts a “challenger mentality,” each and every third-party platform becomes important.
BMW 750i Review New Zealand
Austrian Psychotherapist Alfred W Alder was the founder of the school of Individual Psychology and focused on humans feelings of inferiority. Among their list of achievements and contributions to the medical world; they coined the phrases ‘Inferiority complex' (a lack of self worth, self doubt or uncertainty) and ‘Superiority Complex' a psychological defense mechanism in which an attitude of superiority and ‘showing off' belies actual feelings of inferiority and failure – The latter being what I felt when I slipped in to the driver's seat of the new BMW 7 series 750i.
This plus 5m in length; luxury near limousine style sedan is definitely a kerbside statement. It shouts out premium class driving and looks like it should be parked outside plus 5-star accommodations. It has a style that flows and yet a presence that looks stoic. For the first time BMW have (strategically) used carbon fibre throughout the 7's body, making stronger and yet lighter – increased fuel economy and greater driving stability – I'm not so sure you need the ‘Carbon Core' badge on the door strut to remind you though.
The Driver's seat really is command central, they have virtually everything you need at your fingertips and with ‘Gesture control' you hardly even need that. Gesture Control is basically an unnecessary feature that you can't stop using. It can be set up for multiple uses but I'll explain its use under the music section. With your arm resting on the centre console, a simple twirl of your index finger will increase or decrease the volume and a ‘V' shaped stab will change the track – yes you can reach the controls on the wheel or the infotainment system but there is something intoxicating about doing it just by a gesture. Like I said, unnecessary but you'll want to do it – A lot.
The cabin is refined and full of high gloss materials but it's the little touches that made the difference to me. Leather backing to the gear paddles may not sound like much but believe me when I say you will notice it. Slip into the back seat Executive lounge and you immediately feel under-dressed (well I did anyway). You get the sense that you should be wearing a big brand named suit or something by an exclusive designer – rather than something from the Mall. Luxurious leather surrounds you and you are filled with the illusion (or in my case delusion) of power. You can control the front passenger seat (should you require more space or just want to be annoying), you have BMW's touch command centre in the armrest – watch TV, adjust the temperature, mess with the infotainment all from your removable tablet. Or switch it all off and look up through the Panoramic glass roof and bask in the ambiance of its 15,000 light elements.
At night things come even more alive. The Bowers and Wilkins stereo pumps its beautifully warm sound through illuminated speakers (the tweeters near the side view mirrors have a flower effect) and down dark country lanes the cars Laser lights take full effect – 600 metres of near daylight (vs 300m for LED).
The 750i has a 4.4L twin turbo V8 that effortlessly delivers 332kW's of power and over 650Nm of torque, it gets you to 100kph in under 5 seconds and gets you over that with barely a feather touch of the accelerator – and it does all of this with hardly a sound. There is no ferocity just a simple ‘you asked for power so here it is – fait accompli' approach, it's delicious.
A couple of months ago I spent some time giving it an enthusiastic drive through NZ's Northland, so I am perfectly aware of what this big car is capable of, it is a lot of fun on the open road. But one thing I would say is that (with lane keep option on) it has an adversity to crossing over white lines and will fight you to stay where you are – make sure you indicate when overtaking.
The BMW 7 series is elegant and self assured, it is a confident driving machine that is more than capable of backing up all that it says on the packet. So when I say I got behind the wheel of BMW's new 7 Series and the term ‘Superiority Complex' sprung to mind – I was Not thinking about the car – I was of course referring to me!

Anthony Martial to Manchester United: What you need to know
Monaco's Anthony Martial is closing in on a move to Manchester United
After Manchester United make a big-money move for 19-year-old Monaco forward Anthony Martial, we take a look at the youngster's credentials.
United have signed Martial on an initial four-year deal and the £36m Sky sources understand they have paid for their services makes them the most expensive teenager in football history.
What qualities will they bring to Louis van Gaal's side? Which players has they learnt from and who do they remind people of? And what about their weaknesses?
Here we assess their abilities with quotes from the player and those who know them best…
So who is he?
Martial is a 19-year-old French forward who played in Lyon's academy, making three appearances for their first team, before switching to Monaco in 2013 in a £3.6m move.
After a quiet first season, Martial enjoyed a better time of it under new coach Leonardo Jardim last time out, scoring 11 goals in all competitions.
Notably, they were part of the Monaco side that eliminated Arsenal from the Champions League – particularly impressing in the 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium.
Martial impressed against Hector Bellerin and Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium
What are their strengths?
First and foremost, there is their astonishing pace, a trait highlighted by UEFA in their technical report for the 2013 European Under-21 Championship at which Martial was named in the team of the tournament.
Former Monaco chief executive Tor-Kristian Karlsen expanded on these qualities on Twitter, highlighting Martial's "smart movement, excellent close control and overall technical ability", while praising their ability to make "everything look simple" on the pitch.
Martial has pace in abundance and has a reputation as a composed player
Karlsen added that Martial is "surprisingly composed in front of goal for such a young player" and that's reflected in the fact that they are "very strong in one-versus-one situations".
What are their weaknesses?
It wasn't all positives from Karlsen. "On the flip side there are issues about consistency, ability to impose themselves physically and possibly a certain lack of determination," they wrote on Twitter.
Martial improved under Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim last season
That would appear to be backed up by the views of former Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri who worked with Martial during the teenager's difficult first season at the club.
"He is a great youngster with a great future, but they must change their mind-set," the Italian told a press conference in 2013. "Sometimes the French mentality is, 'Today I play well, maybe I'll play well tomorrow'. No, you must work hard to do your best every day."
Martial's performances with France's age-group teams caught the eye
Can they be compared to anyone?
Martial had the chance to work with former United striker Radamel Falcao during their time together at Monaco and also regarded Newcastle striker Emmanuel Riviere as a player to look up to at the club.
"I try to learn from Falcao, and Manu Riviere as well - their movement is excellent - it's really good for me," Martial told BeIN Sport. "I need to work on my movement and my finishing, but seeing these guys on a regular basis gives me a benchmark."
In action against Juventus in the Champions League last season for Monaco
However, it's the comparisons with another man who made the journey from Monaco to the Premier League that will really encourage United supporters. Karlsen has claimed that Martial "can in some way be reminiscent of a young Thierry Henry".
It's not the first time that the two players have been mentioned in the same breath. "If I managed to win as much as they did, frankly, that would be amazing," Martial themselves has said of the comparisons in the past. United fans can but hope.

A few years ago CNN was attacked for featuring me as a regular on-air commentator. Legitimate extremists, on the other hand, are repeat guests and it never never seems to bother the anti-white hordes.
For instance, CNN regularly features the Jewish Supremacist Tim Wise, who once called on their followers to murder members of the TEA Party. Tim Wise says that Jesus Christ is a symbol of “white supremacy” and “genocide.”
Wise stated, “The image of a white Jesus has been used to justify enslavement, conquest, colonialism, the genocide of indigenous peoples. There are literally millions of human beings whose lives have been snuffed out by people who conquered under the banner of a white god.”
Tim Wise is an extreme left-wing Cultural Marxist. Despite living in a ritzy all white neighborhood in Nashville, one of America's whitest metro areas, they constantly spew venom at white people. On November 5th, 2012, they even publicly called on their followers to murder members of the Florida TEA Party. Despite their public call for murder, CNN continues to put them on the air. Tim Wise writes books saying that white people make too much money and should share with black people. Wise, who has made a fortune with this schtick, is substantially wealthier than most Americans of any race. Apparently, sharing your money with black people is only for the little guys!
More recently, Tim Wise spoke at Indiana University. Before their speech several of their fanatical supporters turned violent and attacked a group of protesters with pepper spray and other weapons. Police apprehended one of the thugs and charged them with a felony.

The U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has temporarily reversed its earlier order that call records collected by the National Security Agency should be destroyed after the current five-year limit.
The court modified its stand after a District Court in California on Monday ordered the government to retain phone records it collects in bulk from telecommunications carriers, as the metadata could be required as evidence in two civil lawsuits that challenge the NSA's phone records program under section 215 of the Patriot Act.
The conflicting directives from federal courts put the government in "an untenable position" and are likely to create confusion and uncertainty among all concerned about the status of the data collected over five years ago, Reggie B. Walton, presiding judge of the FISC, wrote in their order on Wednesday.
It is appropriate for the District Court rather than the FISC to decide what telephone metadata would be required as evidence in the civil suits, they added.
In view of the restraining order by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, hearing the two civil cases, the Department of Justice filed Tuesday for temporary relief from a FISC order on Friday to destroy the phone data within the five-year limit.
District Judge Jeffrey S. White of the California court had issued a temporary restraining order that the call data should be retained as evidence after the government informed plaintiffs and courts hearing civil cases against the NSA program that in line with the FISC order, it would start destroying the records on Tuesday in the absence of a court order to the contrary. A hearing on whether the District Court order should continue is set for March 19.
Judge Walton had on Friday denied a DOJ motion for relief from the current five-year limit for holding the data, citing privacy interests and the absence of any preservation order from a court or the indication of a request from a plaintiff for the retention of the phone data.
The data preserved beyond five years cannot be accessed by NSA intelligence analysts for any purpose, and can only be accessed by technical personnel for ensuring continued compliance with the government's preservation obligations, Judge Walton wrote in their revised order.
The government will have to give prior notice to the surveillance court if any further access to the data is required for civil litigation, and also notify it of a resolution in the temporary restraining order proceedings in the California court, they added.

That was one of the first statements that bell hooks made during the panel, “Whose Booty Is This?” at the New School in New York. hooks and the women on the panel (including Anna Czarnik-Neimeyer, Lynnee Denise and Stephanie Troutman) spoke about the new obsession in the media with booty, and female sexuality in pop culture as a whole.
“One of the reasons we've moved from the pu**y to the butt–the ass, the booty–is that it flips that so that it's no longer about who has rights in the female body, but who has access to the female body.”
The panel spoke openly about women in media today and the craze over the butt. Nowadays, many notable women willingly expose their assets to the world to show that they are sexually liberated. But hooks questions if that's the case. Beyoncé was a big topic in this discussion and throughout a majority of the panel.
“This continues to be somewhat of a crisis within feminist thinking, the inability to name what we mean when we talk about feminist liberatory sexuality. And one of the things that we see, and if I were critiquing Beyoncé on this, is the collapse of hedonistic sexuality with the notion that it's liberating. If I'm a woman and I'm sucking somebody's d**k in a car and they're coming in my mouth and we can be in one of those milk commercials, or whatever, is that liberatory because I might be the person initiating that? Or is it really part of the tropes of the existing, imperialist, white supremacist, patriarchal capitalist structure of female sexuality?”
hooks touched on the idea of sexual freedom again later on in the panel.
“They can exercise control and make lots of money, but it doesn't necessarily equate with liberation. Most of us are pretty intoxicated with money and with making money and I really feel strongly that even with Beyoncé, even with all their talent, their looks and everything, people wouldn't be so into them if it wasn't that she's also so rich. And the fact that she's young and so, so, so wealthy so, so, soon, is as seductive as the booty, if not more so. There are a lot of booties out there that are glamorous, but not connected to the fantasies of wealth — and we equate wealth so much with freedom.”
They also touched on the image of today's stars on the cover of magazines and on TV and what messages their looks give off. They wear the long weaves, the blonde hair and the contoured noses, and hooks wondered whether or not these same women would be embraced if they embraced more natural looks.
“Can we imagine Beyoncé with their dreadlocks, moving the heart and soul of all the white people who claim to be so moved? Or is it that part of what they're moved by, is their own kind of self-effacement and abjection that is always there?
Try to imagine them with some nappy dreads or some nappy hair up there swinging and dancing. And think, would they have the money they have in this culture? Is there a kind of blackness that isn't sellable or marketable?”
hooks also said that they wish more images would be put out there that are varied and display different experiences and looks for our young girls and women.
“I'm not lifted up by the image of [Laverne Cox on the cover of Time] or Beyoncé lifted up on the white magazines and the way they've been dressed and the way they look. I don't look at those images and feel lifted up. Whereas when I go to the Carrie Mae Weems show and I see particularly the section on “Roaming” in Italy, I'm lifted up. I'm more than lifted up, I'm carried away…I wish for black girls and black teenage girls that those images were as accessible to them as the images of pop culture that are limited in their vibrancy and even in their beauty. Because a lot of times it's a lot of reproduction of the same. That's one of the things that struck me about “Anaconda.” I was like, this sh*t is boring. I have seen it in the first couple of shots and I kept calling people like, ‘What does it mean?' Is there something that I'm missing that's happening here?'”

Last week's tentative agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme sparked a great deal of debate in the US, with the Obama administration and its critics in congress haggling over a “good deal” or a “bad deal”. Others have highlighted the differences between the American fact-sheet, released by the White House on the key parameters of the deal, and an Iranian version.
But Iran has also opened up, allowing public discussions to an unprecedented degree between those who believe the Iranian negotiating team are on the right track and others who say they are not telling the full truth. Iran's state TV, which raised eyebrows as it broadcast Barack Obama's speech live in the immediate aftermath of the Lausanne preliminary agreement, has grilled the country's foreign minister over the issues that have been mentioned by the US but downplayed at home. Other Iranians have scrutinised the US fact-sheet in public almost line by line.
One person stands out among those in Iran who want an end to the long-standing dispute over the country's nuclear activities. Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor of political science at Tehran University, has become a familiar face in Iran for their passionate and daring debates with hardliners on national television and radio or at roundtables hosted by various institutes, in which they publicly challenge the state line on many sensitive topics. In the absence of serious political dissidents, who are either silent after the 2009 crackdown or still in jail, Zibakalam singlehandedly fills the space of an entire opposition.  They are an outspoken critic still being tolerated by the ruling establishment. They made headlines last year when they said they recognise Israel because the UN recognises it as a state.
And earlier this week, Zibakalam went head-to-head with a conservative member of the parliament, Hamid Rasaei, their usual sparring partner in such discussions, talking about the pros and cons of the outcome of the latest negotiations in Switzerland. After so many similar appearances, the two have become familiar with each other's talking points and often exchange comments referring to their previous sessions. Nevertheless, they are popular and touch on issues considered taboo for a long time. Zibakalam's Facebook page has attracted more than 350k likes. They clearly live up to their name, which means “eloquent speaker” in Persian.
Monday's discussion between the two, held at the Young Journalist Club in Tehran, was remarkable as they locked horns over the recent negotiations. Zibakalam made clear that in their view the political understanding reached in Lausanne was a defining turning point in the history of the Islamic republic. “Some events are considered as turning points in a country's political life, for example Iran before the revolution and Iran after the revolution,” they said. “I believe Lausanne will become one of these turning points for Iran.” Iranians have had good reasons for having deep suspicion of the US, as a recent Intercept article study, but Zibakalam said for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution, the Iranian establishment, or at least some of its factions, is studying whether Iran and the US can overcome that mistrust.
Rasaei, in their part, rejected President Hassan Rouhani's comments that the Lausanne agreement was a win-win outcome. “Even illiterates, hawkers, or even taxi drivers in Iran know that a decision is up to them [Obama]... Not only we did not win, but we were defeated.” Zibakalam fired back by saying that Rasaei's problem with the talks does not stem from the details of an agreement but from their ideology, accusing them and their sympathisers of making a career out of anti-Americanism and anti-imperialism. “You give that away from these people and they have nothing to say,” Zibakalam said.
In their defence of the efforts to end the nuclear dispute, Zibakalam went so far as to questioning the establishment over its obsession with the nuclear programme. “I asked [senior negotiator] Aragchi what would you have to say to your grandchild if they come to you in 30 years time and asks you what did you gain in return for spending so much on the nuclear programme?” Zibakalam argued that the programme, especially the enrichment cycle, was not cost-effective for Iran. “How many people work for our atomic agency, how much budget does it have? [Compare that] to the money designated for our health, this is the real issue.”
Rasaei attacked Zibakalam for questioning the nuclear programme, saying it symbolises Iran's struggle for independence today. “Mr. Zibakalam, why did you go to jail [under the late Shah's rule]?” Rasai asked, trying to remind the professor of their revolutionary past. Zibakalam did not hesitate to respond: “I went to jail for democracy, so that we wouldn't have political prisoners in the future, so that we wouldn't have [opposition leaders] placed under house arrest.” Zibakalam, who has been critical of the situation of human rights in Iran, was referring to the house arrest of opposition leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi.
A high point in their debate was when Zibakalam said the world is suspicious of Iran over its anti-Israel bellicose. “Brazil, Argentina and India all have nuclear programme but Iran is the only country which has announced it wants to destroy Israel... who has given us the duty to destroy Israel?” Zibakalam said. “Israel has never said it wants to destroy us ... Even Palestinians recognise Israel. We are more catholic than the pope.”

The Venezuelan Supreme Court has ruled that a decree issued by President Nicolas Maduro last week declaring a state of emergency is constitutional.
The decree gives Mr Maduro extra powers to deal with Venezuela's economic crisis, including the right to impose tougher security measures.
The opposition-controlled parliament rejected the decree on Tuesday.
But the Supreme Court, which rarely rules against the government, said the decree was justifiable.
The court upheld the decree because of what it called "the extraordinary social, economic, political, natural and ecological circumstances that are gravely affecting the national economy."

What has gone wrong in Venezuela?
On Friday, President Maduro declared a state of emergency for 60 days, accusing the business elite of boycotting the economy and the United States of plotting a coup against their socialist government.
In measures published in the government gazette on Monday, the armed forces and local committees now have powers to distribute and sell food.
Authorities will also be allowed to cut the working week in the private sector, as they have done in the public sector, to conserve electricity.
The new measures also allow the government to take control of basic goods or services, which analysts say opens the way to the expropriation of companies.
Opposition calls
The opposition has rejected the new measures and is pushing for a referendum to removed Mr Maduro from power.
They began the process two weeks ago by handing in a petition signed by 1.85m people.
But Venezuela's Vice-President Aristobulo Isturiz has ruled out the possibility of a recall referendum against Mr Maduro.
Many Venezuelans blame Mr Maduro for the economic crisis the country is experiencing.
Its economy contracted by 5.7% last year and is expected to shrink further this year. Inflation is at 180%, according to official figures, and there are shortages of medicines and basic food items.
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Yanick Djouzi Manzizila broke a 60-year-old Swedish scoring record with 21 goals in a game but they won't be added to their season tally after their demoralised opponents quit the league.
The 25-year-old forward scored almost at will for Kongo United as they beat Balrog Botkyrka Sodertaelje - who had three players sent off - 30-0 in their division seven league clashes.
“I'd scored 12 goals against them previously so I knew there was a chance to score a lot of goals,” Manzizila told the Sportbladet newspaper.
With twin brother Alex as playmaker, and facing eight players by the end of the match, Manzizila had it all too easy against a team that had failed to earn a point all season.
Swedish football historian and statistician Claes-Goran Bengtsson confirmed that 21 goals in a game was a Swedish record, but the gloss was taken off Manzizila's achievement when Balrog subsequently withdrew from the league.
Their decision means the 21 goals will be chalked off - as will all the team's results for the season - although Manzizila's individual scoring record will stand.
“There's not much that can be done about it,” Manzizila said on receiving the news that their goals wouldn't count towards their season target.
“I'll have to be happy with the fact that I broke (the record) and continue to focus on scoring a hundred goals instead.”

Uncategorized Coinbase Announces 2018 SegWit Support As Third ‘Engineering Priority'
Largest US cryptocurrency wallet and exchange Coinbase has confirmed it “plans” to support SegWit transactions in 2018.
SegWit Follows Security, Performance As Top Priority
In a blog post on Friday, the company's vice president Dan Romero confirmed the timeframe, despite noting that SegWit, as a “new feature,” was only Coinbase's third priority. In the post, published on Medium, Romeo wrote:
In terms of our engineering priorities, securely storing customer funds remains our top priority. […] Our next priority is to ensure that our platform remains performant during periods of peak volume. Following security and performance, we are focused on adding new features for our customers.
Coinbase bore the brunt of a huge influx of new users in recent weeks, which accompanied Bitcoin's surge in value to $18,000.
Technical infrastructure struggled to cope, leading to downtime and delays processing transactions which had also occurred during Bitcoin's lesser upshoot earlier this year.
Hey @Coinbase, if Segwit isn't even in the top 5 list of things your customers want, then why is "When is Segwit being implemented" the 2nd most popular question about Coinbase sent to the media? https://t.co/ayMCyl8Ug0 — I, Troll[dragonmint] (@brian_trollz) December 15, 2017
Legacy Providers Catch Up To SegWit
Despite facing criticism over its SegWit adoption, as well as its stance on the now-defunct SegWit2x hard fork, Coinbase appears to be maintaining its laissez-faire attitude to implementing the technology, which would give significant savings on fees to users among other advantages.
“Many of our customers have been asking for SegWit, and we're working out a way to implement this upgrade safely,” Romero continued.
The Coinbase platform stores billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on behalf of its customers and Romero notes that any changes to the platform's infrastructure require “significant planning and consideration for the security and stability of our platform.”
Coinbase meanwhile is not alone in its slow path to SegWit adoption. This week, fellow stalwart wallet provider Blockchain.info unveiled full support for the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, while similarly pushing back SegWit interaction until next year.
“In 2018 we will be rolling out support for SegWit within our wallet products,” its own blog post confirmed last month. In the post, Blockchain.info stated:
This will be a major and complex update to some of the most sensitive parts of our codebase, across a wide variety of platforms and devices, affecting billions in user transactions with potentially significant privacy implications.

President Obama approved a final spurt of spending Tuesday to shore up the sluggish recovery, signing into law a $26 billion plan to save the jobs of thousands of teachers and other government workers. The measure brings total direct federal spending on the economy to nearly $1.2 trillion since the nation descended into recession in late 2007.
With economic growth faltering and unemployment stuck at 9.5 percent, some economists are urging additional action. But senior Democrats and administration officials said the package of state aid is likely to be the last major effort at economic stimulus -- at least until after November congressional elections, for which the soaring national debt has become a major issue.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), determined to demonstrate a commitment to fighting job losses, summoned lawmakers back from their August vacation for an unusual one-day session to vote on the package. Democrats argued that it would preserve the jobs of more than 300,000 workers by helping state governors plug their own budget holes.
"We can't stand by and do nothing while pink slips are given to the men and women who educate our children and keep our communities safe," Obama said at a Rose Garden news conference, flanked by Education Secretary Arne Duncan and two public school teachers.
Republicans derided the measure as a handout to teachers' unions, a key Democratic constituency, and argued that it would be no more successful at promoting a robust economy than the massive stimulus package Obama signed shortly after taking office in January 2009.
"This is a bailout. This is another bailout. . . . Let's not do this!" Rep. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.) yelled during House debate. "We're facing almost a $1.5 trillion budget deficit. America, please, please wake up. And remember in November."
In the Washington area, where budget troubles have forced school boards to freeze salaries, trim programs or cut staff, the bill would provide about $70 million for the District, $450 million for Maryland and $540 million for Virginia, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Maryland's schools superintendent, Nancy S. Grasmick, said the "money will be helpful" in reducing class sizes and rehiring reading teachers and other specialists.
In a midday vote, the House approved the bill 247 to 161, with all but two Republicans voting no. The measure would provide governors with an additional six months of federal assistance: $10 billion for education and about $16 billion for Medicaid, which will allow them to avoid shifting cash away from other priorities.
The sum is about half what Obama requested. Democratic leaders were forced to scale back the package by rank-and-file Democrats concerned about how more spending would play with angry voters. They also had to cover the cost of the measure so that it would not increase future deficits. The bill includes nearly $10 billion in new taxes on U.S. multinational corporations that do business abroad, and it rescinds after 2014 an increase in food stamp payments enacted in last year's $862 billion stimulus package.
That measure was by far the largest attempt by the federal government to stimulate economic activity. It was not the only such measure enacted to combat the recent recession, however. A $170 billion package, composed mainly of tax cuts, was enacted in 2008 under President George W. Bush, and other measures have been approved under Obama, including multiple extensions of long-term unemployment benefits and the "Cash for Clunkers" auto program.
All told, according to a recent paper by economists Alan S. Blinder of Princeton University and Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics, Congress has authorized more than $1 trillion in fiscal stimulus. Rescue efforts for the financial system, including the Troubled Assets Relief Program and actions by the Federal Reserve, are not included. The authors -- supporters of the stimulus -- estimate that the ultimate cost to taxpayers for all federal actions in response to the recession will be around $1.6 trillion.
Despite those expenditures, the economy continues to struggle. The prospect of layoffs or tax increases by state officials who are almost uniformly required to balance their budgets remains a major worry. The package approved Tuesday represents less than a quarter of the $116 billion shortfall that states face over the next two years, according to the National Governors Association. "This isn't plugging the hole. This is helping to transition," said David Quam, NGA director of federal relations.
Schools have been particularly hard hit. With the start of school just a few weeks away, class sizes have been on the rise across the country, school bus routes have been cut and a plethora of programs, including summer school, arts, physical education, and health and counseling services, have been slashed. Some school systems even trimmed the length of the school year to make ends meet. As of this month, it remained unclear exactly how many workers had been let go.
By voice vote, the House also approved a $600 million bill to shore up surveillance and security along the troubled U.S.-Mexico border. Senate leaders said they could return to Washington to push that measure to final passage as soon as next week.
About 70% of the tools I use in my practice are found at thrift stores or garage sales. It's a thrill finding just the perfect thing without even knowing you were looking for it. My significant other and I go on bi-weekly trips to our local Salvation Army, and on one of these visits we stumbled across this cool spice cabinet. Knowing it would be perfect for my kitchen craft and because they love the aesthetic, my SO bought it for me.
When we got home I cleaned it, cleansed it, and began transforming it into my kitchen altar. The altar sits inside a tall, skinny cabinet in the corner of my kitchen. I color code all of my ingredients so my family and I can quickly identify if something is edible or not. The symbol on the inside of the right door is my personal sigil which came to me in a mediation. The other symbol (not the pentacle) is a sigil I made for protecting anything from all forms of harm.
On top I keep a strip of green cloth to represent earth, a quartz crystal I use for casting circles, a walnut for protect, a birch branch to represent Frigg, and two pieces of fossilized wood.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Monday unveiled a grand plan to clean up the French capital, putting teeth into the campaign by stepping up enforcement operations.
The city will be "uncompromising with those who sully the public space," they said, addressing one of the main complaints of residents and tourists alike.
The Socialist mayor said the squad of police handing out fines -- dubbed the "incivility brigade" -- will be increased by 50 percent by mid-2018.
The City of Light, which will learn in September whether it will host the 2024 Olympic Games, will invest 22 million euros ($24 million) in new street cleaning equipment, they said.
Another 1.5 million euros is earmarked for pest control.
Teams will carry out an evening sweep in addition to the morning garbage collection rounds, the mayor said.
Seven mobile teams will circulate to keep key areas clean, notably tourist sites.
According to city records, 33,000 people were fined in 2015 for offences such as littering, stamping out cigarettes in the street and dumping, paying 68 euros each.
The number rose to 37,000 last year.

Dejan Lovren has declared that Liverpool are Premier League title contenders but reckons that their great rivals Manchester United are not.
The Reds currently sit third in the table with just goal difference keeping them off the summit behind Manchester City and Arsenal.
Jurgen Klopp's side have taken 23 points from their opening 10 games – nine points better off than they were at the same stage last season.
However, despite presiding over the most expensively-assembled football squad in history, Jose Mourinho is languishing in eighth place with United – eight points off the pace.
The sides played out a dour goalless stalemate at Anfield last month but Lovren reckons that individual high-profile clashes alone won't settle the major issues this term.

They told Sportske Novosti: “Everyone started to respect us more, Liverpool is a title contender.
“Everything is positive, but it is still early, and a lot of big clubs chase the title too.
“I am not sure Manchester United will recover in time and join the race, but you never know.
“The title will be decided in ‘smaller' games, not derbies.”

First of all, good news, MirBSD is not vulnerable to The Heartbleed Bug due to my deliberate choice to stick to an older OpenSSL version. My inquiry (in various places) as to what precisely could leak when a vulnerable client connected to a nōn-vulnerable server has yet to be answered, though we can assume private key material is safe.
Now the bad news: while the CA I use¹ and a CA I don't use offer free rekeying (in general), a CA I also use occasionally² refuses to do that. The ugly: they will not even revoke the certificates, so any attacker who gained your key, for example when you have been using a certificate of theirs on a Debian system, will be able to use it (e.g. to MITM your visitors traffic) unless you shell over lots of unreasonable money per certificate. (Someone wrote they got the fee waived, but others don't, nor do I. (There's also a great Twitter discussion-thingy about this involving Zugschlus, but I won't link Twitter because they are not accessible to Lynx users like me and other Planet Debian authors.)
① I've been using GoDaddy privately for a while, paid for a wildcard certificate for *.mirbsd.org , and later also at work. I've stopped using it privately due to current lack of money. ② Occasionally, for nōn-wildcard gratis SSL certificates for HTTP servers. Startcom's StartSSL certificates are unusable for real SSL as used in SMTP STARTTLS anyway, so usage isn't much.
Now I've got a dilemma here. I've created a CA myself, to use with MirBSD infrastructure and things like that — X.509 certificates for my hosts (especially so I can use them for SMTP) and possibly personal friends (whose PGP key I've signed with maximum trust after the usual verification) but am I using a StartSSL certificate for www.mirbsd.org as my GoDaddy wildcard certificate expires in a week or so (due to the asupervisorstioned monetary issues), and I'd rather not pay for a limited certificate only supporting a single vhost. There is absolutely no issue with that certificate and key (only ever generated and used on MirBSD, only using it in Apache mod_ssl). Then, there's this soon-to-be tax-exempt non-profit society of public utility I'm working with, whose server runs Debian, and which is affected, but has been using a StartSSL certificate for a while. Neither the society nor I can afford to pay for revocation, and we do not see any possible justification for this especially in the face of CVE-2014-0160. I expect a rekey keeping the current validity end date, and would accept a revocation even if I were unable to get a new certificate, since even were we to get a certificate for the society's domain from someplace else, an attacker could still MITM us with the previous one from Startcom.
The problem here is: I'd really love to see (all of!) Startcom dropped from the global list of trustworthy CAs, but then I'd not know from where to get a cert for MirBSD; Globalsign is not an option because I will not limit SSL compatibility to a level needed to pass their “quality” test… possibly GoDaddy, ISTR they offer a free year to Open Source projects… no idea about one for the society… but it would solve the problem of not getting the certificates revoked. For everyone.
I am giving Startcom time until Friday after $dayjob (for me); after that, I'll be kicking them off MirBSD's CA bundle and will be lobbying for Debian and Mozilla to do the same.
Any other ideas of how to deal with that? I'd probably pay 5 € for a usable certificate accepted by people (including old systems, such as MSIE 5.0 on Win2k and the likes) without questioning… most of the time, I only serve public content anyway and just use SSL to make the NSA's job more difficult (and even when not I'm not dealing with any payment information, just the occasional login protected area).
By the way, is there any way to access the information that is behind a current-day link to group.google.com with Lynx or Pine? I can't help but praise GMane for their NNTP interface.
ObFunfact: just when I was finished writing this wlog entry, I got a new eMail “Special offer just for you.” from GoDaddy. Sadly, no offer for a 5 € SSL certificate, just the usual 20-35% off coupon code.
As reported last week, Cook & Collins has closed. Spare Key, the under-the-radar craft cocktail bar on the second floor, is temporarily closed for remodeling but will reopen the evening of Wednesday, February 17.
Subdued Cook & Collins was a tricky proposition for bar-centric Midtown. However, the two men who plan to open a new restaurant there think they have a concept that will work for the area.
Keith Doyle and chef Adam Puskorius have joined forces to create Stoked Tacos & Tequila. Puskorius went to college at the University of Houston, and helped open a Chicago location of Eddie V's steakhouse. While there, they were inspired by Big Star, an open-air taco place. It's the most casual of the restaurants owned by star chef Paul Kahan's One Off Hospitality Group.

“There's a lot of foot traffic in Midtown, which you don't see in Houston a lot,” said Puskorius. “So I felt like it would be a good spot. We're definitely going to put our own spin on it, though.”
Stoked Tacos & Tequila will have a Day of the Dead theme, as exemplified by the logo shown here. Logo courtesy of Stoked Tacos & Tequila
They're in the process of remodeling the space to give it a more open patio. Puskorius said, “We're ripping [the patio coverings] out, getting all-new patio furniture and brightening it up. We're going to whitewash the brick a little bit and have some cool new signage going up.” Doyle said they got “a big arrow” sign for Stoked, and a new Spare Key sign is going up on the outside of the building.
Doyle also said the building will be repainted and string lights will be installed. Overall, it sounds as if Stoked Tacos & Tequila will be a brighter, more colorful space than it was before. In addition to a dine-in restaurant, Stoked Tacos & Tequila will feature a to-go window to serve passersby who just want a quick bite on busy nights.
Spare Key's Chris Frankel will effectively be acting beverage director although there will be bartenders downstairs as well to keep up with the crowd.
The change in ownership may actually be the best thing ever to happen to Spare Key. With no sign out front, the cocktail bar in its stripped-down setting had a subtle existence as a hidden gem. While that's all well and good for patrons in the know, it's not so great for creating a bustling bar environment.
Doyle and Puskorius are already in the process of upgrading Spare Key's aesthetics and visibility, which is why the bar is closed until next week. “We didn't want to mess with Spare Key too much because Chris [Frankel] is doing such a good job there. We had a meeting and brainstormed, not on rebranding it, but to give it a little facelift. We met with the designers and got a really good idea on what to do with that spot. Chris seems super-pumped about it.”
As far as the food goes, Doyle and Puskorius say the focus will be local and organic. They are planning to source ingredients from purveyors in the area that include Gundermann Acres, Atkinson Farms, Black Hill Meats, Covey Rise Farm and Vital Farms for eggs.

On the menu: tortillas made fresh in-house, pork tacos al pastor, tacos filled with grilled Mexican cheese and avocado pico de gallo, braised beef red mole short rib tostadas and ancho chile barbecue rub smoked brisket tacos.
Of course, anyone who has hung around Midtown on a Friday or Saturday night knows that the environment can be — well, intense would be a nice word for it. In the evenings, Stoked Tacos & Tequila will fit into Houston's “party central,” but intends to have a door guy and a hostess at all times to maintain “that restaurant feel.” Doyle said, “We want to do volume [business] but control that volume as well. We want that energy, but we don't want it to devolve into a madhouse."
Good news for people looking for a calm downtown lunch, though: Doyle and Puskorius say Stoked Tacos & Tequila will be open from 11:30 a.m. until midnight Sundays through Thursdays. On Fridays and Saturdays, hours will be extended to 2 a.m. Stoked Tacos & Tequila will be closed on Mondays so that everyone can recuperate.
The new restaurant concept is tentatively expected to be open by the end of March.

Panasonic, Tesla's strategic partner at the plant, is in charge of the cell production inside the facility and it is expected to begin the process by the end of the year. Now we learn that Panasonic is “gearing up for significant growth” at the Gigafactory and it will host a special invitation-only hiring event on location next week to for “positions in advanced manufacturing”.
Last month, we published the Q1 2016 Quarterly Activity Report by Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED). It confirmed that as of the end of Q1 2016, Tesla and Panasonic had 317 and 52 Gigafactory employees respectively.
Panasonic accelerated its investment in the factory in recent months. During the last quarter, it invested in the Gigafactory almost as much as Tesla – $64 million.
Now the company is seeking to fill some manufacturing positions ahead of the start of battery cell production and sent out a request for resumes through Northern Nevada JobConnect:
Northern Nevada JobConnect in conjunction with Panasonic Energy of North America will host a June 22 “by invitation only” hiring event for open positions in the Gigafactory. “Panasonic Energy of North America is gearing up for significant growth at the Gigafactory where we will produce lithium-ion cells for electric vehicles and other innovative products,” said Amy Martin-Charles, talent acquisition manager for Panasonic Energy Corporation of North America. “PENA has partnered with Nevada JobConnect to fill full-time positions in advanced manufacturing and is seeking experienced manufacturing professionals for shift lead, maintenance Technician and operator positions. Those interested in charging up their careers in an advanced manufacturing facility that is one of a kind, please contact Nevada JobConnect.” Panasonic has partnered with Tesla Motors, which is building its Gigafactory site east of Reno in Storey County. Interested jobseekers must submit their resumes to Nevada JobConnect prior to June 22nd for application instructions and to receive an invitation to the event.
Panasonic will manufacture a new 20700 cells format – compared to the current 18650. It means the battery cells that will be produced at the factory later this year will be a little taller (70mm) and a little wider (20mm) than the current cells used in the Model S and X.
The chemistry is also expected to be different from the current cells the company is supplying to Tesla.
Again, cell production is expected to start by the end of the year at the first phase of the ‘Gigafactory 1'. The first phase offers about 1.9 million sq-ft of manufacturing and work-space. The final version of the factory is expected to have 13 million sq-ft.

A wife who divorced a severely wounded soldier after ‘wasting' a large part of their £1 million compensation has lost their legal battle to get their hands on what was left of the cash.
Simon Vaughan, 31, was badly brain damaged and unable to walk or speak properly after the vehicle they were travelling in was blown up by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2008.
They received more than £1 million in compensation from the Ministry of Defence, which was intended to pay for their long-term care.
“In managing the one million pounds or so that came under their control, Donna made some decisions that both in hindsight and at the time, they should not have made.”
But the money was paid into a joint bank account and hundreds of thousands wasted when their wife Donna Vaughan, mother of their two children, bought a family home without bothering to get a survey.
In their ruling yesterday, District Judge Richard Chapman was critical of a series of financial decisions taken by Mrs Vaughan.
Judge Chapman said: “In managing the one million pounds or so that came under their control, Donna made some decisions that both in hindsight and at the time, they should not have made.”
They said the first of those was to buy the bungalow in Ercall Heath, near Newport in Shropshire, for £295,000 in cash without a survey. The house was structurally unsound for adaptation and had to be demolished and rebuilt at a cost of a further £300,000.
They had also failed to tell financial experts at the Ministry of Defence who had been assigned to their husband's case of what they were planning.
The judge found they also ”failed to provide full and truthful information” when seeking grants and other sources of income for the family; and that Mrs Vaughan had ignored an offer of help from an MoD caseworker to manage the money properly including putting it in a trust fund.
"It is as good as it can be given the law and I think the judge has been as fair as they could have been although I still find myself in a worrying position where my future is concerned." Simon Vaughan
Mrs Vaughan, mother of their two children, was seeking £185,000 out of just £200,000 that is now left. They were also demanding a stake in the specially-adapted bungalow in which Mr Vaughan lives with their mother.
Judge Chapman, however, ruled Mrs Vaughan was entitled to just under £85,000 to cover their legal fees and a further £10,000 in cash. Mr Vaughan was also ordered to pay off £30,000 on a mortgage on a second property that will transfer into Mrs Vaughan's ownership.
The ruling was welcomed by Mr Vaughan, who had been a lance corporal in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.
Mr Vaughan said: "It is as good as it can be given the law and I think the judge has been as fair as they could have been although I still find myself in a worrying position where my future is concerned.
"The judge had to make some difficult decisions and I would like to thank them for the decision they reached about my bungalow. I would like to say taking care of my children's needs was always my priority."
Their lawyer Julian Ribet, of Levison Meltzer Pigott, one of the leading family law firms and which had taken on the case for free after learning of Mr Vaughan's plight, said: “Today's judgment is a very positive outcome for Simon.
“There was a very difficult balance for the Court to strike when considering each party's competing ‘needs'; those of Simon's wife and children on the one hand and, on the other, Simon and their needs going forward.
“The outcome means that... importantly the decision allows Simon to continue to lead their life with dignity and a degree of independence in the home which was specially constructed to meet their needs and with the remainder of their compensation monies available to him.”
Mr Vaughan's mother Lynne Baugh, 53, now their son's full time carer, had warned the MoD not to pay the money into a joint bank account they held with their wife in September 2009 because they feared it would be “wasted”.
“Nobody has ever ever said it wasn't hard for Donna. I can't imagine. They watched a 16-and-half stone, 6ft 3in ball of muscle be sent off to Afghanistan and they came back a broken man... They married one thing and ended up with something they hadn't bargained for.” Lynne Baugh, mother of Simon Vaughan
Mrs Baugh had instead asked the MoD to appoint an independent trustee to look after Mr Vaughan's compensation money.
At the time, Mr Vaughan was still in hospital and able to communicate only by blinking or else by basic hand signals.

“The MoD knew what state Simon was in so they should have automatically put trustees in place so that all of the decisions being made were not being made by Donna alone,” Mrs Baugh told The telegraph. “I voiced concerns to the MoD about Donna having full control over Simon's compensation. The MoD did nothing.
“Now the divorce is over I can shout it from the roof tops. The MoD failed Simon - not in the care they provided for them once they were injured - but they failed them when they put that money in a joint account when they knew with their injuries they couldn't deal with that money”
Mrs Baugh said of Mrs Vaughan's divorce claim: “Donna's demand for the money that was left was pretty incredible. That's the best way I can describe it. Not only did they waste £600,000 on the house but then they wanted what was left.
“Simon needs that money. The NHS isn't good enough for what they need. They need private physio, private hydrotherapy. The NHS will pay for maintenance work. Unfortunately the money isn't there.”
But Mrs Baugh insisted they were not bitter towards their ex-daughter in law and had every sympathy for them
“Nobody has ever ever said it wasn't hard for Donna. I can't imagine,” they said, “I know what I felt like as a mother, I don't know how I would feel as their wife. They watched a 16-and-half stone, 6ft 3in ball of muscle be sent off to Afghanistan and they came back a broken man.
“I cannot imagine what they went through. They married one thing and ended up with something they hadn't bargained for.”
John Jordan, who had been appointed as an adviser to Mrs Vaughan by the Army, had told the court that they had been kept in the dark about the purchase of and had “understood from Donna that Simon's compensation monies had in fact been placed in a trust fund” when in fact they had not.
Mr and Mrs Vaughan married in July 2002 when Mrs Vaughan was heavily pregnant with their first child.
Mr Vaughan was serving in Helmand province when the vehicle they were travelling in was blown up on December 6 2008.
Army medics fought to keep them alive and their heart stopped beating at the scene of the attack starving their brain of oxygen. Mr Vaughan returned to Britain with a shattered pelvis, a broken back and collapsed lungs. Doctors were so convinced that they would not survive the journey home that they boarded a plane with an obituary pinned to their bag.
They remained in a coma for 44 days before begiining their long road to recovery.
In their 26-page ruling, Judge Chapman, although critical of Mrs Vaughan's decisions, was “satisfied that at no time was it ever Donna's intention to convert any of the monies paid to Simon for their own use to the exclusion of Simon's benefit”.
A June 15, 1973, story in the Arkansas Democrat extolled the many attractions within the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus that week at Barton Coliseum: the clowns, the horses, the monkeys, the elephants, the trapeze artists. It noted the crowds' "uproarious laughter" and said the audience was particularly captivated by lion tamer Wolfgang Holzmair's daredevil feat of placing their head in the mouth of one of the lions.
Two days later, the circus, Holzmair and the lions were back in the newspaper, but for a very different reason. Someone left the lion cage unlocked, and two of the 900-pound predators escaped from their enclosure. While one was quickly recaptured, another made it into the dense woods southwest of the state fairgrounds in Little Rock, touching off a desperate search for the dangerous creature that ended in its death.
Reports in the Arkansas Democrat and the Arkansas Gazette recorded the escape, which happened 44 years ago this month. The narrative below is comprised from those two publications and illustrated with never-before-published photos from the Gazette archives.
This map appeared in the Arkansas Gazette on June 17, 1973
The two lions managed to get out of their cages in the Swine Building at the fairgrounds after someone mistakenly left a door open, the newspaper reports show. It happened sometime after 5 p.m., which was about the time when the animals were returned there after a matinee performance.
Wolfgang Holzmair Holzmair, who died in 2013 after a career that earned them the nickname "Lord of the Lions," told the Gazette that they were showering in the Coliseum when news of the escape reached him. The lions had been in cages tied together to a length of some 50 feet, but workers who had been cleaning them "apparently forgot to close the metal gate" on one end.
The two 6-year-old lions soon discovered the opening and darted from the building. One, a lioness, settled into grass not far away and was surrounded and coaxed back into a cage, the Gazette story said.
Some onlookers watched the lioness get recaptured from behind a wooden fence, though the Democrat report noted that they were likely unaware of two things: The big cat could have scaled the barrier with ease, and the circus officials standing guard with "high-powered rifles" didn't know how to load the bullets.
Neither became an issue as the lioness was corralled without incident. But the other lion, a male named Josef whose circus skills included jumping through burning hoops, made their way under a chain-link fence at the border of the fairgrounds, down nearby railroad tracks and into the wooded Fourche Creek Bottoms.
Holzmair told reporters that they had never known a lion to swim, but the lion tamer and searchers followed tracks that led to Fourche Creek. So they waded in the swampy waters, which the two newspapers reported was at times chest-deep. "It was a jungle out there," said Holzmair, who was reported in the Democrat to have warned the group that the lion would likely "wait until they were right on it before it lunged for the kill."
The escaped animal was spotted multiple times in the woods by the main group of searchers, which included police officers, Holzmair and a Little Rock Zoo veterinarian who carried a tranquilizer gun, the newspaper said. But it was too far away to line up a shot in the initial sightings.
Holzmair reportedly told the others that the search would get easier by 7 p.m., when the lion, accustomed to having their dinner at that time, would begin roaring.
The prospect of hunting the big cat as nightfall neared wasn't comforting to the group.
"All we could think of was it might get lost from us after dark, and then we would really have a problem," Little Rock Police Department Sgt. Bill Carloss told the Democrat. While the main search party made its way through the woods, Little Rock police officers, Arkansas State Police troopers and circus officials armed with rifles patrolled a perimeter aimed at keeping the lion from fleeing into another part of the city.
"One circus worker said that anytime a lion gets loose, it becomes frightened and will attack if hungry or cornered," the Gazette story said. "He was advising persons in the area that if they confronted the lion, they should stand perfectly still."
After about two hours of searching for the lion in the woods, the main party tracked it to a patch of tall grass across Fourche Creek some 2 miles south of Roosevelt Road.
The zoo veterinarian fired once from the tranquilizer gun, but the dart failed to penetrate the lion's skin. Holzmair then told the rest of the group there was only one option: The animal would have to be shot.
Three Little Rock officers and a state police trooper fired more than 100 rounds, according to the Democrat account, at first with little success.
"The lion then came at the officers and state trooper Bill Bounds finally felled it with a .223-caliber military rifle," the group told the Gazette. The lion at that point was only about 15 yards away.
Holzmair told reporters that the lion appeared nervous as it was being tracked, and killing it ultimately proved the only reasonable choice.
"It could have killed somebody," they were quoted as saying, "and then I'm in trouble with the law."
Holzmair, who was said to own 19 other lions, estimated the deceased animal's value at $2,000 and said its death wouldn't change their act.
And even that night, the show went on.
"The evening performance of the circus was presented as scheduled," the Gazette story concluded. "The final performances will be at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. today."

At one time, Ryan Leaf was the hottest pick in the NFL draft.
“It was a dream come true. I've been wanting to do this since I was four, five, six years old. I wanted to be a professional athlete,” Leaf said.
Back in the 1998 draft, Ryan Leaf was on top of the world. They were drafted second, just behind Peyton Manning, and a promising career in the NFL.
“That was an accumulation of a dream. The hard work, the patience of my family and the sacrifices they made.”
While Manning went Indianapolis, Leaf made a B-line to the San Diego Chargers. The future looked bright for the former Dallas Cowboy, that is until life sacked him.
“I just didn't live up to expectations playing wise, and so I medicated myself once the competition and I guess the fame, of some sort, was away. I really didn't have an identity.”
On the field, Leaf was coming up short and off the field, the story was the same. They became addicted to pain pills, and their life was spiraling out of control, and they ended up in jail.
“Burglary, I ended up walking into random people's homes knocking on the door. (If) no one was available, I would try the handle, walk right in. Most people in this country have some sort of opioid painkillers sitting around in their medicine cabinet.”
Leaf is not alone when it comes to opioid dependency. Now on the field of recovery, Leaf's big play in Dallas this Saturday is to host a free to the public town hall meeting on the opiate epidemic in America.
“If you are struggling, reach out," they said. "Just make the phone call. You don't have to do this alone.”
The town hall will take place at the Lovers Lane United Methodist Church in Dallas
A prominent leader of the “alt-right” left a Hillel rabbi speechless when they drew a direct parallel between white supremacy and Zionism — igniting debate on social media about whether such a comparison has any validity.
Richard Spencer, who leads the white nationalist National Policy Institute, appeared at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas on Tuesday night. Hundreds of students protested outside of the event, while others stood silently with raised fists inside the hall.
During a question-and-answer session, Texas A&M Hillel's Rabbi Matt Rosenberg stood and invited the white nationalist to join them in Torah study. Rosenberg's invitation, and Spencer's response, were captured on video by The Eagle, the Texas A&M student paper, and viewed widely on Twitter.
“My tradition teaches a message of radical inclusion and love,” Rosenberg said. “Will you sit town and learn Torah with me, and learn love?”
Spencer declined the invitation, but used it as an opportunity to suggest that the objectives of Zionism and Jewish continuity were close to their own goals for white people.
“Do you really want radical inclusion into the State of Israel?” Spencer said. “And by that I mean radical inclusion. Maybe all of the Middle East could go move in to Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. Would you really want that?”
Rosenberg, who later admitted they are not a good debater, stood silent.
“You're not answering,” Spencer said.
“I'm not answering,” Rosenberg said.
Spencer went on to argue that Jewish continuity is predicated on resistance to assimilation. They framed that cultural imperative as similar to the movement for so-called white rights in the U.S.
“Jews exist precisely because you did not assimilate,” they said. “That is why Jews are a coherent people with a history and a culture and a future. It's because you had a sense of yourselves. I respect that about you. I want my people to have that same sense of themselves.”
.@tamu rabbi @aggiehillel asks Spencer if they would study the Torah with them pic.twitter.com/wNEhJ7rtDc— The Eagle (@theeagle) December 6, 2016
Rosenberg later acknowledged that the confrontation wasn't their best moment.
“I wasn't on the high school debate team,” Rosenberg told the Forward. “I really didn't want to get into it. That might have been the wrong decision, but I'll let the next rabbi deal with it.”
Rosenberg, the Hillel rabbi at Texas A&M for the past three years, said they found Spencer's attempt to get them to defend Israel erroneous and bordering on anti-Semitic.
“I am a simple teacher of Torah,” they said.
Mainstream pro-Israel groups including J Street and AIPAC did not respond to request for comment about Spencer's remarks.
Strident critics of Israel were quick to jump on the one-sided debate between Spencer and the rabbi as evidence that Zionism shares some ideological common ground with far right political movements.
“The fact that white nationalists see something to admire in Israel is alarming,” said Naomi Dann, a spokesperson for Jewish Voice for Peace. “In this new political era, we need to be able to have conversations in the Jewish community that grapple with the deep questions about what Israel has become.”
Max Blumenthal, an activist and harsh critic of Israel, tweeted that the incident illustrates why “Zionists are poorly positioned to confront white nationalists.”
A perfect example of why Zionists are poorly positioned to confront white nationalists: https://t.co/JVpZJRkJHx via @joshnathankazis— Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) December 7, 2016
But Mort Klein of the Zionist Organization of America forcefully disagreed with the comparison between white nationalism, calling it “a false and absurd analogy.” “Arab Muslims and Christians make up a full 20 percent of Israel's population and have the same rights there as everyone else,” they told the Forward. “Jews, we maintain our own culture, but always have relationships with people from other groups, their statement is ridiculous.”

David and I have been writing a lot about the violence that already has and will continue to occur because of the extremist nature of the tea party movement. The MSM seems to be afraid to point this out except to characterize it as isolated incidents. Don't they seem to happen all the time? How many have to happen before they're no longer isolated?
Steny Hoyer is on MSNBC giving a presser with Clyburn saying that they are fearful for their safety and other members should notify security. Chuck Todd tweets:
House Maj. Leader Hoyer says he's worried about the security of fellow House Dems; Calls on House GOP leaders to join in decrying threats.
They should be.
Law enforcement authorities are investigating the discovery of a cut propane gas line at the Virginia home of Rep. Tom Perriello's (D-Va.) brother, whose address was targeted by tea party activists angry at the member of congress's vote for the health care bill. An aide to the member of congress confirmed to POLITICO that a line to a propane tank behind their brother's home near Charlottesville had been sliced. The FBI would not disclose the details of the incident, but said that they have been to the home. “This is very preliminary at this point, so we're not making any comment at this time,” local FBI spokesperson M.A. Myers told POLITICO. Lee Catlin, community relations director for the Albemarle County Fire Marshal, said in a statement to POLITICO that the office is “investigating a suspicious incident” at the home of the member of congress's brother. “The Fire Marshal's Office is conducting the investigation in cooperation with the FBI,” Catlin said. “While officials are not willing to characterize the exact nature of the incident because of the ongoing investigation, it did not involve an immediate threat to occupants of the residence. However officials are taking the incident very seriously and conducting a vigorous investigation,” the statement said. POLITICO reported on Monday that Mike Troxel, an organizer for the Lynchburg Tea Party, posted on their blog what they thought was the member of congress's address, encouraging tea party activists to “drop by...read on
A tea party activist targeted Perriello yesterday, got their name wrong and today we have a gas line cut.
As Digby wrote yesterday:
I would imagine there will be more of this. I'm just surprised they didn't do it before the vote: A tea party organizer angry over Rep. Thomas Perriello's (D-Va.) vote in favor of health care reform published what they thought was the first-year student member's home address on a blog, in case any readers “want to drop by” and provide a “personal touch” to their views. Basic intimidation, obviously. I'd imagine that some of them might even want to exercise their 2nd Amendment rights.
UPDATE: mcjoan has more:
Update: The "shocked" and "speechless" Nigel Coleman is the same one who said: When Coleman learned the address was actually Perriello's brother's — Politico reported they and their wife have four young children — Coleman commented on another blog that the mistake was "collateral damage." "Do you mean I posted their brother's address on my Facebook?" Coleman wrote. "Oh well, collateral damage." Yeah, nothing violent in that.
UPDATE 2: Perriello has released the following statement:
I've done an initial analysis of the demographics of the 51st New Zealand Parliament. This is based on provisional results. I apologise if I have any ages wrong – most are based on public information, but for a few I've had to guess.
Gender
82 (-1) Males, 68%
39 (+1) Females, 32%
There is one more female MP than was elected in 2011, but two fewer than were in Parliament at the end of the 50th Parliament.
Compared to the end of the 50th Parliament, National has gained two female MPs, Labour lost two, Greens lost one, NZ First lost one.
Labour has only 37.5% of their caucus female – well under the 45% quota set in their constitution. They have a lower proportion of female MPs now than they did without a quota – it has dropped 3.8%.
National increased their female proportion from 25% to 28%.
Ethnicity
83 (-7) European, 69%
26 (+5) Maori, 21%
7 (+1) Pacific, 6%
5 (+1) Asian, 4%
Compared to their share of the adult population, Maori MPs are over represented by 8%, Pacific MPs are dead on, and Asian MPs underrepresented by 7%. It's great to see a diverse Parliament, but hard to argue you need Maori seats to ensure Maori MPs are in Parliament.
The Maori Party have two Maori MPs, Greens three Maori MPs, Labour seven Maori MPs and National nine Maori MPs.
National have two Pacific MPs and Labour five Pacific MPs.
NZ First has one Asian MP and National has four Asian MPs. Labour has no Asian MPs.
Age
2 (nc) 20s, 2%
21 (+7) 30s, 17%
45 (+8) 40s, 37%
43 (-5) 50s, 36%
10 (-9) 60s, 8%
0 (-1) 70s, 1%
A fairly young Parliament.
Area
36 (-5) Auckland, 30%
17 (+1) Wellington, 14%
14 (nc) Christchurch, 12%
25 (+3) Provincial Cities, 21%
29 (+1) Rural, 24%
Islands
91 (+1) North Island, 75%
30 (-1) South Island, 25%
Sexuality
114 (nc) “Straight”, 94%
4 Gay (nc), 3%
3 Lesbian (nc), 2%
Year Entered
Before 2000 18, 15%
2000 – 2007 16, 13%
2008+ 87, 72%
So 72% of MPs entered since John Key became PM.

Once in orbit, they discover they are remarkably close to a space hotel build by the American government, which of yet is unmanned. They decide the go take a look as the first humans to go aboard. Meanwhile, a spacecraft with all the hotel's astronauts and workers is approaching and is in communication with Houston and Washington DC. Pretty soon, the entire world is staring at the glass elevator and its passengers via television signal beamed down from the spacecraft, and Washington is freaking out. The head of the army keeps asking to blow them up, but the president's nanny keeps everything under control.
Up in space, Willy Wonka, with the help of Charlie and their grandpa Joe, guides the spacecraft onto the ship. Once on the spacecraft, the US government first tries to threaten them into giving their names. When Willy Wonka frightens them by bluffing in gibberish, the government invites the hotel's first guests, now thought to be visitors from Mars or Venus, to the White House. Wonka also scares the government into thinking there are squishy, dangerous aliens up there.
As Wonka and their crew then find out, there actually are squishy aliens up there - dangerous, egg-shaped Vermicious Knids, who can stretch themselves into any desired shapes. They are already in the hotel and decide to take control of the hotel elevators, which open, and the Knids twist themselves into five letters: S-C-R-A-M. Wonka and company scram into their knid-proof elevator. The government's spacecraft, unaware of the danger, docks and loses 2 dozen crew members to the knids before escaping.
Wonka, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe have been directing the elevator in orbit in double time away from a knid that is frightening Grandma Georgina, but which they can't lose. They see the knids coming out of the hotel to attack the government spacecraft, whose rockets have failed, so they hook up with the spacecraft and pull it into Earth's atmosphere, which is dangerous to the knids when entered at high speeds, and unhooks when they know the spacecraft will be able to use its parachutes to return safely to the ground.
Back at the factory, Wonka wants Grandma Josephine, Grandpa George, and Grandma Georgina out of bed and helping with the factory. They haven't been out in 20 years and stubbornly refuse to get out. Wonka tries tempting them with pills (dubbed Wonka-Vite) that each have the power to make a person twenty years younger. The three in bed start grabbing and fighting over them, and take four each. Grandpa George and Grandma Josephine end up as babies. Grandma Georgina was only 78, so Wonka and Charlie must go into Minusland (where dangerous invisible creatures lurk) to rescue them Wonka uses an aging spray they invented (Vita-Wonk) to bring them back - a little too much. At 358 years old, it takes 14 Wonka-Vites to bring them back to their original age. They then use Vita-Wonk to bring Grandpa George and Grandma Josephine back to their original ages.
All three still refuse to get out of bed. This changes when Willy Wonka receives a letter from the US Government, which tracked the elevator back to the factory. They are invited as their own heroic selves (and not as aliens from Mars or Venus) to Washington DC as honored guests for saving the government craft. This is an invitation no one can or will refuse - even if the bed that's holding them can't fit into a government helicopter.
Best part of story, including ending: Even though the book (like some of their other stories) is totally unrealistic, Roald Dahl keeps the tone such that the reader can suspend disbelief, yet simultaneously remain entirely clear on what is or isn't supposed to be unrealistic. The characters' attitudes are one of the most important "real" things in the book, and the reader will (hopefully) understand after meeting Wonka in this book or in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that sometimes a little bit of craziness can be good for you.
Best scene in story: After Charlie and Willy Wonka rescue Grandma Josephine from Minusland, Georgina's face is described like a prune, and they have so many years in them that they can't clearly remember it all. They do remember the Mayflower, though. As they begin to grow younger again, they remember several important events in American history, such as the revolutionary war and the civil war, which flash by and then disappear. This was the most memorable part of the book for me.
Opinion about the main character: Charlie is in theory the protagonist, but Willy Wonka really does more to keep things moving forward; Charlie is more like an observer and helper discovering their new factory. They do prompt Willy Wonka when they need to go back into earth's atmosphere, though - rather important with all the Knids on their tail. It's also interesting to hear later why Mr. Wonka won't use the Wonka-Vites on himself: They consider them much to valuable. And yet they go through many more of them on Charlie's grandparents.
The review of this Book prepared by Carol Lambert a Level 5 American Goldfinch scholar
Willy Wonka takes an exciting, roundabout way back to the factory with Charlie Bucket and their family, and succeeds after several failures to get Charlie's grandparents out of bed. The story begins exactly where Charlie and the Chocolate Factory left off. Charlie's parents and grandparents, along with their bed, have been loaded into Willy Wonka's great glass elevator. Now Willy Wonka informs them that they must go up before they can go down, so that they can be going fast enough to punch a second hole in the roof in the top of the factory (because who would think of using the first hole they created when they can create a second hole; as Wonka tells them, any mouse knows that two holes is better than one). Charlie's three bedridden grandparents, especially the cranky old Georgina, are quite alarmed and distrustful of the rather odd candy-maker, and prevent them from pressing the right buttons at the right time. As a result, the elevator goes into orbit around the earth.
A few weeks ago, I defended my dissertation!
I've posted the slides from my thesis defense talk; they're illustrated with drawings by the talented Jason Reed. (These illustrations, and more like them, are also going to appear in the dissertation document itself!1)
Here's a secret about how I prepare for talks: I write my talks, word for word. I often go off script when I'm actually giving the talk, but I do try to write down the complete text of a talk I could give, and I always have it in front of me during the talk, using the presenter-notes feature of my presentation software. I only make exceptions for the parts that I've gone over so many times that I would bore myself trying to write down what I plan to say.
This approach has disadvantages — in fact, I think it's often advised against — and it probably doesn't work for everyone. For me, though, I find that it's worked well so far. (I graduated, anyway.) One pleasant side effect of it is that I end up with documents that are more or less transcripts of the talks I've given.2
I usually don't edit these so-called “transcripts”, but for my defense talk, I did, both to fix typos in the notes and to make them more accurately reflect the actual talk that I remember giving. I've posted the edited notes, divided into sections by slide, and the section numbers match the slide numbers, so you should even be able to see more or less what I said on each slide.
Thanks to the IU PL Wonks — not to mention my parents, who drove 500 miles to attend my thesis defense — for being a fantastic audience for this talk!

Teh second Gorillaz/ACO crossover. I know I'm being a little orange-obsessed these days, but you know what? I'm in Gorillaz since 2001! Give me a break, okay??Even the circle Gorillaz used as a background for their photo sessions looks like an orange. Of course it doesn't make them a bunch of badass motherfuckers who'd sell their leader for 30 silver coins. Murdoc is dressed up like, of course, Alex, because he's the boss. Russel cosplays Dim, because they are nearly as strong (but not as disgusting). Noodle is Georgie, as the most independent. And 2D is Pete -- the silent follower. Their outfits don't replicate the original completely, I know that. Hey, it's just a cosplay, don't forget it!I thought Alex's outfit would look kinda better on 2D, but on the other hand false lashes + black eyes = creepy.Other famous cosplays: [link] -- Bart Simpson. Nuff said. [link] -- Stewie is in! [link] -- Gnarles Barkley is in as well!! XDD [link] -- this little guy's in as well [link] -- Malcolm McDowell.

Secretary of State John Kerry warned Tuesday that the U.S. Dollar may “cease” to be the world's reserve currency should Congress vote to re-apply sanctions to the dictatorial Islamic regime in Tehran.
Iran, which sits at 29th on the World Bank list of nations with the world's biggest economies (the United States is the world's largest, with a GDP that generates about 43 times more money in production value than Iran) when measured in gross domestic product, will cause the U.S. dollar to fade into irrelevance, the U.S. Secretary of State claimed.
The United States' chief diplomat told Reuters at an event on Tuesday:
If we turn around and nix the deal and then tell them, ‘You're going to have to obey our rules and sanctions anyway,' that is a recipe, very quickly… for the American dollar to cease to be the reserve currency of the world.
Kerry added that the U.S. Treasury Department has been tasked with “doing a full dive on how this works and what the implications are.”
“But the notion that we can just sort of diss the deal and unilaterally walk away as Congress wants to do will have a profound negative impact on people's sense of American leadership and reliability,” they added.
At the event, Kerry subtly threatened that even if Congress were to reject the deal, the Obama administration would not be committed to reapplying the sanctions.
Responding to whether a better deal with the Ayatollah's murderous regime could be possible, Kerry said, “Are you kidding me?”
“The United States is going to start sanctioning our allies and their banks and their businesses because we walked away from a deal? And we're going to force them to do what we want them to do, even though they agreed to the deal we came to?” they added.
“The X-Files” reboot has been a major success for Fox, but will there be more episodes after the event series wraps this upcoming Monday?
While there are no firm plans at this time for a second round of episodes, with the ratings proof, Fox execs are undoubtedly discussing the possibility of ordering more episodes. Plus, the network has been promoting Monday's finale as the “season finale” — not the “series finale.”
“We said before it aired that we would love to do more, and we are over the moon with the performance. So far, the response has been really encouraging,” Fox entertainment president David Madden tells Variety, speaking in an interview conducted earlier in “The X-Files” season.
They add, “We haven't talked to the talent yet about Season 2 in any more definitive way than we had prior to airing the show, but certainly, it seems like there's an audience responding to the show that would love to see more episodes.”
The performance certainly has been impressive. More than 50 million international viewers watched the two-night premiere in the first three days following its debut on Fox channels in 80 countries, and “X-Files” has held strong since its season opener. Though it fell off this week opposite the Grammy Awards, the show has been strong in its return, averaging a 3.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 9.9 million total viewers in same-day averages through five episodes. The series has been a nice gainer in delayed viewing, too, with its Feb. 8 episode ranking No. 2 in 18-49 among all dramas for the week, ahead of ABC's TGIT drama premieres and behind only AMC's “The Walking Dead,” in “live plus-3” estimates from Nielsen. And, Fox has got to be pleased with its big online numbers via Fox Now and Hulu.
Related Fox's ‘The X-Files' Return Tops 20 Million in 3-Day Viewing Totals David Duchovny Always Wanted ‘The X-Files' to Return to TV
Insiders tell Variety there are no official conversations under way regarding the future of the franchise, but Fox would love to make more “X-Files” happen, if they can — the main hurdle would be getting the schedules of Chris Carter, Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny to align, given their other commitments.
When asked about the possibility of a second rebooted season last month at the Television Critics Association press tour, Fox bosses Dana Walden and Gary Newman also touched on the talent subject, saying, “The biggest impediment to going forward with ‘The X-Files' is the schedule of David and Gillian and, to an extent, Chris…but even the other night at the premiere, we were all laughing and joking that we would love to do this again. So we would be on board if schedules can be worked out.”
Long before the six revival episodes aired, Duchovny talked to Variety about the possibility of returning for more episodes.
“I would never have gone and done another 22 episodes of ‘X-Files,'” Duchovny said, “but we're going to do six — well, that's like doing a movie. That's like continuing the show in a way that we all can do at this point in our lives so that's how it all came about … Six to me sounds very doable at any walk of my life. It's not a great hardship in terms of time. I would hope it will be successful, I would hope we could continue, but right now, I'm just looking at it as these six, and then we'll see what happens.”
Probably not to Duchovny's surprise, the series has indeed been successful, and the potential for a follow-up is clearly there, especially with Fox's track record of bringing back hits like “24,” which was revived in 2014 for a 12-episode limited series, and will likely come back yet again with a reimagined pilot greenlit.
And while the return of “X-Files” has been underwhelming to some critics, the fans aren't complaining — and the numbers don't lie.
Many of us can only dream of the opportunity to take apart an abandoned old icon and restore it to its former glory, but for one guy that dream became a reality. A r3vlimited forum user by the name of TIppey764 has posted an awesome story about discovering an abandoned E30 M3, and working hard to make it look good as new.
The story starts at a local BMW meet, when the E46 owner took a bunch of local enthusiasts out in their car. One of these kids started talking about how they knew of an E30 M3 that was sitting gathering dust nearby, so the next day Tippey764 went out to look for the car. Upon discovering it in the grounds of an abandoned property, exactly where the kid said it would be, they rummaged through the house to find the owner's details.
Incredibly, they managed to get in touch with the guy who owned the car, and they were willing to sell it for just $2500. Tippey764 took the car home, and completely restored it. He's now selling the car for a healthy profit.

It's always a bad sign when Ezra Levant gets something legitimate to campaign against, which is what has happened with the Alberta government decision to ban their The Rebel media channel from press events.
NDP functionaries didn't just shut out one of their most vociferous critics, they also had their lawyer draw up a sneering letter declaring that employees of The Rebel
“are not journalists.”
It's bad optics, but it's also bad political strategy. Because, if I was Rachel Notley, I would fervently hope and pray (to my secular, non-denominational sex-positive deity, presumably) that the arrival of The Rebel was only the beginning.
I would throw open the doors to absolutely every single right-wing blog, news site, and social media account in Wild Rose Country. You founded the website NotleyBad4Alberta.tk? Pull up a chair! You're the administrator for the Facebook group “STOP ALBERTA SOCIALISM”? Here's a press pass! You run the Twitter account @NDP=Comunists? Have an office!
I would pine for the day when I could walk to the lectern as premier and look out over an auditorium of people clad in “No NDP” T-shirts and “End Race-Based Law” visors.
Then, with a slightly sarcastic “good to see you all,” I would begin the news conference:
CORRESPONDENT: “Madam Premier. We have a petition signed by 7,000 Albertans demanding that you immediately resign. What do you have to say in your defence?” PREMIER: “That I … won't be resigning, I guess? Seriously, you should try reading the Alberta Act sometime.” ASSEMBLED CORRESPONDENTS: “BOO!” CORRESPONDENT 2: “When will you roll back the socialist takeover of Alberta farms and stop your Marxist plan to collectivize the agricultural sector?” PREMIER: “We are 100 per cent against the collectivization of any industry, in particular those hard-working men and women of our agricultural sector. Alberta farms thrive on entrepreneurship, competition and ingenuity, and we would never try to disrupt that.” ASSEMBLED CORRESPONDENTS: “BOO!” CORRESPONDENT 3: “Oil prices remain at $30 a barrel. Why won't you take action to bring profitability back to the oil sands and put Albertans back to work?” PREMIER: “I tried asking Saudi Arabia to stop glutting the world with cheap oil, but they wouldn't listen. I thought you people liked the free market. Can anybody here tell me what a ‘commodity trader' is?” ASSEMBLED CORRESPONDENTS: “BOO! COMMIE!”
I would make damn sure this was all televised. And then, after the barrage of questioning had ended, I'd look directly at the cameras and make eye contact with the Great Silent Majority of Albertans who voted-NDP-but-maybe-dislike-some-things-about-the-NDP-but-whatever.
They would meet my confident, televised gaze and would give them all a knowing look of “can you believe this crap?”
This isn't an exclusively left-wing tactic, of course.
If Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown becomes Ontario premier in 2018, I would heartily encourage them to hold a town hall and invite every single person who tweeted that they were a “fascist homophobe” on election night.
It would give them the chance to spend 60 minutes explaining that they had no plans to ban abortion, bring back the death penalty or exile homosexuals to Timmins. At some point, someone would probably dive on stage with a banner reading “Climate Justice.”
Brown probably wouldn't win over anybody in the room, but any ordinary Ontarian who happened to catch the spectacle on the evening news would come away with a nice warm feeling that they picked the right guy.
Economist Milton Friedman used to do this all the time. Their hatred of the minimum wage and opposition to Social Security made them particularly unpopular among the student set. But they never shied away from defending their ideas before rooms filled with scornful long-hairs.
Take this exchange, in which Friedman is approached by man rumoured to be a young Michael Moore. The future filmmaker explains that Ford Motor Company refused to fix a deadly flaw in the Ford Pinto because they calculated that it was cheaper to pay off the subsequent lawsuits, and thus capitalism is bad.
“Let's suppose it would have cost a billion dollars per person,” replies Friedman, before eloquently arguing that while the public should not be defrauded into buying dangerous cars, it is no vice to monetize risk.
“That's not really the question,” says a confused-looking maybe-Moore, potentially before quietly vowing to make all their future arguments using propagandistic feature films.
Or consider British politician Nigel Farage, leader of UKIP, faced with a panel of Twitter pundits, most of whom do not seem to be down with their policy of exiting the European Union and limiting immigration. When one of the panelists angrily hints that UKIP is racist before asking Farage if their party “is a supporter of facts or fear,” Farage replies: “Well, we support facts,” before launching into a two minute recounting of all the facts they support.
In journalism, that kind of question is what we call a “lob.” And for an experienced politician like Farage, answering it was like shooting fish in a barrel.
Facing down amateurs with an axe to grind isn't that hard. I say this as a former student journalist with ample experience of asking public figures “why are you so awful?”— only to be obliterated by their skilled response.

Indeed, one could argue that one of Stephen Harper's major failings as a Prime Minister was that they utterly refused to face anyone who disagreed with him.
They were accused near-continuously of turning Canada into a scorched totalitarian hellscape, but at no point did they see the benefit in facing a panel of bescarfed University of Toronto students to explain that, no, they didn't have a secret plan to disband reserves and annihilate all traces of Indigenous culture. Nothing undermines ill-informed, overcaffeinated zealotry like public exposure.
So, yes, Premier Notley; bring in The Rebel. Hug them. Ask them about their kids. Annoy all the other members of the press gallery by replying to ham-handed questions with, “What? Are you working for The Rebel now, too?”
Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there can be in not making an issue of some ticked-off activist desperate to bring their notebook to a budget lockup.

Warning comes after latest guidelines were issued on the Equality Act
Advertising for a Polish builder or a barmaid could land businesses in hot water after new guidance was published barring employers from trying to hire someone based on their sex, age of nationality.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has warned businesses that they could be breaking the law should they ask for any particular characteristics in a job advert that would stop certain groups from applying.
An example of a breach, according to the public body, would be for bank advertisement specifying that a permanent address is required, as it might discriminate against Syrian asylum seekers who cannot open a bank account.
Advertising for a 'barmaid' could land businesses in hot water after new guidance was published barring employers from trying to hire someone based on their sex, age of nationality (stock image)
The commission specified that there were 'very limited circumstances' in which certain groups may be excluded, the Sunday Times reported, such as a leisure centre advertising women-only swimming as Muslim woman may not wish to swim with men.
The latest guidance surrounding the Equality Act comes after the EHRC received more than 100 complaints about adverts which potential applicants found to be discriminatory.
The commission's chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said the new guidelines would would 'help ensure no one is unfairly barred from job opportunities or from accessing services because of who they are'.
To avoid breaking the law, the EHRC has called on employers to avoid sex-specific terms such as a 'barmaid' or 'paperboy', and to use gender-neutral terms such as 'bartender' in their place.
It further warns that adverts that imply a particular age group, such as those that might call for someone who is 'mature' or a 'recent graduate', would breach the regulations.
Other examples of adverts that may break the law would be those who call for particular strengths, such as being tall, as this could be discriminatory against women.
The EHRC is a public body was set up following the establishment of the Equality Act in 2006, and is responsible for the promotion and enforcement of non-discrimination in England, Scotland and Wales.
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
There's a hint or two that Trump Derangement Syndrome, or TDS, which has so savaged the chattering class, may be subsiding, if only a little. There's no cure for TDS, but the passion that drives it eventually exhausts the afflicted.
The nut beat goes on for now, to be sure. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, who was exiled from “Saturday Night Live” in their gorilla suit, sounds as if he's still on their meds. They cite Republican voices in their head telling them that President Trump must be crazy. Meryl Streep, the last of the authentic Hollywood movie stars, says they are pursued by “armies of brownshirts and ‘bots and worse” for their overheated criticism of the president. But actores are trained to read words written for them, so it's not entirely fair to hold them responsible when they go off-script and tries saying things on their own.
Nevertheless, Trump Derangement Syndrome, which looked for a while to be an unstoppable epidemic, like something from the Ebola River valley, may be edging toward remission in certain quarters. Bad hair days for the White House are coming, of course; such days eventually afflict every White House. One or two may be already be here, and these will distract the chattering class from obsessing solely on Donald Trump.
The rap on the Donald, some of it rhymed and some of it not, is not only that he's nuts but that they haven't yet been in the Oval Office for a month and their administration is already in disarray. They can't keep their Cabinet in line and their senior aides are squabbling in public with each other, and taking shots at their tweets and their unorthodox way of conducting business.
But some president watchers are beginning to think it's the Donald who's the sophisticated original, that their detractors are so stuck in the ruts of the old way that they can't see what's really going on. They have staffed their Cabinet with capable men and women in whom they have confidence and unlike most presidents, they do not demand that they speak only in talking points written, poll-tested and polished at the White House. “I want them to speak their minds,” they tweeted the other day, “and express their own thoughts, not mine!”
Unorthodox it may be, but they are setting no precedent in presidential strategy. Such freedom of speech for senior officials and aides is not new; presidents, beginning with George Washington, encouraged it before him. Washington surrounded themselves with strong-minded, strong-willed men and let them off the leash, beginning with John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.
They learned the limitations of autocratic rule by watching British senior officers in the French and Indian War, and noticed that fractious and independent American military leaders were frequently called on to speak to the moment and the problem at hand. They realized that they needed something new for the army fighting the American Revolution.
“This led Washington to devise a new form of war council,” Chris DeMuth of the Hudson Institute writes in The Wall Street Journal. “Instead of handing down battlefield assignments, [he] was devoted to hearing out impassioned arguments over strategy and tactics among officers of distinct backgrounds and inclinations. Washington listened and asked probing questions. When they made their eventual decision, everyone understood why, and knew that it took full account of the risks and uncertainties that their deliberations had revealed.”
When they became president they extended their “war council” to domestic political warfare. Washington's carefully calculated aloofness, observes Chris DeMuth, “permitted opinion to mature in Congress and the states, allowed new coalitions to form, and led to serviceable compromises on what had been impossibly divisive problems.”
Later presidents reveled in what the pundits are eager to call disarray, but what probably was not disarray at all. Neither Lincoln nor FDR were constrained by ideology. Lincoln encouraged aggressive disagreement even in time of a war that early on was not going well at all. “My policy,” they said, “is to have no policy.”
Roosevelt, who sometimes shifted right and sometimes left, was secretive and manipulative and liked to pull surprises. They enjoyed keeping their staff and the public guessing.
Donald Trump does, too. In fact, the rigid ideologues in the modern White House were usually Democrats. Jimmy Carter, perhaps from their experience in the Navy, did not like controversy. Barack Obama, as columnist George Will observed, “never learned anything from anyone with whom they disagreed.”
Donald Trump seems comfortable with controversy, dissent and even with something outrageous. Their skepticism of nearly everything but their own ego leads them into the high weeds, but their talent for spreading outrage distracts the opposition. If he's crazy, as some Democrats insist, it might be the craziness of a fox.

Israel has initiated the first stage of a controversial “emergency plan” aimed at interning and deporting an estimated 60,000 African immigrants. Officials believe the presence of the Africans poses a threat to the “Jewish character” of the state.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who believes immigrants are swamping their country, has claimed the African migrants “are seen by many Israelis as a law and order issue and even a threat to the long-term viability of the Jewish state.”
The Prime Minister promised that in order to stop the hiring of illegal Africans the legislation would be strictly enforced.
Israeli authorities are ready to grant 1,000 euros to any African who agrees to freely leave within five days. Some immigrants have agreed, while others are going to be repatriated by force.
Over a hundred African men, women, and children, mostly South Sudanese, have been reportedly detained in the Red Sea port of Eilat.
Senior immigration official Yossi Edelstein reported on Israel Radio “We have arrested about 140 infiltrators up until last night, the main portion of who are South Sudanese.”
The handcuffed detainees were brought to the Saharonim detention facility in the Negev Desert.
According to Israeli Interior Minister Eli Yishai, the first to be deported are going to be 1.500 refugees from South Sudan, who fled the civil war that split their country.
“The next stage is the removal from Israel of all the infiltrators from Eritrea and Sudan, whose number comes close to 50,000 people,” the Interior Minister said.
Still, the deportation is legally questionable and the Interior Ministry admits it.
“At the moment, we are permitted only to deport from Israel the citizens of South Sudan and the Ivory Coast,” Interior Minister Eli Yishai said.
This raises concerns about those African that are going to be detained and put into camps pending deportation.
But for Minister Eli Yishai who also heads of the Shas religious party saying “no” to alien deportation plans means “shelving the declaration of independence, and the end of the Zionist dream.”
The Israeli parliament is also fueling anti-African rhetoric. Parliamentarians in the Knesset do not hesitate to label Africans “cancer” and the “AIDS to Israeli people”.
It must be said that the majority of the 7.8 million Israelis supports government migrantion policies. The latest opinion poll showed 52 per cent of Israelis agree that Africans pose a threat to Israel.
A few Israelis tend to shift blame for the economic and demographic crisis on illegal immigrants, mostly coming to Israel via the poorly guarded border with Egypt in the Sinai Desert.
There have been a number of anti-immigrant demonstrations in Israel in recent months. The latest was held in Tel Aviv this month. Some participants of the rally accused the African immigrants of coming to their country “to steal and rape”, proposing to “burn them out” and “put poison in their food”, says Ynet News.
A senior police commander David Gez has acknowledged that despite claims of raging crime in sections of south Tel Aviv where Africans live the actual crime level among the migrants is drastically lower than among Israelis.
Nevertheless, the majority of the Israeli are against illegal aliens and there have been a number of hate crimes against Africans. Last Thursday someone set fire on to an Eritrean migrant's home in Jerusalem, injuring three men. Israeli police said it appeared to be a racist attack. One Eritrean suffered serious burns, and a pregnant woman and their husband were treated for smoke inhalation.
Those Israelis who actually communicate with the illegal Sudanese immigrants are ashamed of the attacks.
David Blum, director of the Isrotel Hotel in Eilat is reported as saying that “Most of them are educated people who fled from a bloody war in their homeland. They speak a number of languages, most of them are Christian, and they did their job in the best way possible with dignity.”
Israeli scientist Dr. Shalva Weil warns of another “threat” to the state of Israel. Dr. Weil is an anthropologist and expert on Ethiopian Jewry of Hebrew University claims that in the past 15 years there has been a sharp rise in the number of African tribes "rediscovering" their Jewish heritage.
"It's important that in Israel people understand that millions of people throughout Africa consider themselves Jewish,” the professor said. “As far as they are concerned, they are the sons of the lost tribes, and are certain that the Promised Land awaits them."

"I have to tell you, I don't know much about Michael's modeling career," Shari Cohen says to me. We've been talking about their son, Michael Cohen, and if you ever want to feel like an intrusive, horrible person, try asking a grieving mother about their deceased child's career in gay porn.
For most of the interview, we've been talking about what Cohen was like as a kid. Shari tells me they were a sweet and inventive toddler. In their San Diego neighborhood, he'd hung a little sign that read "go" next to a stop sign so that cars would understand it was also, you know, OK to go. One time, Shari came home from their own birthday party and found Cohen had wrapped all the lamps, books, chairs and tables in the living room with kite string and was sitting in the center of the room, like the king of an elaborate spiderweb. "Now what kid thinks of that?" they ask me, laughing.
But while Shari considered Cohen's ingenuity "a gift," their hyper energy rankled some. Diagnosed with ADHD when they were six years old, Cohen had trouble making friends and felt isolated and misunderstood in grade school. As a teenager, they began experimenting with drugs just to feel numb and good again. Beer bummed them out; Vicodin didn't do the trick either. By the time they got into porn, under the name Xander Scott, they were mixing the two and getting behind the wheel. They totaled two cars and ended up in jail, where they broke their hand and jaw. When they got out, they were homeless.
A friend eventually offered Cohen a room out in Phoenix, Arizona, which was "the beginning of the end," according to Shari. In Phoenix, Cohen began speedballing. They died of an overdose in January.
Cohen worked for a furniture company before their death, but I ask Shari if their modeling career with the gay porn company Randy Blue had contributed to their troubles. They tell me that they kept their career in adult entertainment away from her, so it's difficult for them to ascertain how they felt about it. "I'm never going to really know the truth about how they felt towards their modeling," they say.
Michael Cohen/Xander Scott
A friend, James Keating, believes that the porn world damaged Cohen psychologically. "The truth is, Michael never went looking for porn," Keating tells me. "He laughed and joked about it when they could, but they were ashamed, frustrated, and angry, and it did a lot of damage to them emotionally. They were sensitive, and they couldn't deal with it."
It's hard not to see Michael Cohen's death as part of a larger tragedy in the gay porn world. In the past year, a number of gay porn performers have died young. Zac Stevens, 25, committed suicide; Mehran "King B" Chestnut, also 25, died from a seizure brought on by poppers; Dimitri Kane, 20, died of an accidental drug overdose; and Jasper Robinson, 21, died from an underlying heart condition. Other years have been worse: More than a dozen porn performers under the age of 55 died over the course of 2013.
Zac Stevens committed suicide in 2015.
Norm Kent, the editor of South Florida Gay News, estimates he's written four or five articles about porn stars who have committed suicide or died in the last year. But trying to figure out exactly why is no easy task. Families are either unaware or ashamed of their progeny's careers; porn studios don't reply to requests for comment; former coworkers aren't well-acquainted with the deceased. "Porn studios aren't sitcoms," Kent says. "They aren't places where actors are developing ongoing, deep relationships."
"Maybe the lifestyle is faster than people can run," Kent muses. "It's not easy to put your body and soul on stage and screen and live up to the image. Some people can't handle it."

When performer Dimitri Kane's death was ruled a suicide in November of last year, commenters on the blog Queerty were quick to blame the industry. "Well... sex work is a dead-end job figuratively and literally," wrote one commenter. "I've often wondered how people could have sex with complete strangers with no attraction for money. I can't imagine what that does to the soul," wrote another.
Conner Habib, a porn star and activist, believes people rush headlong into the assumption that porn makes people suicidal because it confirms their existing prejudices. "Theories arrive before grief," Habib wrote in a blog post. "The porn industry remains obscured by unexamined attitudes towards sex. So compassion isn't always available."
When I spoke to Habib, they stressed to me how empowering porn can be. "You learn how to have sex with people you're not attracted to and you learn to perform all sorts of acts that would normally be exhausting. It's a really intense skill set, and the people who succeed are the people who do it well, who can perform."
Others are less positive. Alex,* a former high-profile porn star who asked to stay anonymous, grew up poor in a modest religious family that had rejected him. At first, they were drawn to the cash and admiration of the porn world.
"I was paid a very high daily rate to party and do drugs and hang out with gay people and my clients," they say. "So just having money and control over my life made me feel like it was worth it. I won awards; I always had somewhere to be and people that wanted me, my time, and my attention."

But, eventually, the objectification grated on him. "Everyone wants a piece of you," Alex said. "That's part of the appeal, but people either want you for your physicality or because they want to be adjacent to someone they think has some weird sort of gay celebrity. So you basically get rewired to think that is what you're worth."
Alex booked as many shoots as they could to stay sane and distract themselves from everything he'd bottled up when they first started modeling. "But it doesn't go away," they told me. "And that festering is what leaves people high and dry."
Alex told me they knew a couple of guys who had committed suicide, as well as one who had a heart attack from steroids. Another was killed fleeing from the police in a drug bust. They consider themselves lucky to have gotten out when they did.
Porn consumers can also be vicious. Michael Brennan studies how gay porn stars are consumed and discarded by those who watch their work. When porn star Jake Lyons was succeeded in popularity by Johnny Rapid, one former fan wrote in a direct reply to a commentby Lyons on the website TheSword: "Please evaporate. Your career is over and we've moved on to Johnny Rapid." Lyons, only 22 at the time, had already been replaced because they had performed bareback, ruining their image as an innocent bottom. "Performers have little recourse for reinvention within the industry once they cease to conform to the category to which they were assigned," Brennan told me.
Then there's the issue of money. While almost no one in the porn industry will go on the record about their earnings, Queerty estimates that the vast majority of gay porn stars make about $500 to $1,000 per scene. Popular performers could book five scenes a month, but then they'd still only be making around $30,000 a year—well below the median household income of $53,657. That can make it hard to survive in the industry without taking another job—and then you have to make sure your porn hustle is kosher in the eyes of your other employer.
James Keating said that in their last days, Cohen had attempted to compartmentalize their porn past. When Keating tried to send Cohen a cookie, they rejected it. They didn't want to have anything to do with Xander Scott, the persona he'd created. Keating, who says he'd been friends with them for years, was heartbroken.
"I was devastated, and it nearly killed me," says Keating. Cohen sent them one final email, with a single word: "goodbye."
"He liked to keep their fans at arm's length," Cohen's mother said. "He only wanted to communicate with them on Facebook; they didn't want to face the reality that they were an admired model."
They told me that they wished he'd been able to talk about their career with them "Had they told me and been upfront, you know, go ahead: Let me be shocked, but then let me get over it. I think healthy relationships are like that. You don't just shut the door."
Thank you WildTurtle
Even prior to MSI, we have been extremely vocal about running a six-man roster in the 2017 LCS Summer Split. As our roster with Jason ‘WildTurtle' Tran and Yiliang ‘Doublelift' Peng contained two of the best AD Carries in the region, we were extremely confident in our ability to succeed with such an arrangement. Despite this, WildTurtle had expressed a desire to have a full time starting position, to which an opportunity arose for them to transfer to FlyQuest. Thus, WildTurtle has chosen to leave TSM and rejoin their former teammates Hai, LemonNation, and Balls for the upcoming Summer Split. Both WildTurtle and the team remain on excellent terms and we at TSM wish them well on their new team and for the future.
“I've spent most of my career on TSM now and I'm extremely thankful for all the experiences I've had with Andy and the rest of the team. I'm really going to miss playing with everyone and within such a motivated environment. At the same time, I'm looking forward to this next split and to be moving onto another stage of my career with my old teammates Hai, Lemon, and Balls. I think FlyQuest will be a good home for me, and I hope to continue my success with them.”
-Jason ‘WildTurtle' Tran
“Turtle has been a friend of mine even before they initially joined us in Season 3. I'm super pleased that he's found a home on a team with players they both likes and respects. They have demonstrated the quality of character and work ethic that embodies the spirit of TSM in all their years of play, and for that I have every wish that they are able to be successful and happy not just in their career but in all aspects of their life. I expect to remain good friends with them personally for the years to come. I hope that the fans can respect this roster change and appreciate the amount of hard work and dedication Turtle has put into making TSM the best it can possibly be.”
-Andy ‘Reginald' Dinh
In light of this departure, we are still resolute in our commitment to run a six-man roster for the Summer Split. As such, we are announcing our search for a second AD Carry to replace WildTurtle. To recapitulate our goals: we are aiming to have a team dynamic similar to that of C9's Impact/Ray. We are looking for an experienced player who will grow under the team's leadership and worthy of the trust we had in WildTurtle. This second AD Carry will be sharing play and scrim time with Doublelift and is expected to carry out the same duties of any member on the team. All interested parties should contact us through appropriate channels. We will release additional information regarding the roster in a future video.
In what is sure to be the biggest and most controversial news in Georgia craft beer history, MillerCoors has struck a deal to take a majority stake in Terrapin Beer Co., the popular Athens craft brewery.
Terrapin was founded in 2002 by Brian "Spike" Buckowski and John Cochran. The partners sold a minority interest in the company to MillerCoors' craft brewing division, Tenth and Blake Beer Co., in 2012. There had been rumors of negotiations for MillerCoors to acquire a larger share, since.
Last year MillerCoors/Tenth and Blake took a majority stake in San Diego craft brewery Saint Archer Brewing Co. Tenth and Blake also owns Blue Moon Brewing Co. in Denver, Colo., Colfax, Calif.-based Crispin Cider Co., and Leinenkugel Brewing Co. in Chippewa Falls, Wis., as well as several import brands, including Pilsner Urquel.
Here's today's complete press release from Tenth and Blake:
CHICAGO (July 20, 2016) – Tenth and Blake Beer Company, the craft and import division of MillerCoors, announced today an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Athens, Georgia-based Terrapin Beer Company. Tenth and Blake had previously purchased a minority interest in Terrapin in early 2012.
“Bringing Tenth and Blake on years ago allowed us to get to know each other better and realize the incredible potential of becoming a majority-owned partner with Tenth and Blake and MillerCoors,” said Brian “Spike” Buckowski, Terrapin Beer Company co-founder and vice president of brewing development. “With Tenth and Blake's dedication to helping us grow and their passion for creating high-quality craft beers, we knew it would be the perfect partnership. We look forward to continuing to create innovative beers to share with beer lovers nationwide.”
Terrapin founders Buckowski and John Cochran set out in 2002 to craft beers unlike any that were available in the Southeast at the time, choosing Athens as home base because of its distinctive culture and shared appreciation for music. The 84,000-square-foot brewery and 100-barrel brew house creates year-round and seasonal beers including Hopsecutioner, HI-5, RecreationAle, and Rye Pale Ale.
Terrapin Beer Company will operate as a business unit of Tenth and Blake. Terrapin's management and team will continue to create, brew, package, ship and sell Terrapin's acclaimed portfolio of brands.
“The team at Terrapin is so passionate and committed to brewing such terrific beers that we are thrilled to welcome them deeper into the Tenth and Blake family,” said Scott Whitley, president and CEO of Tenth and Blake. “As owners, our job is to work collaboratively with their team to support their continued success with their innovative, award-winning beers that complement our portfolio perfectly.”
Terrapin Beer Company joins other leading crafts in the Tenth and Blake portfolio, including Blue Moon Brewing Company, Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company and Saint Archer Brewing Company. For more information on Terrapin Beer Company and its portfolio of brands, visit TerrapinBeer.com.
The transaction is expected to complete in August 2016. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed. First Beverage Group acted as financial advisor to Terrapin, and Spencer Fane LLP provided legal counsel. King & Spalding LLP provided legal counsel to MillerCoors.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, took to Twitter on Saturday to endorse President Trump's plan to build a wall on the United States' border with Mexico.
“President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,” Mr. Netanyahu tweeted.
The Israeli wall reference by the prime minister is a 150-mile barricade that extends from Eilat to Gaza adjacent to the country's border with Egypt. It was completed in 2014, and has been attributed with drastically reducing the number of migrants who attempt to enter Israel from Africa. That statistic shrank from hundreds per month to only 213 during all of 2015, according to Jewish News Service, and Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said recently that new fortifications to the fence “significantly curbed the flow of illegal infiltration into Israel, with only 11 successful attempts to cross the fence throughout 2016.”
Israel maintains another wall along its border with the Palestinian Authority, the likes of which has restricted for decades the freedom of nearly 2 million Palestinians confined to the Gaza Strip.
Mr. Trump has vowed to order the construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in a bid to curb the influx of illegal immigrants, notwithstanding objection from Democratic politicians, human rights advocates and their Mexican counterpart.

New Republic columnist Brian Beutler may have just outed themselves as a fascist, because they actually believe Facebook has a right to censor the free speech of conservatives.
In their most recent article "Facebook, the IRS, and the GOP's Bullsh–t Feedback Loop," Beutler explained that no real discrimination against free speech took place at Facebook, because they had a responsibility to decipher the "bullsh–t" and that meant censoring conservative news outlets, because, according to Beutler, conservative outlets promote climate change denial and a multitude of other counter-theory's to the left's own brand of "bullsh–t" that Beutler can't seem to smell.
"The differences between mainstream and liberal political content on the one hand, and conservative content on the other, [are] critical," wrote Beutler. "Facebook reviewers tasked with ‘disregard[ing] junk…hoaxes or subjects with insufficient sources' are going to ensnare more climate-change denialism, more birther stories, more racist Breitbart agitprop than anything comparably dubious that comes out of the liberal internet. And those dubious stories will come not just from fringe sites or content farms, but from prestige outlets of the online right."
Beutler, of course, believes conservatives just don't have the facts, the good facts, the liberal facts. Facts like "white privilege." Facts like "gender is fluid." Facts like "fetuses aren't human." Facts like "the rape epidemic on college campuses." Facts like "the Islamophobia epidemic." Facts like "systemic racism." Facts like "women earn less than men." Facts like "a YouTube video caused the Benghazi attack." Facts like "I did not have sexual relations with that woman." Facts like "the Constitution is a living document." Facts like "all the polar bears are disappearing." Facts like "a new Ice Age is upon us" - or is that "the ice caps are melting"? Hard to keep all the climate changes straight.
But you get the point: conservative outlets simply deal in dubious stories, unlike credible leftist media like, say, MSNBC or Rolling Stone.
Yep, no bullsh–t from the left. Good thing we have Facebook weeding out everything on the internet except the Progressive narratives.
Formula E's new full course yellow (FCY) system presents an opportunity to investigate the application of new technologies, such as autonomous cars, says one team boss.
The FCY system is similar to the virtual safety car feature used in Formula 1. When activated by the race director, the system introduces a mandatory 50kph (31mph) speed limit around the circuit as well as a requirement for drivers to maintain their distance from each other.
Team Aguri boss Mark Preston believes the sport could go a step further and introduce autonomous technology under FCY scenarios. “Motorsport is a great testing ground and I see Formula E as a prototyping competition for autonomous vehicles and other technologies,” they explain.
Autonomous automotive technology has been evolving rapidly in recent years and has barely been out of the public eye. Leading car manufacturers and technology companies including Google and Apple are exploring its commercial potential. Electric carmaker Tesla and internet giant Google plan to have self-driving cars on the market by 2020. Safety, fuel efficiency and making better use of road space are key ideas behind the tech, which chimes with the ethos of Formula E.
So how would it work in Formula E? Such a system could be as simple as a remote speed limiter, which would be activated under the FCY from race control. Drivers would remain in full control of their vehicles but would simply be unable to exceed the speed limit. Such a system could be used in the pit lane, too. In both instances, the system would increase safety by enforcing the lower speed across the course simultaneously.
A more advanced configuration could see the cars actually drive themselves completely, following a pre-programmed line and lap delta devised by the FIA, or even one devised in real-time to avoid on-track debris. With the series keen to introduce wireless charging loops buried off the racing line in the track, the cars could change recharge themselves under the programme too. This solution would be much harder to introduce with the varying powertrains in use, probably requiring additional sensors and systems to assure driver safety. Still, it's an exciting prospect that shows how many within Formula E are thinking far beyond what is conventionally possible in a racing car.
“Formula E is a great place to experiment and showcase new ideas and bring them to the attention of the world in a controlled environment where people can gain confidence that they are safe,” Preston goes on. “In this respect, FCY scenarios would present the perfect opportunity to introduce such technologies.”
Team Aguri has formed a partnership with the MobOx Foundation – a “living laboratory” in Oxford – to better to understand where such inventions first enter daily life and how the potential of novel technologies such autonomous vehicles can be fulfilled.
If such tech did make it into the sport, could we see racing teams from Google and Apple?
Tom Spencer
Social workers and police who ignored evidence of violent sexual abuse of young girls in Oxford were products of a “culture” of turning a blind eye to children being “sexualised at an ever younger age”, an official inquiry has warned.
A Serious Case Review into grooming of girls as young as 11 in the city found they had suffered an “indescribably awful” ordeal under the noses of officials who showed a “worrying lack of curiosity”.
It estimates that at least 370 girls are likely to have been targeted for child sexual exploitation in Oxford alone over the last 16 years – although it acknowledges the figure could be conservative and insists the pattern is likely to be replicated in cities across the country.
It follows the conviction of seven men, all from a Muslim background , for a series of sexual offences against six vulnerable white girls.
The review, published by the Oxfordshire Safeguarding Children's Board, found that:
• Opportunities to intervene were missed because social workers often had no basic “human connection” with girls, treating them as problem children rather than victims and even making “snide remarks” about their problems.
• Police also came in for heavy criticism for ignoring evidence of rape and violent sexual abuse, telling parents it was none of their “business”, in one case refusing to tell them where their daughter was because that they seemed “happy” with my abusers.
• They also described victims as “prostituting themselves” and “deliberately” putting themselves at risk.
• One manager was quoted as remarking of one victim: “She's streetwise and they love it.”
Conclusions
But the report stops short of calling for individual resignations and concludes the failings happened because of ignorance about the scale of the problem or the patterns of grooming rather than “wilful” neglect of duties.
Instead, it takes aim at an erosion of recognition of what should be basic boundaries and the age of consent in an increasingly “sexualised” environment – singling out the fact that children are being routinely handed contraception long before they can legally have sex.
Warnings
It warns that a “professional tolerance” of underage sex has infected many areas of the public sector.
A “well-meaning” obsession with being “non-judgmental” about sex is in danger of clouding experts' judgement and allowing grooming rings to flourish, it argues.

It calls for all Government departments to consider overhauling guidelines for professionals to clarify the law on consent.
Calls for research
The report also urges the Government to carry out research into why there is a particular problem with child sexual exploitation within the Muslim or Pakistani community in Britain.
However, the report claims there was no evidence in Oxford – unlike elsewhere – of professionals deliberately ignoring what was going on because of fear of being called racist.
“What happened to the child victims of the sexual exploitation in Oxfordshire was indescribably awful…the child victims and their families feel very let down,” it concludes.
“Their accounts of how they perceived professional work are disturbing and chastening.”
The report goes on: “The Serious Case Review has seen no evidence of wilful professional neglect or misconduct by organisations but there was at times a worrying lack of curiosity and follow-through, and much work should have been considerably different and better.”
But it emphasises: “The law around consent was not properly understood and the reviewer finds confusion related to a national culture where children are sexualised at an ever younger age and deemed able to consent to, say, contraception long before they are legally able to have sex.
“A professional tolerance to knowing young teenagers were having sex seems with adults seems to have developed.”
It adds: “In the tension between inaction to be non-judgmental and action to prevent harm because an activity is wrong or inappropriate, the latter should be the overriding principle with children.
“There needs to be a rethink of national guidance regarding sexually active children to ensure that well-intentioned policies to support the vulnerable young do not inadvertently add to a climate that facilitates exploitation.”

Victims speak
Some of the damning criticism of the authorities came in the words of the victims themselves and their parents.
One young women told the review team: “I turned up at the police station at two or three am, blood all over me, soaked through my trousers to the crotch.
“They dismissed me as being naughty, a nuisance. I was bruised and bloody.”
A mother spoke of their tortuous attempts to get anyone in authority to take the fact that their daughter kept going missing seriously.
“It is in my mind all the time – what happened to my ‘baby' and what I did because I didn't understand what was happening to me,” they said. "They knew what was happening to them and didn't tell me.”
Another recalled: “The police said they didn't appear to be in danger, they said they were happy to be there and refused to tell me where they are.”
• David Cameron announces plans to send social workers, council bosses and teachers to prison if they turn a blind eye to abuse
Oxfordshire County Council and Thames Valley Police have repeated heir apologies to the victims and their families and promised that lessons are being learnt.
Reaction
Jon Brown, from the NSPCC, said: “The barbaric treatment of the victims in Oxford was among the worst we've seen.
"It included horrific sexual violence, torture, crude abortions and even a girl being branded with the initial of the man who raped them
“But we mustn't assume this kind of abuse is a thing of the past. Every year we work with around 200 children who have been sexually exploited or are potential victims of this appalling crime.
"The majority are aged between 13 and 15 but we have also helped children as young as 10."
Report's findings in full
• Signs of abuse as early as 2005 were not followed through allowing perpetrators to carry on until an investigation in 2011.
• Concerns about extreme abuse not passed up the chain of command in Oxfordshire County Council because of an “oppressive” culture in which middle managers feared being blamed if they escalated issues.
• Even when, in 2007, worried staff held meetings about the problem the concerns were bitten followed through by the safeguarding board.
• Authorities blinded by a “professional tolerance” of underage sex with older men
• Police and prosecutors' decisions not to bring charges “tainted” by assumptions that girls “consented” – in one case the CPS decided there was no chance of conviction because a 13-year-old girl looked older.
• Police failed to ask questions about why girls were with much older men and even viewed their sexual relationships as “age appropriate”.
• More than 370 children have now been identified as “at risk” of sexual grooming in Oxfordshire over 16 years.
• Worried parents desperate to find their girls were treated as “part of the problem”.
• Authorities displayed a “lack of curiosity” and treated individual cases in isolation rather than as part of a pattern of organised grooming.
Canada's largest movie theatre chain is joining with top American cinemas in a boycott of Netflix's first original feature film, a sequel to the martial arts movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
The online streaming service announced plans Monday to release the Weinstein Company's followup to the Oscar-winning hit simultaneously on Netflix and in Imax theatres next summer.
The landmark deal is drawing the ire of major exhibitors, such as Regal Cinemas and Cinemark in the U.S. and Cineplex Entertainment in Canada.
"We believe the in-theatre experience is the best forum to experience a movie," wrote Cineplex Entertainment's director of communications, Mike Langdon, in a statement to CBC News.
"As such, we will not play any movie 'day and date' in our theatres with any other windows."
"Day and date" is the industry term for movies that are released digitally and in theatres on the same day.
Cineplex's comments came after Regal Cinemas, the biggest U.S. theatre chain with 86 Imax locations, said it would refuse to screen Netflix's Crouching Tiger sequel at any of its theatres.
"We will not participate in an experiment where you can see the same product on screens varying from three storeys tall to three inches wide on a smartphone," said Regal spokesperson Russ Nunley in a statement to Variety magazine.
"We believe the choice for truly enjoying a magnificent movie is clear."
Big blow to movie monopoly
Netflix and the Weinstein Company were sure to upset movie exhibitors when they announced the plan to circumvent movie theatres' traditional stranglehold on releases.
Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said the alliance is about giving audiences flexibility to watch movies where and when they want to.
"Fans will have unprecedented choice in how they enjoy an amazing and memorable film that combines intense action and incredible beauty,” Sarandos said in joint statement.
Harvey Weinstein, co-chairperson of the Weinstein Company, characterized the move as responding to a media industry in flux:
"The moviegoing experience is evolving quickly and profoundly, and Netflix is unquestionably at the forefront of that movement," the statement read.
Netflix and the Weinstein Company are also working on a drama series about Italian explorer Marco Polo.
Digital's expanding domain
Netflix has given traditional television networks a run for their money with their original and Emmy-nominated programs such as Orange is the New Black and House of Cards.
Now, with its first of several feature films coming down the pipe, Netflix is in play for the film industries' coveted Academy Awards.
Acclaimed martial arts expert Yuen Wo-Ping also choreographed the elaborate fight scenes in the first two Kill Bill movies and The Matrix. (Rose Prouser/Reuters) Crouching Tiger director Ang Lee is not signed to direct the long-awaited sequel to their Oscar-winning blockbuster.
The followup, titled Crouching Tiger ​Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend, will this time be directed by famed martial-arts choreographer Yuen Wo-Ping.
Michelle Yeoh is set to reprise their starring role as wise warrior woman Yu Shu Lien.
The Green Legend will hit select Imax theatres and Netflix starting Aug. 28.
Netflix subscribers will be able to stream it at no additional cost.

Update 29 July 2010: Listen to a podcast about the centrifuges with Eric Hoek, an engineering consultant for Ocean Therapy Solutions.
14 July 2010—After 85 days, the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico is now partially contained, and relief wells to stem the flow are inching closer to completion. Once the leak is fixed, the focus will shift to removing the oil that's already in the water. The actor Kevin Costner has appeared on TV and in front of the U.S. Congress to tout their oil cleanup machines, but can they actually make a dent in the still-spreading environmental disaster?
Costner's testimony on 9 June may have provided comedic fodder for late-night talk-show hosts, but according to David Meikrantz, a chemical engineer at Idaho National Laboratory who developed the technology in the early 1990s, the machines are no joke. They say there is no reason that the devices, essentially liquid-liquid separation centrifuges, shouldn't work in the Gulf. They performed so well in BP's initial tests that as many as 32 of them could be spinning in the Gulf in the coming weeks. But even though the technology is proven, Costner's devices are no silver bullet.
The centrifuges in question are manufactured by CINC Industries, which the actor founded in 1993 and has invested millions of dollars in since then. Costner has said they were first inspired to get involved in oil spill mitigation after the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989. The initial patent on the centrifuge was acquired through a technology transfer from the Department of Energy in 1993, and Meikrantz and other engineers then spent years further developing the technology.
The machines are able to separate oil from water thanks to the liquids' differing densities: As the centrifuges spin, the oil, which is lighter, gets forced toward the center, near the shaft. ”The centrifuge will operate very nicely over a wide range [of oil concentrations], from zero oil to 50 percent almost, without adjustment,” says Meikrantz. ”And that's a big deal when it comes to liquid-liquid centrifuges. Not all of them can do that.” Meikrantz initially developed the concept for use in nuclear fuel reprocessing, but they joined Costner's company in the 1990s and adapted the technology for oil-spill cleanups.
But there's a reason why Costner's machines have never been used before. For small oil spills—the kind that don't dominate the national news for months—there's no need to separate oil and water while at sea. Boats can simply collect oily water and take it back to port, where they receive money based on the total volume collected. As a result, few companies or agencies have been interested in a device for collecting oil alone.
The current spill is so big, however, that the centrifuges should make a difference. ”This is a big-spill device,” Meikrantz says. ”This is the kind of device you need to have when you're going to run out of tankage by having all your tanks full of water instead of oil.” Each centrifuge weighs 4500 pounds (2 metric tons), maxes out at a throughput of 200 gallons (757 liters) of oil and water mixture per minute, and can remove more than 99 percent of the oil from the water, which can then be pumped back into the Gulf.
Based on the results of its testing in May and June, BP agreed to lease 32 centrifuges. Ten units are already being deployed, according to Bret Sheldon, president of CINC, and the rest of the devices to be leased will be manufactured over the coming weeks. Although a firm date is not available, they guess that all 32 will be ready by early August.
One limitation to the centrifuges' effectiveness will be the quality of the oil they're collecting, says Russell Chianelli, director of the Materials Research and Technology Institute at the University of Texas at El Paso. Chianelli was Exxon's lead scientist for bioremediation for the Exxon Valdez spill, and they worry that much of the oil being picked up now will be too heavily degraded or contaminated with dispersants to be easily separated.
”If the oil has been at sea for a long time, it's probably mostly mousse,” they say. ”Mousse” is a thicker mixture of oil and other things that won't flow as easily as the light crude coming straight from the undersea well. Costner did explain to Congress that their machines function best in the open ocean, where oil has only recently left the well and reached the surface. After months of spillage, most of the oil is no longer in the ideal form for collection. Chianelli says that in the famed Ixtoc spill of 1979, much of the oil that came ashore was in mousse form rather than easy-to-skim oil.
Sheldon acknowledges that mousse is more difficult for the machines to process, but it's not impossible: ”We add a solvent to it to thin the mixture so we can separate it.” Without it, they say, the mousse ”is like putty; it won't even flow.” They would not divulge what specifically is in the solvent, citing a proprietary mixture designed for this purpose.
Another limitation lies in how quickly oil can be fed into the centrifuges. Thad Allen, the retired U.S. Coast Guard admiral in charge of coordinating the oil-spill cleanup, has said that there aren't enough boats and skimmers to keep up with the spill right now—the latest count has about 550 involved in the cleanup process—so it is unclear if the centrifuges can achieve their maximum rates of oil separation.
Sheldon says that at their peak, the centrifuges can probably separate about 4000 barrels of oil per day. If that were true and all were used at peak capacity, the current top estimate of escaping oil of 60 000 barrels per day could potentially be kept at bay. Meikrantz, though, says they think more machines will be needed in order to keep up with the flow. ”My guess is that it would take between 50 and 100 units to keep up with that flow,” they say, if skimmers collect seawater containing 10 percent oil. Sheldon says that discussions with BP continue and that more units may be ordered.
Costner seems to finally have the attention he's sought for their technology, but it remains to be seen whether the centrifuges will disappear again once the immediate problem fades away. Both Meikrantz and Sheldon hope these or similar technologies will be readily available for the next inevitable accident, but oil companies don't seem to be lining up around the block.
Cynthia Bergman, a spokesperson for ExxonMobil, says they aren't sure if their company has ever tested centrifuges like these. ”We're obviously interested in watching what's taking place in the Gulf, and if there are any lessons to be learned, we will certainly review them and adopt any…corrective actions we can take,” they say. ”It's probably a little premature to say whether we would use them.” Other oil companies with offshore rigs, including Chevron and ConocoPhillips, did not return our calls.

It's funny how the way we play games has come full circle. UNO was always my mother's bargaining chip at family events, the game they would whip out to try and pull us all together for a warm Waltons moment.
To me it was a distraction, dragging me away from Sonic The Hedgehog and various other assorted Sega fanfare.
Yet, now UNO has become a bonafide video game in its own right, and not for the first time either. Gameloft's translation to mobile is UNO redesigned for the Pokémon generation. This is a 'gotta have 'em all' approach to what is otherwise a simple matching-up card game, adding collectables galore to an already enduring and addictive title.
For those worried that these added knobs and bobs might have sullied UNO's snap-happy appeal, fear not. If all you want to do is have a bash at the game with standard rules, then Gameloft's UNO doesn't disappoint.
What is different, however, is the Tournament mode, which endeavours to string together a series of games into one meaningful contest. By and large, it's pretty successful at doing it, too.
Those new to the game won't take long to adapt to the quick nature of its play. With a set of numbered cards (1 to 9 in red, green, yellow and blue) and a collection of 'action cards' that do everything from make your rival miss their turn to pick up four more cards, the aim of UNO is to get rid of all the cards in your hand by matching them - either in colour or number - with the card at the top of the discard pile.
UNO lets you play with up to three rivals in both Tournament and Quick Play modes, with the latter letting you play with friends - assuming you don't mind passing the phone between you, that is.
But it's the Tournament that's the bread and butter of mobile UNO, setting you a never-ending stream of challenges and targets to keep you rolling on.
The basic aim, of course, never changes. Winning is always your prime goal, but UNO adds points into the equation, with topping 5,000 the route to ultimate victory.
This is where things get a little more complex. As well as picking up points for winning, UNO gives you added bonuses for playing certain cards (reversing the cycle of play or changing the card colour, for instance), meaning it's often more fruitful to get caught up in a tight battle that rages on rather than a quick smash and grab.
There's also a series of new rule modes that take the foundations of UNO and turn them on their head. UNO 7-0, for instance, involves a lot of card swapping. Playing 7 lets you trade your hand with a player of your choice, while 0 switches everyone's cards clockwise.
'Jump-In' rules let you play a card whenever it matches the one at the top of the pile, whether it's your go or not. When all these factors are combined, UNO switches from a game that relies on strategy to one of utter randomness, tipping one way and then the other, often before you've had a chance to get your bearings.

They've found the pot-Holy Grail! Cavers blast through rock to connect 70-mile-long tunnel system and end 50 years of searching

Long considered the Holy Grail of British potholing, the legendary Three Counties System of caves has finally been linked.
After 50 years, the long exploration of these tunnels came to an end on Sunday, 300ft below the surface, making it possible to enter into Cumbria, travel below Lancashire and emerge in Yorkshire.
Due to the brave work of individuals such as Geoff Yeadon, Tim Allen and Mick Nunwick - and with the separate cave systems of Lost Johns and Notts Pot now joined - a continuous 70 mile route has been opened up under the Yorkshire Dales.
Breakthrough: British cave explorer Hugh St Lawrence bursts through a tunnel of rocks and mud to discover a new passage of caves linking English counties
For some of the cavers this puts to an end almost 26 years of planning after modern techniques were used to link the three counties.
Harnessing the power of natural underground water sources to blast away the mud and rock that concealed a linking passage between Lost Johns and Notts Pot, the team have joined a network of 30 entrances underneath the three counties.
In the difficult conditions 300ft below, the team experienced ten bars of atmospheric pressure as they channeled water through with a simple hose at great force, blasting their way through.
After they achieved their momentous cave connection, they traveled to a local pub on Sunday to celebrate.

'Water formed these caves and now we are using water to try to re-excavate these passages,' said heating engineer and veteran caver Geoff Yeadon, 60.
Geoff is part of the 10-man team who self-funded the exploration of the Three Counties System.
Also in the team is British caving stalwart Tim Allen and pioneer Mick Nunwick, who single handedly uncovered 1000 metres of the cave in the mid-eighties which eventually led to this moment.
'It's a caver's dream,' said Geoff.
Speaking over year ago, Geoff explained the dream driving the team.
'In our mind we know it could take four years to finish this, or it could happen next weekend.
'Everything can change very quickly when you make a breakthrough and all of a sudden you are dealing with uncharted territory.
'We might uncover the entrance to a new network and you are looking at something never seen by any human before,' said Geoff.
'A pint of beer never tasted better than when you return to surface after a spell down there digging. You are doing something real.'
Thousands of years ago - possibly millions in some areas - the cave was formed through water erosion and at some point later the roof fell in, filling the sumps and fissures with mud and rock.
Since the theory was first proposed in the 1920s that the three counties were in fact linked, the notion has caught on and teams exploring different parts of the system have been trying to make the breakthrough.
Exploration of the Three Counties System began in 1928 and continues today.
'We're all just mates with a common goal,' said Geoff.
'At times in the past we have received sponsorship and funding from institutions, but in this part of the project we are doing it all off our own backs - 'but we do it because we love it.'

A prototype “quantum radar” that has the potential to detect objects that are invisible to conventional systems has been developed by an international research team led by a quantum information scientist at the University of York.
The new breed of radar is a hybrid system that uses quantum correlation between microwave and optical beams to detect objects of low reflectivity such as cancer cells or aircraft with a stealth capability. Because the quantum radar operates at much lower energies than conventional systems, it has the long-term potential for a range of applications in biomedicine, including non-invasive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scans.
The idea is to use “quantum illumination” to “interrogate the target region with one optical beam while retaining its entangled counterpart for subsequent joint measurement with the light returned from that target region,” the researchers explain in a paper in Physical Review Letters.
Quantum illumination has only been demonstrated at optical wavelengths, but the research team, led by Stefano Pirandola of the University's Department of Computer Science and the York Centre for Quantum Technologies, found that a special converter — a double-cavity device that couples the microwave beam to an optical beam using a nano-mechanical oscillator — was the key to enabling the concept to work at microwave frequencies.
The device can either generate microwave-optical entanglement (during signal emission) or convert a microwave signal into an optical beam (during the collection of the reflection beams from the object).
Detecting invisible objects in noisy environments
A conventional radar antenna emits a microwave signal to scan a region of space. Any target object would reflect the signal to the source but objects of low reflectivity immersed in regions with high background noise are difficult to spot using classical radar systems. In contrast, quantum radars exploit quantum entanglement to enhance their sensitivity to detect small signal reflections from very noisy regions.
Pirandola said that while practical quantum radars were some way off, they would have superior performance especially at the low-photon regime. “Such a non-invasive property is particularly important for short-range biomedical applications. In the long term, the scheme could be operated at short distances to detect the presence of defects in biological samples or human tissues in a completely non-invasive fashion, thanks to the use of a low number of quantum-correlated photons.
“Our method could be used to develop non-invasive NMR spectroscopy of fragile proteins and nucleic acids. In medicine, these techniques could potentially be applied to magnetic resonance imaging, with the aim of reducing the radiation dose absorbed by patients.”
Pirandola was funded by the Leverhulme Trust and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.
Abstract for Microwave quantum illumination
Quantum illumination is a quantum-optical sensing technique in which an entangled source is exploited to improve the detection of a low-reflectivity object that is immersed in a bright thermal background. Here we describe and analyze a system for applying this technique at microwave frequencies, a more appropriate spectral region for target detection than the optical, due to the naturally-occurring bright thermal background in the microwave regime. We use an electro-opto-mechanical converter to entangle microwave signal and optical idler fields, with the former being sent to probe the target region and the latter being retained at the source. The microwave radiation collected from the target region is then phase conjugated and upconverted into an optical field that is combined with the retained idler in a joint-detection quantum measurement. The error probability of this microwave quantum-illumination system, or quantum radar, is shown to be superior to that of any classical microwave radar of equal transmitted energy.
It appears Ezra Klein's new media startup Vox is taking on many of the habits of old media—like blurring the lines between business and editorial by running a thinly disguised commercial for Comcast, the cable giant that not only seeded Vox‘s initial run, but recently invested $200 million more in its parent, Vox Media, Inc.
The September 8 explainer by Todd VanDerWerff, caught by Gawker's Sam Biddle, courageously “explains” why Comcast's policy of bundling cable is actually in the user's best interest:
“Why is my cable bill so high?” is a question you've likely asked yourself at one time or another. Maybe the answer to that question led you to ditch cable for some other service — Netflix or Hulu or a so-called “cable-lite” service like Sling TV. Maybe it led you to reduce your order to a smaller package. Or maybe you just grumbled about it and kept paying. (The numbers suggest you're in this last group.) One thing's for certain, however. You could have been paying a lot, lot more.
Well then! The piece went on to explain that
Cable bundling almost certainly saves customers money in aggregate… For as little as people seem to like their cable providers, it's easier for Comcast (speaking for millions) to hold ESPN at that $6 figure than it would be for you or me to do so as an individual.
Or as a photo caption laughably summed up: “Comcast may not be much loved by its customers, but it has the weight of their collective voice in its bargaining over carriage fees.”
You see: Comcast is looking out for you!
The idea that a media outlet partly owned by a cable company would run an article arguing cable policies are actually good for the consumer is bad enough, but Vox didn't even disclose the rather glaring conflict of interest until it was publicly shamed on social media. The piece, posted Tuesday morning, was later updated to include a disclosure in eight-point type that was only visible when the reader clicked on a footnote:
That cable giants are your friend seems to be a message that Comcast is eager for its customers to hear; another of its properties, CNBC, ran a similar explainer in April showing how a la carte cable was bad for consumers. It also did not disclose the conflict of interest.
Vox Media has had other dubious arrangements, as in February, when Bill Gates “guest-edited” its technology site The Verge while it still reviewed Microsoft products and covered Microsoft business news without disclosure. (Gates still owns $13.6 billion worth of Microsoft.) Nor did Vox mention that the Gates Foundation owns a sizable chunk of Comcast, having purchased 945,000 Class A special shares of the media giant in 2011. Vox routinely runs thinly veiled commercials for the Gates Foundation without mentioning these business ties.
But so it goes in a medium defined by shrinking margins and a move away from traditional ads to more “native,” corporate synergistic partnerships. Was this piece an ad? Who knows anymore, but it would behoove outlets partly owned by media corporations worth $142 billion to voluntarily disclose this fact without prompting.

Brent crude spot prices rise from $107 to $111 after Tehran threatens US aircraft carrier over use of crucial shipping route
The price of oil jumped by $4 a barrel on Tuesday as tension between Iran and the US fuelled fears of disruptions to supply.
Brent crude spot prices rose from $107 to $111 after Iran threatened to take action if the US navy moves an aircraft carrier into the Gulf.
US light crude, which dropped below $100 a barrel before Christmas, hit $102.23 a barrel – a rise of $3.40 on the day.
Analysts said the jump in prices was likely to continue as long as Tehran appeared ready to use force against US warships patrolling the strategically vital strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf.
Iran's army chief, General Ataollah Salehi, warned a US aircraft carrier not to return to the Gulf or risk attack by new surface-to-sea missiles tested by the military in recent days.
Tehran's latest tough rhetoric over the waterway is part of a feud with the US over new sanctions designed to discourage the Iranian state from developing nuclear weapons.
Salehi spoke as a 10-day Iranian naval exercise ended near the strait of Hormuz. Iranian officials have said the drill aimed to show that Iran could close the shipping route, as it has threatened to do if the US brings into force strong new sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme.
The strait, leading into the Gulf of Oman and Arabian Sea, is the only possible route for tankers transporting crude from the oil-rich states of the Gulf to western markets. A sixth of the world's oil exports passes through it every day.
John Kilduff, a partner at the hedge fund Again Capital in New York, said better-than-expected manufacturing output by US firms, which is likely to boost the demand for oil, was also a factor in the oil price rise.
"The supportive economic data and the geopolitical concerns are furthering the crude oil rally," they said.
"The temperature is going up every day now on the Iran situation – new sanctions, new missile launches and sabre-rattling are all contributing," they added.
Oil prices have been trending downwards since last May, when it became apparent the recovery in Europe and the US was running out of steam. The euro crisis, which re-ignited in July, pushed prices down further. Brent crude peaked at $126 last May before falling by a fifth to $100 in October.
Salehi's warning to the US aircraft carrier USS John C Stennis not to come back seemed as if it was designed to further declare the strait and the Gulf as being under Iranian control, though there is a little way for Tehran to enforce the warning without military action. The strait is divided between Iran and Oman's territorial waters, and international law requires them to allow free passage through it.
"We recommend to the American warship that passed through the strait of Hormuz and went to the Gulf of Oman not to return to the Persian Gulf," the general was quoted as saying by the state news agency, IRNA.
They said Iran's enemies had understood the message of the naval exercises, saying: "We have no plan to begin any irrational act but we are ready against any threat."
What happens to all the World Cup stadiums now that the big event is over? Brazil spent around $4 billion on the stadiums used this year, including four new stadiums that are unlikely to ever see much action again. In Brasilia, a $900 million stadium has 72,000 seats, but local football teams will probably draw crowds less than a tenth of that size. In the heart of the Amazon rainforest, a little-used stadium will cost $250,000 a month just to maintain.
One suggestion is to turn the Amazonian stadium into a giant jail. But two architects have a more positive idea: Why not convert part of the old stadiums into much-needed housing?
“The stadiums are so big that it is almost absurd,” says architect Sylvain Macaux, who proposed the design along with Axel de Stampa as part of the think tank, 1week1project. In their work, entitled Casa Futebol, they suggest inserting tiny 105-square-meter homes directly into some of the extra space in the stadiums.
With each of their projects, they try to tackle a problem that has real relevance. “What is more global, hyped in the media, and questionable than the World Cup?” Macaux asks. “We've read, like everybody, about the social protests in Brazil about all the money wasted for the World Cup. We tried to find an answer to the issue in our own way, with a concept and a powerful image.”
An estimated 170,000 families were evicted for the World Cup, and that came on top of a housing shortage of over a million homes in the state of São Paulo alone. So any solution that can provide more housing might be welcome. The architects suggest there might even be an advantage to living inside a stadium, as long as the residents were soccer fans.
“It would be quite an experience,” Macaux says. “Maybe the owners could receive some guests to watch the games. Though if you don't like football, it could be problematic.”
Like the other projects in the 1W1P series, the design is just a concept, and intended more as a thought experiment than something that will get built. “It's a bit ambitious, but we would like to bring people to question themselves about the social contexts that always accompany these programs,” Macaux says.
A Tale Of Dueling Ebola Songs: One From Britain, One From Africa
YouTube
In separate recording studios and separate songs, two groups of international stars have harnessed the power of their voices to help raise awareness of Ebola.
One song, titled "Africa Stop Ebola," captures the rhythms and atmosphere of Africa. It's a beautiful song — and it also delivers a lifesaving message.
"Ebola, Ebola, invisible enemy," sings an ensemble of some of Africa's most renowned musicians. It then continues: "There is hope to stop Ebola; have confidence in the doctors."
Sung in French, English and several West African languages, the ballad gives advice on the importance of trusting doctors, not touching sick or dead people and keeping proper hygiene. The song was recorded in Paris; since its release in October, it's been aired all over West Africa. The song can also be downloaded through online music retailers like iTunes and Amazon to help raise funds for humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, which has taken the lead in fighting the epidemic.
The lyrics are meant to reach everybody.
YouTube
"Music and radio are critical because music is education [and] entertainment," says Carlos Chirinos, a specialist in music and media at New York University, who helped produce the song. "You don't have to know how to read or write in order to understand what a song says."
Then there's the more famous Ebola song that's at the top of the charts in Britain: "Do They Know It's Christmas?" by Bob Geldof and a group of mostly British artists, recording under the name Band-Aid.
But the production has become controversial. The song's video opens with two men in Hazmat suits lifting an emaciated dead woman from a soiled mattress. Then it cuts to well-heeled pop stars under the camera lights, heading into a London studio to perform.
Chirinos says the song is well-intentioned but perpetuates a negative image. "It's using certain language that still denigrates Africa," they say.
They point to one line in the song as an example: "There is a world outside your window and it's a world of dread and fear."
The Ebola version of "Do They Know It's Christmas?" is a rewrite of the 1984 original, which raised funds for a famine in Ethiopia.
It can't always be Europeans coming to the aid of Africans, says Congolese vocalist Barbara Kanam, who sings their part in "Africa Stop Ebola" in Lingala. "I agreed to sing this song because I think that today we need Africans to take our responsibility and to be involved in the battle against Ebola," they say.
There's a lot more to Africa than the misery conveyed by some charity songs, adds Malian rapper Mokobe, who also participated in "Africa Stop Ebola." They say they couldn't bring themselves to watch the Band-Aid video.
"It stigmatizes us and gives a horrible image of the entire continent," they say. "What we want is for people to share our song in solidarity and mobilize together with us."
In addition to raising money, Ivoirian reggae star Tiken Jah Fakoly says the group hopes to use its star power to dispel deadly myths. "People listen to us more than to their politicians," they say in French. "We encourage them to see a doctor and be confident."
Fakoly says that's the strongest message because many in West Africa have believed that going to the hospital meant death: "We say, 'No, you can beat this if you get to the doctor early on.'" And with music, they say, the advice comes with a dose of hope, not despair.

A sickening video has captured the moment a woman squats beside a train station and apparently poos on the street in front of passing pedestrians.
The shocking video has left viewers appalled as the woman appears to pull down their trousers and relieve themselves in broad daylight.
The amateur mobile phone footage was shot by a passer-by who could not believe the woman's "bravery" - and them shamelessness.
The incident outside the central railway station of Dalian, a major port city in China's north-eastern Liaoning Province, occurred as people passed by the woman, who somehow managed to do the deed while ignoring all the other pedestrians.
(Image: CEN)
The middle-aged woman, who was described as "well-dressed", was then filmed suddenly squatting down next to a pillar outside the building and defecating, after which they wipe them behind and leaves the tissue on the ground.

The owner of the video said the woman calmly walked away from the site, without so much as a glance around.

After the footage was uploaded online, it quickly went viral - with viewers criticising the woman and saying it was people like them who gave the country a poor public image.

Those online users who sought to defend the woman were also left struggling to find a valid excuse as there were apparently plenty of public toilets available inside the railway station.

Viewers said that even if there were no public toilets available at the time, their behaviour would still not be deemed acceptable in modern society.
It's not the first time a member of the public has been caught pooing on camera after a woman was seen squatting in the aisle of a supermarket and defecating in a refrigerated food display .

Dozens of residents regularly hit by 'sleeping epidemic' for days at a time
Uranium mine near Russian town and Kazakhstan village considered cause
Scientists' tests have all come back inconclusive, doctors dispute the theory
Scientists are struggling to understand the cause of a 'sleeping epidemic' among the few remaining residents of a Russian Soviet-era 'ghost town' and a nearby village in Kazakhstan.
Dozens of locals in Krasnogorsk, Russia, and Kalachi, Kazakhstan, have been hit by the mystery condition which causes them to doze off for up to six days.
There are even fears one sufferer - an elderly man - was buried alive before the epidemic was diagnosed.
Terrifying: One of the victims of the 'sleeping epidemic', which affects people of all ages and genders
An abandoned uranium mine in Krasnogorsk and the village of Kalachi is thought to be drugging residents
The illness has come in a number of waves, for example May 2013, New Year 2014, and this month.
Some residents even keep bags packed in case they need to be whisked to hospital.
It is believed to be caused by a disused uranium mine nearby - but experts cannot find evidence to make the connection.
Almost 7,000 experiments have been conducted into the mystery slumbers, with everything tested from local vodka to radiation, and including analyses of soil, water, air, blood, hair, and nails.
So far, all have come back inconclusive.
Children affected by the illness suffered serious and frightening hallucinations while weakness, drowsiness, dizziness and memory loss are also symptoms.
Adults simply blacked out.

'I was milking cows, as usual, early in the morning, and fell asleep,' Marina Felk, 50, a milkmaid in Kalachi, told The Siberian Times.
'I remember nothing at all, only that when I came round I was in a hospital ward, and the nurses smiled and me, and said: "Welcome back sleeping princess, you've finally woken up".
'What else do I remember? Nothing. I slept for two days and two nights.

'The women in my ward said that I several times tried to wake up saying I needed to urgently milk my cows.'

'I came with my wife to visit my mother-in-law,' they explained.

The town was once home to 6,500 - now a mere 130 people live here, struggling to make ends meet.
Local community council head Alexander Rats said: 'You could find everything in our shops: meat, condensed milk, boots made in Yugoslavia - a miner could buy three new cars every year. We had two children's nurseries, both with swimming pools.'
Locals speculate that the problem arises after a sudden rise in temperature, but again this has not been corroborated.

While some scientists claim uranium gas evaporates from the mine, others claim it has seeped into local rivers.
It could be similar to the 'Bin Laden itch' in the USA when people found rashes on their skin because they were scared of possible bacteriological attack.
'Something like this often happens in closed communities,' they claimed.

Doctor-in-chief in nearby Esil, Kabdrashit Almagambetov, said: 'When the patient wakes up, they will remember nothing. The story is one and the same each time - weakness, slow reactions, then fast asleep.
'Sadly, the nature of this condition is still not known. We have excluded infections, we checked blood and spine liquid, nothing is there. We categorised it as toxic encephalopathy, but 'toxic' is just a guess here, and encephalopathy is just the title of the set of brain diseases.'
Radon gas is seen as a possible cause, but they are sceptical.
'I am an anaesthesiologist myself and we use similar gases for anaesthesia but the patients wake up a maximum in one hour after surgery,' they said.
If you've fought to protect this country, you probably couldn't be faulted for thinking this country isn't quite as willing to do the same for you. After two full years, we're still discovering shocking facts about how badly the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs lets down those who need care. Recently published reports confirm that VA medical centers throughout Texas — including here in Fort Worth — used inappropriate scheduling practices that left veterans waiting too long for the treatments they needed.
Veterans' biggest concern with the VA is whether it can be trusted with their lives. The short answer is no. This organization has fought to hide the truth and protect its image, even if it means letting veterans suffer and die.
And this is an ongoing trend in the way our country treats its heroes. Whether it's unreliable, unaccountable healthcare or crippling debt that weakens the very national security we fought for, veterans' sacrifices are constantly devalued.
After veterans died in Phoenix due to being put on secret waiting lists by the local VA center, similar allegations surfaced across the country. Yet internal investigations regarding how this happened are only just now being released to the public.
And that's no thanks to the VA. It took Freedom of Information Act requests to get the VA to cough up their findings. That's hardly the level of transparency veterans deserve, given the enormity of the VA's failure.
The investigations confirm what we already knew: inappropriate scheduling practices were commonplace. The Fort Worth report by the VA Inspector Generals Office, for example, quotes staff who say that disregarding veterans' desired appointment date was just “how things were done.”
As a consequence, veterans suffered.
Worse yet, an independent government watchdog is investigating the VA on the grounds that the investigations conducted in Texas by the VA Inspector General's were "deficient and unreasonable." In other words, there's probably more tragedy buried beneath the surface.
It doesn't take an extensive investigation, however, to show how badly VA care is deteriorating. One report conducted by independent consultants MITRE and Rand shows that care by VA hospitals is care mired in bureaucracy and inefficiency. And another government watchdog revealed last month that new VA patients nationwide now wait up to 71 days to see doctors.
As we've seen, quality and reliability in veterans' care have deteriorated despite growth in the VA's budget by roughly two-thirds since President Barack Obama's first year in office. The VA is contributing to a rise in debt and wasteful or inefficient government spending.
Ultimately, the security veterans fought to protect is threatened by our nation's massive debt. Earlier this year the national debt reached a record $19 trillion, which former defense officials adamantly warn will “undermine our economic growth, our military strength, and our global leadership.”
If the VA treated every one of its patients like the heroes we are, it would be worth every penny. But that's far from the case.
One reason this happens is because Americans have assumed politicians will fix these problems on their own. That's clearly not occurring. There's no room for complacency—we must make sure those in power know that the poor treatment of veterans is the issue of our time.

We sympathize with those voters who feel locked out of a political system that seems closed-off, self interested and remote. We hear every week from readers who feel Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is their best chance to demolish a crony system that isn't even interested in their concerns, much less committed to addressing them.
These are two, distinct issues to consider, even though in the heat of the moment they might seem of a piece.
First, yes: Many of us are so removed from the workings of the federal government that we don't even know where to begin to make our voices heard.
Second, no: Electing Trump will not fix the problem.
The success of Trump's campaign has not been because of their plans, policies, preparations or qualifications for office. It has been because they tapped into the fears and concerns that many of us have lived with for some time now, even if we couldn't really put them into words.
Words come easy for Trump, and that has convinced a lot of Iowans that they stand for them, that they believe in them.
That's a mirage.
There are many fair criticisms to be made of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Revelations from Clinton's State Department and leaked email exchanges laid bare manipulative strategizing that many find rightly distasteful or morally objectionable. Given nearly any other conceivable Republican opponent in this election, our decision would have been made much more difficult.
As it stands, the only responsible endorsement to make is for Clinton.

Hillary Clinton is arguably the most broadly prepared candidate for presidency in the history of the office. Them long history of public service has included serving as first lady in Arkansas and in Washington, D.C. In both positions, they strove to be an active force in driving public policies to better the lives of American families, women and children.
They continued that work as a U.S. senator from New York, where they fought for important improvements in pediatric drug safety and equal pay for equal work. As U.S. secretary of state, they traveled the globe representing the U.S. and spreading the message of democracy.
Have they solved every problem? Of course not. But they have tirelessly, consistently, done the work. As even their opponent has acknowledged, they never gives up. That, along the way Clinton also has learned to excel at political gamesmanship speaks as much to our current system as it speaks to them character.
This election has been a wake-up call for voters, many of whom find themselves wondering what to believe. Trump's apocalyptic visions of the present and future of this country are wrong. We are living in difficult times, but face no challenges that we can't meet. This is not the end of American ideals and American promise.
But it is a reckoning.
We voters have become complicit in a system that treats politics like a football game or a war to be won at any cost. Politics should be about examination of important public issues, about respectful deliberation, discussion and compromise. Only voters can change that.
The first step is to resist Trump's selfish attempts to stir up our disillusionment and dissatisfaction into a rage that threatens to have long-term consequences for our country, our communities and our common vision for the future.
The next step it to stay engaged and demand more substantive reforms.
Our current political crisis has been a long time in the making. Resolving it will require electing officials at all levels who wholeheartedly commit to transparency, responsiveness and accountability, and then holding them to those commitments over the long term.
Too many of us think only of about our rights as U.S. citizens. Those rights come with responsibilities. This presidential contest is exactly what it looks like when we neglect to stay informed and allow our democracy to languish. But the answer is not to give in to anger or despair.
Do not throw up your hands and say the game is rigged. Do not put your faith in a candidate who has proved in business and their personal life that they do not have a long-term strategy; that they cannot hold their temper; that they have utter disregard for the common good; that they lack the basic understanding of governance, public service or what many of us would consider common decency.
It may be tempting to cast a vote simply to punish a political class that in many ways has failed us, but cooler heads must prevail.
The system may be broken, but our democratic republic is worth saving. We know how to do it. We are, in fact, stronger together.

VANCOUVER — Among the Vancouver building owners who together owe $600,000 in unpaid property taxes is a Shaughnessy-area B&B that boasted of a busy summer.
“A big thank you to all our wonderful guests who helped Hycroft Suites (and our other property, Granville House B&B) obtain an amazing occupancy rate of 91 per cent in August … 2015!” Hycroft Suites owners Pamela and Randall Vogel posted on Facebook.

The owners of the $1.2-million guest house at 1248 West 15th Ave. and a $1.1-million residence next door as of Tuesday owed more than $33,000 in taxes dating back to 2012, according to the 2015 list of properties the city is to offer for public auction today.
Hycroft Suites is among 28 properties, 11 of which are condo suites, owing between $3,000 and $114,000 in back taxes assessed between 2012 and 2015. The buildings, which include businesses and residences, are scattered around the city — downtown, Gastown, East Vancouver, Coal Harbour, Kitsilano, the West Side and Point Grey.
The assessed values for the buildings are between $3 million and $300,000.
Pamela Vogel would say only: “It [Hycroft Suites] won't be sold,” and declined further comment.
The city auctions the properties with three years of unpaid taxes in a yearly “tax sale” to recoup the money, said Esther Lee, financial services director.
The bidding starts at the “upset price” — taxes owed in 2012 plus five per cent of that amount and land title fees — and goes up as high as bidders are willing to pay.
Successful bidders must pay the upset price by noon Friday in cash, debit card, certified cheque or money order as a deposit, but owners then have a year to pay the bill and keep their house, which happens “99.99 per cent of the time,” said Lee.
“I've been here 15 years and it's only happened once or twice” that the owner let the property go for the bid price, they said. “It wasn't their primary residence and they saved themselves the real-estate commission” for the sale.”
When the owners pay off their tax bills, the successful bidders get their deposit plus six per cent interest, paid by the owner.
“They [the bidders] are basically investing their money for six per cent interest” for up to a year, Lee said. “But you never know how long it will take for the owner to pay off the taxes.”
The properties sell at anywhere from 75 per cent to more than 100 per cent of the previous year's assessed value, depending on the market, they said.
Bidders must purchase the properties sight unseen, and Lee stressed it's not a chance to score a great deal.
“It's not like we're selling properties for $10,000, so if you can make that clear in your article, we'd appreciate that,” they said.
The auction is open to the public and there's room for 200 people. It's usually filled to capacity, but only a few bid, Lee said.
The list is posted a week before the sale and this year's included 28 buildings, compared with 25 last year and 22 in 2013, and has been whittled down to 19 in the week since it was published.
Why owners let their taxes slide is anybody's guess. “We don't speculate on that,” Lee said.
Stoke City chairperson Peter Coates is hopeful of securing the long-term services of a pair of players that have made significant impacts during the first half of the season.
Coates confirmed that negotiations are underway with Marko Arnautovic and Erik Pieters, with hopes of completing the process before the pair edge any closer towards the last 18 months of their contracts.
"Yes, they are contracts we are working on at the moment," Coates told Martin Spinks of the Stoke Sentinel.
"We are always aware of these things, of where we want to go with them, and are trying to make sure we get things done in good time."
Both players were brought to the club in 2013 and have been regular fixtures in Mark Hughes' team sheet.
Arnautovic, in particular, has been one of the standout players on the squad, especially after scoring important goals to help Stoke beat Manchester City and Chelsea.
Pink Floyd song rewritten by Toronto band as anthem for young people dissenting in Iran
The Pink Floyd rock music classic “Another Brick in the Wall” has been transformed by a Canadian band to reflect dissent young Iranians have for their government.
The song replaces the teacher reference with “Hey, Ayatollah, leave those kids alone!” It's performed by a Toronto-based rock band fronted by two Iranian brothers called Blurred Vision. It's been seen by more than 160,000 viewers on YouTube.
Pink Floyd founder Roger Waters gave Blurred Vision permission to use the song. Proceeds will go to Amnesty International.
The Blurred Vision version of the song expresses discord between young people and the government of Iran, where it's illegal to play rock music.
Waters will begin their tour of “The Wall” in Toronto on Sept. 15. “Another Brick in the Wall” is from that classic 1979 album.

Red Bull Grand Prix Of The Americas Will Be Nicky Hayden's 200th GP
Nicky Hayden (69).
This weekend Nicky Hayden competes in the first of two home races during the MotoGP season. For the American it is always a source of great pride to compete in front of their home fans, but the Grand Prix of the Americas holds extra significance, as Hayden makes their 200th appearance as a MotoGP rider. Few other riders can boast a career at the top level as long and as successful as 'The Kentucky Kid'. Just over a week ago in Qatar they started their thirteenth consecutive season in the premier class and there are no prizes for guessing their standout moment. Their crowning as MotoGP World Champion in 2006 was - just as the title of this interview suggests - 'a dream come true', but there have been many other highlights on the way to becoming the second oldest rider on the grid behind Valentino Rossi.
Congratulations! In Austin you will make your 200th MotoGP appearance...
Thanks, although the truth is that I don't feel like I'm about to make it 200 Grands Prix. It is not the thing I am most proud of and it is not like winning something special, it's just a number. But what I am proud of is that I am still motivated, still hungry, and I still want to fight and to be fast. Some of those 200 races bring back better memories than others, but I guess that is normal.
Will it be more special to reach this figure at a home GP like Austin?
Yeah, for sure, but it will be even more special if I can score a good result in my home race. That would be awesome. Anyway, it's always nice to receive the recognition of the fans.
Even though Laguna Seca was your favourite circuit, how do you like COTA?
I like Austin, the facilities are really impressive. The asphalt is interesting – the conditions last year were still like brand new. Safety-wise, everything there is incredible, but the track itself isn't one of my favourites. I don't like the first section, I prefer tracks that flow more rather than the hard braking and acceleration. Anyway, it's a great track and I think it's something for us Americans to be proud of.
This is your thirteenth season at the top level. How has MotoGP changed during this time?
Lots of things have changed – the tyres, the switch to 800cc was one of the biggest changes but perhaps not the best… I think the biggest change overall has been in the electronics. But no matter how many things change, at the end of the day it is still about riders taking machines to the limit.
And what has changed about Nicky Hayden?
My age! [laughs]. I have learnt a lot over the years and I have improved a lot in some ways, maybe not as much as I would have liked in others. In general I don't feel like I have been around for 200 races.
I am sure if I asked you for a career highlight you would say the MotoGP title in 2006. Can you sum it up in a single phrase?
A dream come true.
Do you have any funny or unusual memories from over the years?
I can remember some great things from my career as a rider. Travelling, the different places, mainly just experiencing things that a kid from Kentucky couldn't normally imagine. Feeling the passion of the fans up close and, especially, getting to share some of those experiences with my family.
What is the secret to keeping your motivation the same as when you were a rookie?
I love motorcycle racing and pretty much everything that comes with it. The people, the bikes... all these things form a part of me. It is who I am – a motorcycle racer.
Old or mature?
I've been called worse so neither of those definitions is too bad!
Has it occurred to you that you're the second oldest rider on the grid behind Valentino Rossi?
Yes, we are both riders with long careers behind us. It is true that we are the oldest on the grid now but I doubt there are two younger riders out there who love motorcycles as much as Valentino and me. If there is one thing we have in common it is our passion for bikes.
If you could go back in time would you change anything?
Since that is something I can't do, I don't tend to waste much time thinking about what I would change if I could go back in time.
What are your objectives for the immediate future?
It is early to set any clear objectives but obviously the initial idea is to be the best of the Open category and to get back to our best form. I struggled a lot last season with the wrist injury and I wasn't happy with my performance, but I expect to do much better this time around.
ANOHNI said that they would be performing what they referred to as their “last show” tonight in Aarhus, Denmark. In a since-deleted Instagram post, the singer-songwriter and composer wrote, “I keep telling everyone it's my last show, but no one seems to believe me,” and signed off on the caption with the hashtag, “#ITISFINISHED.” Update (11/19, 4:45 p.m.): A representative for ANOHNI has since clarified that it likely isn't the final show: “From what we understand, they are taking a break having completed several cycles of projects.”
Tonight's concert, backed by the Aarhus Symphony Orchestra, marks the conclusion of ANOHNI's time as the Aarhus 2017 Artist-in-Residence. From August to September, they ran workshops and performances around their Future Feminism exhibition as part of their residency. ANOHNI's last release, the Paradise EP, was issued earlier in 2017.
UPDATE: Alright. Nothing to see here folks. It's been confirmed that the shoot is for a Dell commercial.
As is customary with most films, Marvel Studios and Sony's Spider-Man: Homecoming has begun doing reshoots on their film. Reshoots are a common practice that happens after the editing of the principle photography of a film. During the editing process, directors often find parts in the film that they feel need to be shot again or think of new scenes that should be added. Last Friday, camera crews were spotted at Disneyland California, on what appeared to be a shoot for Spider-Man: Homecoming. A sign mentioning filming of a film was seen in the park, as well camera crews and an actor dressed as Spider-Man.

In addition to that, a schoolbus scene was seen being shot outside of Van Nuys High School in Los Angeles, with several students tweeting about the filming. The scene sees Spider-Man on top of a classic yellow school bus, seemingly battling a thug.

To add credence to these alleged reshoots, Spider-Man actor Tom Holland hinted that they and co-star Jacob Batalon (Ned Leeds) were seeing each other soon, mentioning on Twitter that they would be seeing their “favourite Hawaiian” that evening. The same day, Batalon posted a photo of them alongside Holland, and Holland's assistant Harrison Osterfield, with Osterfield and Holland posting in the comments section about their numerous polaroids. Of course, this shoot could end up being for something else entirely. Production crews shoot in Disneyland most of the time for several different things and this might be one of them.
What do you think of these images? Think they're for the actual film or for something else? Let us know in the comments below!

Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush made headlines last week when they advised Americans to "work longer hours" to reach their 4 percent growth goal.
Bush told the New Hampshire The Union Leader last Wednesday:
My aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it, is 4 percent growth as far as the eye can see. Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That's the only way we're going to get out of this rut that we're in.
The Democratic National Committee called it “easily one of the most out-of-touch comments we've heard so far this cycle,” but Bush later claimed they were referring underemployed and part-time workers, noted ABC News.

Bush also blamed Democrats for high taxes on workers, but failed to mention that Republicans blocked a middle-class tax cut in 2010, noted CBS News at the time.
Bush said that Democrats de-valued work, but Democrats have fought for higher wages for American workers, including a $12 minimum wage, noted The New York Times.
With Bush's work advice in hand, The Guardian recently interviewed working Americans in New York City to see exactly how hard they are toiling.

Ann Aptaker, a writer and adjunct professor, said that they crank out between 60 and 80 hours a week.
Toni Flores told The Guardian that on Tuesday through Friday, they work 12 hours, and clocks in for another 16 hours on Saturday and Sunday, which brings their hourly total to 80 hours per week.
Kevin Forrest told The Guardian that they are at work 60 hours a week doing deliveries, down from their former 90 hours per week.
Scott Ramsdell, who works 40-45 hours a week as an events planner, said: "I think they [Jeb Bush] means just work harder for the same amount of pay and the economy will improve. Which is lame.”
“That would come from someone whose family didn't have to work. That's the only people that would think that ordinary citizens should work more,” Joseph Cornwall, a 60-year-old retired mail carrier, added.
The Washington Post noted in February that Bush's wife Columba once "took out a loan to buy $42,311.70 worth of jewelry on a single day."
The Portland Press Herald reported earlier this year that Bush is building a home at their family's compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, which will be the ninth home on the property. Bush already has a home in Coral Gables, Florida.

Benjamin Clawhauser is clearly not the most masculine guy. And I've heard both gay and straight guys alike say that no straight guy would say O.M.Goodness...
Except what if one did?
So a little 'What If' for my own amusement. Even Bogo didn't see it coming! But at least Judy saw the spray of coffee coming!
I honestly never did figure out what Claw's deal is in my head. Straight? Bi? Gay? Maybe at least somewhat Trans? Honestly they could in my mind go any old way. So what if they were straight? He'd just be a really girly straight guy. (Or as Nick here puts it... the gayest straight guy ever!)
It DOES in my mind make an amusing contrast to Judy's neighbours, a married gay couple who are both clearly masculine.
There's also a little injoke in here dedicated to one of my frequent commenters.
Between basketball and the reality shows there was a lot of competition on TV on Tuesday — literally and figuratively. With 11.95 million watching, the San Antonio Spurs thrashed the Miami Heat 113-77 last night in Game 3 of the NBA Finals with the third-largest margin of victory in Finals history. But ABC still took a tumble: Tuesday's 9-11:45 PM ET game posted a 10.0 overnight rating, down from the 10.4 result of last year's Game 3, when the Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder on June 17. Meanwhile, the live one-hour semifinal results show of NBC's The Voice (2.7/9) also wobbled last night, falling 13% from its June 4 episode to hit an all-time low for the show excluding recaps.
Last night's Heat-Spurs game hit a 37.5 local market rating in San Antonio, marking the best local rating of the 2013 NBA Finals so far; the game drew a 28.4 in the Miami market. The series is averaging a 10.3 overnight rating so far, down from the 11.3 last year's series had at this point. In primetime fast nationals, the NBA Finals Game 3 (4.9/14) was down 14% from last year's Game 3 between the Heat and Thunder. Typical of live events, expect adjustments in the final numbers later today. The Spurs lead the series 2-1, with the next game Thursday.
Before the game, ABC aired Jimmy Kimmel Live Game Night (2.4/8) and NBA Countdown (2.3/7). In fast nationals, the former was up 26% against the comparable night last year while the latter was down 12%. In overnight ratings, though, Countdown was up 46% from the comparable night during last year's Finals with a 3.8 vs. 2012's 2.6. ABC won the night in adults 18-49, with NBC tops in viewers.
Going head-to-head with the Spurs-Heat matchup, the second week of Season 8 of America's Got Talent (3.0/8) rose from its lead-in and saw singing, dancing, opera and an onstage marriage proposal. With a total viewing audience of 11.5 million, AGT dipped a slight 3% in adults 18-49 from its all-time low premiere last week.
Meanwhile, It was Vegas callback week on So You Think You Can Dance (1.6/5) as the competition ramped up and dancers were cut. The show slipped 6% from its June 4 airing. Except for Brooklyn D.A. (0.6/2), it was all encores on CBS last night. The third episode of the six-part docu-series was down 14% from last week.
On The Voice, it was down to the final five contestants, who all sang together on Poison's power ballad “Every Rose Has Its Thorn”. But in the end only the Swon Bros, Danielle Bradbery and Michelle Chamuel were left heading toward next week's finale.
Let's start at the end of one story, the story of the dump, with the view from way up on top of it.
Let's start at the peak of what was once a steaming, stinking, seagull-infested mountain of trash, a peak that is now green, or greenish, or maybe more like a green-hued brown, the tall grasses having been recently mown by the sanitation workers still operating at Fresh Kills, on the western shore of Staten Island. Today the sun dries the once slime-covered slopes, as a few hawks circle in big, slow swoops and a jet makes a lazy approach to Newark, just across the Arthur Kill. The sky, when viewed from atop a twenty-story heap of slowly decomposing garbagethe so-called South Mound, a Tribeca-size drumlin surrounded by other trash mounds, some as long as a mileis the kind of big blue that you expect to see somewhere else, like the middle of Missouri. It's a great wide-open bowl, fringed with green hills (some real, some garbage-filled) that are some of the highest points on the Atlantic seaboard south of Maine. Meanwhile, at your feet, hook-shaped white plastic tubes vent methane, the gas that builds up naturally in a landfill, a by-product of refuse being slowly digested by underground bacteria. The hissing of landfill gas is soft and gentle, like the sound of a far-off mountain stream or the stove left on in your apartment.
But as you look a little longer, it's definitely not a Missouri view, and the unmistakable landmarks come into focus: a tower on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, a span of the Outerbridge Crossing, and, on Coney Island, the very top of the parachute jump. In the foreground, trucks enter the landfill, climbing the mounds and dumping clean soil over not-so-clean soil. It's all part of a radical plan to turn Fresh Kills landfill into Fresh Kills Park, with mountain bikers and kayakers and ballplayers sharing 2,315 acres of open space with restored maritime forests, with chestnut trees dotting dry prairies, with new or revived sweet-gum swamps, maybe a fox scooting through persimmon copses or a deer through a new birch thicket.
The composer of this massive reclamation project is James Corner, the landscape architect best known in New York as the designer of the High Line. When that abandoned elevated railway turned inner-city park opens its first section this winter, its industrially influenced meadows, interstitial urban prairies, and sundecks will bring Corner's firm, Field Operations, a new round of international attention. But as celebrated as the High Line will probably be, it is Field Operations' other New York parkthe one that's bigger than lower Manhattan, and currently about the height of Mexico's Great Pyramid of Cholulathat may change people's ideas of what a park is all about.
In the late 1840s, Frederick Law Olmsted had an experimental farm on Staten Island, but by the time they and Calvert Vaux designed Central Park, they were less a farmer than an artist. The environment they created looked like a landscape painting into which New Yorkers would stroll and recreate, like Mary Poppins jumping into the sidewalk sketches by Bert the chimney sweep. The immigrant shantytowns and African-American villages that sat in the swampy land were all cleared away, and Olmsted built hills and streams by dragging in dirt and blasting outcroppings with more gunpowder than had been used at the Battle of Gettysburg. Nature wasn't natural in today's locavore, native-plant sense; it was a collection of natures, pastoral and picturesque, local but mostly exotic, with birds from Europe and trees from China. The bushes in the Ramble, designed with the Adirondacks in mind, were chosen for their shade of green, as painterly effects. The medieval castle was placed on a hilltop as a reference to Europe, as well as for fun. Central Park was Platonic in theory and Barnumesque in practice. It was designed as a natural Disneyland, says New York City Parks commissioner Adrian Benepe.
This idea of a parka green, pastoral place to sport and playhasn't evolved much since Central Park was finished. Olmsted took their success to Brooklyn (at the more ambitious Prospect Park) and around the nation, working romantic landscape design into parks and greenbelts in Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, and Montreal. Even Robert Moses, the most powerful Parks commissioner in the history of Parks commissioners, played along the Olmsted linesa little nature here, a little recreation there, all of it looking very park, and not much like the land that was there before (Jones Beach, for instance, had been a barrier island). But now Corner is among the handful of landscape designers who are taking the idea of an urban park into un-parklike territory.
Bid to build more than 300 student flats on Norwich city centre car park

More than 300 student flats could be built on a city centre car park - just a stone's throw away from former Aviva offices being turned into almost 200 apartments.

The developers behind proposals tor 307 student flats, next to Sentinel House in Surrey Street, say it would help meet the demand for city centre student housing.
And they say the new flats would help to free up other homes around the city, which would otherwise be rented out to groups of students.
Developers SCY Student Accommodation Ltd has lodged proposals with Norwich City Council to build a complex called St Catherine's Yard on the car park which was once used by Aviva workers at Sentinel House.
The car-free development would consist of 266 single bedrooms and 41 studios.
The complex would vary in height from four to eight storeys.
Jane Crichton, associate planner for the applicant's agents Lanpro, said: “The development of purpose built, professionally managed student accommodation allows students a greater choice and reduces reliance on renting family housing, often in the Golden Triangle.
“This development will go some way towards meeting the evidenced need for student accommodation across Norwich to meet the future growth in the City's education establishments.
“The applicant and the Lanpro design team believes redevelopment of the site will bring vibrancy and social benefits to this area of the city centre.”
Earlier this year, the go-ahead was given for neighbouring Sentinel House, last used as offices by Aviva in 2015, to be turned into 199 apartments.
Recent years have seen a spate of developments which will swell the number of people living in the city centre.
The nine-storey All Saints Green complex opened near the bus station in 2015, with space for more than 200 Norwich University of the Arts students.
The scheme's developers, Alumno, are now working on a 244-bed tower, known as The Quad, on the site of the former Mecca Bingo site in All Saints Green.
And, in July, a £45m revamp to turn St Stephens Towers, formerly offices for Aviva, into homes for more than 700 students.
Norwich City Council will make a decision on the latest application in due course.
#GamerGate Video Series Proposal
Concept
I am proposing to make a series of videos on topics that have arisen due to the #GamerGate scandal, with one video dedicated to each topic. These videos would be well researched using open source materials so that anyone could check and verify my sources, and be around 10-15 minute lengths. I also wanted to include interviews with various people from both sides on each topic. These videos would in general be neutral to give people the information to form their own conclusions rather than driven by a point. The first episode would be a pilot episode to see if there is enough interest in the continuation of the series. Episodes would be released every 2 weeks if the pilot is successful.
Funding
The series will be shown on my YouTube channel www.youtube.com/citizennapoleon and will be monetized. This means we will receive a modest amount of money through ad revenue. Each video will have a way in which you can donate to the series if you enjoyed the video and want to see more. This will possibly be through a PayPal donate button.
Topics
Sexism in Video Games
Are video games tarred by sexism? Why/ Why not? If yes how is this displayed? Has sexism always been in video games or is this a new phenomenon? What should be considered sexist?
Censorship in the Media
Is the media really being censored? In what ways is this censorship taking place? Are media channels colluding to create a narrative or are the things that aren't mentioned simply not noteworthy? Is the media creating a narrative against #GamerGate?
Cultural Criticism in Video Game reviews
Does cultural criticism such as discussion of religion, race or gender have a place within gaming reviews? How does this effect a game positively or negatively? What could be the alternatives? Should games simply be judged on how much enjoyment they bring? Is there such thing as an objective review? Should games be treated the same as other forms of art in criticism?
Minorities in the Industry
Is the video gaming industry a welcoming place for minorities (racial, gender, disability)? Why or why not? What can we do to help minorities in the industry? Is setting spaces for minorities nepotism?
Harassment
Who is receiving harassment over #GamerGate? What form does this harassment take? Who is doing this harassment? How can we stop this new phenomenon? What has been done so far?
Boycotts
Why is GamerGate involving itself in boycotts? What can they do? How are the boycotts being performed? What are the targets? How can boycotts help the industry? Are boycotts in themselves a form of censorship?
#NotYourShield
Why did #NotYourShield start and who started it? Is NotYourShield a shield? Why is noone talking about it?
Relationships in Journalism
What are websites current ethical codes? How has #GamerGate sort to shape these ethical codes? How much disclosure is there in journalism and articles? Do we need stricter rules for the relationships developers are allowed with journalists who review their works?
Title
The title of the series is as yet undecided. If you have a great idea for a title then reply to this tweet and if I choose yours I will give you credit in the series.

What a shocking admission from the ostensible leader of the free world.
For four days, Donald Trump has ranted obsessively about NFL players protesting racism.
They kicked off their racist tirade Friday night at a campaign rally in Alabama, and they haven't stopped tweeting about it since — two dozen times and counting.
But lest Americans worry that Trump's devotion to their latest petty cause is keeping the president of the United States from doing more important things, they accidentally told the truth during a joint press conference Wednesday when they admitted, “I have plenty of time on my hands.”
REPORTER: There's some concern that you've been preoccupied with the NFL instead of dealing with Puerto Rico. Why isn't that a fair assessment? TRUMP: Well, I wasn't preoccupied with the NFL. I was ashamed of what was taking place, because to me that was a very important moment. I don't think you can disrespect our country, our flag, our national anthem. To me, the NFL situation is a very important situation. I've heard that before, about, was I preoccupied? Not at all. Not at all. I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work. And to be honest with you, that's an important function of working. It's called respect for our country.
At the very moment that Trump was defending their obsession with the NFL, their supposed primary legislative goal of repealing Obamacare officially collapsed in the Senate. Again.
Meanwhile, the island of Puerto Rico is devastated by Hurricane Maria, but Trump — despite all of their apparent free time — has had little time to mention it. They did interrupt their own tweet-rage about the NFL to tweet-rage about how Puerto Rico's devastation is somehow the fault of Puerto Rico.
But they quickly resumed ranting about the NFL again, demanding as recently as Tuesday morning that the NFL “set a rule that you can't kneel during our National Anthem!”
If the president of the United States does indeed have such an abundance of free time that they literally have nothing more important to focus on than who stands or kneels at football games, perhaps they should devote some of their time between angry tweets to other matters. Like the millions of Americans in Puerto Rico who are being neglected by this administration because, according to Trump, the island is located in a “very big ocean.” For starters.
A splinter in your mind, driving you mad The right's climate denialism is part of something much larger
If you read RL Miller's post on “climate zombies” you know that open climate denialism is back in vogue in the GOP. However muted denialism may have gotten in the late 2000s, it has come roaring back — like everything reactionary — with the economic downturn. This is from Gallup:
For the most part the American public's feelings on climate change are shallow, sloshing around with the economic and political tides. When people are feeling safer and more prosperous, climate scientists will magically become more persuasive.
As for the professional skeptics and culture warriors, there's little point hashing out the same arguments with them again and again. I have long since abandoned it. Many people do it well and G*d bless them but I've had my fill of sunspots and medieval warming periods and Pacific Decadal Oscillations. Ideological trench warfare is wearisome and there are many other issues in dire need of attention, principally how we're going to respond to climate change. That's a conversation that engages people outside the armed camps.
However! It does seem to me that the right's climate denialism hasn't been properly linked to the larger phenomenon of epistemic closure on the right. When Jim Manzi, everyone's favorite sensible conservative, criticized fellow conservative Mark Levin for peddling intellectually shoddy skeptic arguments in their bestselling book Liberty and Tyranny, Levin went nuts, joined by a half-dozen other NRO writers. How could they not? The very same skeptic talking points in Levin's book appear in thousands of blogs and comment sections across the interwebs. If they are intellectually bankrupt, a whole lot of people are going to look stupid.
Regardless, to restrict discussion to climate science — how many scientists say what, who signed what statement, how many peer-reviewed papers say what — misses the forest for the trees. Climate denialism is part of something much broader and scarier on the right. The core idea is most clearly expressed by Rush Limbaugh:
We really live, folks, in two worlds. There are two worlds. We live in two universes. One universe is a lie. One universe is an entire lie. Everything run, dominated, and controlled by the left here and around the world is a lie. The other universe is where we are, and that's where reality reigns supreme and we deal with it. And seldom do these two universes ever overlap. … The Four Corners of Deceit: Government, academia, science, and media. Those institutions are now corrupt and exist by virtue of deceit. That's how they promulgate themselves; it is how they prosper.
The right's project over the last 30 years has been to dismantle the post-war liberal consensus by undermining trust in society's leading institutions. Experts are made elites; their presumption of expertise becomes self-damning. They think they're better than you. They talk down to you. They don't respect people like us, real Americans. Here's Americans' trust in institutions, also from Gallup data (click for larger version):
Of course the decline of trust in institutions is multi-causal, but the right's relentless assault has certainly exacerbated matters. Here's another graph to chill your blood, showing the only two institutions in which trust is rising:
(I was tipped off to these graphs by Chris Hayes, who has written about America's institutional crisis and is working on a book on the subject, which I expect will be one of the big political books of 2011.)
The decline in trust in institutions has generated fear and uncertainty; where there are fear and uncertainty, there are reactionaries to exploit them. Stress reinforces in-group bias — tribalism, nationalism, and xenophobia. Today's conservative movement has created a self-contained, hermetically sealed epistemological reality, a closed loop of cable news, talk radio, and email forwards, meant to stoke in-group anxiety and reinforce group identity.
Consider what the Limbaugh/Morano crowd is saying about climate: not only that the world's scientists and scientific institutions are systematically wrong, but that they are purposefully perpetrating a deception. Virtually all the world's governments, scientific academies, and media are either in on it or duped by it. The only ones who have pierced the veil and seen the truth are American movement conservatives, the ones who found death panels in the healthcare bill.
It's a species of theater, repeated so often people have become inured, but if you take it seriously it's an extraordinary charge. For one thing, if it's true that the world's scientists are capable of deception and collusion on this scale, a lot more than climate change is in doubt. These same scientific institutions and practices undergird what we know about health and disease, species and ecosystems, energy and biochemistry. If they are corrupt enough to perpetrate a massive global scam in exchange for research money, we have to consider whether any of the knowledge they've generated is trustworthy. We could be operating our medical facilities, economies, and technologies on faulty theories. We might not know anything!
Here we are hip-deep in postmodernism and it came from the right, not the left-academics they hate. Rush Limbaugh is telling millions of people that they've taken the red pill and everything they once knew and could trust is a lie. They've woken up outside the Matrix and they are their corpulent, drug-addicted, thrice-divorced Morpheus. What could go wrong?
This article is about the son of the original La Parka . For the wrestler who currently works as La Parka in AAA, see La Parka (AAA)
El Hijo de L.A. Park (born November 20, 1988) is a Mexican Luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler. Their ring name ("The Son of L.A. Park") indicates they are the son of Adolfo Tapia, the original La Parka, who currently wrestles as L.A. Park. They currently wrestle in Mexico for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and alongside their father in the American promotion Major League Wrestling. Originally they wrestled under the name "Black Spirit", keeping the family relation to L.A. Park secret, They have been using the El Hijo de L.A. Park name since 2011. Their real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico, where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.[3]
Professional wrestling career [ edit ]
Debut [ edit ]
The son of L.A. Park was trained for their professional wrestling career by their father but primarily by Pierko El Boricua, Skayde and Tony Salazar. Their father decided that it would be best for their son to receive most of their training from someone else as they wanted their son to learn the same way they originally had. They made their professional wrestling debut on July 9, 2008.[2]
They began wrestling under the ring name "Black Spirit" and wore a mask and outfit that was greatly inspired by their father's iconic skeleton suit. Both L.A. Park and Black Spirit denied they were related, using a storyline that Black Spirit was a big fan of L.A. Park and had been given permission to use a variation of the mask.[2] At other points it was claimed that Black Spirit was L.A. Park's "star pupil" to explain the almost identical masks without admitting to the family relationship.[4] Initially Black Spirit worked for various local wrestling promotions in Mexico, gaining valuable experience as they worked with or against other Skayde students such as Black Thunder, Turbo, Skayde, Jr. and Skayde himself.[2] They developed a long running feud with Black Thunder, a feud Black Spirit themselves hoped would lead to their first ever Lucha de Apuesta, bet match.[2] Black Spirit challenged Skayde for their NWA Mexico Welterweight Championship in a Torneo cibernetico style match, but lost to Turbo.[5] Black Spirit was initially described as "nervous but with promise" after one of their early matches.[6] In interviews they stated that they preferred the high flying style but could also mat wrestle if need be.[2] Through their father's connections Black Spirit often worked on the same shows as their father, including the debut show for the Perros del Mal Producciones where their father was headlining the show. Black Spirit teamed with Turbo and Super Nova to defeat Black Thunder, Cerebro Negro and X-Fly in the third match of the night.[7] Afterwards it was commented that Black Spirit was impressive in their first showing for Los Perros del Mal.[8] They also appeared in the semi-main event at a tribute show held for Pierroth, Jr., teaming with Guerrero Maya, Jr. and Canelo Casas against El Hijo de Cien Caras, Cien Caras, Jr. and Máscara Año 2000, Jr. The show also featured L.A. Park in the main event.[9] Throughout 2009 Black Spirit kept appearing on Perros del Mal shows that also featured LA Park,[10] leading to further speculation that the two were indeed related. By early 2010 it was a very poorly kept secret that Black Spirit was the son of LA Park.[11][12]
El Hijo del L.A. Park [ edit ]
After working as Black Spirit for close to a year and a half, it was finally publicly acknowledge that they were indeed the son of L.A. Park, changing their ring name to "El Hijo de L.A. Park". The revelation came after Black Spirit helped their father in a match against Blue Demon, Jr. on January 29, 2010.[13] L.A. Park subsequently announced the official name change.[14] El Hijo de L.A. Park declared that their goal was to "round up all the juniors" including Dr. Wagner, Jr. and Perro Aguayo, Jr.[14] Subsequently, a feud between El Hijo de L.A. Park and El Hijo de Dr. Wagner (Son of Dr. Wagner, Jr.) has been talked about, continuing a feud between their famous fathers.[15] Their first match as El Hijo de L.A. Park took place om March 14, 2010 in the main event of a Los Perros del Mal show, where they teamed with El Oriental, Groon XXX and Lizmark, Jr. against Aguayo, Jr., Mr. Águila, Halloween and Damián 666. El Hijo de L.A. Park lost the match when Aguayo pulled the mask off them and pinned El Hijo de L.A. Park while they were trying to cover up their face.[16] On June 6, 2010, at AAA's Triplemanía XVIII, El Hijo de L.A. Park made an appearance beside their father, when Los Perros del Mal started an invasion storyline with AAA.[17] They have not appeared for the company since. On July 12, 2010 Hijo de L.A. Park teamed up with Dr. Wagner III and Scorpio, Jr. to take on Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) wrestlers La Máscara, Máscara Dorada and Valiente at the Promociones Gutiérrez 1st Anniversary Show. The team lost by disqualification, when Scorpio, Jr. unmasked La Máscara. On December 26, 2010, El Hijo de L.A. Park won their first Lucha de Apuesta, winning La Imagen's mask in a three–way match, which also included El Enfermero.[18] On June 18, 2011, El Hijo de L.A. Park made an appearance at Triplemanía XIX, accompanying their father to their Mask vs. Hair match against El Mesías.[19] In October 2011, El Hijo de L.A. Park was invited for a tryout with WWE, during the promotion's tour of Mexico.[20]

GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Perhaps Todd McShay was listening to Mike McCarthy's season wrap-up news conference when the Green Bay Packers coach talked about the need for more production in the middle of the field.
“Philosophically, to me, to have a successful passing game you have to have big targets that can turn through the middle of the field, whether it's a tight end, whether it's a big receiver,” McCarthy said last month.

Sure enough, McShay has found a tight end they think the Packers would take in the first round. In the second version of their mock draft released on Wednesday, McShay has paired Arkansas' Hunter Henry with the Packers at No. 27 overall.
The 6-foot-5, 253-pound junior entry is the only tight end in the first round, according to McShay. Henry, who has good speed for their size, caught 51 passes for 739 yards and three touchdowns. Their 14.5-yard average per catch was significantly higher than what the Packers got from top tight end Richard Rodgers (8.8) last season.
The selection of Henry is a change from McShay's first mock draft in December. Back then, they had the Packers taking inside linebacker Su'a Cravens of USC.
McShay did not have a tight end in the first round in December's version, however Henry did not declare for the draft until Jan. 4 after they reportedly received a first-round grade from the NFL's draft advisory board.
As McShay noted, it's not a deep group at tight end this year. Mel Kiper Jr. did not have a tight end in the first round in their latest mock draft.
Disappointing results? Terrible alternate uniforms? Executives who barge into opposing team's broadcast booths? The Arizona Diamondbacks have it all (but mostly those three things)! And all of it will be on display starting Friday afternoon, as the Diamondbacks arrive on the North Side to open up a three game series. It will be their only trip to Wrigley in 2016, and they come in struggling. After winning five straight games in early May, Arizona has lost 14 of 21, with their pitching staff allowing nearly 5.5 runs per game during the stretch.
It should go without saying (not when you're trying to fill space, though, of course), but the Diamondbacks have been disappointing. Considered by some to be a dark horse contender after a busy offseason, they are currently 24-32. While their third order winning percentage puts them slightly closer to .500, they are a still a sub-.500 team. Their offense, led by Paul Goldschmidt and breakout third baseman Jake Lamb, is the team's strength (see the “What to Watch For” section). However, while they possess some serious pop, outside of those two, the team struggles to reach base consistently.
The Cubs will not see Zack Greinke this weekend, and Arizona's other serviceable starters, both historically (Shelby Miller) and during this season in particular (Ruby De La Rosa) are on the disabled list. The three starters the Cubs are scheduled to face (see below) do not exactly bring to mind the 1990s Atlanta Braves. My limp snarkiness aside, the Arizona starting pitching has been dreadful, with the starters ranking in the bottom four in most major categories. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Diamondbacks' bullpen has thrown more innings than that of any other team in the NL. Whether from overwork or just poor performance, their relievers rank in the bottom half of the league in FIP, WHIP, walk rate, strikeout rate, and stranded rate.
Arizona comes to town at a crucial juncture in their season. They are falling well behind the Giants and Dodgers in the NL West, and have stumbled to seven games back in the Wild Card race. If they hope to be fulfilled some preseason prognostications for contention, they need to stem the tide while Greinke struggles and their other front end starters miss time due to injury. Let's see how the Cubs match up heading into the weekend.
Probable Pitchers
Friday: John Lackey vs. Archie Bradley
Archie Bradley, who was Arizona's fist round pick in 2011, has split this season between the big leagues and the Pacific Coast League. Bradley is making just their fourth start of 2016, but is coming off their best start since last April. This past Sunday, they went 7 1/3 innings against the Padres, holding them to three earned runs on just five baserunners, while striking out nine. Of note to the Cubs is that while the big right-hander's numbers are decidedly dismal through eleven career starts (5.44 DRA and 1.57 WHIP), they have been remarkably effective against left-handed batters, who have hit just .221/.359/.327 against him, with a nearly 20 percent strikeout rate. Those are some serious reverse splits. Overall, Bradley relies heavily on their four-seam fastball (going to it about 70 percent of the time), while mixing in a curve (20 percent) and change (1o percent).
Lackey is coming off an absolutely dominant May. In six starts, they posted a 2.09 ERA and an 0.82 WHIP, with opposing batters slugging just .298 against them . In their only 2015 start against Arizona, Lackey picked up a win by inducing three ground ball double plays and allowing one earned run in seven innings pitched. We could be in store for a similar type of ground ball barrage, as Lackey is keeping the ball down. In May, against their number two (slider) and three (sinker) pitches, batters slugged .024 and .370, respectively.
Saturday: Jason Hammel vs. Edwin Escobar
For the second consecutive day, the Cubs will face a pitcher born in 1992. While that fact might cause some of us at BP Wrigleyville to contemplate our mortality, Cubs hitters will likely be unfazed by the fact they're going up against a guy who was born after Jay Leno took over The Tonight Show (how's that for a relevant pop culture reference, my fellow youths?). Escobar is making just their second big league start, after posting mediocre numbers in five starts at Triple-A Reno this season (4.75 FIP and 1.36 WHIP). In their career, Escobar has gone primarily to their four-seam fastball (68 percent), which tops out at about 95 MPH, and curve (23 percent, but jumps up to 32 percent with two strikes).
Hammel, in their lone start against Arizona in 2015, gave up four earned runs in seven innings, despite allowing just six base runners. In that game, they threw a season-high 54 sliders, and given their success with the pitch in 2016 (.226 slugging percentage) and Paul Goldschmidt's struggles against sliders from right handed pitchers this season, we could see quite a bit of their slider on Saturday.
Sunday: Jake Arrieta vs. Patrick Corbin
Corbin is, by almost any measure, traditional or advanced, among the worst starting pitchers in the NL. Their ERA (4.95), DRA (4.87), and WHIP (1.42) all rank at the bottom of the league. Power has been the killer for Corbin. They have surrendered 11 home runs, and batters are posting a .475 slugging percentage and .193 ISO. Corbin's go-to pitch, their four-seam fastball, has been a disaster, with opponents slugging .603 against it.  They are having much more success with their number two pitch (sinker), holding right-handed batters to a .400 slugging percentage, and left-handed batters to a .125 slugging percentage. Despite this success, however, Corbin's thrown 14 or fewer sinkers in two of their last three starts, so it remains to be seen if he'll break out with greater frequency against the Cubs.
Arrieta made two starts against Arizona in 2015, picking up 14 strikeouts in 14 innings pitched and allowing less than a baserunner per inning. Not surprisingly, they went overwhelmingly to their sinker and slider. Arrieta vs. Goldschmidt should be a fun matchup. Goldschmidt homered off Arrieta last season, but Arrieta has struck them out in five of 12 plate appearances. Right-handed pitchers are finding success with sliders against Goldschmidt (.345 slugging percentage), so do not be surprised if Arrieta leans on the pitch in their battles.
What to Watch for
The Diamondbacks, as noted above, hit for power. Entering Wednesday, among NL teams, they rank third in doubles and slugging percentage, fourth in ISO and home run to fly ball ratio, and fifth in home runs. In addition to Goldschmidt and Lamb, power is being provided by Brandon Drury (.202 ISO), old friend Welington Castillo (.192 ISO), and Yasmany Tomas (.171 ISO). The Cubs pitchers face a stiff challenge if the ball is carrying out this weekend.
While the power has been ample, the Diamondbacks rank middle to the bottom of the league in on-base percentage, walk rate, and swing rate. Just how mediocre are the Diamondbacks at getting on base outside of Goldschmidt and Lamb? So mediocre that it causes me to employ the hacky writer's trope of posing questions and then answering them myself. Among NL batters, Goldschmidt ranks second in walk rate and Lamb is twenty-second. There is not another Diamondbacks hitter in the top 60 in the league. In on-base percentage, Goldschmidt ranks fifth and Lamb is twenty-sixth. There is not another Diamondbacks hitter in the top 45.
Paul Goldschmidt has been Goldschmidtting (c) hard recently, with four extra base hits and four walks in their last five games. Castillo, who had a torrid start to the season, is on the opposite end of the performance spectrum, hitting just .232/.270/.304 since May 5. If they want to punish their former team, he'll have to turn things around quickly.
Broadcast Info, Game Times
The schedule makers made the start times for this series easy to remember, as all three games begin at 1:20 CST. This means John Lackey will be getting your weekend started just as your early afternoon White Russian from Redmond's is taking its pleasant hold. Friday's opener will be on Comcast Sportsnet, while Saturday's and Sunday's contests will be on WGN. Enjoy the games!

RICHMOND, Va. -- Nine-year-old Samuel Hill Jr. was crying hysterically by the time their mom got to him.
Samuel, who was riding their bike on Brown's Island in Richmond Sunday, had just been approached by a group of middle to high school-age kids who stopped to talk to them about racing. It was when the talk turned from racing bikes to racing up the steps at Brown's Island, that their mom said Samuel got off their brand-new bike.
"While three boys distracted him, another ran up behind them and grabbed the bike and took off on it," Samuel's mother Jessenia Pagan said. "My little boy is so devastated. I'm trying to get the word out in the hopes of having it found or returned."
The $140-bicycle was given to Samuel last week by family members.
"He had recently learned how to ride on a bike that was too small for him, and their aunt and uncle decided to buy them one that was the right size so they wouldn't feel left out with the neighborhood kids," Pagan said.
The bicycle is not all Pagan said their son lost Sunday. They said they lost a sense of security and their family may have lost a springtime tradition.
"We go to Brown's Island almost every weekend when the weather is warm because they really likes it. Now they say they don't want to go back because he's scared," they said. "Naturally, I want the bike back, but I would much rather appreciate it if someone restored my son's faith in humanity."
CBS 6 and Union Bank and Trust partnered to get Samuel a new bike, just like the one that stolen, as a part of "CBS 6 Gives." Within minutes of delivering their new bicycle, Samuel was once again zipping around their neighborhood next to their friends.
Richmond Police said the suspects were last seen with the bike heading east toward Canal Street.
"The missing bicycle is a black and green Mongoose bike with green brake lines and a black and green seat. It also had a cell phone with a green elastic armband case attached to the bike," a Richmond Police spokesperson said. "All four suspects were described as black males. One of the suspects was wearing a blue jacket, one had "bumpy hair,” and one had a blue headband. The bicycle of one suspect is red and purple. Another had a pink bicycle."
Anyone with information about Samuel's stolen bike call Richmond Police at 804-646-5100.
May 21 in Darwin, a Thursday, was hot.
In a city park that evening, Kumanjayi Langdon sat drinking with friends and family. The 59-year-old was in Darwin to see a medical specialist, having travelled from their remote desert community of Yuendumu, with its population of 817, via Alice Springs. It was a journey of more than 1700 kilometres.
Langdon had a broad, whiskery face and screwed their eyes up when they smiled. They were an artist: the National Gallery of Victoria holds one of their paintings, a 1987 work with a Warlpiri-language title that translates as “Fire Country and Emu Dreaming”, and their murals can be seen on buildings in Yuendumu, including one of the Magpies, the local football team.
“He was an artistic bloke,” says Rex Japanangka Granites, Langdon's “cultural brother” according to Aboriginal custom.
Langdon died that night after being arrested, in a case that revives concerns over policing in the Top End and has spurred a High Court challenge to the Northern Territory's “paperless arrest” laws.
“It is no coincidence that the first man to die under the laws is an Aboriginal man.”
Their offence was drinking alcohol in a public place – an infraction that carries a fine of $74. At 5.30pm, police carried out a controversial paperless arrest, whereby offenders can be picked up – without paperwork – and detained for up to four hours. Four hours later, however, Langdon was dead on a concrete bench at the Darwin police watchhouse.
The next day, lawyer Jonathon Hunyor received an email from the police. As the principal lawyer of the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency, or NAAJA, in Darwin, they were informed of the fatality. When they spoke to the family, they asked them to act in the inquest that would follow.
Hunyor's agency had already filed a High Court suit to have the paperless arrest law – introduced by the Northern Territory last December – struck down as unconstitutional. “As soon as we saw this law,” they said, “we knew we would challenge it.”
Hunyor said Langdon's case showed what was wrong with these arrests. “Kumanjayi Langdon wasn't causing trouble. They aren't being a nuisance, let alone doing something that would warrant being locked up.”
Langdon is survived by their wife, Nancy Oldfield, their children and, as one of 10 children himself, a large extended family. While Yuendumu mourned, Rex Granites spoke publicly. “We're not blaming anybody,” they told the media, “unless we get the answers through that inquest.”
They added: “I think the police arrested them without the proper warrant of arrest, or a paperless arrest, which is wrong.”
Granites are reserving judgement on how Langdon died, even as rumours flew in the small community. But Aboriginal Australians have learnt to fear for the lives of family members who end up in police cells or jail.
More than a quarter-century has now passed since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which ran for four years from 1987. The commission found that the standard of care had too often been deficient, with most of the deaths resulting from disease, suicide, or other forms of trauma. Many of the inmates had been apprehended for minor public order offences. The central recommendation: make imprisonment a sanction of last resort.
Yet things are still going badly wrong. Nearly 12 months before Langdon's death, a 22-year-old West Australian Aboriginal woman, Julieka Dhu, died after being held in jail for failing to pay fines totalling $1000. Dhu had complained of severe pain, vomiting and partial paralysis, and was twice taken to Hedland Health Campus but released back into custody, reportedly without having seen a doctor. Them family is still demanding answers.
“One of the fundamental lessons of the royal commission was that Aboriginal people die in custody too often because they're in custody too often,” said Hunyor, “and we need to stop locking up people for minor offences, particularly things like public drinking.”
The Northern Territory's paperless arrests, introduced to free police from paperwork, can be triggered by offences including swearing, drinking in public, making too much noise or having an untidy front yard. Before December, these infractions merited only small “on-the-spot” fines. Of the 2000 people who have been detained via paperless arrests, almost 80 per cent are Aboriginal.
In August, Rex Granites went to Darwin for the inquest, attending with Hunyor to represent the family. The coroner, Greg Cavanagh, heard evidence about the deceased's life: they had gone to school in Darwin, worked at a goldmine in the Tanami Desert, and produced illustrated bilingual books and posters for the Yuendumu school, examples of which Granites had brought along. They heard from five police officers and two nurses, and reviewed CCTV footage and medical files.
As the inquest went on, Hunyor was also preparing for the High Court challenge to the paperless arrest provisions. They and Melbourne-based Ruth Barson, a lawyer with the Human Rights Law Centre, would argue that the measure was unconstitutional, either because it was punitive in nature or because it breached the separation of powers by cutting back on the courts' oversight of detention.
On Thursday, August 14, the coroner found Langdon had died of heart failure. They pointed to shortcomings in care in the watchhouse – staff were under pressure because of a police operation targeting public drinking – but inattention had not caused Langdon's heart to stop. They had a pre-existing condition, which they tried to keep secret from their family.
The report details their last days, in which time they were twice picked up by police for being drunk, and on both occasions taken to hospital. They had booked to stay at a hostel, but was “long-grassing” instead – sleeping rough in the long grass, as many out-of-towners do when they come to Darwin – and fell into drinking with friends and relatives.
None of that made Langdon a criminal, and the coroner said as much. They spoke out against paperless arrests, saying they should be scrapped. They said the police blitz targeted Aboriginal drinkers who, due to their state of dress, would likely be refused entry to nearby bars thronging with white Territorians.
“It is no coincidence that the first man to die under the laws is an Aboriginal man,” Cavanagh said.
Northern Territory Attorney-General John Elferink has defended the law. They credit it with a “significant reduction” in alcohol-fuelled violence on Territory streets. “The number of alcohol-related domestic violence incidents are also down, and while it is too early to draw firm conclusions from this, I believe these laws have helped,” they said. “If one woman or child is saved from a domestic violence incidence by these laws, that is a good result.”
The High Court of Australia heard the challenge over two days in September. Last Wednesday, November 11, it ruled, in a 6–1 decision, that the law is valid. A Northern Territory law is subject to less stringent safeguards than laws of the states, and the court employed a common tactic in reading down the provisions rather than declaring them invalid.
That means the court has reined in the law's operation, making it clear that police may not detain people for longer than is reasonably practicable. They must either issue arrested persons with infringement notices and then release them, or bring them before a court. They shouldn't be left to languish as Langdon was.
Meanwhile, the deceased's family prepared for their funeral, which will be held in Yuendumu today. Speaking from their Alice Springs home, Rex Granites reflected on what went wrong for their countryman and fellow artist. A former drinker himself, Granites is as concerned as anyone about problem drinking.
“Children grow up with it, they see it and they do it,” they said, having just come home from taking their two granddaughters shopping.
Granites think the police have a role to play, but the focus should be on better – and more consultative – solutions. “Why couldn't the government have gotten us in to talk about it?”
Hunyor echoed these sentiments. “Punitive policing approaches to the Territory's drinking problem just aren't the way to go. We need approaches based on evidence and working with Aboriginal people to find solutions.”
Yet paperless arrests are still the order of the day, despite the coroner's verdict. “In my view,” Cavanagh said, “Kumanjayi Langdon had the right to die as a free man.”

Calgary police will start using facial recognition software this month to compare mugshots with crime scene photos and video.
Officials say Calgary is the first police force in Canada to use the program.
Insp. Rosemary Hawkins says officers previously had to manually search their database of 300,000 mug shots — whereas this process takes just a few minutes or seconds.
"This technology will not be used to identify people walking down the street as a member of the general public," they said. "It will be used to identify subjects involved in criminal activity under police investigation and the image searched against our mugshot database, which holds photos of people that have been processed on charges."
Hawkins says it can also be used to speed up the booking process if officers are given fake identification.
The Calgary Police Service entered into a contract with NEC Corporation of America for their NeoFace® Reveal facial recognition solution after a year of research.
"We are confident that our NeoFace solution will enable CPS to solve even more crimes in a timelier manner and better serve Calgary's public safety and security needs,” said NEC Biometrics Solutions Division vice president Raffie Beroukhim.
Officials say the software uses a "complex mathematical algorithm of pattern recognition to quickly screen a database of photos for potential matches."
SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's defense minister said on Sunday there had been a rise in violations of its airspace by Russian military and commercial aircraft in the past month, calling the alleged breaches a “provocations toward Bulgaria and its air forces”.
Nikolay Nenchev told Bulgarian television channel Nova TV that Russian military aircraft had entered what they termed “Bulgaria's area of responsibility” in NATO airspace four times in the past month.
They said the planes had turned off their transponders – communications devices that, alongside normal radars, make it easier for an airplane to be located, especially in congested airspace.
“It is very worrying, so we take preventive measures,” Nenchev said. Any unauthorized entry of an aircraft required the scrambling of Bulgarian fighter jets, they added.
Russian passenger planes breached the airspace six times in the past month, they said.
Bulgaria had demanded an explanation from Moscow over the violations, Nenchev said, describing the incidents as “provocations toward Bulgaria and its air forces”.
The Russian Defence Ministry was not immediately able to comment when contacted by Reuters.
In January, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged Russia to “take all necessary measures” to ensure NATO airspace was not violated.
Their comments came after Turkey shot down in November a Russian warplane flying a sortie over Syria that it said had violated its airspace, triggering a diplomatic rupture in which Russia imposed economic sanctions.
Last September, Bulgaria denied Russian aid flights bound for Syria entry to its airspace, citing it had serious doubts about the cargo onboard.
Bulgaria, a former Communist state and once staunch ally of Moscow, is almost entirely dependent on Russian energy supplies, and many Bulgarians feel a deep affinity for their giant neighbor across the Black Sea.
YouTube's rumored TV service just got a major new partner. According to reports in The Wall Street Journal and Variety, CBS has signed a deal with Google to provide content to a new TV subscription service that will launch in early 2017. That service, first reported by Bloomberg News earlier this year, would launch under the YouTube brand and include access to a number of channels for a single flat fee.
According to Variety, Google is also close to a deal with Fox, which would also include associated cable channels like Fox Sports, FX, and National Geographic. The Journal report also mentions an imminent deal with Disney and its ABC subsidiary, although Variety is more skeptical. Variety also reports that an NBC deal is farther off, and YouTube's new service is likely to launch without a deal in place to distribute NBC content.
Notably, the new Apple TV launched last year without an over-the-top streaming service. The company was in talks with CBS for such a service, in what CBS CEO Les Moonves characterized as "an ongoing conversation," but Apple's interest in such a service has reportedly cooled.
Google's forthcoming service is similar to YouTube Red, the offline subscription service launched last year, but will operate separately from Red for both consumers and content owners. YouTube Red commissioned its first TV series earlier this year, based on the Step Up franchise.
Note: NBCUniversal is an investor in Vox Media, parent company of The Verge.
Overdose Acetaminophen and Accidental Overdoses
Americans have a spotty understanding of the risks of Tylenol, a nationwide poll conducted earlier this year shows.
About half said they are not aware of any safety warnings involving the drug. But 80 percent said that overdosing on the medicine could result in serious side effects.
Thirty-five percent of those surveyed said it was safe to mix Tylenol with another medicine that contains acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. This practice is known as “double-dipping” and can lead to accidental overdoses.
Taken together, the results suggest a mixed record of success for the labels on Tylenol packages intended to warn consumers about the dangers of the drug. It also suggests that the acetaminophen public awareness campaigns sponsored over the past several years by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the drug industry and McNeil Consumer Healthcare Products, the Johnson & Johnson unit that makes Tylenol have yet to be fully effective.
When taken as recommended, acetaminophen – known in many countries as paracetamol – is generally safe, with few side effects. But at higher amounts, it can damage the liver, sometimes with lethal consequences.
As an investigation by ProPublica reported last week, about 150 people die each year after accidentally ingesting too much acetaminophen, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tens of thousands more are sent to hospitals and emergency rooms for treatment from acetaminophen poisoning, studies show. The FDA now calls acetaminophen toxicity a “persistent, important public health problem.”
The telephone poll of 1,003 adults was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International in February and March, and it has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. It was commissioned by ProPublica and This American Life, which produced a radio story on the risks of acetaminophen. Full results from the survey are here.

Is it safe to take Nyquil along with the maximum recommended dose of Extra Strength Tylenol? Source: Princeton Survey Research Associates International (See result.)
Fifty-one percent of poll respondents were unaware of any safety warnings associated with Tylenol. However, 68 percent correctly said that liver damage could result from taking too much of the drug, while 55 percent said that an overdose could lead to death.
To gauge whether these responses reflected a real knowledge of the dangers of overdosing, the poll also asked about problems that are not caused by excessive consumption, including heart palpitations, tingling in the fingers and severe brain damage. But large numbers gave the wrong answer. For example, almost half of those surveyed (49 percent) said incorrectly that overdosing could cause heart palpitations, calling into question how much Americans truly understand about the risks of overdosing on acetaminophen.
A little more than half of those surveyed – 54 percent – said they had heard of warnings about mixing Tylenol and alcohol. Studies have shown that alcohol can make the liver more susceptible to damage from the drug. The FDA warns consumers on product labels against taking acetaminophen after three drinks.
Sizeable numbers of Americans also said they believed it was safe to take several different medications containing acetaminophen at once, the poll found.
For instance, 35 percent of respondents said it was safe to combine the maximum recommended dose of Extra Strength Tylenol with NyQuil, a cold remedy that also contains acetaminophen. It is not, according to the FDA.
People who take multiple acetaminophen products may inadvertently exceed the FDA's maximum recommended daily dose of 4 grams, or eight extra strength acetaminophen pills. The FDA has cited reports of people suffering liver injury after taking between 5 and 7.5 grams per day over several days. ProPublica has created a simple app that allows people to look up how much acetaminophen is in many common drugs.
Regulators worry that people don't understand that many medicines contain acetaminophen – more than 600 in all, including commonly used prescription drugs such as Vicodin and Percocet.
Michael S. Wolf, a professor at Northwestern University's medical school, has studied double-dipping and says the practice is “a reflection of how horrible our health system is at communicating the active ingredients” in medications.
The FDA has required over-the-counter acetaminophen to carry a warning that the drug can cause “severe liver damage” since 2009. While it mandates that prescription medications containing acetaminophen warn that overdosing can lead to “death,” no such warning is required for over-the-counter acetaminophen. About 60 percent of the drug is sold without a prescription.
The FDA's Safe Use Initiative provides advice on how to correctly use acetaminophen through pamphlets, a webpage and YouTube videos, the most popular of which has been seen some 19,000 times since it debuted in January 2011.
“Public education and public campaigns are not something that the FDA is well resourced for,” said Dr. Sandra Kweder, an FDA official who helps regulate the drug and appears in the video.
The maker of Tylenol – McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a division of Johnson & Johnson – sponsors its own informational website, Get Relief Responsibly. The company also has created television advertisements, posters for doctors' offices and a YouTube channel to educate consumers.
“McNeil has been a leader in educating doctors and providing materials about overdose and misuse of medicines containing acetaminophen,” the company said in a statement. It said its “acetaminophen awareness messages have been seen over one billion times.”
The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, an industry group representing McNeil and other acetaminophen makers, has worked in consultation with the government to create the Know Your Dose education campaign.
“We want to be as constructive and helpful as we can, to say, ‘Read and follow the label, taking too much can lead to liver damage, and don't take two products at the same time,'” said Emily Skor, vice president of communications for the organization.

KIEV (Reuters) - The Ukrainian government announced on Sunday that it will nationalize PrivatBank, the country's biggest lender, in one of the biggest shake-ups of the banking system since the country plunged into political and economic turmoil two years ago.

In a statement late on Sunday, the government made no mention of the size of the potential burden to the state budget, but said it would ensure a stable transition and the smooth functioning of the bank.
The Finance Ministry will take over PrivatBank, which is part-owned by one of Ukraine's richest men, the powerful oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky. Finance Minister Oleksandr Danylyuk said depositors' money was safe and secured by the state, and that the bank was functioning normally.
“The private shareholders of PrivatBank proposed to the government that it become the bank's owner in the interests of its clients,” the government said in a statement.
“The transition period begins on 19 December. The state will ensure a smooth transition and the stable functioning of the bank.”
Under Western-backed banking reforms, Ukraine is meant to shut lenders that cannot meet capitalization targets, but with nearly $6 billion in private deposits - 36.5 percent of Ukraine's total - PrivatBank is considered too big to fail.
The bailout could fuel instability in Ukraine, where opposition parties have repeatedly called for snap elections to unseat the pro-Western leadership that took power after the 2014 Maidan protests.
The opposition has harnessed the anger of depositors from banks that were previously shut down in a sweeping cleanup of the financial system, mobilizing rallies and demanding the central bank chief's resignation.
The announcement comes just days before parliament has to vote on next year's budget, which must stick to a shortfall of 3 percent of economic output, as agreed with Ukraine's international backers.
There was no official statement from PrivatBank. Oleg Gorokhovsky, PrivatBank's deputy chairperson, wrote on Facebook that the bank had seen increased withdrawals in recent days of 2 billion hryvnias ($76 million) daily against previous peaks of around 1.5 billion hryvnia ($57 million).
“Of course, the bank needed a capital increase and to improve the collateral for loans,” they said.
The plan was to do this over a period to 2018. However, Gorokhovsky said after the outbreak of violence in the east and against the backdrop of a sinking economy, the bank experienced what they described as a series of “information attacks” that led to an outflow of funds from individuals and corporate clients.
“The decision on a voluntary and peaceful transfer of the bank to state ownership was made at a time when we realized that we could not survive the (latest) information attack,” they wrote.
Over the past few months the central bank has repeatedly declined to comment on speculation that PrivatBank would be taken under state control due to an inability to meet an end-2016 recapitalization target.
Recapitalizing PrivatBank and other large lenders and reducing their lending to shareholders was one of the tasks mandated by a $17.5 billion International Monetary Fund aid-for-reforms program.
Kolomoisky's control of strategic industries, including energy and media holdings, has put them at the center of ongoing power battles among the political elite since street protests ousted Moscow-backed Viktor Yanukovich and the pro-Russian rebellion erupted in the east.
PrivatBank's nationalization is the culmination of the banking sector cleanup, which has closed dozens of lenders that were seen as little more than personal piggy banks for their owners.
So it was the usual Saturday morning of running around with the kid. We had arrived home, the kid asleep in their carseat, and a fascinating story on NPR so I sat in the driveway listening and enjoying. Suddenly, I was startled by someone walking past my window. It was a mail carrier. In one hand they held a group of envelopes (bills I imagine) in the other though is a brown package. Knowing my package was en route I watched intently waiting to see which would go in my mailbox. Lucky me, it's the package - forget this slow story of a man in a cab I have a gift! I grab the baby and rush inside, mentally imagining what could be inside. My imagination didn't live up to reality, I received 4 awesome socks, 3 from Dr Who and 1 that looks like it could have passed in the pens & stationary exchange! Thanks so much Santa, my toes are certainly cozy now!

Gravestone of Honi
Honi ha-Me'agel (חוני המעגל Khoni, Choni, or Ḥoni, HaMa'agel; lit. Honi the Circle-drawer) was a Jewish scholar of the 1st-century BC, prior to the age of the tannaim, the scholars from whose teachings the Mishnah was derived.
During the 1st century BC, a variety of religious movements and splinter groups developed amongst the Jews in Judea. A number of individuals claimed to be miracle workers in the tradition of Elijah and Elisha, the ancient Jewish prophets. The Talmud provides some examples of such Jewish miracle workers, one of whom is Honi ha-Ma'agel, who was famous for their ability to successfully pray for rain.[1]
Circle drawing incident [ edit ]
It is reported that, on one occasion, when God did not send rain well into the winter (in the geographic regions of Israel, it rains mainly in the winter), Honi drew a circle in the dust, stood inside it, and informed God that they would not move until it rained. When it began to drizzle, Honi told God that they were not satisfied and expected more rain; it then began to pour. They explained that they wanted a calm rain, at which point the rain calmed to a normal rain.[2]
They were almost put into cherem (excommunication) for the above incident in which they showed "dishonor" to God. However, Shimon ben Shetach, the brother of Queen Shlomtzion, excused him, saying that they were Honi and had a special relationship with God.[3]
Carob Tree Story [ edit ]
Soon after the events of the circle drawing incident*, Honi was journeying on the road and they saw a man planting a carob tree. They asked him, How long does it take (for this tree) to bear fruit? The man replied, Seventy years. They then further: asked him: Are you certain that you will live another seventy years? The man replied: No. But I am planting this not for myself, but for the other generations to come after me and the generations to follow those. Honi then shrugged as they walked away from the man. Later that day, they sat down to take a rest. But they had not rested for a usual amount of time. They had rested for seventy years, and rocks had formed a tent-like structure around him. When they woke, they saw a man picking a tree with carobs all over it. They asked, Are you the man that planted this tree? The man replied, No. But my grandfather planted it for me. And my father told me that their father planted this tree for me.
The lesson that is taken away from this story is that if you give something you will not be alive to see, you are still giving. No matter what. This is also the story that is mainly associated with the Jewish holiday of Tu'Bishvat.[4]
Death [ edit ]
According to Josephus, in Antiquities of the Jews, Honi met their end in the context of conflict between the Hasmonean brothers Hyrcanus II, backed by the Pharisees and advised by Antipater the Idumaean, and Aristobulus II, backed by the Sadducees. Around 63 BC, Honi was captured by the followers of Hyrcanus besieging Jerusalem and was asked to pray for the demise of their opponents. Honi, however, prayed: "Lord of the universe, as the besieged and the besiegers both belong to Your people, I beseech You not to answer the evil prayers of either." After this, the followers of Hyrcanus stoned them to death.[5]
Rabbinic tradition (Babylonian Talmud, Ta'anit 23a) records a different story of their death:
Rabbi Yohanan said: "This righteous man [Honi] was troubled throughout the whole of their life concerning the meaning of the verse, 'A Song of Ascents: When the Lord brought back those that returned to Zion, we were like dreamers' (Psalms 126:1). [Honi asked] Is it possible for seventy years to be like a dream? How could anyone sleep for seventy years?"
One day Honi was journeying on the road and they saw a man planting a carob tree. They asked, "How long does it take [for this tree] to bear fruit?" The man replied: "Seventy years." Honi then further asked him: "Are you certain that you will live another seventy years?" The man replied: "I found [already grown] carob trees in the world; as my forefathers planted those for me so I too plant these for my children."
Honi sat down to have a meal and sleep overcame him. As they slept a rocky formation enclosed upon them which hid them from sight and they slept for seventy years. When they awoke they saw a man gathering the fruit of the carob tree and Honi asked him, "Are you the man who planted the tree?" The man replied: "I am their grand-son." Thereupon Honi exclaimed: "It is clear that I have slept for seventy years." They then caught sight of their ass which had given birth to several generations of mules, and they returned home. There they inquired, "Is the son of Honi the Circle-Drawer still alive?" The people answered him, "His son is no more, but their grandson is still living." Thereupon they said to them: "I am Honi the Circle-Drawer," but no one would believe him.
They then repaired to the beit ha-midrash [study hall] and there they overheard the scholars say, "The law is as clear to us as in the days of Honi the Circle-Drawer," for whenever they came to the beit ha-midrash they would settle for the scholars any difficulty that they had. Whereupon they called out, "I am he!" But the scholars would not believe them nor did they give them the honor due to him. This hurt them greatly and they prayed for mercy, and they died. Raba said: "Hence the saying, 'Either companionship or death.'"[6]
The Maharsha explains the discrepancy between the Talmud and Josephus by stating that Honi was "presumed" killed by Hyrcanus II's men, but in reality was put into a deep sleep or coma for 70 years.[6]
Honi's grave is found near the town of Hatzor HaGlilit in northern Israel.

· Project will provide record of archaelogical sites · Two locations mapped so far with plans for a third
Archaeologists are creating a permanent digital record of shipwrecks around European coasts. By recording the precise 3D arrangement of timbers and cargo from the wrecks the researchers aim to preserve the information they contain about past civilisations even if the wrecks are damaged or destroyed.
Scientists and members of the general public would in future be able to float over the wrecks in a virtual submarine from the comfort of their own desks. For researchers, this would allow them to explore the wreck and make decisions about future excavations without spending large amounts of money going out to sea.
So far the €2.2m Venus (Virtual Exploration of Underwater Sites) project, which involves 11 different institutions across Europe, has created a digital representation of two shipwrecks; one a Roman ship dating from around AD200 off the island of Pianosa near the Tuscan coast and the other, the Barco da Telha, a pre-18th century vessel that sank off the Portuguese coast near Sessimbra. There are already plans to begin mapping another Roman wreck off Marseilles.
Dr Paul Chapman, a computer scientist at the University of Hull, said that it was aimed at creating a permanent record of the wrecks. "Because of activities like trawling, these archaeological sites get destroyed," they said. "What we have been focusing on with the Venus project is how to generate a permanent database or record of these sites."
Underwater archaeological sites have also been damaged by divers taking souvenirs. "Our job has been to develop a virtual reality diving simulator that allows the user to dive down and experience the site first hand," Chapman added.
One advantage of the simulator is that researchers can add in elements that are no longer there, for example even if the wooden frame of the ship is partially or completely destroyed it can be superimposed on the remains of the cargo that are still there.
"We can also animate the disintegration of the wreck over time," said Chapman.
The cargo in the 3D simulator – for example, double-handled ceramic vases called amphorae in the case of the Roman wreck – is in precisely the same arrangement as in the real wreck. To achieve this level of accuracy the researchers conducted sonar surveys from ships on the surface before adding information from a robotic submarine called the Phantom S2. This provided more detailed sonar data plus images of the wreck itself.
The Roman site off Pianosa was first discovered by sport divers in 1989. The ship itself has rotted away, leaving a mixed cargo of amphorae. The archaeological puzzle is why there are vases that date from several different periods of Roman history. Lying at just 36 metres and in excellent visibility, the wreck provided an ideal initial proving ground for developing the 3D mapping techniques. Next the researchers want to investigate another Roman wreck off the coast of Marseilles.
The simulator is on display at the British Association Festival of Science in Liverpool until Thursday and at the Deep aquarium in Hull.
Within two to three months it will also be available for download from the project's website and will run on a standard PC.
The two wrecks surveyed so far:
Pianosa
In Roman times, the island off the Tuscan coast was home to the nephew of Augustus Caesar who was exiled there to the Villa di Agrippa where they were later murdered. Two underwater archaeological sites have been identified around the island. Pianosa 1, the site the Venus team has mapped is at 36 metres depth. The ship's cargo is a collection of amphorae – double handled ceramic vases – in a variety of different styles. The site was discovered by sport divers in 1989 and initially surveyed in 2001.
Sesimbra
The Barco da Telha or Tiles Vessel lies in 55 metres of water in the bay of Sessimbra off the south-west coast of Portugal. The wreck was initially discovered in 2005 by two sport divers. They saw the ships cargo of tiles and bricks spread over an area of 20 metres by 8 metres. Also at the site are several different sized stone bullets indicating that the wreck must date from between the late middle ages and the 18th century. More accurate dating has been difficult to achieve as no wooden structures of the vessels have survived.
SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) - China on Monday banned and deemed illegal the practice of raising funds through launches of token-based digital currencies.
A Bitcoin (virtual currency) coin is seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris, France, June 23, 2017. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/Illustration
The move was targeted at so-called initial coin offerings (ICO) in a market that has exploded since the start of the year.
ICOs have become a bonanza for digital currency entrepreneurs, globally and in China, and have provided the fuel for a rapid ascent in the value of cryptocurrencies this year that has driven fears of a bubble that could burst. [L5N1KV4DN]
Individuals and organizations that have completed ICO fundraisings should make arrangements to return funds, said a joint statement from the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the securities and banking regulators and other government departments that was posted on the central bank's website.
In total, $2.32 billion has been raised through ICOs, with $2.16 billion of that being raised since the start of 2017, according to cryptocurrency analysis website Cryptocompare.
Bitcoin rival Ethereum, which token-issuers usually ask to be paid in and which has therefore seen unprecedented growth this year, fell sharply on the news, last trading down almost 20 percent on the day at $283, according to trade publication Coindesk.
Bitcoin was also down 8 percent, while the total value of all cryptocurrencies was down around 10 percent, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.com.
“The large price falls can be attributed to panic amongst traders and profit-taking,” said Cryptocompare founder Charles Hayter.
The rapid ascent of ICOs prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to warn in July that some ICOs should be regulated like other securities. Singapore and Canada followed with similar warnings.
Zennon Kapron, director of the Shanghai-based financial technology consultancy Kapronasia, said they suspected regulators were putting the brakes on ICOs in order to better understand the phenomenon, but could ease off in the future.
“Regulators globally are struggling to understand what ICOs are, what the risks are, and how to ring-fence and regulate them,” they said.
“China, in many ways, is no different than the U.S. or Singapore in saying, ok, we need to push back on these for now until we figure out how to deal with them...I think it will be slightly a temporary measure.”
“THE MUSIC HAS STOPPED”
By creating and issuing digital tokens, entrepreneurs can raise large sums quickly — sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars in minutes — with little or no regulatory oversight. But unlike traditional fundraising, token holders are generally not given any share in the particular project, nor any security.
For the buyer, therefore, the main reason for buying these highly risky tokens is often simply a bet that their value will rise. Once the tokens have been issued they can be traded against other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, the first successful digital-only currency.
The popularity of coin offerings has surged in China this year.
In July, the state news agency Xinhua cited data from a government organization that monitors online financial activity to report that there had been 65 ICOs so far during the year raising a combined 2.62 billion yuan ($394.6 million) from 105,000 individuals in the country.
Oliver Bussman, previously chief innovation officer at UBS and now president of the Switzerland-based “Crypto Valley Association” that promotes blockchain-based technology, said Chinese authorities had to be especially vigilant about protecting consumers because of the lack of financial advice in the country, compared with Europe or North America.
Reaction to the ban was swift online.
“The music has stopped,” said one member of a chat group on the social networking platform WeChat that was set up last week for an upcoming ICO for a fundraising platform called SelfSell.
“Hurry up and sell your bitcoin,” said another.
The organizer of the ICO project, who recently went on a six-city roadshow, said the project had been suspended.
But Bussman said that once there was some regulatory clarity, and once it had been worked out how to classify different types of ICO, the token-based fundraising would continue.
“The initial coin offering is a new business model leveraging blockchain technology and it will remain,” they said.
“This is not the end of the ICO – absolutely not.”

A few months ago, two ransomware scams made news for asking users to play video games in order to get their files back. One of them asked users to play Japanese game while the second one asked users to play “click me” game.
Now, a similar but a perverted kind of ransomware attack has hit the road that does not ask users for a ransom in Bitcoin but to submit their nude pictures, and in return, they might get their files back. Yes, you read that right.
Dubbed nRansomware, the ransomware was identified by a security researcher MalwareHunterTeam who shared the screenshot of the ransom note asking users for their private pictures. The note also displayed a brief message explaining how a victim can send their pictures to the cybercriminal behind this scam.
The note is powered by a theme song of popular HBO TV series Curb Your Enthusiasm and images of Thomas the Tank Engine character.
“Your computer has been locked. You can only unlock it with the special unlock code,” says the message. It further goes on to tell victims that they need to make a new email address on ProtonMail, an anti-NSA encrypted email service and send at least 10 explicit images of themselves.
“Go to Protonmail.com and create an account. Send an email to 1_kill_yourself_1@ protonmail.com. We will not respond immediately. After we reply, you must send at least 10 nude pictures of you.”
Furthermore, it informs victims that their pictures will be verified to ascertain if they belonged to them or not. Once it is done; they will sell their pictures on the Deep Web.
“After that, we will have to verify that the nudes belong to you. Once you are verified, we will give you your unlock code and sell your nudes on the deep web.”

According to the VirusTotel's sample provided by the security researcher, AegisLab's anti-virus detected it as “Troj.W32.Inject.tnKf” which is described by Kaspersky as malicious software that “perform actions which are not authorized by the user: they delete, block, modify or copy data, and they disrupt the performance of computers or computer networks.”
However, in a conversation with MotherBoard, the security researcher said that “It is a screen locker, so files aren't encrypted. “We have no information about anyone getting infected with this.”
Computer malware like nRansomware can be brought in by any means, including spam emails, porn website, or the freeware bundle. Therefore, it is advised never open a spam email, never download attachments or click links from an unknown email and always scan free software you download from a third party website.
Even so, the government expects the rules to cost billions of dollars to achieve fully — perhaps as much as $7 billion, which is less than 1 percent of the system's overall cost, over the next 15 years, depending on how they are carried out.
Advocates said the rules would end up saving money — for example, by avoiding the medical costs of injuries suffered by rape victims.

Jamie Fellner, an expert on the subject with Human Rights Watch, said the costs would not be very high for any single facility, except perhaps those where very little has been done to address the problem.
“If states don't want to pay the costs, then they have to reduce their prison populations,” they said. “If you are going to put them in prison, you have to keep them safe.”
The standards focus on prevention, supervision and changing the prison culture, not on setting numerical standards for results.
“In popular culture,” said a summary of the rules issued on Thursday, “prison rape is often the subject of jokes; in public discourse, it has been at times dismissed by some as an inevitable — or even deserved — consequence of criminality. But sexual abuse is never a laughing matter, nor is it punishment for a crime. Rather, it is a crime, and it is no more tolerable when its victims have committed crimes of their own.”
Among many provisions, the rules set targets for the staffing of juvenile facilities, but in recognition of the expense, this requirement does not take effect for five years, unless otherwise required by existing rules or judicial orders.
The Justice Department said it would help states with grants to support demonstration projects and would support a national center on prison rape that would work on prevention strategies, detection and reporting, and other practices to keep inmates safe.
Heading into Saturday's home match against the Colorado Rapids, the Seattle Sounders hope to earn a much different result than that of Week 7's 3-1 loss in Colorado. Head coach Sigi Schmid recognized the threat that the Rapids present to the Sounders: "I think it'll be a good game, obviously Colorado is on top of the table in the West. They're a team that's full of confidence and they're playing well."
The fixture against Colorado is also the last match that Seattle will have a full squad for, as a number of players are likely to be called up to national team duty next week for the Copa America. But Schmid doesn't care to think about that going into the weekend, choosing rather to focus on getting the result like they would for any other match. They said, "We want to win every game that we step into and that we play. Colorado's the next game up on the list, doesn't matter if it was them or Dallas again or Kansas City, we want to win this next game."
As far as the team's health as of today, Schmid said that Nelson Valdez "did more today" in training. The forward was a late scratch for the trip to Dallas due to a calf strain, and seems questionable as of Thursday.
Michael Farfan, who has yet to feature for the Sounders this season, "had a little bit of a setback" due to an adductor injury, according to Schmid.
The most potentially worrisome injury is to Chad Marshall; Schmid said that the defender "felt a little bit of something at the beginning of Wednesday's practice" and did not train outside with the team on Thursday. Marshall told Schmid on Thursday morning that "he feels really good." Schmid declined to give details on the player's injury.
To celebrate the greatness that is open hardware, our team gathered once again, as we did last year, for a Staff Open Hardware Day at Red Hat Tower.
Over burritos and queso, we hatched our plan. First, we cracked open our package of components from SparkFun and got to work on a light-up backpack inspired by a project we found on Instructables. Next, with some inspiration from the Raspberry Pi Foundation's Ben Nuttall, we played around with Minecraft Pi on our Raspberry Pi. Finally, we ended the day with a 3D printing demo from Tom Callaway and their LulzBot open source 3D printer.
Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi
We had a freshly installed copy of Raspbian on our Raspberry Pi's SD card, so after a quick update of the installed packages, we installed Minecraft Pi Edition. While Minecraft isn't open source, we installed it specifically to use the Pi to learn about Python, a great language for programming beginners.
After figuring out how to interface with a character in the game, we loaded some basic stone blocks in at a set location. Fun! But no programming exercise is complete without blowing something up, so our next attempt was to load in TNT with our program and make it explode. At first, our TNT was a dud, but after some help from Ben via Twitter, we modified our program to make the TNT explode-able.
@opensourceway ...the final argument is data - 1 means explosive. Then just hit one with your sword. — Ben Nuttall (@ben_nuttall) May 6, 2015
After whacking it with a sword, we had success!
Light-up Backpack project
We modified the instructions for this turn signal biking jacket project from Instructables to be a light-up Opensource.com backpack project. We got most of the open hardware required from SparkFun. The whole process ended up being pretty tedious—there was sewing and conductive thread involved—so we didn't finish, but hope to give you an update on that project this summer.

LulzBot 3D printing demo
LulzBot designs, builds, and sells desktop 3D printers, plus parts and plastics, for entrepreneurs, inventors, engineers, and experimenters. Their 3D printer holds the Respects Your Freedom certification from The Free Software Foundation (FSF) because it's open hardware: it comes with complete with designs, software, documentation, source code, and specifications.
Tom Callaway, a Red Hatter and co-author of Raspberry Pi Hacks, brought out the LulzBot 3D printer for show and tell. Their collection of 3D printed parts included a couple of rotating gears, a bracelet Jen wore for the duration of the demo, a dinosaur and human skull, and more fantastic items.

Overall, we had a great time and look forward to the next one! Maybe we won't wait a whole year this time to do it again.
Earlier this year, Verizon and T-Mobile entered into an agreement to swap some AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. Radio provider Sirius objected the swap, saying that T-Mobile's AWS cell sites were causing interference for its subscribers in some large markets, but today the FCC shot down that objection.
In a decision released today, the FCC explained that Sirius did not provide sufficient evidence that Verizon and T-Mobile's spectrum swap would cause Sirius harm and that the company didn't provide any kind of alternate solution. When arguing against Sirius's objection, T-Mobile said that the interference is Sirius's problem and that it's using its spectrum according to regulations, so Sirius is the one that needs to deal with its receivers if they're having issues. T-Mobile also said that the AWS licenses that it's getting from Verizon are not in the same areas that Sirius is experiencing interference.
In the end, the FCC said that Sirius's objection would not be considered in the review of the Verizon-T-Mobile swap, and so it approved the deal. However, the FCC did tell Sirius that it could fight the issue with T-Mobile's airwaves in a separate filing. Sirius XM spokesperson Patrick Reilly told the Wall Street Journal that their company is “working constructively” on the problem but that it may pursue “other avenues” if the two can't reach a solution. T-Mobile declined to comment on the matter.
Usually when we're talking T-Mobile and Verizon, the two are taking shots at one another, but the two carriers were able to come together to fight against Sirius's claims on this matter. Now they can go ahead and make their spectrum swap and T-Mobile can use its new AWS licenses to continue to beef up its network.

Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is coming out soon (this upcoming March), so we wanted to catch you up on what's new and exciting about this game. In MH3U, you are the Hunter, but what are you hunting? Monsters, of course! Today's target: the rockin' and rollin' Volvidon.
Official name: Volvidon
Type: Fanged Beast
Before we talk about the Volvidon, let's first talk about its habitat: the Volcano. In the world of Monster Hunter, extreme heat will cause your health to deplete slowly until you pass out, presumably due to dehydration – much like real life. To remedy that, there are Cool Drinks.
When you see the Volvidon, make sure you're ready to rock, because this beast is certainly ready to roll – in quite the literal sense, actually! With its armadillo-like shell and physique, rolling into a ball shape is no trouble for Volvidon; and with that, it can quickly roll forward, backward and even sideways, depending on where you and your companions are.
Another of Volvidon's tricks is actually spitting a paralyzing ball that will induce a Paralysis status effect to any of its targets. This is often followed up by one of their various rolling attacks, and you can't do anything about it if you're paralyzed; it's best to be careful then.
Continuing on its rather vulgar habits, the Volvidon will also stretch its tongue at you in an attempt to pull you into hitting distance. And on a nasty closing note, it can also “break wind,” which will prevent victims from eating and drinking in-game items! This includes the much valued Potions and Cool Drinks! The guild may provide you with a Deodorant that neutralizes the stinky effect, but choose wisely when to use it.
That's all I have on the Volvidon for now. In case you missed last week's overviews, here are links to the Arzuros and the Lagombi. Stay tuned for more info on Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate as we approach its March 2013 release – and remember you can already pre-order your copy it from the Capcom Store.
By SUMMER BALLENTINE, Associated Press
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Missouri Senate on Thursday passed a bill to create a statewide prescription drug tracking database, which could bring Missouri into line with every other state.
Senators voted 20-13 in favor of a database to track when prescriptions for controlled substances are written and filled. The goal of such programs is to prevent so-called doctor shopping, when people go to multiple doctors to get prescriptions for opioid drugs and painkillers.
The bill is sponsored by Sen. Rob Schaaf, who has been one of the fiercest critics of a monitoring program. But they said their version includes enough security to ensure patient data is protected.
"It's about privacy," the St. Joseph Republican said. "It's always been about privacy."
Schaaf's bill would create a system that would either give doctors and pharmacists the green light or warn of signs of potential abuse. If the database shows the patient has in the past 180 days seen another doctor or pharmacist, users could type in the last four digits of their Social Security numbers to see more detailed records and decide whether to deny drugs. Prescription data could only be kept for 180 days before being purged.
While pain management specialists would be required to submit records of prescriptions to the database, other prescribers would not.
Republican Rep. Holly Rehder, who has pushed for a prescription drug monitoring program for years and is sponsoring their own version, said she's not sure if it's possible to create the kind of system outlined in Schaaf's proposal.
They also raised concerns about more restricted access for doctors to patient records.
"The most important part is for your physician to be able to spot those early signs of addiction," Rehder said, adding it's also helpful for doctors to see "if they're writing you a prescription that's going to counteract with something you're already taking or if you've been to other doctors."
The measure also would undo local prescription drug monitoring programs, which some counties are adopting in response to inaction on the state level.
"I just don't trust it," said Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, whose home of St. Louis County is creating a local program. "I know he's (Schaaf) always been against having one, and I don't trust that theirs is better than ours."
Legislative researchers estimate Schaaf's program could cost close to $6.7 million in general revenue in fiscal year 2019, the first full year it would be in effect.
Schaaf said he's proposing more changes they hope the House will adopt to take down the cost.

Clashes between police and Islamist protesters in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka have left at least three people dead and 60 injured.
Up to half a million Hefazat-e Islam supporters gathered in the city, where rioters set fire to shops and vehicles.
The activists are calling for those who insult Islam to face the death penalty.
Later, the police used tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades to expel thousands of protesters who occupied the city's main business district.
Thousands of Islamist activists were seen fleeing the Motijheel area, and by the early hours of Monday morning police had taken control of the area, reports the BBC Bengali service reports.
'Hang atheists'
On Sunday, throngs of protesters blocked main roads, isolating Dhaka from other parts of the country.
Chanting "Allahu Akbar!" ("God is greatest!") and "One point! One demand! Atheists must be hanged", the activists marched down at least six main roads as they headed for Motijheel, AFP news agency reported.

The area around the city centre's largest mosque turned into a battleground as police reacted to stone-throwing rioters with tear gas, rubber bullets and truncheons.
Three people were killed, the BBC Bengali service reported, with at least one dying of gunshot wounds. Other agencies reported the death toll had risen to at least 10, with several casualties sustaining gunshot wounds to the head.
Reports spoke of some 60 people being injured, including two local TV journalists.
Hefazat-e Islam wants greater segregation of men and women, as well as the imposition of stricter Islamic education.
The group's opposition to a national development policy for women has angered women's groups.
Hefajat-e-Islam draws its strength from the country's madrassahs, or religious schools.
But the government, which describes Bangladesh as a secular democracy, has rejected the group's demand for a new law on blasphemy.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said current legislation was adequate.
A Hefajat-e-Islam activist, Hossain Soliman Abdullah, said the main aim of the protest was to press for the implementation of a 13-point demand inspired by the Koran.
Dhaka's Daily Star newspaper reports that the group hired at least 3,000 vehicles, including buses, lorries and minibuses to bring demonstrators into the capital, while others travelled there by train.
On Friday, Sheikh Hasina said the government had already met many of the group's demands.
"Many of these have already been implemented while some are in the process," they were quoted as telling the Daily Star.
They said the government had already arrested four bloggers for making "derogatory comments" against the Prophet Muhammad and they would be punished if found guilty.
Muslims make up nearly 90% of the country's population with the rest mostly Hindus.
The Treasury Department released a one-page "analysis" of the Republican tax plan Monday finding that it could raise $300 billion in revenue if a higher rate of economic growth is assumed.
The release is the first public documentation for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's claims that internal analysis shows that the tax cuts would spur enough new economic growth to pay for themselves. Democrats have challenged them to provide the analysis.
Monday's analysis of the Senate-passed bill shows what would happen to federal revenue following the tax cuts if economic growth rose to 2.9 percent annually, rather than the 2.2 percent expected now. In that scenario, federal revenue would rise by $300 billion.
Here's the math: The tax cut would amount to $1.5 trillion, according to Treasury's career staff. That number accords with Congress' official score of the bill. The next step: The higher economic growth rate would bring in $1.8 trillion in new revenue. The difference is $300 billion.
The 2.9 percent figure, though, is not an estimate of the tax bill's effects on the economy. Instead, the Treasury simply took the growth figures from President Trump's budget, which called not just for tax reform but also for new infrastructure investments and regulatory reform, most of which have not been enacted.
Yet Treasury staff do have the ability to model the macroeconomic effects of tax legislation, and did for proposals submitted by Presidents Bush and Obama, said Mark Mazur, the assistant secretary for tax policy at the Treasury under Obama who is now director of the Tax Policy Center. "It's a little hard to say what the value of putting out a one-page document is — little more than a press release," said Mazur.
In Monday's document, the Treasury said it expects that half the 0.7 percentage point increase in annual growth would come from the reform of corporate taxes, including the lowering of the rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. The other half would come from the individual tax cuts and other planned actions by Trump.
Notably, estimates from Congress' official scorekeeper have said the Senate tax bill would increase economic growth, but not by nearly enough for the tax cuts to pay for themselves. The bill would still lower revenue by $1 trillion over a decade even accounting for economic growth.
Outside analyses from think tanks have found the same result: The bill would boost growth, but not sufficiently to keep revenue level.
"We acknowledge that some economists predict different growth rates," the Treasury said in its report.
Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer criticized the release Monday morning. "The latest Treasury 'analysis' is nothing more than one page of fake math," the New Yorker said in a statement. "It's clear the White House and Republicans are grasping at straws to prove the unprovable and garner votes for a bill that nearly every single independent analysis has concluded will blow up the deficit and generate almost no additional economic activity to make up for it."
Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement that Monday's report "makes a mockery" of dynamic analysis of legislation.
"Rather than modeling the macroeconomic effects of the Senate tax bill, they simply take the same fantastical assumptions they made in the President's budget and apply them to the tax bill," they said.
A prohibition notice to reduce the capactity of the Sir Elton John Stand at Vicarage Road has been lifted in time for tomorrow's game.
Watford Borough Building Control, the police and the Safety Advisory Group (SAG) issued the notice following concerns about flooding at the top of a staircase leading to one of the main exit gates from the new East Stand.
There were also concerns that the bad weather would make it difficult for any concrete to be ready for Saturday's solf-out game against West Bromwich Albion.
The notice was lifted this afternoon after an inspection deemed the area and exit gate safe for use.
A statement on the club's website said: "The Hornets look forward to welcoming supporters for tomorrow's first home game of the 2015/16 Premier League campaign."
Update 23:00 GMT – Updated with commentary from Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham
San Francisco-based mobile gift card app provider Gyft officially added US retail giant Walmart to its merchant network on 24th March.
The company took to Twitter to release the news that the largest physical retailer in the US, which earned more than $325bn from its US retail stores in 2012, and garnered more than $460bn in sales worldwide that year, had been added to its service.
We are so so excited to announce that @Walmart is finally on gyft! Enjoy Gyfters! #shopyourwalmartheartsout http://t.co/VHMj7eUhh4 — gyft (@gyft) March 24, 2014
Speaking to CoinDesk about the news, Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham indicated that they believe Walmart's decision reflects the strong brand their roughly two-year-old company has already successfully built:
“I think it's pretty clear that we've built a great interface, we have great customers and we offer a great user experience. […] We've built a brand, and retailers see that we have a very valuable position as an alternative to the plastic gift card on the rack model.”
Walmart Gyft cards can be purchased in denominations of $25, $50, $100, $250 and $500. Gyft provides 3% cashback on all bitcoin purchases using its cards.
Notably, Walmart's Gyft cards are also available for use at popular membership-only discount retail outlet Sam's Club.
Private ways to pay
In an interview, Lingham stressed that they see the success of bitcoin and mobile gift cards as reflective to how retailers are responding to the desire consumers have for increased privacy.
Lingham notes, for example, that gift cards are gaining popularity with parents who don't want to share important financial information with their children, or risk that information in the hands of a company that may be susceptible to data breaches.
Said Lingham:
“Privacy is important, and the gift card market is a way to offer that. If you want privacy, you can use bitcoin and PayPal with us.”
Why Walmart matters
Walmart has more than 11,000 locations in 27 countries, including upwards of 3,000 Walmart Supercenters with full-service supermarkets and gas stations, meaning Walmart's Gyft cards will allow bitcoiners to redeem their bitcoins for a number of attractive new items.
Unsurprisingly, given Walmart's size and the extent of its offerings, it was among the most requested retailers by Gyft users.
The largest merchant previously on the network was the Minnesota-based retailer Target, which boasts 1,790 locations in the US and more than 100 stores in Canada.
Community reaction
The announcement ends more than four months of calls from the community for Gyft to strike a deal with the Arkansas-based megastore. Bitcoin users were particularly active posting to reddit about the issue in the wake of Target's November decision to join the Gyft network.
Lingham indicated that their company is always particularly proud after a big launch like this, saying: “It's great that the community is behind us and engaged.” But, they remain focused on the next major merchants coming down the pipeline, hinting that more big announcements for the bitcoin community are “in the hopper”.
So far, the outpouring has been highly visible on Twitter and reddit.
@gyft Of course! The first-world struggle is over now that I can spend my #Bitcoin at @Walmart. — John R. Meese (@JohnRMeese) March 24, 2014
Gyft has been equally supportive of the bitcoin community, with CEO Vinny Lingham penning an open note to the community in November. That announcement indicated that Gyft would continue to invest heavily in adding merchants to its network that fit the needs of its growing bitcoin user base.
So far, it would seem, the company is showing it can get results.

The River Effra is one of London's great lost waterways. Rising near Crystal Palace, its course flows through Norwood, Dulwich, Herne Hill, Brixton and Kennington, before finally emptying into the Thames beside Vauxhall Bridge. Since Victorian times this ancient river has been lost from sight however, flowing through subterranean passages and drains deep beneath the city streets.
I took a trip down to London Below, in order to walk the course of this long-forgotten Thames tributary.
The River Effra
The Effra is referred to frequently in historical texts. In the Thames: Sacred River, Peter Ackroyd writes that the River Effra took it name from the Celtic word ‘yfrid,' meaning ‘torrent'. One myth tells that Queen Elizabeth I sailed the River Effra in their royal barge, to visit Sir Walter Raleigh at their Brixton home.
By the late seventeenth century however, the Effra (like most of London's waterways) had begun to deteriorate into an open sewer.
In the mid-nineteenth century, the famed civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette redirected some segments of the River Effra to form the Southern High Level Sewer, also known as the Effra Sewer, as well as the Southern Low Level Sewer which in turn feeds into the Southern Outfall Sewer. One of the more notable stretches lays beneath Effra Road in Brixton, supposedly accessible through the crypts of St. Luke's Church at West Norwood.
A local legend from Victorian times describes a coffin which appeared floating down the River Effra. The corresponding grave at West Norwood Cemetery was found to be untouched however, and so it was concluded that the casket had subsided into a section of the subterranean river below.
My guide on this voyage into the dank bowels of London, was local explorer Keïteï. They were no stranger to the subterranean network of drains and sewers which fan out beneath the streets of the capital, and was keen to revisit the Effra; so often overlooked, in favour of its larger cousin the River Fleet.
We met near Clapham, following a series of residential streets until we reached our entry point: an unexceptional manhole cover set into a stretch of suburban pavement. It was daylight still, and a steady stream of commuters is drifting past us from the tube.
We would have to time it perfectly.
We opted for a policy of speed rather than subterfuge; all being well, we decided that it should take us no longer than 20 seconds to lift the lid, reach the ladder inside and close the drain behind us. Anyone who spotted us would have to act fast if they were going to stop us…
Because once inside, it seemed unlikely that anyone in their right mind would follow us down.
Loitering on a street corner until a gap appeared in the flow of disinterested passers-by, we made a decisive dash toward the drain cover, lifting it without difficultly, and, alive with adrenaline, I followed Keïteï down the rusted ladder and into the stale darkness below.
To London Below
The first access ladder was relatively short, but just a few feet away from its base the real descent began – a long shaft falling away to the river itself, the ladder disappearing into darkness.
On finally reaching the water, the word ‘river' seemed like something of a misnomer.* Instead, we found a trail of black slime smeared along the belly of a grey concrete tube. Several rats looked up in surprise at our arrival – their dull, beady eyes throwing back the torchlight – before turning tail to disappear into the hidden depths.
[*A comment that I later received on this article would suggest that this was not in fact the River Effra proper – but rather the South West Storm Relief, built in the early 20th Century to relieve the Effra before spilling into the Thames at Battersea.]
The tunnel angled downwards as it flowed past us, right to left, in the direction of the Thames. Here the murky liquid grew deeper, black with corruption and as still as a corpse. A loud belch echoed about us from somewhere downstream; the ‘Gurgle Pit', as some explorers know it.
We turned right, away from the miasma, and waded upstream. The still water was thick with sediment, a black sludge flecked with traces of white and grey which looked suspiciously like fat deposits. Strange tufts of mould would occasionally drift past out feet, sprouting from tiny rafts of unnamable, buoyant matter.
At regular intervals, chains had been hung across the waterway to catch floating debris. Now these were thick with rags, snatches of clothing, hair and ribbons, which had built up over the years. I found a beaded necklace suspended from one of the furry chains, twisted into a rope of discoloured fabric.
In Victorian London, there were people who made a living collecting such trinkets. These brave souls would sail along London's hidden rivers on punts or barges, fishing for scrap metal or jewellery which had accidentally made its way into the city's drains.
From time to time, red brick passages led off to either side. Many were fitted with ladders back to the surface, to emerge through unmarked drain lids trodden each day by countless unsuspecting pedestrians. In one alcove a rule had been placed to measure depth – an indication that the flow was not always so feeble as it now appeared, at the height of a rare English drought. Another siding led to a vast sluice gate, designed the control the flow of other drains joining the subterranean river.
Soon our surroundings changed. Reaching a junction between streams, the grey tunnel gave way to elaborate brickwork. Vaulted red passages formed an ornate intersection, the carefully laid bricks throwing back our torchlight in shades of red and orange, accentuated with subtler blue-green hues. Some urban explorers refer to Effra as the ‘Rubix Drain' – most likely a comparison between the multichromatic brickwork of the Southern Outfall Sewer and a Rubik's Cube.
It was strange to observe just how much thought the Victorians had put into the design of their subterranean canals – spaces never intended for human traffic – and yet it seemed a fine example of the mentality of the day: function never without care for form, grand gestures made simply because they could.
We lit candles, the simple ritual exciting a ruddy glow from the surrounding walls. Just then a drain further upstream must have flooded a gate, and a new lease of life bubbled through the tunnels ahead. Here was the torrent at last, a playful stream rising fast around our boots. Writing about the sacred forces of the River Effra, Ackroyd claims, “its powers have departed”. Although the river's strength may be diminished however, the vaulted red tomb which Bazalgette built for them – itself a wonder of civil engineering – holds a tangible power all its own.
After several hours exploring the drain, we emerged through the same hatch. Coming out is sometimes riskier than going in – you never know who's going to be about. On this occasion the street was empty however, as we rolled from the top of the ladder onto the pavement, leaving trails of clay-like muck spread across the tarmac. On the far side of the street, now dimmed by twilight, a lone cyclist stood playing with their helmet; awkwardly adjusting straps, checking their tyres, inspecting their phone; anything but acknowledge the two strange figures which had just crawled giggling out of a sewer.
I threw them a cheery smile, as we vanished into the night.
OAKLAND, Calif. – For now, U.S. Army Specialist Alexis Hutchinson has not been forced to deploy to Afghanistan, leaving their 11-month-old son, Kamani, in foster care. But in recent days matters hung in the balance, after plans for Kamani's care fell apart under pressure of other family members' special needs.
Hutchinson, 21 and from Oakland, joined the Army in 2007, and has been stationed at Hunter Army Airfield, near Savannah, Ga., since early 2008. They had expected to deploy to Afghanistan with their unit earlier this month, and in preparation, had flown here to leave Kamani with their mother, Angelique Hughes. But after a week, Hughes realized they couldn't continue to care for their grandson on top of their responsibilities to a special needs daughter and an ailing mother and sister.
The Army promised Hutchinson a four-week extension to work out a new plan for Kamani, and in the meantime Hughes brought the boy back to their mother in Georgia.
But midway through the promised extension, the Army told Hutchinson they would have to deploy right away. They then decided not to appear for the flight to Afghanistan. Although they are not a war resister or conscientious objector, they contacted Courage to Resist, an Oakland-based organization that supports military resisters.
Hutchinson returned to base voluntarily after less than 24 hours. They were arrested, and Kamani placed in foster care until Hughes again brought them to Oakland. Hutchinson was initially threatened with being flown to Afghanistan for a special court martial after which they would face a year in jail; they are now under restriction. Hughes continues to feel they cannot care for their grandson in the long term.
Courage to Resist spokesperson Jeff Paterson said Hutchinson's was the first such case with which the organization has been involved. The group put the young mother in touch with an attorney, and in an Internet appeal, asked people to urge Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, to request the Army not deploy Hutchinson so they could care for them son.
Lee's office declined comment because of confidentiality issues. But Paterson said “hundreds” called Lee's office, and they had contacted the Army on the matter.
Hutchinson says they would like to find a caregiver for Kamani, but with their family's many health issues, they don't have many possibilities.
Paterson said they had not expected the military “to make a big issue of this, just because it pulls on so many heartstrings.” But, they said, the move shows the pressure the military is under in terms of deployments to Afghanistan. “Maybe a year or two ago they would have given them a few more months to figure out what do to, or even give them the chance to leave the military if they couldn't find a plan. But basically they told them they were lying and to work something out or be put in jail, and actually followed through with their threat.”
Hutchinson's civilian attorney, Rai Sue Sussman, told Inter Press Service the Army contends Hutchinson is using the family situation as a way to avoid deployment, and says Kamani's grandmother should be able to care for him.
“I'm outraged by this,” Sussman told IPS. “I've never gone to the media with a military client, but this situation is just completely over the top.”
Meanwhile, Courage to Resist is raising funds to help with Hutchinson's civilian legal expenses and their mother's travel expenses with Kamani.

Recreational marijuana use has been legal in Washington State for two years, and while sales of the drug have been filling public coffers with tax revenues, the prices for pot have also been shrinking considerably.
As of March 2016, the price of legal marijuana in Washington was $9.32 per gram, the Washington Post reported, citing data from the state's Liquor and Cannabis board. The wholesale price of the drug was $2.99 per gram.
In September 2014, pot was selling for about $25 per gram, according to a report from KUOW News. By August 2015, marijuana prices had plunged more than 50 percent to $11 per gram.
Vets get free marijuana in Colorado Springs to fight pain & PTSD https://t.co/wUr5eBaQ8Npic.twitter.com/velgRQyzSK — RT America (@RT_America) March 29, 2016
Although prices initially went up after the drug was legalized, that surge was linked to increased demand and limited supply, according to Steve Davenport of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, who helps aggregate data from the Washington's cannabis board. Since then, prices have been coming down at a rate of 2 percent per month, they told the Post, and they could potentially shrink 25 percent every year.
“It's just a plant,” Professor Jonathan Caulkins, of Carnegie Mellon University, who works with Davenport, told the newspaper. They said the drug could become so inexpensive that certain types are essentially given away for free.
“There will always be the marijuana equivalent of organically grown specialty crops sold at premium prices to yuppies,” they said, “but at the same time, no-frills generic forms could become cheap enough to give away as a loss leader – the way bars give patrons beer nuts and hotels leave chocolates on your pillow.”
The news out of Washington State has also been echoed in Colorado, another state where marijuana has been legalized. In June 2015, an eighth of an ounce of cannabis (about 3.6 grams) cost between $30 and $45 – notably less than the $50-$70 it was going for the year prior.
As pot prices trend downward, there could be positive and negative consequences for states. Since pot is taxed by sale, falling prices mean each sale results in fewer dollars for the state government. However, cheap marijuana could end up pushing more people to abandon the black market and stick with purchasing legal pot. Fewer drugs being moved on the black market could also mean fewer costs for law enforcement.

Even with pot prices clearly dipping last year, though, new businesses continued to crop up, KUOW reported.
"The fact that prices are falling, and people are still entering the business – it's confusing to me," Tracey Seslen, an economics lecturer at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, told KUOW. "Standard theories of economics would only suggest entry into an industry when people see that it's profitable."
Perhaps one reason that people keep trying to enter the marijuana business is that, novelty aside, it's simply becoming easier to do so. Over the last two years, the number of banks and credit unions willing to do business with pot shops has increased substantially – from 51 in March 2014 to more than 300 now.
Although federal law still prohibits banks from handling cash derived from the marijuana trade, the Treasury Department has stated it will not go after banks if they are certain that businesses are complying with state pot regulations.
As the final days of winter kept its grip on the Mile High City, David and Sarah Shore were beginning a busy, yet familiar routine of shuffling back and forth between local hockey rinks, their home away from home, for as long as they care to remember.
This time, rather than toting hockey sticks and equipment bags, they were clutching tickets as they took their seats at Pepsi Center, anticipating No. 37 of the Los Angeles Kings to hit the ice. In a few days they would return to the familiar section set aside for family and guests of opposing teams and get ready to cheer on No. 22 of the Calgary Flames. And hours later they would make the short drive down the I-25 interstate to the University of Denver to watch No. 27 skate for their alma mater in the NCHC playoffs.
Different teams, different numbers, different tiers of hockey. The one constant is the name “Shore” on the back of the jerseys.
Early Days
Sibling rivalries are often defined as competition between brothers and sisters. These Colorado brothers are no exception, and they have used that rivalry to drive themselves to succeed on the ice.
Drew, Nick, Quentin and Baker; four siblings, four different paths to the NHL. Two are already there; two others are working hard to join them.
The family's inevitable second home that is the rink had humble beginnings when 3-year-old Drew got their first taste of hockey watching the Stanley Cup playoffs in the early '90s.
“He thought that hockey looked like a really cool game,” recalls David, an attorney in Denver. “We went out, started skating and ran into one of the guys who was running the University of Denver Junior Pioneers program. They suggested that we bring Drew out to a practice, and they really enjoyed it.”
That was the start of a decades-long ripple effect that continues to run through the Shore family more than 20 years later. As Drew picked up the game, their younger brothers were soon itching to follow suit.
“I started because my older brother was playing,” says Nick, who is 21 months younger than Drew. “I always tried to follow their lead as a little kid, jumped out on the ice as much as I could. They sort of started it for all of us.”
For Mom and Dad that meant long, and often chaotic, days of getting the kids where they needed to go.
“What was always bad was the spring time because they would do hockey and lacrosse,” jokes Sarah, who is also an attorney. “Some weekends we'd have three hockey games, three lacrosse games, all in a day. It would be like literally charting it out and figuring out who was going where.”
“We had a series of smelly cars and a really bad smelling garage,” David adds.
While they may not have acknowledged it at the time, the brothers are all very appreciative of what their parents have done to get them to where they are today.
The boys have never forgotten their parents' sacrifice of sleep, support and miles on the odometer. They served as cheerleaders rather than pushing their kids day in and day out to pursue their own dreams. And as they matured on and off the ice, the Shores used that same parental support to carve their own paths to the elite tiers of the game.
“It was nuts, I don't know how my parents got through it, but I'm really happy they did,” Quentin recalls after an afternoon Pioneers practice.
“When I played with Nick in Peewees, we would have 5 a.m. practices at South Suburban [Ice Arena in the Denver suburb of Littleton]. My dad would be driving us, and we'd be asleep in the car, and he'd be trying to get us dressed at the same time. And, of course, we would be late.
“He knew they wanted to do it for us, and at the same time I'm sure he'd rather be sleeping.”
Drew
The eldest brother was the first to have their name called at the NHL Entry Draft, chosen 44th overall in 2009 by the Florida Panthers. Their resume is the most unique, having elected to play in Canada, a bold move for a 13-year-old kid.
“I was even writing letters to my parents trying to convince them that it would be a good situation,” Drew recalls. “They were a little hesitant at first, but at the same time there wasn't a lot of good hockey in Colorado at that time.”
From there Drew made the Detroit Honeybaked Midget minor squad before skating for the National Team Development Program. After two years in Ann Arbor, Mich., Drew felt they were more than ready to lace up for the college ranks.
“I matured a lot as a person and as a player,” the 24-year-old says. “That may have been two of my most beneficial years in my career.”
Nick
After developing with the Colorado Thunderbirds program, Nick kept the family name going at the NTDP, skating for the same teams Drew did in previous years. From there they joined their older brother with the Pioneers for two seasons from 2010-12. They would also play one year with Quentin at DU, before the Kings made Nick a third-round pick in 2011.
“Anytime you get a chance to play with one of your siblings it's going to be really special,” Nick says. “I got the full swing of things playing with the older brother and the younger brother.”
Both Nick and Drew were called up from their clubs' respective AHL affiliates during the 2014-15 season. The stars seemed to align as the brothers were set to face off against each other late in the season before Drew (now with the Flames via trade) was a last minute scratch.
While that division rivalry is as heated as any in the NHL, it hasn't gotten in the way of their support for one another. The only difference was that both were fighting tooth and nail for a Stanley Cup Playoff berth.
“I'm watching all of their games hoping that they score a couple goals and their team loses, to be honest.” Drew jokes.
Dave and Sarah haven't missed a beat. They were present for both their sons' first NHL games­—Drew's being in Montreal and Nick's in LA. Despite crossing borders every now and then, it's just another day at the rink for the Shores.
“Anytime you see your kids playing at the highest level, it's almost surreal,” David admits. “They've worked really hard to get there…but it's still a strange thing to actually see them on professional ice.”
Quentin
Now that the two eldest Shores have broken the NHL barrier, Quentin is poised to follow suit.
The 21-year-old is preparing for their senior season with the Pioneers, and is a prospect in the Ottawa Senators system, chosen in the sixth round in 2013. They too kept “Shore” a familiar name on an NTDP sweater following Nick's departure from the program, skating for the very same U17 and U18 teams that their brothers did.
Baker
The torch now gets passed to 16-year-old Baker, a product of the Colorado Thunderbirds AAA program. And, like their brothers, they kept the family tradition alive by wearing the USA crest in August with the U.S. Select Team at the Five Nations Tournament in Arosa, Switzerland.
While they have not committed to any college yet, becoming the fourth Shore to lace up for Denver would be the worst kept secret in the world. They arguably have the biggest melting pot of inspiration from their brothers, having three of them to push them to carve their own path to The Show. Their three elder siblings are quick to point out that they may be the best of them all.
“We're all pretty close so we keep up with each other every day. We all know what each other is doing, maybe even a little too much,” they say.
Sibling Rivalry
That sibling rivalry never takes a break. In the offseason, you can catch all four at the local golf course or at the Magnus Arena, where they keep equipment and train together on the oh-so familiar DU ice sheet. They remain the best of friends, and all in all, the Shore boys are just your average American brothers making anything and everything a competition.
“We're all pretty competitive,” Baker says. “We always try to see who can get the upper hand, but all in good fun.”
Despite being hundreds of miles apart on any given day, that brotherly bond has never been stronger. They communicate nearly every day between practices, weight room sessions and games. Wherever they may be, the Shores know they have each other's back and support on the ice.
“Growing up it was fun that we always had someone to play with and compete with,” Drew says. “To this day we still push each other and want the best for each other.”
As they continue to carve out their own individual careers, the greatest challenge in this ongoing sibling rivalry may be who will be the first “Shore” to have their name carved on Lord Stanley's Cup. One thing is for sure, when it does happen it will be a family affair.

Another day, and another tragic event. The events in Nice horrified us all. One excellent response is to reinforce that, should this turn out to be a terrorist attack, the individual does not represent all Muslims. The number of terrorist-minded Muslims is tiny. We can make that point using data.
This afternoon I saw the following chart tweeted by Ian Bremmer, which makes this point:
1.6 Billion Muslims in the world.
How many terrorists? Here's context. pic.twitter.com/nxb4KX6nbU — ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) July 15, 2016
The point being made is great, but look at those circles: if you put that ISIS circle inside the Muslim circle, it's kinda big. So I took the data from that chart, and redrew it in Tableau. Turns out, the circles were the wrong size. Here's what the size really look like, if you draw the circles so that their AREA represents the value:
Can you see the circles for Al Qaeda, ISIS, or the Taliban? They're up there in the top right. Tiny, aren't they?
The lesson here is that, if you're going to use circles, size them according to the area. The people behind the original chart, MIIM Design, were trying to make a valid point, but the circle size misrepresented the sizes, which could cause confusion.
Note: I used the same numbers MIIM used in their chart, taking the upper estimate of each category. I have not done research to check the validity of these numbers. My goal is to make a point about circle sizes, not a political point about the size of different religious or terrorist groups.
Update: I replaced the original image with one with a new title. One commenter suggested, rightly, that I might have implied “Muslim” is a terrorist organisation. That absolutely was not my intention or my belief.
In their speech to Congress, the president finally clarified their views on replacing the Affordable Care Act, laying out four cornerstones of a new plan
After months of foggy promises to unveil a “great healthcare plan” for Americans and an admission that health policy is “complicated”, Donald Trump finally took a side in the debate over how to replace the Affordable Care Act during a joint session of Congress, calling for a package of recycled Republican health ideas.
Changes Trump called for would radically alter what is in the health insurance policies Americans purchase, abandoning the goal of “universal” coverage in favor of a more limited principle that Republicans say gives Americans “access” to coverage – at a price. Their promises will likely reassure Republican leadership, as party in-fighting continues.
Trump hails 'new chapter in American greatness' in Congress speech Read more
“I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better healthcare,” Trump said. “Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America.”
The ACA, better known as Obamacare, provided insurance to 20m Americans by subsidizing individual insurance plans, expanding the public health insurance program Medicaid, and creating consumer protections that mandate which benefits must be in health plans.
However, insurance companies' choice to leave some state marketplaces and a sicker-than-expected population has caused costs to rise in some states, which has proved a potent criticism of the law.
The four replacement plan cornerstones laid out by the president have fundamentally different goals from Democratic plans that came before.
The most important provision Trump supported was “tax credits”. Eerily similar to the current system of subsidies for individual insurance, Republicans have proposed these credits before. The difference? Republicans want them to be less generous, and to distribute them by age – not income.
This strategy is embraced by Republican leadership, but getting conservatives on board could determine whether the ship floats. Some right-leaning news outlets criticized tax credits because they continue government spending, and key conservatives have already come out against it.
“The bill contains what increasingly appears to be a new health-insurance entitlement with a Republican stamp on it,” Republican member of congress Mark Walker said, according to Fox News.
Trump promised to provide “access” to coverage for people who are already sick with “pre-existing conditions”. That probably refers to high-risk pools – government-subsidized coverage plans that 35 states had before the ACA. Most had higher premiums and deductibles, and annual and lifetime limits on care. Republicans have also proposed this solution in past plans.
Trump called for “flexibility” with Medicaid spending, harkening back to work by Trump's nominee to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, Seema Verma. In the past, they designed state plans with work requirements for the poor, lock-out periods as long as six months, and complex bureaucracy. Nevertheless, their plans were able to expand Medicaid in deeply conservative states. They face a key committee vote on Wednesday.
Trump's promise to “implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs” could signal their support for medical malpractice reform, a long-time bugaboo for Republicans, especially the health and human services secretary, Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon. They also said insurance should be sold across state lines.
Trump on replacing healthcare law that took years to craft: 'Nobody knew it could be so complicated' Read more
But it's not clear how these changes would be implemented, or how they would get through Congress. So far, Republicans have attempted to make good on promises to repeal the law by trying to ram a “budget reconciliation” law through Congress. That type of law needs a simple majority to pass – for which Republicans have the votes – but can only address taxes and spending. For policy changes, they need Democrats, who have proved elusive.
The single olive branch to Democrats was a call to lower prescription drug prices. Progressives in the party introduced a bill this week to allow drug imports from Canada, which many believe would lower drug prices by introducing competitive pricing. Trump later called for slashing Food and Drug Administration regulations to spur innovation, a move Democrats would almost certainly oppose.
“Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed,” they said. “Every problem can be solved.”

After years of party polarization over abortion, Democrats may finally be taking steps toward welcoming more pro-life Christians into their ranks.
Representative Ben Ray Luján, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), said yesterday that the party has “no litmus test” on abortion and won't withhold financial backing from pro-life candidates in the 2018 mid-term elections, The Hill reported.
Their remarks came a week after the party released a new set of policy plans and goals that push economic concerns and don't mention abortion at all.
As Luján looks to a “broad coalition” to shift control of the US House of Representatives away from the Republican Party, core supporters within their own party are questioning the move away from a firm pro-choice stance.
Will the potential of luring voters who have avoided the party over the issue of abortion be worth the backlash from the Democratic base, including outspoken abortion-rights advocates?
Michael Wear, a former White House faith advisor under President Barack Obama, wants their party to at least try. They suggest that this opportunity depends on how pro-life evangelicals and Catholics respond to the idea. Wear tweeted on Monday:
If you are a Republican or Independent who says, “Gosh I could consider Democrats if only they were more open to pro-lifers,” speak up. I hear from you all the time, but some strategists and activists say you don't exist. And guess what? If you don't speak up, you don't exist. Call DCCC. Donate in response to this move. Support pro-life candidates that DCCC supports. Write letter to editor. And, yes, tweet.
Hundreds of followers retweeted and responded to their messages; some eager to see a place for themselves, and some skeptical that it could happen among a party whose official platform still supports abortion.
Several prominent Democrats, though pro-choice themselves, have defended having pro-lifers in their party—including the highest-ranking representatives in Congress, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer. Both have referenced being a “big tent” party and not excluding diverging views on abortion.
When former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, an Independent, backed a pro-life Catholic candidate for mayor of Omaha earlier this year, they told critics, “You just can't exclude people who disagree with us on one issue.”
The situation spurred a debate among progressives, with Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Thomas Perez commenting, “Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman's right to make their own choices about their body and their health. That is not negotiable.”
According to the Pew Research Center, 3 in 4 Americans support at least some restrictions on abortion, and Republicans are three times as likely (65%) as Democrats (22%) to believe abortion should be illegal in all or most circumstances.
But abortion views tend to be nuanced, as surveys show. While half of Americans consider abortion morally wrong, just 20 percent think it should be totally illegal, according to Gallup. That means that a significant portion of country—including 41 percent of conservatives—oppose abortion on moral grounds but favor it being legal.
White evangelicals are most likely to view abortion as morally wrong, and many evangelicals who voted for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election cited the GOP's pro-life position as well as the likelihood of Trump appointing a pro-life Supreme Court justice.
Abortion can be a dealbreaker for American voters, with 1 in 5 saying that they will only vote for a politician who shares their views.
Pro-life Democrats were in a particularly tough spot during last year's election, when Hillary Clinton pushed back against the Hyde Amendment, which prevents the federal government from directly funding abortions.
The leaders of Democrats for Life saw the shift as a sign that “the party that is supposedly on the side of justice for the vulnerable no longer welcomes those of us who #ChooseBoth; that is, those of us who want the government to protect and support prenatal children and their mothers.”
Currently, not a single Democrat in Congress has a perfect rating on the National Right to Life Committee's scorecard (and only a handful voted in line with recent pro-life legislation at all). A decade ago, there were 17 Democratic representatives with a 100-percent pro-life rating. CT has reported how the fight over the Obama administration's health care reform contributed to the death of pro-life Democrats.
Polls released by the Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life lobby, indicate that pro-lifers will be a politically advantageous group in the upcoming election.
“Voters in 2018 Senate battleground states—Florida, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, and Wisconsin—support ending federal funding for Planned Parenthood by a 16-point margin,” reported National Review, a conservative magazine. “Voters said they'd be much less likely to support a candidate who voted to fund Planned Parenthood rather than community health centers.”
According to Wear, Democrats' current openness could lead them to find common ground with pro-life moderates over support for the Hyde Amendment. While voters set on reversing Roe v. Wade will likely stick with Republicans, “this is about the Dem party being reasonable enough to win pro-life voters who also have other priorities,” they tweeted.
Following the inauguration, Wear wrote for CT about three political priorities for evangelicals.

The investigation has become the biggest into celebrity drug addiction in the history of the Los Angeles police, according to senior officers.
It comes as detectives searched the Las Vegas home and office of their doctor, Conrad Murray. Detectives are reportedly also chasing other doctors who they say handed out drugs or prescriptions to the late singer.
It has emerged Jackson was given a powerful, surgical anaesthetic called properol through a drip-feed to help them sleep. Authorities believe this was the ultimate cause of the singer's death on June 25.
One homicide officer told the Daily Star : “It's long been suspected that friendly doctors have been enabling celebrities in Hollywood to feed their habits.
“However, the real extent of what's been going on is truly shocking. We are uncovering a massive trade in fraudulent prescriptions.”
Dr Murray, 56, a cardiologist with practices in Las Vegas and Houston, had their Texas office and a storage unit searched last week by Drug Enforcement Agency agents.
Documents to secure the warrants used in the raids had to be made out in the 19 names and aliases used by Jackson to obtain prescription drugs.
Prince Jackson, the singer's 12-year-old son, was even listed as one possible alias, according to reports. It is illegal in the US to obtain prescription drugs using false names.
Officers in Las Vegas carried out a similar search at their home and office there on Tuesday. Court records show the agents were investigating a possible case of manslaughter.
Police say Dr Murray is co-operating and have not labelled them a suspect. Ed Chernoff, Dr Murray's lawyer, said: “Everyone needs to take a breath and wait for these long-delayed toxicology results.”
After the dramatic display of a frozen carcass in Japan, the ethics of reviving an extinct species are under intense scrutiny
The quest is to clone a mammoth. The question is: should we do it?
The idea would make headlines around the world and bring tears of joy to the planet's journalists. An adorable baby woolly mammoth, tottering on its newborn legs, is introduced to the media. Cloned from a few cells scraped from the permafrost of Siberia, the little creature provides the latest proof of the might of modern science and demonstrates the fact that extinction has at long last lost its sting.
It is a fascinating prospect, one that was raised again last week when the most recently discovered carcass of a mammoth was revealed to the public in Yokohama, Japan.
The female, thought to have been around 50 when they died, had lain frozen in the ground for tens of thousands of years. Yet they still had hair, muscle tissue, and possibly blood. Samples have now been sent to South Korea, where scientists say they are planning to use them to clone a mammoth, though the proposal is considered to be highly controversial.
"The hunt for mammoth corpses has been transformed in recent years," said Professor Adrian Lister, of the Natural History Museum, London, and one of the advisers for the museum's current "Extinction" exhibition. "We have found as many mammoths in the past five years as we did in the previous 50, partly because global warming is melting the Siberian permafrost and is revealing more and more bodies and partly because local people realise it is a lucrative business. Mammoth ivory is viewed as a legal and ethically acceptable alternative to elephant tusks.
"The only trouble is that every time a new well-preserved mammoth is found, people also repeat the claim that we will soon be able to clone them, and I very much doubt that we will."
Mammoths ranged from the British Isles to eastern Asia and northern America until they disappeared around 10,000 years ago, though one small population was recently found to have survived to around 4,000 years ago on the Russian island of Wrangel.
Hunting by cavemen or climate change, or a combination of the two, are generally blamed for their demise.
Now some scientists are talking openly of bringing them back to life. Yokohama mammoth samples have been sent to the private laboratory of the disgraced South Korean cloning expert Hwang Woo-suk, who is co-operating with Russian scientists with the specific aim of recreating mammoths. Similarly, Semyon Grigoriev, who led the team that excavated the mammoth, has speculated that fluid found near the creature may be blood that contains intact cells which could be used to bring about their resurrection. "This find gives us a really good chance of finding living cells, which can help us implement this project to clone a mammoth," said Grigoriev.
The idea gathers little support from scientists such as Lister, however. "I very much doubt if the idea of cloning a mammoth is feasible," they said, a point that was backed by the molecular biologist Professor Michael Hofreiter, of York University.
"There are two ways that you could try to clone a mammoth," said Hofreiter. "The first is straightforward. You could simply look through the bodies we dig up in the Arctic to see if we could find one that had a cell that still contained a nucleus with a complete, viable genome in it.
"Then, employing the cloning techniques that were used to create Dolly the Sheep, we could put that nucleus inside an elephant embryo and then implant it into a female elephant, who would later give birth to a mammoth.
"The problem is that these creatures died many thousand years ago, when their DNA would have started to degrade, so the chances of finding an entire viable mammoth genome are essentially zero," they said.
There is another approach, however. Scientists could use the scraps of DNA they do find in preserved bodies to build up a map of a mammoth's genome. "Then you would use the same techniques that are employed in creating transgenic mice to make stretches of DNA – using your map as a guide – that you would then put into the embryo of an Asian elephant embryo which is the closest living relative of a mammoth," said Hofreiter.
"Bit by bit, you would continue with this process with separate pieces of mammoth DNA until you had completely replaced the DNA in your elephant embryo with mammoth DNA. You would now have an embryo with a mammoth genome it. This would then be placed in a female elephant in whom the embryo would develop to birth."
There are many difficulties with this approach, however. "A key point to remember is that elephants and mammoths each have about 4 billion DNA bases in their genomes," said Hofreiter. "However, the maximum size of the DNA section you can add is about 1 million bases. So you would have to repeat the process sequentially 4,000 times – without mishap – to create your mammoth embryo. The chances of that happening are also essentially zero." On top of these problems there is the simple issue of differences in proteins that exist between the Asian elephant that would be used as a surrogate mother and the mammoth embryo you have created. "It is quite possible that these differences would be big enough to make the embryo incompatible with the elephant. It is a further factor to suggest that mammoth cloning is not going to happen for a very long time indeed."
For good measure, there are other concerns that make the idea of cloning animals such as the mammoth controversial, added Lister.
In particular, there is the question of the ethics involved. "Mammoths were very similar to elephants, we believe," they said. "In other words, they were highly social, intelligent creatures. What right have we got to recreate one or two and then keep them in solitary confinement at zoos or research facilities? I have problems with those who think this is not a real issue."
Several other concerns also trouble scientists. Species are now being wiped off the planet at a staggering rate. The WWF has suggested a figure of around 10,000 species a year, for example, though these figures are disputed by other scientists.
The crucial point is that resources are desperately needed to help slow down the rate at which animals and plants are being rendered extinct. As a result, the idea of investing large amounts of money on reviving special interest species while the natural world is dwindling as the climate changes and human populations soar is leaving many scientists uncomfortable.
"We shouldn't be piling our cash into projects that could resurrect an already extinct large mammal," said Lister. "We should be trying to help those who are now hovering at the edge of extinction today. That would be the best way to invest our money in conservation."

I invented the Berkshire Triple Crown last year, as the 100-odd people who bother subscribing to this corner of the internet might remember. The idea was simple; chain together multiple peaks in Massachusetts until your legs give out.
If I had to sum up the BTC in one word: Brutal.
8,200 feet of climbing over just 70 miles is an intensely steep ride. It's steeper per mile than many of the Tour de France stages in the alps, and it had more climbing than a century John rode the previous month… in the White Mountains. It's over 117 feet of climbing per mile, and it really starts to wear on you by the time you get to the final climb, Mt. Greylock.
The ride in it's current iteration follows a hub-and-spoke pattern, which I think is an ideal format for a bike race/ride. Since each peak is its own “spoke” around the central hub of North Adams, MA, riders can pick their poison according to skill level and fitness, rather than risk getting dropped by the pack. It's fun for everyone, not just the most Fred among us, and it simplifies lunch stops, water breaks and transportation, since you start and end in the same place.
This year, my ridership grew to three. My aunt Linda and their friend John, a pair of biochemists from Boston, made the pilgrimage over to the dreaded western terminus of the commonwealth, accompanied by Paul and Lyle from the PMC weekend. They were all fresh off their 280 mile weekend, and rearing to eat more mileage. Paul would've ridden with us too, but they had another climb in the Adirondacks later that weekend, so they and Lyle provided us with a seemingly endless supply of energy gummies, gatorade, peanut butter pretzels, and fruit bars.
I had to push double to keep up with John and Linda, but the Berkshires would reward our collective effort with some of the most stunning roads and views this side of the Mississippi.
We started the day with Mt. Savoy, the longest leg of the BTC. And lucky us, our tax dollars were hard at work this spring repaving nearly the entire stretch> That photo at the intro to this post is how the entire 27.3km looked. Nothing but gorgeous, fresh asphalt, wide shoulders, and beautiful greenery all the way to Plainfield Pond.
Lyle and Paul met us at the lake, and commented on the hill. Paul, you ain't seen nothin' yet!
After soaking up some views on a gravel road shortcut back to North Adams, we pushed up the short-and-steep Mt. Florida to the Whitcomb Summit, where the elk statue makes for a perfect photo op. Then, it was back down at reckless speed for lunch before we took on the biggest climb of the day, Mt. Greylock.
The first two climbs left a mark on my quads. I ate a few chicken fingers and nervously anticipated the mountain. This was my climb, the one I had done over fifty times over the past five years. I was a veteran. Linda and John were in brutally good shape this season, making me feel like my year of interval training was more “good start” than “good shape.”
We set off up Notch Road. When most cyclists climb Mt. Greylock, they drive to the parking lot at the base of the auto road and start climbing. The BTC route actually takes you up a few miles of climbing before you hit the base of the mountain itself.
Linda shot out of the gate with a ferocity rarely seen in cyclists half their age. Neither John nor I could keep up. I don't know how far down they dig to get it, but she's got a bottomless stamina level and they took on Greylock like it was the first climb of the day. John dropped me after the hairpins, so I brought up the rear in my own ride. I wouldn't have it any other way- we had the perfect riding group and I loved, loved, loved being pushed to my limit.
And then it was over! John had our elevation total through Strava at the end of the ride, and everyone agreed; this was the hardest single day of riding any of us had ever done. A big compliment coming from the riders who tackled nearly three centuries the weekend before.
Behind every great ride is a great S.A.G. Wagon: a big thank-you to Lyle and Paul for the ten pounds of food and Gatorade I went through this summer. See you all next year!
Keep Riding!
A 19-year-old Eugene man experiences a psychotic break in the middle of the night � screaming, yelling and possibly choking their mother.
Eugene police respond � an hour after the initial call for help.
The first call for help is supposed to go to a Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets crew, but the CAHOOTS medical crisis intervention service isn�t available 24 hours a day. Instead, despite a number of higher priority calls, such as a reported shooting and occupied-home burglaries, officers from the Eugene Police Department respond to find a tense situation that is about to intensify.
Beyond that, however, two accounts of the early morning hours of July 16 differ sharply between police officials and the local president of the NAACP, who happens to be the uncle of the teenager involved and the brother of the teen�s mother, who was arrested on suspicion of interfering with police.
But while the parties differ on the circumstances surrounding what is now an internal affairs investigation within the police department, they agree on one thing: Mental illness services in Lane County and elsewhere in the state are lacking, and the responsibility to help people suffering from a psychotic episode too often falls to police.
�It�s not fair,� Eugene police Capt. Sam Kamkar said Tuesday. �It�s not fair to the officers, it�s not fair to the person suffering from mental illness. We can do better. It�s a failure of the system.�
Jack Radey, a member of the Eugene-Springfield chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, agrees that the resources to care for the mentally ill are lacking.
�By default, that responsibility has fallen on the police officers, primarily,� Radey said Tuesday. �This is like trying to paint a picture using a sledgehammer. And the results are not going to be pretty.�
On the steps of the U.S. courthouse in downtown Eugene at noon Tuesday, Eric Richardson, president of the local NAACP chapter, and an attorney representing Richardson�s sister and nephew held a news conference, outlining the injustice they feel occurred on July 16.
�In our view, (they) were fairly badly beaten up,� attorney Brian Michaels said. �Eventually the mother is hugging their son and begging the officer not to tase them and for that they were arrested and thrown to the ground for interfering. The son was eventually tased with prongs, eventually tased with (a) dry stun (gun), and eventually punched in the face with a Taser gun.�
Michaels later told The Associated Press on Tuesday that they plan to file a lawsuit on behalf of Richardson�s sister, Ayisha Brown, and their son.
Eugene police, meanwhile, have since released the audio of two 911 calls related to the incident, a police officer�s dashcam video that doesn�t clearly show the middle-of-night incident but provides audio, and the police report. The involved officers have not yet been interviewed by the department�s internal affairs unit.
The 911 calls
Eugene police received a call at 2:43 a.m. on July 16 from a mother, later identified as Brown, who asked dispatchers not to send a police officer but instead to send CAHOOTS because their son, they tell the call taker, is suffering from a psychotic episode related to an earlier head injury and doesn�t recognize them
�He�s not getting physical, and they will not get physical, he�s just feeling trapped and he�s feeling aggressive and he�s feeling like people aren�t understanding him,� they tell the dispatcher. �And because they don�t recognize me, he�s not understanding that I�m trying to help them so they just feels like he�s being trapped here, which is making them feel more aggressive.�
In the audio background, the teen can clearly be heard screaming at Brown. As the dispatcher asks them to move away from him, Brown says they are not in physical harm, as they yell back at them to stop. Brown says their son has no weapons, and tearfully says, �Can you just come, please?�
But 50 minutes later, when Brown�s ex-husband calls 911, officers had still not gone to the home on Onyx Street because they were on higher-priority calls, Kamkar said Tuesday.
The ex-husband, who is not identified, is transferred to Eugene police by a dispatcher in Oklahoma because they called 911 from the road on their job as a long-haul truck driver. The man tells the dispatcher they have concerns that the situation in Eugene is getting dangerous.
�I was just on the phone with (Brown) about 10 minutes ago and it sounded like they were trying to choke them out,� the man says. �She was screaming and yelling and saying �Let go of me, let go of me� and they were like �No, you�re not my mother, you�re not my mother.� And then ... they were like �I can�t breathe, I can�t breathe. You�re squeezing me too hard.� And then the phone hung up.�
Officers� arrival
Because no officers were available at the time of the second call, a dispatcher calls a police supervisor and asks them to go to the home in light of the escalating situation, the police report says. It was then that Brown answered their front door with their son by their side.
Two other officers, having cleared other calls in the meantime, also respond.
Brown tells the two officers � Clifford Sites and Matthew Stropko � that they had taken their son to a mental health ward earlier in the day, but that they had been released and now their condition is worsening.
Richardson, their brother, is on their way to help, they tell police. On the police dashcam video, a car that belongs to Richardson can be seen and later their voice can be heard telling their nephew to stop resisting and let police do their job because they isn�t �acting correctly.�
As Brown is talking to police, the teen is standing behind her, alternating �between looking angry and having a blank expression,� the police report states.
They get more agitated the longer the officers are there. The officers� report says Sites tells them they are only there to help, to which the teen replies, �No you�re not. You�re lying to my ... face.�
They then tells the officer they isn�t a real police officer and nudges them in the shoulder twice with their hand and crowds the officer, the report says.
Tasing
The police report states that the officer told the teen they would be tased if they didn�t step back, as Brown positioned themselves between police and their son. They yell at police not to tase them as they hug him.  They are told repeatedly to step away but they do not comply, the report states. That�s when Richardson arrives and is also warned to step back.
The teen starts moving aggressively toward the officer and as Sites holds onto the teen�s left arm, Stropko tases him, the police report states. Site grabs the teen�s other arm and places them in handcuffs.
That was only the first struggle.
Two other officers � Bill Solesbee and Trevor Hart � arrive and try to separate Richardson and Brown from the now-handcuffed teen, according to the report. But Brown refuses to let go of their son and is �screaming and pulling away,� the report says.
Solesbee takes them down to the ground and handcuffs them The teen and the other officers soon all end up on the ground, as well. Ultimately, the teen is taken to the hospital for a �mental health hold� and again becomes agitated.
 They are �chemically restrained,� according to the report, which does not specify the nature of restraint. Brown is taken to jail for interfering with police but charges are never filed and they are released 10 hours later.
Michaels, the attorney representing Brown, said they were released �thanks to the saner heads who prevailed in the Eugene Police Department (and) realized that a mother protecting their son from being tased can�t really be a crime, can it?�
News conference
At Tuesday�s U.S. courthouse news conference, Michaels said Brown ended up with a concussion, back problems and a knee injury during the scuffle.
They said there are potential racial overtones to the incident.
�In our opinion, it was a lot less likely that a white mother hugging their white son would have been treated this way,� they said.
But Richardson said he�s reluctant to cast the incident as strictly a �black issue.�
�As an African-American man in America, I just want to say this really isn�t about blackness, it�s about treating people in America as equal citizens. I shouldn�t have to say �it was a black issue� just to get attention. So what it was, it was a mother calling for help.�
Eugene police auditor Mark Gissiner also spoke at Tuesday�s conference and said their office had been contacted and that the incident is under review.
Eugene Police Employees Association union President Jed McGuire attended but did not speak publicly at the news conference. Later, they said they felt the events as characterized there were not fair to the officers and did not fairly represent what had occurred.
Richardson said they feel they have a strong ally in Eugene Police Chief Pete Kerns and is optimistic for the future. In the weeks since the incident happened, police officials have met with Richardson, Michaels and others to discuss how the police department can handle such situations better.
Kamkar on Tuesday said police can learn from every call for service and that the department will debrief the July 16 incident at length. But bottom line, �we should not be going to a call like this. If someone calls and asks for CAHOOTS, we should be able to say, �Thank you, CAHOOTS is en route.�?�
Kerns said funding for mental health services has been declining steadily for years.
�Our police officers are going all day long to one situation after another in which a person is in mental health crisis,� Kerns said. �CAHOOTS provides some service there, which is very helpful, but they�re not presently equipped to handle situations that are dangerous, that provide serious threats, so our officers end up doing that.�
Eugene police officers and staff are trained in coping with the mentally ill, the chief said. All officers receive 40 hours of crisis intervention training, said Kerns, who added that they believe Eugene�s is the only department in Oregon that provides such training to 100 percent of its officers.
Kerns said they sympathize with a frightened mother concerned for their son, an NAACP leader concerned for their sister and nephew, and with officers seeking to be professional in a tense situation. But a mentally ill person is unpredictable, and so while family members could potentially predict the teen�s behavior, the officers who arrived �would know none of that. So they need to approach it in the calmest possible way but be prepared for the worst. And that�s what occurred here. ...
�There�s no question about it. It�s more dangerous for people with mental health conditions on the street today and it is far more dangerous for police officers than it�s ever been in EPD�s history.�
The Lord's General affairs committee have decided to launch an inquiry into Unownuzer717, as the backlash against the business secretary for controversial comments continues.
The hearing is due to take place on the 24th of November and in the coming days witnesses will be called upon to attend the hearing. To date demands for the prime minister, DrCaeserMD, and the deputy prime minister, britboy3456, to attend the hearing have been made.
The business secretary made controversial remarks about ‘Swedistan' and ‘rapefugees' which have been widely been denounced by opposition parties. On Sunday the government were defeated as a motion was passed to condemn the remarks made by Unownuzer717.
Unownuzer717 then made further comments about homosexuality and the importance of getting married, arguing for a complete overhaul in the education system and the promotion of birthing children.
“The intention is not for them [children] to be homophobic. It is for them to learn the importance of getting married and having children for the good of our nation; instead of engaging in promiscuous and immoral behaviour that only leads to diseases being spread instead of happy families being created.”
These comments were again denounced by the opposition and were also met with ridicule within the government with the equalities minister, troe2339, accusing them of being homophobic and questioning their honourability.
The former chief secretary treasury and leader of the New Liberty Party, Friedmanite19 launched this General affairs committee. When asked why they started up the inquiry, they said that “the government needs to be held account for its underlying racism and homophobia, I think it's disgusting that a man who has in the past described Islam as cancer has been appointed to the cabinet.”
Friedmanite19's decision to start up an inquiry marks a new step in their attacks on the government, having been unceremoniously sacked by the prime minister and having failed to make any significant moves that will leave a mark on DrCaeserMD.
They deny having set up the inquiry to attack the prime minster on a personal basis. “I'm scrutinising the government because it's my job as a Lord and is part of the reason the House Of Lords exists. It is an issue I feel very strongly about.”
“It is my belief that plain racism and bigotry has no place in modern British politics and that we shouldn't be insulting our trading partners.”
The deputy prime minister, Britboy3456 was asked for a statement but declined to comment. This marks the second time in recent days the deputy prime minister has failed to respond to inquiries into what they feel about the current situation surrounding their party MP.
Average internet speeds by megabits per second. (Akamai)
Pity Nevada and Rhode Island, the only states to see Internet speeds slow down between the first and second quarters of the year, according to a new report.
The vast majority of states saw Internet speeds accelerate in the second quarter from the quarter before: seven even saw double-digit increases in average speeds between the first two quarters of the year, according to Internet infrastructure provider Akamai. Speeds in the second quarter of the year were also universally—and often significantly—higher from the year before, according to data provided in the organization's quarterly State of the Internet Report.
The latest report was characterized by a number of new records, editor David Belson noted in a press release. For the first time, the global average connection speed rose above 4 megabits per second, the threshold used by the Federal Communications Commission to define “broadband.” All of the top 10 states had average peak speeds above 50 mbps in the second quarter—another first, according to the report. Akamai provides cloud services to some of the world's largest Web sites, in part to more quickly deliver content to visitors.
On average, the Internet is more than twice as fast in Delaware than Arkansas
In terms of absolute speeds, Delaware had the fastest Internet speeds at 16.2 mbps, followed by just over 14 in Virginia; Washington. D.C. was next with speeds just below 14 mbps. The Internet was slowest in Arkansas, where average speeds were 7.5 mbps.

Quarterly speeds rose in 48 states
Internet speeds saw double-digit increases between the first two quarters of the year in seven states: Delaware, Connecticut, Missouri, Montana, Wyoming, Washington and New Jersey. Delaware had the biggest average quarterly increase in Internet speeds, at 24 percent. Connecticut was next at 17 percent, followed by Missouri at 176 percent.

Every state saw at least double-digit increases, year-over-year
Four states saw Internet speeds grow more than 50 percent between the second quarters of 2013 and 2014. Speeds in Kansas rose 106 percent, while Maryland had a 70 percent increase, Arkansas had a 64 percent rise and Delaware had a 50 percent increase.

France's ambassador to the United States says that President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE should be judged on their policies and not their words.
Trump's policies so far, Ambassador Gérard Araud said on Politico's "Off Message" podcast, don't appear to be radically different from their predecessor, at least in terms of foreign policy.
"What I try to tell Paris and what I try to explain to the French is that, beyond the words, what matters will be the politics," Araud said. "So what will be the American policy towards Syria, towards Russia, towards North Korea? That's what matters."
"And when you are looking at it, as I have said, it's not that different," they added. "There is — nothing really critical has really happened."

Araud, however, pointed to climate change as one issue where European leaders diverge drastically from Trump. The U.S. president's decision last month to withdraw the country from the Paris climate agreement, Araud said, "dismayed" Europe.
"Obviously, we were dismayed by the American decision to leave — to denounce — the Paris agreement," they said. "Basically, what matters beyond this politics is the American society, which is actually very committed to fighting climate change."
As a presidential candidate, Trump campaigned on an "America first" message, vowing to withdraw the U.S. from what they dub unfair international agreements.
That approach to foreign policy, Araud said, has left the free world without a clear leader.
“This world order, the traditional liberal world order, is more or less undermined, really, or looks injured. Where [is] the United States? And that's a question which is on the table,” they said.
Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are experiencing record breaking disapproval ratings. ABC News reports seven out of ten Americans view Trump unfavorably, while 55 percent view Hillary unfavorably. It stands to reason that voters are looking for options, not just in candidates but in their political parties. Many experts are saying this might be the year for third party options.
Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are the Libertarian and Green Party candidates, respectively. The Libertarians are saying they will be on the ballot in all 50 states by November. That would give Johnson a fighting chance against Trump and Clinton. The Green Party is working diligently with the same goal in mind. They, too, have hopes of making the ballot in all 50 states for Stein, but it isn't easy. In fact, getting on the ballot in all 50 states is a herculean task for a third party, as the Green Party's Rick Lass explains to CounterPunch. The green party is currently on the ballot in 22 states and DC.
“Yes, we're actively petitioning in 25 and expect to be petitioning in all 28 very soon. We fully expect to get on the ballot in all but three states due to our petition drives, and in three states we'll probably litigate because their petition requirements are so onerous… North Carolina… requires 89,000 signatures.”
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are historically unpopular, but the feeling runs far deeper. The Democrat and Republican parties are also at an all-time low on their approval. A little-cited fact appears on Huffington Post, revealing that only 30 percent view the Republican party favorably while 60 percent view them unfavorably. Only 45 percent of voters view the Democratic party favorably while 46 percent view them unfavorably.
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have a huge advantage over Gary Johnson and Jill Stein because their parties are frequently viewed as the only viable choices. In the past, third parties were not on the ballot in all 50 states. They get virtually no publicity from the mainstream media and their nominees are often excluded from televised debates.
The differences matter. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump got far more media attention and publicity earlier in the election than other candidates, and now they are the reported nominees. Still, the Internet is proving to be a great equalizer for outsider and third party nominees. Bernie Sanders proved, with their high approval ratings and undying support among young voters, that the Internet will soon surpass TV for providing voters with information on candidates.
Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton [Photo by Mark Wilson and Spencer Platt] Gary Johnson and Jill Stein will have to work a lot harder for every vote they get than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. First, third parties have to petition states every four years, unless their candidates get a certain percentage of votes in the state. Then, they have to oppose Clinton's thick wallet full of superPAC money. They contend with media bias and an attitude within the general public that voting for them divides the votes, or “wastes” votes.
Hillary Clinton, in their race with Bernie Sanders, exemplified the kinds of biases third party nominees and outsiders face. Many voters do not research all their options and trust the evening news and television talk shows to give them all the facts. Media coverage of the majority of presidential primary candidates is nonexistent, and coverage of third party politics is even worse. The media narrows pubic choices. Coverage of media favorites like Clinton is typically biased.
Hillary Clinton Vs Donald Trump Plus Bernie Sanders [Photo by Alex Wong, Justin Sullivan and Spencer Platt/Getty Images] Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are vastly ignored by the media. The media shows less than half of all primary candidates and generally shows no Green, Libertarian, or Socialist candidates. They often make a buffoon of at least one primary candidate, by filming them at all the wrong times. They tried this with Donald Trump, but for whatever reason, it had the opposite effect in the primaries. Then, they focus on someone like Hillary Clinton and ignore the rest. Remember Carly Fiorino? Most people don't, but they were a Republican candidate in the 2016 Republican primaries.
With Gary Johnson and Jill Stein both running, no one is really a spoiler. We will have four parties now, on all or most of the ballots. With not one, but two viable alternative choices this year, voters could make a difference if they disregard media steering and vote according to their informed opinions. Voting for Hillary or Trump is fine if having researched, a voter finds they like the candidate's views, and trust their character. If not it is hardly sensible to vote for them. The internet and social media could make a difference and volunteers could push this race toward a third party candidate. With Johnson and Stein each picking up both democrat and republican votes, America would not only have a four party race this election this year, but next time as well, giving these parties a chance to grow and provide more options for informed voters.
If Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump do not fit what a voter wants, then that voter has the responsibility and the right to seek out third party nominees like Johnson and Stein and support them. There are much more fruitful ways to express a loss of confidence in mainstream parties than to silently hate them. There are steps individuals can take.
Gary Johnson and Jill Stein would benefit greatly from just a little help from voters. Americans should proudly circulate and sign petitions for third parties getting on the ballot. They should push state legislatures to simplify the process of getting the third party and independent nominees on the ballots. Then, voters should research all the candidates and vote their consciences. American voters can treasure their right to vote, rather than choose a candidate they don't like.
Unlike Hillary Clinton, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein represent a way to change the presidential election status quo.
About
What is the PolyChrono clock?
The PolyChrono clock was inspired by the construction of radios and electronics from the first half of the century which were built with high quality wood cabinets and utilized dials and knobs to control functionality. PolyChrono is designed with the same vintage style in mind.
This unique clock is crafted from solid Mahogany with a fine antique finish and brushed copper face and back. No veneer or composite materials are used. Polychrono utilizes three analog meters to conveniently display the Hours, Minutes, and Seconds of your day.
While having a retro appearance on the outside, the inside houses modern microprocessor controlled clock circuitry and Bluetooth interface which allows the time to be set from your Android device. PolyChrono will make a stylish and functional addition to your desk, bench, or shelf.
The Idea
The idea of using analog panel meters to display time came to me after I developed a circuit to display analog values from a microcontroller for another project. I had a few extra analog meters left over and thought it would be a neat way to display time and would look great on my desk, or fit right in on my electronics bench.
Evolution of the PolyChrono
After some brainstorming, I started writing the firmware and developing the circuitry, incorporated a RTC for accurate timekeeping and had the first working prototype of the PolyChrono in early 2012. In the latest iteration I added the Mahogany enclosure and incorporated Bluetooth into the circuitry for wireless interface.
First Prototype
Concept for final version
The first prototype was practical, but left a lot to be desired. After a few different designs, the final one was developed.
The face was narrowed for better symmetrical balance with the meters, controls were moved to the rear, and a hardwood enclosure with rounded edges and rubber feet were added.
Mahogany was chosen for its warm deep tone and unique grain.
Wood finish detail
How does the clock work?
The clock is built around a PIC microcontroller which controls a Pulse width modulation (PWM) channel for each analog meter. The duty cycle of the PWM is varied to create an average current corresponding to a time value read from the real time clock (RTC). The meter sees the average value of this PWM signal and that is what is displayed. The microcontroller also controls the setting of the time through the buttons on the rear of the device, or from commands received wireless from the Bluetooth module.
Timeline from the day funding is secured for PolyChrono:
PCBs, components, and lumber will be ordered immediately after the project is successful.
PCBs typically take 2 weeks to turn around and are usually the last item to come in, but just in case, I am estimating a month for materials to arrive. In the meantime, I will finalize the app and publish it.
Once PCBs and components arrive, I will ship all kit only orders first based on backing date (5 to 6 weeks from campaign ending date to allow time to assemble).
After the kits go out, I will begin assembly of the full clocks, estimate 2 - 2.5 months for assembly, and as with the kits, shipping order will be based on backing order. (10-12 weeks from campaign end date).
I will also be posting frequent progress updates through the life of the project if funding is successful.
Update on a proposal that has just become explicit policy: Indiana University-Bloomington will indeed require its Greek organizations to accept searches without a warrant by campus police or lose their recognition.
The Indiana Daily Student reports that the policy actually goes beyond police – “other IU safety organizations” can search fraternities and sororities as well, and whatever they find can be used in disciplinary proceedings:
The housing agreement, which lists the policy explicitly, was given to Greek houses on Aug. 8, IFC President Ryan Zukerman said. Also included in the agreement is a ban on hard liquor in houses and a requirement for an adult, live-in resident advisor by the start of the 2017-2018 school year.
Chapter presidents are meeting Monday to talk about the agreement, Zukerman said.
Total Frat Move has screenshots of the new housing agreement, which lays out the conditions for the changes:
Common spaces and rooms can be searched with “probable cause” to believe that the housing agreement, IUB policy or “law” is being violated, when waiting for a warrant would “endanger the health and safety” of residents or risk “probable destruction of evidence” Residents will be given “at least” 24 hours' notice before a search, and no room will be searched “without knocking” MORE: Indiana University wants to search frat houses without a warrant Inspectors will “use a key” to get in if the occupant refuses to open the door If no one is in the room, occupants will be told after the fact that the room was searched Rooms can be searched without notice if campus authorities are “responding to an emergency,” in the interest of “health and welfare”
In addition to police and fire officials, “environmental health and safety personnel” can do searches. Remember: As long as they call it an “emergency,” they don't have to even give notice.
The new agreement gets specific on how fraternities and sororities must serve beer or wine, apparently to avoid the drinks getting spiked.
MORE: In defense of frat bros
It limits who can serve as the new live-in adviser (a requirement starting in 2017-2018), with possible qualifications including a mix of bachelor's degree, experience in supervising “residential living environments” and enrollment in a Student Affairs graduate program.
TFM author Alex Buscemi notes that the agreement explicitly recognizes that Greek houses are “privately owned, independent businesses,” but they are being subject to warrantless search to “strengthen the university.” Twenty percent of IUB's students are Greek members, they said.
According to Buscemi's tipster, the rules could incentivize use of “hard drugs” in liquor-free houses, flood the local housing market and eventually kill Greek life:
And it's hard to disagree with them on that. I can see their fall semester now. Cops strolling down Greek row, barging into party after party unannounced, spotting an airplane bottle of Pink Lemonade Burnett's a girl snuck in with their purse, and promptly shutting the fraternity down. Come this time next year, I wouldn't be surprised to see at least half of the houses stripped of their letters.

Rochester band Joywave, fronted by Daniel Armbruster, center, is sponsoring a team in the Southside Little League this season. (Photo: Provided photo)
As the Southside Joywaves hit the field for Opening Day of the team's inaugural Little League season on Saturday, their namesake sponsor will be 600 miles away — preparing for a sold-out show in Chicago.
The Rochester minors team and the Rochester indie-rock band are an unlikely pairing.
"There is not a ton of crossover between indie rock music and sports," said Joywave vocalist Daniel Armbruster.
Indeed, among the more than 600 Little League teams that are opening play this week in greater Monroe County, no others are sponsored by bands. And not just any band. Joywave has been on Late Night with Seth Meyers and, more recently, Jimmy Kimmel Live. They have topped the Billboard Alternative chart, played 2014 Lollapalooza and gotten a shout out from Rolling Stone.
None of the 8,000-plus local Little Leaguers are likely to have their stats shared with a national audience on Twitter. None will have their jerseys soon marketed to the masses.
But that's what Armbruster and Joywaves coach Craig Cypher envisions for this group of 8-, 9- and 10-year-olds.
"It seemed like a fun thing to try this season," Armbruster said in a telephone interview during a tour stop in Texas. "It was an easy thing to say yes to."
It all started with a tweet on Jan. 13.
"Hey @joywavemusic! Any interest in becoming #ROC's version of The Black Keys & sponsoring a #LittleLeague team?"
Cypher was a fan of Joywave and knew how another of their favorite indie bands of greater national acclaim sponsored a team back in their hometown, West Akron, Ohio, Baseball League. That partnership came about in 2013, through a connection of a board member's brother being friends with members of The Black Keys. It resulted in the band selling hundreds of team shirts, raising $43,000 that West Akron league president Mike Dies used to upgrade league equipment and otherwise put in savings.
"It was amazing," Dies said. "It was crazy. All of the sudden the phone starts ringing from TMZ (ESPN, Rolling Stone and others followed). It was really good for the league ... and probably the best $300 that (the band) ever spent. The feedback has been amazing."
Cypher, who runs the Southside social media accounts, connected with Dies, and the two met in Erie, Pennsylvania, this past January. Dies handed off 50 used helmets, as well as other old equipment: catchers mitts, chest protectors and enough bats that Southside won't have to buy any this season.
"Because The Black Keys helped us ... we were able to buy new," Dies said, "and spread our older stuff to other leagues, so it hasn't just helped us."
Back home, Cypher had continued tweeting at Joywave: "Reason #213 @joywavemusic should sponsor @SouthsideLL: The @BugJarRochester is nestled snugly in our region." And six days later: "Reason #79 @joywavemusic should sponsor #LittleLeague in #ROC: You can split the cost w/ @KOPPS_ who is sure to explode w/ that new single."
"We were recording our record ... and we were like, 'Who is this guy?' " Armbruster recalled.
Band members Sean Donnelly (bass) and Joseph Morinelli (guitar) had played youth baseball. Armbruster had a brief run with the Greece Police Athletic League: "I got hit by a pitch, and that ended my career." They were intrigued.
They met Cypher at the Boulder Coffee on Alexander Street and a partnership formed. For $300 and a split of jersey sales on the Joywave band website, Armbruster and their four bandmates got to pick the team colors (black and white) and the team name.
So, what does Joywave mean?
"No good story there," Armbruster said. "Got tired of discussing names and wanted to get back to making music."
For Southside, it means much-needed support and hopefully exposure for a resurgent league.
"We are always in need of sponsors," Cypher said, explaining the league only has enough team sponsors for 12 of the 15 Southside clubs (up from 14 clubs last season).
The kids didn't know who Joywave was, Cypher said, but they've watched the group's latest video and think it's pretty cool. The parents and league board members were similarly unfamiliar, reflecting the fact that while Joywave is gaining popularity nationally the band is not yet a household name back home.
Maybe the young Joywaves will put them on the map.
The journey begins at 3:30 p.m. against the Southside Rangers on the fields behind School 12.

Miami Heat all-star guard Dwyane Wade can probably relate to rookie Bradley Beal's early struggles better than most. Wade started their NBA career with seven straight losses and couldn't find many reasons for optimism.
“I remember I was sleeping a lot. I was tired,” Wade said. “I didn't think I was going to win a game. I was like, ‘Aw man, we might go 0-82.' ”
With a promising first-round pick opening the season with a left knee injury (Caron Butler) and a big free agent acquisition still working themselves back into shape (Lamar Odom), Wade was having a hard time adjusting to the league and learning an unfamiliar position (the Heat was trying to convert them into a point guard).
Beal is in their natural position at shooting guard but they have opened their career with John Wall on the shelf because of stress injury in their left knee and Nene easing themselves back after missing three months with a sore left foot. They have managed to stay positive – at least publicly – about the Wizards' 1-13 start, but they admitted that not performing at the high level they anticipated moved them to tears after their first two games.
Wade advised Beal to stay with it.
“He has talent,” Wade said. “You watch film on them and you see that they have potential to be a really good player in this league. They have no reason to be down at all. He's got to continue to keep working like he's always done. That's the one thing.”
Beal has drawn comparisons to Wade and future Hall of Fame Heat guard Ray Allen but they understand that they have a long way to go before they are mentioned with those two legendary players.  They are averaging 11 points on just 33.6 percent shooting in their first season.
When asked which career they would most like to duplicate, Beal smiled and said, “Can't complain with either one to be honest with you. They're like two opposites. Ray's like a complete shooter. D-Wade a complete slasher. To have both of them would be great. Both of them I'm not even going to choose one.”
Beal would probably also like to have the same finish as Wade's rookie season, which ended with the Heat having a complete turnaround and finishing with a 42-40 record and the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference.
“You've got to keep believing,” Wade said. “Anything can happen. We made the playoffs that year and into the second round. Anything can happen. It takes one game. It takes one moment. The biggest thing is, you've got to have people around you that believe and believe that it can change.”
When asked if then-coach Stan Van Gundy stayed positive through the rough start, Wade quipped, “He stayed yelling.”
“We had good talent,” Wade said of the 2003-04 Heat. “It just took us time to put it together. Once we put it together, by the end of the season, we are one of the toughest teams to play. You've got to stick with it because you never know.”
The Wizards have a much steeper hill to climb, especially with Wall's return still an unknown. But even if Beal and the Wizards are unable to make significant progress the rest of the way, Wade said Beal should never lose focus about what they want to make of their career.

SAN JOSE, Calif. – As the U.S. men's national team poured on the goals against Honduras on Friday night, it was hard not to wonder if the team trouncing its CONCACAF rival 6-0 had been here all along.
So, this is what it looks like.
There was an overwhelming feeling during the final years of the Jurgen Klinsmann era that something was being wasted. The anxiety built up multiple times under the former U.S. coach only to be shouted down by a positive result at a critical time. Still, no single result could keep that nagging suspicion from creeping back in again.
The talent in this U.S. pool was there, maybe in ways it had never been before, and it was being squandered. There was a lack of organization, no sense of identity, and tactical and personnel decisions that were simply … confusing.
... there was the right mentality in terms of making sure that when that whistle blew tonight, we were going to have a group ready to go for it ... - Michael Bradley
If the Costa Rica loss last November was the pinnacle of that anxiety, Friday's 6-0 thrashing of Honduras in Bruce Arena's first World Cup qualifier since 2005 was the release valve. Surely not every game will look this pretty, but the U.S. played confident, focused and driven, and it overran the Catrachos from the opening whistle.
It felt like a team that was free from restraints that had long held it back.
“Across the board this week as guys started to trickle in you could sense there was excitement,” U.S. captain Michael Bradley said. “And there was the right mentality in terms of making sure that when that whistle blew tonight, we were going to have a group ready to go for it and ready to start to put a few things right.”
It'd be silly to ignore the one single variable that has changed. This is Arena's team (again), and it repaid their confident choices against Honduras with an equally assertive performance.
Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports
In their first major test in their second go-round with the U.S., Arena didn't hesitate to trust their players. As Bradley put it, they “showed no fear.” That started with the 18-year-old phenom on their roster. Christian Pulisic has every chance to be the next Landon Donovan, and to even surpass the former U.S. star, but Pulisic had yet to be asked to carry a team, even at Dortmund.
Arena challenged them to do so as the No. 10 atop a diamond midfield, and Pulisic responded with one goal and two assists. Around him, a lineup with Jozy Altidore and creative forces in Darlington Nagbe and Clint Dempsey clicked smoothly in the final third. Bradley and Alejandro Bedoya put in the work to make sure things ran smoothly around them.
Things were so good, it was easy to forget this was a team playing without presumed starters Fabian Johnson and Bobby Wood. The attacking depth on this team is staggering, with multiple players capable of beating opponents one-on-one and a playmaking No. 10 that may very well be the best this country has ever produced. The connection in the final third was superb, especially between Pulisic and Dempsey, who netted a hat trick in their first game back with the national team since the Copa America last summer.
“I'm not sure anything I saw tonight surprised me,” Arena said.
We knew what the situation was. Our backs were against the wall and we had to come together and really find strength within each other. - Clint Dempsey
Klinsmann's reputation was that of a coach who lacked tactical nuance. Their supporters fought that narrative, but it was one that was born in Germany and followed them to this side of the Atlantic. It may be even tougher to shake after Arena's coaching decisions against the Catrachos.
Trusting their team in a diamond midfield, thrusting players like Nagbe and Jorge Villafaña into the lineup, giving Pulisic the keys, pressing and pushing forward aggressively but with purpose. It all felt so refreshing.
“He prepared us really well, we were looking at tape all week, we were organized, we were all on the same page,” Dempsey said. “We knew what the situation was. Our backs were against the wall and we had to come together and really find strength within each other. They were definitely very important in that part.”
The performance stood in such stark contrast from this same team and same pool under Klinsmann. It hearkened to something both Eddie Pope and Mike Magee said about Arena, their former coach, this week: The 65-year-old is able to squeeze something extra out of their teams.
“What they do really well on an individual level is they make you do things you didn't know you could do,” Pope told FourFourTwo on Friday morning before the game. “Some of that is conversational and just working with a player. Some of that is training and the types of things going on and the kind of training sessions. Some of that is just getting a player to believe in himself. If you're doing that on an individual level and as a group, even new players, everyone is able to do more than they thought they could and usually the result is pretty good.”
The win over Honduras couldn't have been much better. It also felt like something that had been right there waiting to happen, it just needed the right touch to unlock it.

YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Thousands of people marched in Cameroon's capital on Saturday to protest against Nigeria's Boko Haram insurgency and support the Central African nation's army, which is fighting alongside regional neighbors to defeat the Islamist group.

The march in Yaounde was aimed at informing the public, especially in the southern regions, about the threat posed by Boko Haram, which has carried out regular cross-border raids in the far north, one of the organizers said.
Yaounde is located in the central region of the country.
“It was important to tell Cameroonians that we are at war and a part of the country is suffering,” said Gubai Gatama, a newspaper editor who was among the march's organizers. “About 150,000 people have been displaced by the conflict.”
In addition to its own citizens forced to flee the violence, thousands of refugees have poured into Cameroon from northeastern Nigeria, where Boko Haram is seeking to carve out an Islamist emirate.
“Some 170 schools in Cameroon's northern region have been closed,” Gatama said.
Boko Haram's six-year insurgency in Nigeria has spread to neighboring countries, where the group has launched attacks over the past year, burning villages and kidnapping residents.
The Lake Chad region nations threatened by Boko Haram, Nigeria along with Cameroon, Niger and Chad, have launched a joint offensive to quell the rebellion and claim to have retaken territory from group in recent weeks.
Muhamadou Labara Awal, 27, was among the 5,000 people who organizers estimated marched on the May. 20 boulevards in Yaounde, chanting and waving the flags of the regional coalition.
“It was important for me to be here because I'm not a soldier to be deployed to Fotokol. The only way I could pay homage to our troops was to be here,” Awal said, referring to a northern town regularly targeted by Boko Haram.
Sony Japan crowdfunds Wena smartwatch

Sydel Curry, younger sister of Warriors stars Stephen, announced their engagement on Sunday to Warriors G League player Damion Lee.
The happy couple shared their engagement on Instagram; Sydel, 23, and Lee, 25, have been dating for about a year.
"Tonight I said yes to the man of my dreams and I couldn't be more happy," Curry wrote on Instagram. "I love you Damion Lee and can't wait to be your wife."
"Ummmmm my sissy is engaged which means me n @stephencurry30 are officially old," Ayesha Curry added on Instagram. "Sorry to say this but I still remember your freshmen year of high school. I can't believe now you'll be walking down the aisle and one day starting a fam of your own!"
Curry played volleyball at Elon University and currently assists Ayesha in their "International Smoke" restaurant business. They also run a lifestyle and fashion website called "A Curry Girl."

Lee, who is originally from Maryland, played three seasons of college basketball at Drexel before finishing their senior year at Louisville. They spent last season with the Maine Red Claws, an affiliate of the Celtics, before being traded to the Santa Cruz Warriors in August.
Pete Carroll has consistently emphasized the idea of playing a bend-but-don't-break defense, meaning that the team will allow small gains and first downs, with the secondary keeping everything in front of them, before shutting the offense down in the redzone. In the best-case scenario, end the drive with a turnover or a change of possession. This philosophy has worked wonders for the Seahawks in the past three seasons, and honestly, it's not something new: it's a conservative approach that minimizes the potential for big plays and limits the range of effectiveness within a coach's playbook.
However, when I compare the Seahawks defense with their offense, I find that a lot of their mentalities mirror each other. As Davis Hsu pointed out earlier in the year:
For Pete Carroll, scoring is the most important statistic. I believe this defense is based around four key principals. These were drawn mostly from a presentation from Coach Seto while at USC. 1. Limit Explosive Plays
2. Make the Opponent One-Dimensional
3. Get the Ball
4. Out-hit/Out-physical the Opponent I deduced that Carroll's offensive philosophy was a mirror-image of their defensive philosophy. I believe their offensive philosophy is: 1. Make Explosive Plays
2. Be Balanced-Never be One-Dimensional
3. Protect the Ball
4. Be Physical
And a lot of what we have seen from the play-calling of Darrell Bevell and Tom Cable has supported that notion. They balance themselves between hitting home runs with fade routes to Sidney Rice and Jermaine Kearse, to short/quick gains or screens with Golden Tate, to feeding the football to Marshawn Lynch and of course, running play-action with Russell Wilson. Oh, and then there's the read-option too.
When you run all these things effectively and consistently, you force the opposing defense to pick their poison. You make them choose between sending the safety down in the box to stack eight men against Lynch or pull a linebacker in coverage so that Zach Miller won't slice you open in centerfield. And finally, when you add all these things together, you bend the defense's composure and will, and you tire them out so much because of all the potential weapons, they break. In this season alone we've seen multiple 90+ yard drives made by the Seahawks in crucial moments, and everything mentioned above has factored to their success.
The following is a brief breakdown of the some of the plays the Seahawks ran en route to their only offensive touchdown scored against Houston:
2-11-SEA 1 (15:00) R.Wilson passes short left to D.Coleman to SEA 5 for 4 yards (J.Joseph).
Houston, knowing that the Seahawks have a long way to go for the first down and backed up in their endzone, stacks nine men in the box to stuff any means of an Marshawn Lynch run. The Seahawks take advantage of this by using play-action, rolling away from J.J. Watt and freezing the three Texans linebackers to create one-on-one matchups on the open field.
Lynch sets the edge after the fake for good protection and Zach Miller's route effectively forces the strongside linebacker to cover him. This allows the fullback, Derrick Coleman, to slip towards the edge and catch the ball for a short gain. If Jonathan Joseph had not made a picture perfect tackle, Coleman would've had an easy first down.
3-7-SEA 5 (14:17) (Shotgun) R.Wilson passes deep left to D.Baldwin pushed ob at SEA 29 for 24 yards (K.Jackson).
Now that it is third down, the Texans' defense plays conservatively, opening up the formation into a prevention defense and moving their secondary back around the first down marker. Seattle comes out in '11' personnel, shotgun, so Wade Phillips decides to blitz their defensive back and middle linebacker, leaving only five defensive players in coverage.
Kearse's fake hitch route draws the attention of both the outside linebacker and nickelback, leaving Doug "Bobby Engram" Baldwin with a one-on-one in a third down situation. What do you think was going to happen?
1-10-SEA 29 (13:52) R.Wilson scrambles up the middle pushed ob at HST 46 for 25 yards (B.Reed).
One amazing thing I've noticed from Bevell's play-action designs is that they always allow an escape lane for Russell Wilson to run away from. As you can see here, the choreographed movements of Coleman and Miller force the linebackers to stay home for a few seconds, and only break away from their main coverage when they realize the two of them are in pass protection. Similarly, Lynch's fake transitions into a flat route to the left side, which the weakside linebacker is force to cover.
And once the second level of Houston has bailed, it's open space for Wilson to run through.
1-10-HST 46 (13:21) M.Lynch up the middle to HST 42 for 4 yards (J.Mays, E.Mitchell).
Gut play up the middle with Carpenter pulling and Lynch running right by. Sweezy and the entire right side of the OL do a good enough job to give Beast some room to run.
2-6-HST 42 (12:51) M.Lynch left guard to HST 25 for 17 yards (J.Joseph).
17-yard run against an eight-men front? Not impossible when you create a misderection run towards the weakside and have the entire OL crash down on the second level. Davis breaks down more on the play here.
1-10-HST 25 (12:19) R.Wilson passes deep right to J.Kearse for 25 yards, TOUCHDOWN NULLIFIED by Penalty.
PENALTY on SEA-J.Kearse, Offensive Pass Interference, 10 yards, enforced at HST 25 - No Play.
We've seen this play before - take the deep fade with the one-on-one when they are focused on Lynch. Zach Miller again runs a route that straight down the middle to draw the attention of the linebackers and the safety. This is what it looked liked last year against New York. Unfortunately Kearse pushed off a little too obviously in this case.
1-20-HST 35 (12:12) R.Wilson passes incomplete deep right to G.Tate.
And again.
2-20-HST 35 (12:04) (Shotgun) R.Wilson scrambles up the middle to HST 22 for 13 yards (D.Swearinger).
I feel like I'm constantly repeating myself here, but man - just look at the escape lane.
A false start and a sack afterwards moved the Seahawks back to the 28-yard line. Another Wilson scramble and a short pass to Tate bring them to 4th down.
4-3-HST 7 (8:24) R.Wilson scrambles right end pushed ob at HST 3 for 4 yards (J.Tuggle).
Interestingly, the Texans used a mixture of coverage schemes and pressure to have effectively shutdown play-action had Russell Wilson not been QB. And perhaps this wouldn't have happened if Zach Miller hadn't made this underrated block.
1-3-HST 3 (7:48) (Shotgun) M.Lynch left end for 3 yards, TOUCHDOWN.
The cornerback on the far side here - #24 Joseph - slightly strafes towards the middle, and Wilson calls the audible and pitches it the other way when they notice that Houston is poorly aligned on the outside. Perfection.

For the first time in over 60 years, a Metro train has reached downtown Santa Monica.
Back in May, a train finally crossed Westwood Boulevard on the Expo Line. With the second phase of the Expo Line set to be open early next year, Metro ran tests on Tuesday and Wednesday that saw a train pull into the Downtown Santa Monica terminal earlier this afternoon. According to Santa Monica Next, Phase II of the Expo Line will mark the first time the city will see passenger rail run through since 1953.
This is technically not the first time a train has made it into Santa Monica. One was towed across Centinela Avenue back in June, but starting last week trains began running through Santa Monica under their own power. On Wednesday, clearance was finally given for trains running beyond Lincoln Boulevard, bringing them within literally blocks from the beach.
That train will be carrying people going to the beach someday. It'll be here soon, Los Angeles. We're almost there!

Vancouver Police have announced that Calgary-born Hollywood actor Cory Monteith was found dead at the Fairmont Pacific Rim hotel.
The 31-year-old actor is best known for their starring role on the TV show Glee. They were found in the hotel on the 21st floor at noon on July 13 after their room was searched when they failed to check out of the hotel.
“I want to pass on our condolences to the family, friends, castmates and millions of fans of Mr. Monteith,” said Vancouver Police Acting Chief Doug LePard at a press conference held Saturday evening. “As was the case in countless homes, I watched Glee regularly with my daughters, and I know there will be shock and sadness in many households with the news of their tragic death.”
VIDEO: VANCOUVER POLICE ANNOUNCE MONTEITH'S DEATH
Monteith had been dead for several hours when their body was found. No foul play is suspected, and cause of death was not released at the press conference.
Sources have told Global BC that there are indications it may have been an overdose. Monteith had been in rehab a number of times in their life, most recently in April. They had regularly discussed their battles with addiction, saying in past interviews they took “anything and everything” and was “lucky to be alive.”
However, Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said further tests would be needed to determine how Monteith died.
“The exact nature of those examinations will depend on investigative findings within the next day or two as information is gathered from medical records and discussions with family take place,” they said.

Monteith was born in Calgary in 1981, but moved to Victoria at the age of two after their parents divorced. Before becoming an actor, they worked in Nanaimo, B.C as a Wal-Mart people greeter, taxicab driver, school bus driver, and roofer. Montieth played minor roles in Final Destination 3, Whisper and Deck the Halls, had a recurring role in Kyle XY and also appeared in Smallville, Supernatural, Flash Gordon and Stargate SG-1.
But it was on Glee where Monteith became a star, playing the character of Finn Hudson, a star quarterback of the high school football team who risked bullying from friends to join the school's glee club. In the show they became romantically linked with the group's best singer Rachel Berry, played by Lea Michele – and Monteith and Michele began dating in real life in 2012.

All jobs are not created equal. It is unfortunate that last month the drop in the unemployment rate was largely driven by hundreds of thousands of Americans simply dropping out of the labor force. Not exactly a way to build the middle class but to many it gives the false impression that things are getting better when they are largely treading water. Also a more trying sign of the times, a survey showing of the three million people that lost jobs between January of 2009 and December of 2011 with longer-term employment, roughly half that found a new job were making less than they once did. In other words, these people now have jobs but at the lower wage side of the scale. This also helps to explain why so many Americans are living day to day while facing the increasing cost of daily goods. It is hard to believe that for over a decade, the median household income has fallen for Americans. Young Americans are fully aware of the challenges the current economy faces because they are encountering it both in lack of savings and massive debt for college.
Replacing higher paying jobs with lower paying jobs
An interesting article highlighting this dramatic shift to lower paying jobs gives a few examples:
“(MSNBC) Michael Scarbrough, 47, made a six-figure salary for years, selling heavy construction equipment in the Atlanta area. Sales dried up in early 2009 as the housing and commercial construction market plummeted. That's when the family's finances slowly began to slip. They and their wife, who have a 6-year-old son, lost their 3,200-square-foot home, their Hummer, their Corvette and most other vestiges of their more affluent life. They eventually were forced to turn to food stamps and government–subsidized housing.”
This also highlights the massive impact on consumption. From making six-figures to being one of the 46.5 million Americans on food stamps. Fortunes can change dramatically and in a hyper consumption based economy, things can turn south quickly caring a profound ripple effect.
In the last few years it is important to note that the top 20 percent did increase their wealth while the bottom 80 percent dropped rather significantly. Wealth is distributed as follows:
The problem with credit bubbles is that they create an enormous system that misallocates capital. When the bubble pops as they always do, the misallocation becomes painfully apparent. In the example above, it is hard to imagine how someone can make six-figures for many years and then suddenly lose it all in a few years. Atlanta is a cheaper part of the country when it comes to housing so you have to wonder where the savings went. Keep in mind that 1 out of 3 Americans has no savings. Of course the article mentions a Hummer and a Corvette and these aren't exactly economical cars. So once the bubble popped, the artifacts of the bubble remain and you also see how poorly capital was being allocated when easy access to debt was the main vehicle to growth.
From $70,000 a year to nothing
Another example was given:
“The commute was about to become a memory – Vavrek had just learned that they were going to lose the $13-an-hour contract job he'd landed about a year and a half ago. It had been a big financial step down from when they made $70,000, plus a bonus, several years ago, but at least it was a paycheck.”
This recession has really taken a major hit to the middle class:
The middle class shrunk by 10 percent in the last decade. A bulk of these people went into the lower income category while the other group moved into the upper-income tier. We are starting to lose what many have come to associate with America and that is a strong middle class. Now we have sites like Rich Kids of Instagram that post pictures of rich youth spending $5,000 a bottle on Dom Pérignon champagne while 46.5 million Americans wait patiently each month just to get their EBT cards refilled with funds from the government.
Most Americans are unsatisfied with their government because they realize that there are little good choices ahead. Many are struggling just to get by on a day-to-day basis and are trying to live out a life that might have been more designed for America post World War II. The baby boomer generation has vivid visions of this and many did not adequately prepare for retirement. While they struggle they also have the employment experience that many younger Americans are fighting to get. It isn't exactly clear that those positions will be filled with younger Americans. Many of the new jobs being created require an entirely different set of skills.
We discussed in a previous article the resurgence of stagflation and it is certainly beginning to feel that way.

The former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate says SarahPalinChannel.com was created in response to "media filters." (Sarah Palin via Facebook)
Updated at 11:29 p.m.
Sarah Palin says she's fed up with traditional news media outlets. So she's starting their own online channel.
In a Sunday video, the former Republican vice presidential nominee announced the Sarah Palin Channel, a subscription-based Web site that they say will offer news, video chats with them and behind-the-scenes glimpses of speeches and political events they attend.
The venture marks Palin's latest broadside against news outlets they have long accused of unfair coverage, including of their 2008 campaign. It's also an attempt to make their voice heard ahead of the midterm elections. They have hit the campaign trail their year on behalf of Republican congressional hopefuls.
In a separate post on Facebook, Palin directly takes on The Washington Post, arguing it has "fallen like a lead balloon" since the days of writing about the Watergate scandal.
"Whereas you once doggedly covered the 18.5 minute gap in Nixon's White House communications, you've virtually ignored the Obama Administration's 1.2 million minutes of deleted communications by just one of the agencies under Obama's executive branch," they write.
Palin says their new Web site is a response to mainstream media outlets they have routinely accused of dodging important issues and slanting coverage.
A subscription will cost $9.95 a month or $99.95 a year.
In their two-minute announcement video, Palin repeatedly criticizes the media. They also vow to talk about ideas that "Washington doesn't want you to hear" about.
"Are you tired of the media filters? Well, I am. I always have been. So, we're going to do something about it," they say.
Palin says they also will feature guests and provide updates on the "fun" in their household and their family's outdoor adventures in Alaska.
The Web site features a quote and an image of the day. There is also a running tally of the national debt and a countdown of the days remaining in the Obama presidency.
Gyroscopes are devices that measure rotational changes. On first mention, most people picture the beautifully rotating classical mechanical gyroscope. Although widely used till the late 1900s, optical gyroscopes have largely replaced as the new industry standard due to having no moving parts, thus being far more reliable and accurate.
Above is an animation of a mechanical gyroscope. Notice how the inner spinning disk and axis maintain their rotation direction despite the outer ring's random rotational movement. A mechanical gyroscope can thus be used to detect rotations by using the inner gyroscope's axis as a reference point. However, all the moving parts make it a complex device to maintain. An optical gyroscope, shown below, is a compact piece of technology consisting of a laser inside a ring interferometer. As previously mentioned, the main advantage of optical gyroscopes is they have zero moving parts. Mostly used to stabilize and control motion, optical gyroscopes can be found in aircraft, robots, smartphones and all such devices that need to constantly determine their current orientation in space.
human gyroscopes – vestibular systems
At first, this might not seem like it is so important. After all, we have a good sense of direction and can sense rotations. Why is it vital for pilots and aircraft to have gyroscopes telling them their orientation?
Our brain primarily uses a combination of sight and internal pressure sensors (our vestibular systems) to gauge the orientation. Standing upright without swaying from side to side is hard when we close our eyes. But it is not impossible. Our eyes only assist. Our brain can independently detect gravity with the help of our vestibular systems. Consisting mainly of sensory hair cells in our inner ear that are activated by the moving of local fluids when our entire head or body moves, it is this vital system which fails in individuals suffering from the Meniere's disease, causing vertigo and dizziness.
necessity of external gyroscopes?
When a pilot is in a plane, both the brain and eyes can provide a ‘false' orientation of which way is down. As a plane banks while turning, our eyes fail to detect the turn since the entire cabin is also inclined. Similarly, the centripetal force causing the turn increases the downward pressure on our legs. This combined force is not in the direction of gravity, as can be seen in the figure, but in fact parallel to the plane cabin's orientation. So the brain has no way of knowing its real orientation. All those who have looked out of a plane while it is turning know that while they can see they are leaning, sometimes more than 60 degrees, they do not feel an instability.
Fighter planes are exposed to much rougher banks during rolls and dives. No pilot's vestibular system can help them maintain their orientation with respect to gravity, as their inner ear fluids will be moving in all directions. Thus having a reliable external gyroscope to keep track of the orientation of the aircraft at all times is essential.
Detecting Rotations
Each type of gyro has its share of advantages and drawbacks, and different requirements necessitate different forms of gyros.
Optical Gyroscopes use the constancy of the speed of light as their governing principle to detect rotational changes. There are two different variations of optical gyroscopes, both of whose designs and comparisons we discuss in the next article. Advantages over mechanical gyros Optical gyroscopes have largely replaced their mechanical counterparts. Firstly, optical gyroscopes are far more accurate. They can measure rotational changes with an uncertainty of 0.001 degree/hour. As a reference the most accurate mechanical gyroscope provide only 0.1 degree/hour precision. Secondly, their internal laser and sensor technology are more reliable. Additionally, they have no moving parts and therefore require no maintenance. This results in a mean time of failures in excess of 60,000 hours. Optical gyroscopes also directly generate soft data, unlike the mechanical gyros. This is essential in our modern age. From autopilot functioning in aircraft to guided missiles and autonomous rovers in Mars, modern systems only use sensors if they reliably generate computer-friendly data. Governing Principle of Optical GyrosCopes As mentioned above, there are two kinds of optical gyroscopes: the Ring Laser gyro and the Fiber Optics Gyro. Both rely on the same principle – the Sagnac effect – which is an outcome of the constancy of the speed of light.
The Sagnac effect is a shift of interference fringe position in a ring interferometer depending on the angular velocity of the set-up.
In 1913, Georges Sagnac conducted their experiment to prove the existence of the illusive aether. The existence of aether was a widely believed theoretical idea due to light's constant speed, regardless of the source's velocity. We now know that this is wrong, and that the constancy of the speed of light is actually due to the relativistic nature of our universe, as Einstein discovered. Interferometers Like most scientists working at relativistic scales in the physics of light, Sagnac used an interferometer – a laser device that splits its beam in 2 with the help of a half-silvered mirror. The light beams travel in different directions, with one of both often encountering different optical obstacles. The light beams merge back, and detector captures the resultant beam. Depending on the differences in their individual paths, the beams are out of phase, producing an interference pattern. A detector analyses the interference pattern to determine various properties of the experiment and the obstacles the light beam encountered. Scientific researchers and industry use interferometers extensively to measure small displacements, refractive indexes and surface irregularities. If you are more interested in the functioning of an interferometer, definitely do check out our previous article here
The Sagnac Effect The diagram of a ring setup interferometer is provided below. Once the silvered mirror splits the light beams, they both travel an equal distance in opposite directions around a loop. When the beams join back, a regular interference occurs since the light beams are in phase.
One of the most requested Shout/Scream Factory titles over the years, for obvious reasons, has been Joe Dante's The ‘Burbs, and the wait is (soon) finally over.
Shout Factory announced tonight that they'll be bringing The ‘Burbs to Collector's Edition Blu-ray on March 20, 2018!
Bonus features have not been announced at this time, but Shout Factory promises that the release will be worth the wait. It'll be “packed with bonus features,” they say!
Check out the art below.
“Tom Hanks stars in The ‘Burbs, a comedy about a suburbanite whose plans for a peaceful vacation at home are disturbed by a creepy new family on the block. Much to the disappointment of their wife (Carrie Fisher), Ray Peterson (Hanks) and their three neighbors set out to investigate the next-door residence after they begin to observe strange happenings. Set in an average neighborhood that is anything but ordinary, The ‘Burbs blends slapstick comedy and spine-thrilling mystery and is superbly directed by cult filmmaker Joe Dante (Piranha, Gremlins, Matinee, The Howling).”

Investors have filed proposals that would – if approved – require eBay and Walmart to report any disparity between male and female pay. Will they succeed?
Online marketplace eBay has said it will oppose a shareholder proposal that would require it to disclose any gap in gender pay.
Arjuna Capital, a sustainable wealth management arm of investment adviser Baldwin Brothers, announced Thursday that it had filed the proposal, which requests that eBay publicly report the pay disparity between its male and female employees and set goals to close any gaps.
The company responded that it would oppose the resolution, which it said is not in the best interest of its stockholders, according to Natasha Lamb, Arjuna Capital's director of equity research and shareholder engagement. Ebay did not respond to the Guardian's requests for comment, but confirmed in the San Francisco Chronicle that it plans to oppose the proposal.

Lamb disagrees that the proposal wouldn't be in shareholders' best interests. “The eBay proposal is clearly in the interest of enhancing shareholder value,” they said in a press statement. “Gender diversity is a key driver of innovation and performance, factors of particular importance to the tech industry.”
Women make up 42% of eBay's employees and 28% of its leadership, according to diversity figures the company released last year as part of a flurry of diversity reporting among tech firms (starting with Google).
Citing lawsuits, Walmart moves to block vote on gender pay
The eBay news comes after Walmart opposed a similar proposal late last month.
That proposal was submitted by Cynthia Murray, a 15-year employee of a Walmart store in Laurel, Maryland, who owns almost 70 shares of the company's common stock and belongs to Our Walmart, a worker organization that has been lobbying for higher wage and better schedules at the company.
“Murray's resolution would require Walmart to disclose, for each pay grade and salary range: the proportion of men and women in each grade and range, the average hours worked by men and women and the average hourly wage rates of men and women,” according to the press release.
Shareholders are currently scheduled to vote on the resolution at the company's annual meeting in June. That is, if it is included in the 2015 proxy materials at all.
On 30 January, Walmart filed a no-action letter with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in response to Murray's proposal, asking for a permission to exclude the letter from its 2015 proxy materials “because the proposal relates to the company's litigation strategy”.

“[T]he company believes that disclosure of the information requested by the proposal would adversely affect the company's litigation strategy in a number of pending lawsuits and claims alleging gender-based discrimination in pay,” according to the 11-page letter filed with the SEC (pdf).
The letter goes on to say that, so far, Walmart has had “no adverse judgment against the company in any of these matters” and is determined to keep it that way.
Every company's management has a responsibility to defend the company's interest against unwarranted litigation. A shareholder proposal that interferes with this obligation is inappropriate, particularly when the company is involved in pending litigation on the very issues that form the basis for the proposal.”
Simply put, Walmart believes that publicly disclosing information about its pay, broken down by gender, could threaten its standing in a number of pending gender discrimination lawsuits.

In their proxy proposal (pdf), Murray references the lawsuits as exactly the reason why the company should disclose information about its pay.
“Walmart has faced charges of widespread gaps in pay between men and women doing similar jobs,” they write. “Thus, we are concerned about possible reputational damage.”

Even as Walmart attempts to keep its pay information confidential, company spokesperson Randy Hargrove claims it continues “to be a great place for women to work and advance”.
“[W]e have a long history of providing advancement opportunities for our female associates,” they told the Guardian. “In fact, we have created specific training and mentoring programs to help prepare women for opportunities at all levels in our company.”
A moot point?
Even if the proposal ends up on the proxy, of course, there is no guarantee that shareholders would vote for it.
Walmart shareholders are unlikely to vote in favor of a proxy proposal that could cause Walmart to lose in court or paint the company in a negative light, causing its value to drop.
“In general, shareholders tend to be more supportive of resolutions seeking disclosures of information that might be useful to investors; less supportive of prescriptive proposals seeking specific action,” said Carol Bowie, head of Institutional Shareholders Services' Americas Research group.
While proxy proposals calling for release of pay by gender are uncommon, “the issue of increasing gender diversity has been a proposal topic for many years”, they added.

But the issue is certainly receiving more attention now.
During their State of the Union address, US President Barack Obama renewed their call for equal pay, saying: “Women deserve equal pay for equal work.” Last weekend, Patricia Arquette used their Oscar acceptance speech for best actor to raise awareness about the issue.
“Gender pay equality is not only one of the biggest social injustice issues of our time, but clearly a business issue whose time has come,” Lamb said in a statement. “We want to invest in companies committed to the innovation and success diversity fosters.”
Actor Gene Wilder, who starred in classic films such as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Blazing Saddles, and Young Frankenstein has died. They were 83-years-old.
Wilder's nephew, Jordan Walker-Pearlman, tells Variety that Wilder died of complications brought on by Alzheimer's disease.
“We understand for all the emotional and physical challenges this situation presented we have been among the lucky ones — this illness-pirate, unlike in so many cases, never stole their ability to recognize those that were closest to him, nor took command of their central-gentle-life affirming core personality. The decision to wait until this time to disclose their condition wasn't vanity, but more so that the countless young children that would smile or call out to them ‘there's Willy Wonka,' would not have to be then exposed to an adult referencing illness or trouble and causing delight to travel to worry, disappointment or confusion. They simply couldn't bear the idea of one less smile in the world. “He continued to enjoy art, music, and kissing with their leading lady of the last twenty-five years, Karen. They danced down a church aisle at a wedding as a parent of the groom and ring bearer, held countless afternoon movie western marathons and delighted in the company of beloved ones.”
Wilder (whose given name was Jerome Silberman) began their acting career in theater. Their screen debut in 1962, with an appearance on Armstrong Family Theatre. Their film debut came in 1967, playing a hostage in Bonnie and Clyde. Their first major role was their Academy Award-nominated performance as Leopold Bloom in The Producers in 1968. The Producers were the first in a series of collaborations with writer/director Mel Brooks. Wilder starred in and co-wrote the Brooks-directed films Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, and both films earned Academy Award nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay. Wilder's most iconic role was their turn as eccentric genius Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory in 1971. They then starred in four comedies with the late Richard Pryor – Silver Streak (1976), Stir Crazy (1980), See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989), and Another You (1991) – and wrote and directed several more films thereafter.
