Nadia Georgina Oates (born 26 May 1990) is a former English singer, rapper, producer and model. They were featured on Space Cowboy's 2007 single "My Egyptian Lover". They have since released two studio albums—Hot Like Wow (2008) and Colours (2011)—both entirely produced by Space Cowboy. Since 2012, they have not released any new music and has most likely retired from the music industry.
History
Hot Like Wow, 2007 to 2008
Oh's debut album Hot Like Wow was produced by Space Cowboy and released in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2008 by Tiger Trax Records, with songs featured on the American TV shows Ugly Betty, Gossip Girl and So You Think You Can Dance. On 16 July 2011, the title track "Hot Like Wow" was featured on So You Think You Can Dance for the second time. The album was preceded by three singles: "My Egyptian Lover", "Something 4 The Weekend" and "N.A.D.I.A Oh" from 2007 to 2008. The album was however supported by the release of the single, "Got Your Number", that bought their international attention on the American TV series, Gossip Girl.
Colours, 2009 to 2012
Oh worked once again with Space Cowboy on their second studio album, Colours, released on 8 May 2011. Singles from the album, "Taking Over the Dancefloor" (originally titled "Kate Middleton"), which received airplay on BBC Radio 1's The Scott Mills Show, and "No Bueno", showcase a moombahton style and were named Song of the Day by Popjustice on 21 March and 27 June 2011, respectively. Colours was re-issued in September 2011 to include "No Bueno", "Shade", "I Like It Loud" and "Follow Me".
Oh has been working on new music since mid-late 2011, with two tracks being released on SoundCloud as free downloads so far; "Vampire Night" featuring Space Cowboy and "Fqn Amazing". In early 2012, they released "Slapper (Ayye)" through iTunes however since this they have not released any new material.
2013–present: Hiatus and modelling
Since 2012, Oh has not released any new material despite suggesting otherwise. They have since pursued a career in modelling. It is unclear if Oh plans on returning to music.

Joseph Edward Rall (February 3, 1920 – February 28, 2008) was an American endocrinologist and research director at the National Institutes of Health. They were an expert on the thyroid gland, particularly its proteins and its relationship with radioactive iodine.
Early life and education
Rall was born in 1920 in Naperville, Illinois. They obtained a B.A. from North Central College in 1941 before enrolling at Northwestern University. At Northwestern, they served as a teaching assistant and a research fellow in pharmacology while completing their studies; they received a Master's degree in 1944 and an M.D. in 1945. Their residency and fellowship at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which began in 1945, was interrupted by two years of military service in Germany with the Medical Corps following the Second World War. They eventually completed their fellowship at Mayo Clinic in 1950. They developed an interest in endocrinology, the thyroid and radioactive iodine at Mayo, and in 1952 they were awarded a PhD by the University of Minnesota for research on the metabolism of thyroxine.
Career
In 1950, Rall relocated to New York City to work at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center alongside Rulon Rawson, who was investigating the use of radioactive iodine in the treatment of thyroid cancer. In New York, they were an assistant professor at Cornell University Medical College and began research into radiation-induced thyroid cancer as a result of hydrogen bomb testing in the Marshall Islands. They have also begun a lifelong collaboration with Jacob Robbins, with whom they studied thyroid proteins including thyroglobulin, and established the "free thyroxine hypothesis", which holds that thyroxine is only active when not bound to protein.
Rall was recruited by the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, to run a new laboratory, the Clinical Endocrinology Branch (CEB), at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases. The branch initially focused on thyroid physiology and diseases, but later expanded to encompass diabetes as well as disorders of growth hormone and the gonads. Under Rall, the CEB hosted many visiting international scientists and had a longstanding association with the laboratory run by Nino Salvatore in Italy. In 1962, Rall was appointed Director of Intramural Research of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. They served as Deputy Director for Intramural Research for NIH in 1983 until their retirement in 1990.
Rall was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the French Société de biologie and the Belgian Royal Academy of Medicine, and received honorary degrees from the University of Naples (Italy) and Charles University (Czech Republic). They were president of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) in 1964 and received distinguished service awards from the ATA and the Endocrine Society.
Death
Rall died on February 28, 2008, aged 88.

Two Sisters from Boston is a 1946 musical comedy film directed by Henry Koster and starring Kathryn Grayson, June Allyson, Lauritz Melchior, Jimmy Durante and Peter Lawford. The film features songs by Sammy Fain and Ralph Freed.
Plot
Abigail, a young lady from Boston, leaves home to go to New York City for singing lessons in pursuit of their grand ambition to sing for the Metropolitan Opera. Unable to make ends meet, they take a job singing in a Bowery beer hall without telling anyone from their family back home.
When a rumor gets back to Boston that Abigail is performing at a beer hall and showing their limbs, their family is shocked and they decide that they must come to New York and investigate the rumor. Abigail then lies to their family and claims to sing in the Metropolitan Opera, not a beer hall. They even sneak into a performance at the Met, persuading their family that they really are a singer there, despite causing a mishap that interferes with Olaf Olstrom, the company's top tenor.
Martha, Abigail's sister, eventually figures things out. They decide that they must help Abigail really get into the opera so that Abigail can leave their scandalous job at the beer hall. Along the way, Martha must cover for Abigail and protect the secret of their job at the beer hall. Martha ends up meeting a young man named Lawrence and begins a romance with him.

Reception
According to MGM records, the film was a hit, making $3,334,000 in the US and Canada and $1,127,000 elsewhere, leading to a profit of $605,000.
Influence
The English post-punk band The Chameleons used a sample from the film as the introduction to the song "Don't Fall," the first song on their 1983 debut album Script of the Bridge. The scene features Lawford's character, Lawrence Tyburt Patterson, Jr., asking their mother, played by Nella Walker, about the age of their father. After they tell them that their father is younger than they look and still 'spry,' Patterson, Jr. says "In their autumn, before the winter, comes man's last mad surge of youth." Their mother quickly replies, "What on earth are you talking about?" These two lines consist of the sample as used by the Chameleons. Patterson, Jr. goes on to say that they are quoting the ancient Greek dramatist Sophocles, but the quote itself appears to be either apocryphal, misattributed by the screenwriters or else created by them originally. The Chameleons also used the same sample on an otherwise instrumental recording from the same period, "Prisoners of the Sun."

The Nebula Award for Best Short Story is a literary award assigned each year by Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) for science fiction or fantasy short stories. A work of fiction is defined by the organization as a short story if it is less than 7,500 words; awards are also given out for longer works in the categories of novel, novella, and novelette. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration a short story must be published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition. The Nebula Award for Best Short Story has been awarded annually since 1966. The award has been described as one of "the most important of the American science fiction awards" and "the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent" of the Emmy Awards.
Nebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of SFWA, though the authors of the nominees do not need to be a member. Works are nominated each year by members in a period around December 15 through January 31, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Soon after, members are given a month to vote on the ballot, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. Beginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then reach the final ballot in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary ballot for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.
During the 57 nomination years, 231 authors have had works nominated; 44 of these have won, including co-authors. One of these authors, Lisa Tuttle, refused their award, and in 1971 no winner was chosen as "no award" received the highest number of votes. Harlan Ellison won three times out of eight nominations, both the highest number of wins and the highest number of nominations of any author. Ten authors have won twice, with Karen Joy Fowler at seven and Gardner Dozois at six having the next highest nomination count after Ellison. Michael Swanwick has the most nominations for short story without winning at six, and Howard Waldrop and Gene Wolfe are next with five each. No other author has been nominated more than four times.
Winners and nominees
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the short story was first published. Each year links to the corresponding "year in literature". Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer's name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist. Entries with a gray background and a plus sign (+) mark a year when "no award" was selected as the winner.

The Nizam-i Cedid () was a series of reforms carried out by Ottoman Sultan Selim III during the late 18th and the early 19th centuries in a drive to catch up militarily and politically with the Western powers. The New Order regime was launched by Selim III and a coalition of reformers. Its central objectives were the creation of a professional army along European lines, a private treasury to finance military spending and other administrative reforms. The age of the New Order can be generally said to have lasted from 1789 to 1807, when Selim III was deposed by a Janissary coup.
While the term “New Order” eventually came to encompass all of Selim III's reforms, the name was used contemporaneously to refer only to the reform's central innovation: the New Order Army. That army was largely a failure in its own time but reflected an important step in the stages of Ottoman attempts at reform.
Selim III's desire for an army necessitated far-reaching changes in the bureaucracy and structure of the Ottoman Empire and profoundly reorganised contemporary Ottoman politics.
The New Order, according to the historian Stanford Shaw, reflected a profound shift in Ottoman thinking on how to confront the West. Hitherto, Ottomans had conceived of beating the West by returning to the glory days of the 16th century, but the Nizam-i Djedid reforms were premised on the idea that Western ideas and processes had to be adopted to restore Ottoman global prestige.
Etymology
Nizam and cedid are loanwords from Arabic in Turkish. The equivalent phrase in Arabic would be , An-Niẓām Al-Jadīd, meaning "new order" or "new system".
Selim III's forces were designed to be a new force to counterbalance the Janissaries, which were regularly accused of being both ineffectual and of holding too much political power.
The irony, however, was that yenicheri, the Turkish word for Janissaries, also means “new army”, thus leading to the designation of Nizam-i Cedid (“New Order”) forces instead.
Origins
The mid-to-late 18th century witnessed increasing great power competition as new empires, most notably Britain and France, arose and consolidated their respective dominions. The Ottoman Empire increasingly seemed to be falling behind its rivals, especially Russia and Austria, which had each dealt the Ottoman regime several defeats since the 1760s.
The most notable of them was the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, which resulted in the loss of Crimea to Russia, which was also was given major concessions: permission for its ships to sail freely in the Black Sea, access to the Mediterranean and consulates and an embassy in Ottoman territory.
In 1774, Sultan Mustafa summed up the atmosphere of the time in verse: “The world is in decay, do not think it will be right with us; The state has declined into meanness and vulgarity, Everyone at the court is concerned with pleasure; Nothing remains for us but divine mercy”. They died shortly thereafter. Their successor and brother, Abdulhamid I, initiated a second war in an attempt to reclaim what had been lost in Crimea, but it was a disaster.
A decisive battle in 1789 became a show of Ottoman military weakness since 120,000 Janissaries were defeated by 8,000 Russian troops on the shores of the Danube. New Order reformers argued that the Janissary corps had grown from a hardened fighting force into an entrenched interest group with little interest in training and fighting.
In 1789, Selim III inherited the throne from their uncle Abdulhamid at the age of 28. They also inherited the Second Russian-Turkish War, which resulted in a humiliating loss for the empire and the reinforcement of the disaster of Küçük Kaynarca at the Treaty of Jassy in 1792. Selim headed a coalition of reformers and quickly convened a consultative assembly to advance tajdid, or renewal.
While Selim III often receives credit for the military reforms, they were hardly the sole instigator. Ideas for reform, especially of the military, had preoccupied the Ottoman political class for nearly a century before Selim III took the throne. The first Western-style military training in the Ottoman world was done without the Sultan's knowledge. In 1790, as Stanford Shaw documents, Koca Yusuf Pasha organised a separate corps to drill a select core of soldiers in the midst of the Second Russian-Turkish War (Shaw 294).
Reforms
The primary focus on the New Order reforms for which all others were named was military reform. Selim III, having seen their armies easily routed by European forces, brought foreign lecturers to serve as military advisers and organized two colleges for Naval and Army Engineering, respectively, along European lines, with French as the language of instruction. Selim also embarked on an institutional reorganization of the Armed Forces bringing Artillery and Transportation into the same department. The investment quickly paid results, and several hundred New Order forces widely outperformed conventional Ottoman troops in the 1799 defense of Acre from Napoleon Bonaparte.
The greatest threat to the New Order remained the Janissaries. Indeed, the Janissaries' shortcomings were simply indicative of deeper financial, organizational and disciplinary problems affecting the Ottoman state". In its initial stages, the whole reform had to be hidden to avoid provoking them by embedding the New Order Troops within another unit.
In theory, the Janissaries were also subject to reform and training according to the European style, but they would resist it in practice. While some of the more radical reformers urged Selim to abolish the Janissaries, that proved a major political problem in practice. There were also attempts to co-opt the Janissaries, and the Sublime Porte issued decrees praising their role in Ottoman history as well as assuring them that their salaries would continue.
The military reforms, however, also entailed a whole host of economic reforms. The new military demanded new forms of taxation and the uprooting of entrenched elite groups, and the “New Order Army” had to be financed by a “New Treasury” (Irad-i Cedid). Absentee or irresponsible timar holders would find their licences cancelled and seized by the government.New taxes were levied, and old taxes were reappropriated to fund the New Treasury, including taxes on alcohol and wool. Ottomans also embarked on broader reforms of the tariff system. While non-Muslims had enjoyed special privileges by manipulating the concessions, administrators strove to crack down on the loss of state rent.
Selim III also reorganised the provinces from an administrative standpoint. In 1795,he proposed new governance structures in an attempt to reverse the trend of the empire towards decentralisation. The government lacked military or financial resources to carry out the policy, however, and made centralization an “unattainable ideal”.
While the reformers called for revamping the Ottoman system and Europeanisation of the military, they were by no means antagonistic to Islam. In many cases, the call for reform saw Islamic renewal and military-administrative-economic renewal as intertwined and mutually dependent. Military discipline often entailed the memorisation of religious texts.
End
The reform coalition with which Selim came to power was not stable. Different members of the bureaucracy used the New Order discourse as a way to secure personal advancement, switching sides on the question of reform depending on personal interests. For example, few local notables were pleased with new tax arrangements for that New Order Army since they undermined old tax-farming rent sources. Money for the “New Revenue” system which was raised by reclaiming vacant tax farms for the state (Finkel 2005). The accumulation of capital had enabled local elites to challenge the centre, and they had no interest in giving up their power willingly. While some notables benefited from the reform, others, such as Tayyar Pasha, were excluded.
The Janissaries became increasingly aware of the threats posed by the New Order to their privileges. In 1806, during the famous Edirne incident, local janissaries and notables joined to lynch a qadi who had come to recite an imperial decree announcing the deployment of New Order troops to the region. Janissaries also exploited general resentment over Westernisation and higher taxes to fund the New Order to gain popular support for the rebellion that would bring an end to the New Order in 1807.

SPOT or BeingSpot is an American rapper from Brooklyn that became know in Atlanta, Georgia for their album The Good Son.
Background
The eldest son of Jamaican and Guyanese parents, SPOT initially lived in many different parts of the United States. As a child Hargett and their family relocated to Coney Island, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Their childhood was spent between Brooklyn, Harlem, New York and Atlanta, GA. A talented yet troublesome child, Spot traveled the country playing basketball with top AAU clubs during their preteen years. Spot has described growing up in the projects as "vicious."
Career
Spot first came into the public view in 2004, when they teamed with Jimmy Henchman and Bryce Wilson to kick-start newly formed music company Czar Entertainment. With Czar signing a distribution deal with Sony Music Group, Spot seemed primed to release an album, although they had just begun rapping and producing. A fast learner in the studio, Spot began working with major label artist of various genres, including Mario Winans, Miri Bin-Ari, Foxy Brown, Swizz Beatz, Black Rob, and El Debarge, and working on a posthumous Notorious B.I.G. album.
They then released the mixtape The Good Son. Alongside former DJ and Def Jam Records exec Sickamore, The Good Son featured collaborations with Jim Jones, Papoose and production from Just Blaze, the SupaSonics and SPOT himself. Moving over 25,000 copies, this mixtape established Spot as one of top newcomers on the indie circuit.
After touring the country with the likes of Akon and David Banner and performing at various infamous NY prisons including Rikers Island and Arthur Kills Maximum Penitentiary, Spot made history becoming the first rapper to promote a mixtape on MTV when they appeared on Sucka Free (formerly Direct Effects) to promote their second foray into the mixtape game, A Dollar & A Dream.
Packaged as a street album, A Dollar & A Dream was a success worldwide, even garnering the best album ratings of the year by one French publication. Spot has produced the score for a platinum DVD series (The Infamous Times) and a syndicated television show (Hip Hop Hold 'Em) and contributed music to both MTV, BET and VH1 (various programming).
SPOT is managed by Grand Hustle/Rubicon Brand Management (Grand Hustle Records) and released a Gangsta Grillz mixtape with DJ Drama titled The Price Iz Right. Spot was named one of AOL Music's 10 Rising Rappers.

John Centennial Devine was an Arizona politician who served two consecutive terms in the Arizona State Senate from 1917 through 1920. An Arizona pioneer, with an mining engineer background, they worked at several mines in Pinal County as either the supervisor or general manager. They worked as an undersheriff both early and late in their career, once killing a man who resisted arrest.
Biography
John C. Devine was born on February 29, 1876, in Florence, Arizona. They attended Florence schools, and then went to St. Mary's College in Oakland, California from 1892 to 1894, where they studied mining and civil engineering. They were a charter member of the Arizona Pioneer Society. Devine was a mining engineer. They were the supervisor of the Troy Arizona Copper Company from 1901 to 1906.
Devine married Grace E. Adcock of Marysville, Missouri in 1905 in Los Angeles. The couple had five children: four sons, Milford, John, Eugene, and Charles; and one daughter, Virginia. They had another child, who died in infancy in November 1912. In the early 1900s they were a deputy sheriff in Florence, and in 1901 they fatally shot a man, Robert Hatfield, who was resisting arrest for spousal abuse. Hatfield was part of the notorious Hatfield clan. In 1906 they became the superintendent of the Ray Consolidated Copper Company.
They resigned from Ray Consolidated in 1916, in order to take over as president of the Pinal Development Company. In August 1916 Devine challenged the incumbent Democrat, Charles E. MacMillin, in the primary for state senator from Pinal County, who they soundly defeated 719 to 427. They defeated the Republican candidate, Frank H. Swenson, in the November general election.
At some point, they became general manager of the White Metal Company, which they managed until 1926. They were a Mason, and attained the 32nd Degree. They ran for, and won, re-election in 1918. Devine moved to Tucson in 1922, in order for their children to attend school. They served as jailer under Sheriff John F. Belton, being appointed in 1933. They remained in the post until they unexpectedly resigned in August 1936. In 1936 they were appointed undersheriff by Sheriff Ed F. Echols, which took effect in January 1937 Devine died on March 21, 1940. They had been ill for approximately one year, although they continued to work in their county undersheriff duties right up until their death.

Nottingham Carrington Street railway station was the first railway station in Nottingham, opened in 1839 by the Midland Counties Railway. Initially there were two lines with a central platform as well as side ones according to Billson. Victorian civil engineer Francis Whishaw described the station as:
"The elevation next to the road to Nottingham is of plain but neat design. It consists of a central portion and two wings; the central portion contains the entrance hall, which is of the whole height of the building. In the right wing is the booking office for first and second class passengers, with windows (looking to the hall) at which the passengers receive their tickets; the third class passengers obtain their tickets at a counter fixed in the hall. In the left-wing is the boardroom and clerks offices; and in a building projecting towards the passenger shed in the rear is a waiting room for ladies.The [train] shed is covered with a light iron roof in two spans, which is supported on the departure side by a brick wall, in which there are eight windows; and on the arrival side, and along the middle line, by two rows of cast iron columns, nine in each row."
However, Whishaw in 1840 writes the station had grown to four lines. As was usual in those days there were "as many turntables without the shed; the cross line intersecting which communicates with the carriage wharf or landing, which is on the arrival side". This arrangement would probably be similar to that at Derby, allowing coaches to be manhandled between tracks to form trains.
On the north side the station was next to the canal and a small warehouse allowed for transshipment of cargoes between the canal and railway. The original gateposts to the yard and the bridge under the towpath still survive.
The first member of the British Royal Family to travel by train was Dowager Queen Adelaide who took a train provided by the Midland Counties Railway from Nottingham to Derby, where another train provided by the North Midland Railway transported Them Majesty to Leeds on 22 July 1840.
In view of plans by the Midland Railway, as it had become, to extend the line to Lincoln two extra lines with platforms were added on the south side of the station crossing Carrington Street on the level.
However, by the time the Lincoln line opened in 1846, it was clear that the station could not cope. Not only was there additional traffic from the Erewash Valley Line, and a line from Mansfield was planned, the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway had been approved with running rights over the Midland metals into the station.
Accordingly, a new station was built beyond Carrington Street on the West Croft fronting a newly built Station Street. This station Nottingham Midland opened in 1848.
The site of the station is now occupied by Nottingham Magistrates' Court.

The 1988 Lucas Supersprint was the eleventh and final round of the 1988 World Sports-Prototype Championship. It took place at Sandown Raceway, Victoria, Australia on 20 November 1988.
Due to being a short sprint and thus having a smaller points scale for the championship, several teams, most notably the Porsches of Brun Motorsport, Joest Racing, Kremer Racing, and Richard Lloyd Racing, opted not to attend this event.
Unlike the previous World Endurance Championship race held at Sandown in 1984 which included an invitation class for cars that competed in the Australian GT and Sports Car championships, the Lucas Supersprint was open to WSPC cars only. The only local entry was the Bernie van Elsen entered Veskanda Chevrolet driven by touring car stars John Bowe and Dick Johnson (Bowe was the car's driver when it dominated the 1986 Australian Sports Car Championship). The car was able to race as although it had been built to conform to Australia's Group A Sports Car rules, it also met the FIA's Group C rules as well as conforming to IMSA regulations.

En Avant Guingamp (, ), commonly referred to as EA Guingamp, EAG, or simply Guingamp (), is a professional football club based in the commune of Guingamp in France's Brittany region. The club was founded in 1912 and play in Ligue 2, the second tier of French football. The club has appeared in the Ligue 1, the top flight of French football, for 13 seasons, and is known for its relative success given Guingamp's small population of only 7,000 people.
Guingamp are one of only two clubs who have won the Coupe de France while not being in the first division, doing so in 2009, by defeating Rennes, 2–1. They won the same competition in 2014, again with a victory against Rennes, 2–0.
History
Having been an amateur club for a long time, playing in the regional leagues, the club got promoted three times under the presidency of Noël Le Graët, who took over in 1972. In 1976, Guingamp reached the Third Division (now called Championnat National), and the next season they were promoted to the Second Division (now called Ligue 2), where they stayed until 1993. The club became fully professional in 1984, and in 1990 the Stade de Roudourou was opened, with Guingamp hosting Paris Saint-Germain in the inaugural match.
The club's first major honour was winning the Coupe de France in 2009, the second team in history not from Ligue 1 to win the competition. The team defeated Breton rivals Rennes 2–1 in the final. Also, in 2014, En Avant de Guingamp beat Stade Rennais F.C. 2–0 at the Stade de France. Aside from two years of Coupe de France triumph, the club's only other major feat was winning the 1996 UEFA Intertoto Cup.
The club has played in the French top flight before, having gained promotion only three times: 1995, 2000 and 2013. Their longest stay in the top flight was between 2013 and 2019. Following the 2012–13 season, the club was relegated back to Ligue 2 at the conclusion of the 2018–19 season finishing in 20th place.
Aside from winning the Coupe de France, Guingamp is known for having served as a springboard for prominent players that include Didier Drogba, Florent Malouda, Fabrice Abriel, and Vincent Candela. Managers such as Guy Lacombe, Francis Smerecki, and Erick Mombaerts also used the club as springboards during the infancy of their coaching careers. Guingamp is presided over by Bertrand Desplat. The former president, Noël Le Graët, is president of the French Football Federation. The club has a women's team who play in the Division 1 Féminine, and a reserve team in the CFA2.
In the 2018–19 season, Guingamp reached the Coupe de la ligue final against RC Strasbourg. Guingamp lost the final losing 4–1 on penalties after the match ended goalless during 120 minutes of play.
On 12 May 2019, Guingamp were relegated to Ligue 2 ending a six-year stay in the top division after drawing 1–1 with rivals Stade Rennais F.C.

USS Nelson (DD-623), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Rear Admiral Charles P. Nelson, who served during the Spanish–American War and World War I.
Nelson was laid down on 7 May 1942 at the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey and launched on 15 September 1942 sponsored by Mrs. Nelson Stewart, daughter of Rear Admiral Nelson. The ship was commissioned on 26 November 1942, Lieutenant Commander M. M. Riker in command.
Service history
After shakedown along the Atlantic coast, Nelson reported to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet on 21 January 1943. Through 29 May, they operated on convoy duty as flagship of Destroyer Squadron 17, making runs to Bermuda, Port of Spain, Trinidad, Dakar, French West Africa; Aruba, Netherlands West Indies; Casablanca; and Gibraltar.
Invasion of Sicily, 1943
Upon completion of a short training period at Norfolk, Virginia, Nelson got underway 7 June to take part in the invasion of Sicily. During the crossing they screened the cruiser , arriving at Algiers on 20 June. Serving as flagship for Commander Task Force 81 (TF 81) during the Sicily operation, Nelson was assigned duty with the central part of the Western Task Force. This group was to land assault troops on beachheads near Gela, Sicily, to expand the captured area, and to seize the nearby airfield at Ponte Olivo.
At 02:46 on 10 July the first assault waves hit the Gela beaches. Plunging in through the breakers, the shock troops encountered light opposition. But furious gunfire raked the follow-up waves. Caught in the blue-white glare of searchlights, landing craft were subjected to intense fire, and LCIs took direct hits.
At 03:00 Nelson commenced figure eight patrols to the east of the transports. Shortly after dawn Axis aircraft joined the fight, flying out of the Acate River valley on the eastern coast and attempting to bomb and strafe Allied ships, landing craft, and beaches. Nelson fired sporadically at the planes throughout the day. At 12:30 they received word that the destroyer had been sunk. Enemy aircraft continued the attack the next day, delivering a high level bombing attack on Nelsons area and obtaining a direct hit on the Liberty ship . By 23:02 the ships commenced laying a heavy smoke screen, and the Axis attacks were beaten off.
German dive bombers buzzed in on a surprise attack from the northeast at 17:33 on 12 July, dropping bombs and making strafing runs. Nelson splashed one plane at 17:42 and an hour later departed in convoy for Algiers, North Africa.
Returning to the battle area on 17 July, they took up antisubmarine patrol station around Gela and Scoglitti until 23 July, when they returned to Algiers. Later, on 30 July, they escorted troopships into Palermo Harbor on the north coast of Sicily. During this operation they were harassed by constant German air attacks. At 05:48 on 1 August they opened fire on a single plane, splashing it with the third salvo.
Nelson returned to New York on 22 August, where Lt. Comdr. Thomas D. McGrath relieved Lt. Comdr. Riker of command on 3 September. The ship was assigned to North Atlantic convoy runs for the winter. This duty took the destroyer to Belfast, Northern Ireland three times and to Greenock Bay, Scotland, and Gibraltar once each.
Invasion of Normandy, 1944
In May 1944 Nelson steamed to England to stage for the coming Normandy invasion. While moored alongside a tanker at Plymouth, England on 24 May, their port screw fouled a mooring buoy, causing extensive damage to the screw and shaft. Nelson was placed in drydock where the screw and shaft, deemed beyond repair, were removed. But the need for fighting ships was so great that Nelson got underway on 2 June with only a starboard screw. At Milford Haven they rendezvoused with a convoy, and by 8 June was in the Normandy assault area.
The next day they steamed into position No. 13 on the "Dixie Line" as part of the anti-submarine and E-boat screen around the Omaha beachhead. E-boats were the German version of PT boats – speedy, agile, hard-hitting, and hard to hit. Armed with 40 mm guns and torpedoes, they specialized in night attacks. On the night of 8/9 June several destroyers on the "Dixie Line" had taken under fire and chased several of these E-boats, sinking two.
Nelson was anchored in position 13 the night of 12 June. Thus far their only contact with the enemy had been in the form of a glide bomb which had exploded harmlessly off the starboard quarter during their first night in the area. At 01:05 on 13 June they made a radar contact, challenged the contact by flashing light, and opened fire. The target slowed, turned away, and split into three distinct blips. The destroyer had loosed ten salvos when a torpedo struck them just aft the No. 4 gun mount blowing off the stern and No. 4 mount. stood by to transfer personnel, and Nelson was taken in tow. Twenty-four of their crew were killed or missing and nine wounded. After emergency repairs at Derry, Northern Ireland, where their #2 turret and torpedo tubes were removed as a weight saving/stability measure, the destroyer was towed to Boston where they received a new stern.
Extensive repairs completed 23 November 1944, Nelson returned to Atlantic patrol duty. During December they steamed to Plymouth, England, conducting anti-submarine patrol en route. They departed New York late in February 1945 on a convoy run to Oran, Algeria, returning 31 March.
Throughout April and May Nelson served as plane guard and screen for the escort carrier , and on 16 May Lt. Comdr. Clark W. Freeman, USNR, relieved Comdr. McGrath as skipper. The destroyer transited the Panama Canal on 1 August en route Pearl Harbor, and then to Tokyo Bay 3–14 September, following Japan's surrender. The last part of September they steamed to Okinawa, Korea, and Singapore, which they reached on 24 August. En route home, they arrived Colombo, Ceylon on 30 August. There, two days later, Lt. Comdr. Scott Lothrop relieved Lt. Comdr. Freeman as commanding officer; and on 3 November, Nelson sailed for New York, via Cape Town, South Africa, arriving 6 December. They got underway again on 29 January 1946 for Charleston, South Carolina. By directive dated January 1947, Nelson was placed out of commission, in reserve, U.S. Atlantic Reserve Fleet, and berthed at Charleston. They were struck from the Naval Register on 1 March 1968 and sold in July 1969.
Nelson earned two battle stars for World War II service.

Syd Barrett (1946–2006) was an English musician who recorded 37 songs during their short two-year solo career. One of the founding members of English rock band Pink Floyd, they were the dominant force in their early years, writing the majority of the material on their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, contributing to their second, A Saucerful of Secrets, and recording several unreleased songs with them. As a result of Barrett's increasing mental illness, guitarist David Gilmour was hired as their possible replacement. When their condition worsened, they were officially excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968. After their departure, Barrett recorded two solo albums, both released in 1970, until they left the music business in 1972.
Barrett returned to the studio in 1969 to begin work on their first solo album, The Madcap Laughs. Their only single, "Octopus", was released in November 1969. Work on The Madcap Laughs proved difficult, going through five different producers, including former Pink Floyd bandmates David Gilmour and Roger Waters, and Barrett himself. Released in January 1970, the album received positive reviews from critics and enjoyed moderate commercial success, reaching number 40 in the UK charts. Two months later, Barrett began recording their second and final solo album, Barrett. Produced by Pink Floyd members David Gilmour and Richard Wright, the sessions were recorded more sporadically than The Madcap Laughs. Barrett was released in November 1970, but failed to chart; no singles were issued from the album. Two years later, Barrett signed a document ending their association with Pink Floyd and any financial interest in future recordings and left the music business. The Madcap Laughs and Barrett were paired and released as Syd Barrett in 1974. Barrett made almost no public appearances for the remainder of their life, and after suffering from Type 2 diabetes for several years, died at their home in Cambridge, England, in 2006 at age 60.
Several compilation albums of Barrett's songs were released before and after their death. The first of these, The Peel Session, an EP containing recordings Barrett performed for the John Peel Top Gear show on 24 February 1970, contains the unreleased song "Two of a Kind". In 1988, Barrett approved the release of Opel, a compilation that contained several unreleased songs and alternate takes of recordings from sessions for their two solo albums. The 1993 box set Crazy Diamond included their solo albums, Opel, and more alternate takes. The compilation album Wouldn't You Miss Me? followed suit, and contained Barrett's highly sought-after "Bob Dylan Blues". The song, along with "Terrapin" from The Madcap Laughs and "Maisie" from Barrett, reflect Barrett's early interest in the blues. The next greatest hits album, An Introduction to Syd Barrett, contained the previously unreleased twenty minute instrumental "Rhamadan" as a CD bonus track. In 2016, Barrett's Pink Floyd-era songs "In the Beechwoods", "Vegetable Man", and "Scream Thy Last Scream" were officially released on the Pink Floyd compilation box set The Early Years 1965–1972; they were meant to be released earlier but were blocked by Pink Floyd.

Spring Air Company is a mattress company based in the United States. It was founded in Chicago in 1926 when Francis Karr patented a mattress design with free-end coils. Because of the heavy weight, high transportation costs, and low value per unit weight of mattresses, they are often manufactured locally. The company is thus a licensing organization, with local licensees manufacturing the mattresses under a common name for national marketing. Like a cooperative, the licensees own the Spring Air name. Spring Air has factories across the world.
, it is the fourth largest US brand of mattresses (behind Sealy, Serta, and Simmons). It is based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.
Merger with Consolidated Bedding
In 2007 The Spring Air Company merged with Consolidated Bedding, Inc. of Tampa, FL, Spring Air's largest licensee and simultaneously acquired six other Spring Air licensees operating eight mattress manufacturing facilities in the United States. The unified Company will employ 1,150 employees in 14 locations, including its headquarters facility that will remain in the Chicago area. The merger will solidify Spring Air's position as the leading value "S" brand on every retail floor. The acquired manufacturing facilities are in: Atlanta, GA; Birmingham, AL; Chelsea, MA (Boston); Denver, CO; Phoenix, AZ; St. Louis, MO; Salt Lake City, UT; and Lacey, WA (Seattle). They will join Consolidated Bedding's existing facilities in: Columbus, OH; Carrollton, TX (Dallas); City of Industry, CA (Los Angeles); New Brunswick, NJ; and Tampa, FL.
H.I.G. Capital LLC, a private equity investment firm with more than
$4 billion of equity capital under management, provided the equity funding for the
transaction. H.I.G. began a relationship with Spring Air in 2005 when it funded the merger
of American Bedding Industries and Spring Air Partners, the two largest Spring Air
licensees.
In May 2009 the company that owned the Spring Air name - Consolidated Bedding - went bankrupt.
The Spring Air Name was then purchased by E&E Bedding and turned into Spring Air International.
Spring Air International
In May 2009 Spring Air abruptly ceased operations and in June emerged under new ownership and management as SAI (Spring Air International). Spring Air was repurchased by one of its original owners Edward Bates. Today Spring Air has expanded its presence around the world adding over 15 new facilities globally.
The Spring Air brand is now manufactured at 13 U.S. facilities and 22 international licensees that operate in 32 countries.

The siege of Dara was raised by the Sasanian king Khosrow I in 573 during the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 572–591. The fortified city fell after 4 months.
The Sasanians cut through a hill to divert the city's water supply, and used captured Roman ballistae from the abandoned Roman Siege of Nisibis (573).
The news of the fall of Dara, long a major Byzantine stronghold in Upper Mesopotamia, drove Emperor Justin II insane. Bahram Chobin was commander of the cavalry force in the siege, and was promoted to the spahbed of the North after this victory.

Bochatay, a carpenter, was twenty-seven years of age at the time of the accident. They were married and had two children. Fernande Bochatay, Nicolas' aunt, won the bronze medal in the women's giant slalom during the 1968 Winter Olympics held in Grenoble, France.
Skiing
The 1991 Swiss Champion, Bochatay was among the best speed skiers. Speed skiing is a dramatic sport, with competitors flying down the slope at . At Les Arcs, during the Albertville Games in 1992, Bochatay placed 13th in the men's race with a speed of . Speed skiing was a demonstration sport at the 1992 Games, thus Bochatay's death was not considered as part of the official competition.
Accident and death
Around 9:30 am on February 22, the next-to-last day of competition at the 1992 Winter Olympics, Bochatay was warming up with teammate Pierre Yves-Jorand and United States team members Jeff Hamilton, Jimbo Morgan, and Dale Womack, when they crashed into a Snowcat used to groom snow on a public slope. The group was skiing and catching air on a bump in the slope. The group had made other runs on the trail. Nicholas was airborne before landing immediately in front of the groomer.
It was reported that they died of internal injuries immediately after impact.
According to organizers, the machine had flashing lights and a siren while it was sitting behind a small hill. The Swiss team said the machine had been immobile behind the hill and had no sirens or flashing lights. Jean-Albert Corrand, director general of COJO, was the one to say the snow groomer was using a siren and flashing lights and was moving uphill towards the skiers as they were coming down. Witnesses say also that the machine did have a siren and flashing lights. It was also said that Bochatay was wearing slalom skis and not speed-skis when they crashed. The accident occurred on the next-to-last day of the 1992 Winter Olympics, on the morning of the speed-skiing final. Bochatay was the third athlete to die at a Winter Olympics, after British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski and Australian skier Ross Milne who both died at Innsbruck 1964.

Production
They All Kissed the Bride was originally slated to star Carole Lombard in a follow-up film to the successful To Be or Not to Be. However, they died in a 1942 plane crash after departing Las Vegas on their way back from a bond-selling tour. Louis B. Mayer at MGM agreed to let Crawford place on loan to Columbia, where producer Edward Kaufman had to rework the script to fit Crawford's style of comedy. In fact, Mayer rarely lent out stars of Crawford's stature, not wanting other studios to profit from MGM's star-making machine. Crawford insisted that Melvyn Douglas (with whom they had appeared in 1938's The Shining Hour and 1941's A Woman's Face) star opposite them

Brian Thomas Helgeland (born January 17, 1961) is an American screenwriter, film producer and director.  They are most known for writing the screenplays for the films L.A. Confidential and Mystic River. They also wrote and directed the films 42, a biopic of Jackie Robinson, and Legend, about the rise and fall of the infamous London gangsters the Kray twins. Their work on L.A. Confidential earned them the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.
Early life
Helgeland was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Norwegian-born parents Aud-Karin and Thomas Helgeland, and was raised in nearby New Bedford, Massachusetts. They majored in English at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth before following their father's work fishing scallop.
One cold winter day in 1985 made Helgeland consider another job, after finding a book about film schools.
Helgeland eventually settled on a career in film, considering their love for movies. They applied for the film school at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, as it was the only one which could accept them in the middle of the semester.
Career
Helgeland's agent arranged them a meeting with Rhet Topham, who had an idea for a horror comedy film but was having difficulty writing it. The resulting film was 976-EVIL, which the duo managed to sell for $12,000. 976-EVIL marked the directorial debut of Freddy Krueger portrayer Robert Englund, who went on to recommend Helgeland as New Line Cinema wanted to do a new A Nightmare on Elm Street film. Helgeland was paid $70,000 to do what would become A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. Both films were released in 1988, with The Dream Master hitting theaters earlier. Another script, Highway to Hell, earned Helgeland $275,000 and got a film release in 1992. In 1990, Helgeland and Manny Coto sold a script, The Ticking Man, for $1 million, but the film was never made.
In 1998, Helgeland won both an Academy Award (for Best Adapted Screenplay with L.A. Confidential) and a Razzie (for The Postman) the same year. Only one person had previously achieved the dubious feat (Alan Menken in 1993), and only one other (Sandra Bullock in 2010) has achieved it since. They accepted the Razzie and became only the fourth person in its history to be personally presented with the statuette. They keep the statues of both the Oscar and the Razzie on their mantle as "a reminder of Hollywood's idealistic nature and unrealistic expectations."
Helgeland wrote and directed the films A Knight's Tale (2001), The Order (2003) and 42 (2013). They have worked with director Clint Eastwood twice, in 2002 on Blood Work, and in 2003 on Mystic River, for which they were nominated for an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, and has written an as yet unproduced adaptation of Moby-Dick.
In 2004, Helgeland co-wrote the screenplay for the major motion picture The Bourne Supremacy, for which they were uncredited. In early 2008, they were attached to shape the script of the thriller Green Zone after screenwriter Tom Stoppard had to drop out, again collaborating with director Paul Greengrass, whom they worked with on The Bourne Supremacy, as well as reuniting with actor Matt Damon, who played Jason Bourne/David Webb. Helgeland wrote the screenplay for the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123, replacing screenwriter David Koepp. The film was released on June 12, 2009.
On May 4, 2017, HBO announced that Helgeland is one of four writers working on a potential pilot for a Game of Thrones spin-off. In addition to Helgeland, Carly Wray, Max Borenstein, and Jane Goldman are also working on potential pilots. Helgeland has been working and communicating with George R. R. Martin, the author of A Song of Ice and Fire, the series of novels upon which the original series is based. Former Game of Thrones showrunners D. B. Weiss and David Benioff would also be executive producers for whichever project is picked up by HBO.

A white Russian () is a cocktail made with vodka, coffee liqueur (e.g., Kahlúa or Tia Maria) and cream served with ice in an old fashioned glass.
History
The traditional cocktail known as a black Russian, which first appeared in 1949, becomes a white Russian with the addition of cream. Neither drink has any known Russian origin, but both are so-named due to vodka being the primary ingredient. It is unclear which drink preceded the other.
The Oxford English Dictionary refers to the first mention of white Russian in the sense of a cocktail as appearing in California's Oakland Tribune on November 21, 1965. It was placed in the newspaper as an insert: "White Russian. 1 oz. each Southern, vodka, cream", with "Southern" referring to Coffee Southern, a short-lived brand of coffee liqueur by Southern Comfort.
The white Russian saw a surge in popularity after the 1998 release of the film The Big Lebowski. Throughout the movie, it appears as the beverage of choice for the protagonist, Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski. On a number of occasions they refer to the drink as a "Caucasian".
Preparation
As with all cocktails, various modes of preparation exist, varying according to the recipes and styles of particular bars or mixologists. Most common varieties have adjusted amounts of vodka or coffee liqueur, or mixed brands of coffee liqueur. Shaking the cream in order to thicken it prior to pouring it over the drink is also common. Sometimes the drink is prepared on the stove with hot coffee for a warm treat on cold days. Conversely, vanilla ice cream has been known to be used, rather than cream, to make it frozen.
Variations
Many variants of the cocktail exist, both localized and widely known, such as a blind Russian (also known as a muddy water) which substitutes cream with Irish cream, a mudslide (a blind Russian with both), an Anna Kournikova (named after the tennis player), made with skimmed milk (i.e. a "skinny" white Russian), a Russian cherry orchard made with the addition of Grand Marnier (named for the play by Anton Chekhov), a white Cuban (made with rum instead of vodka), or a dirty Russian (made with chocolate milk instead of cream).
A Colorado bulldog is very similar to the white Russian, using all traditional ingredients, but adding a splash of cola.

Melvin Lattany (born August 10, 1959) is a former American track athlete. They were one of the world's dominating sprinters in the early 1980s.
Early years
Lattany attended Glynn Academy, where they were a standout sprinter in track. They also practiced football, where although they were primarily a wide receiver, they also played as a safety, cornerback, punt returner, kickoff returner and was the backup placekicker.
They accepted a track scholarship from the University of Georgia, where they established a new Men's World Junior Record over 100 metres on July 30, 1978.
Lattany qualified for the 1980 US Olympic team as a 100 metres sprinter and a member of the 4 × 400 metres relay team, but was unable to compete due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. They did however receive one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals awarded to those athletes affected by the boycott.
They won a gold medal in the 100 metres at the 1981 Summer Universiade, and in the 200 metres at the 1981 IAAF World Cup, with a 20.21 seconds finish. On May 5, 1984, Lattany became the fifth man (second at sea level) to break the 10-second barrier when they clocked 9.96 seconds in Athens, Georgia.
Professional career
Lattany retired from track in 1985 and signed as a free agent with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League on June 20, looking to become an NFL wide receiver as a 25-year-old rookie. At the time, they ran the 40-yard dash in 4.29 seconds. They were released on August 19.
In 1987, they were reinstated by the International Amateur Athletics Federation to run track again.
Accolades and Awards
In 2009, Lattany was honored as one of the 20 Athletes of the Century at the Drake Relays (he was never beaten in the 100 m, finals and preliminary races, in the four years they competed there, 1978 to 1981; in addition being named outstanding performer in 1981).
In 2013, Lattany was inducted into the Glynn County Sports Hall of Fame.
Rankings
Lattany was ranked among the best in the US and the world in both the 100 and 200 m sprint events from 1979 to 1984, according to the votes of the experts of Track and Field News.

The Wife of the Centaur is a 1924 American silent drama film directed by King Vidor, and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shortly after it formed from a merger of Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures, and Mayer Pictures in April 1924. Metro had acquired the movie rights to Cyril Hume's debut novel Wife of a Centaur (Doran, 1923) in November. A novelist imagines that they have been reincarnated as a creature from Greek mythology and becomes entangled in a love triangle.
Plot
As described in a review in a film magazine, author and poet Jeffrey Dwyer (Gilbert) has a conflicted nature, at times they have high ideals but they also feel strongly the appeal of the purely sensual.  They are strongly attracted to Joan Converse (Boardman), who drops their flapper nature when they fall in love with him, but they neglect them when they meet the flashing, dashing Inez Martin (Pringle), a worldly woman with strong sex appeal. Inez finally throws them over and marries Harry Todd (McCullough), but the marriage is a failure. Jeffrey, returning to their senses after a period of debauchery and wild jazz parties, marries Joan. They go to a lodge in the mountains and are happy until Inez, seeking to win him, takes a house nearby. For months they fight the infatuation, but one night writes a letter to Joan and goes to Inez. However, their better nature makes them realize themselves as they really are, and they return to Joan, who understands and forgives him.
Cast
Preservation
With no prints of The Wife of the Centaur (1924) located in any film archives, it is a lost film. A few seconds of Boardman from this film is included (from around 3:07 to 3:10) in Twenty Years After (1944), a promotional short made by MGM to celebrate its 20th anniversary.

Tadeusz Hogendorf (19 December 1918 – 12 June 2010) was a former Polish international footballer who played in midfield as well as being a forward.
Biography
Hogendorf was born in Rzeszów just after the conclusion of World War I when Poland became an independent state. Hogendorf started playing football with their local team Resovia Rzeszów, breaking into the first team in 1936. In 1937 Resovia were competing for promotion to the liga, needing to beat Rewere Stanisławów in the final game to be promoted. Due to the club having no manager to organise the players, Hogendorf and Stanisław Baran went missing a few days before the game spending time with a local counts daughters instead of focusing on the game. Resovia ended up drawing the game 3–3 and failed to win promotion. In 1938 Hogendorf joined Warszawianka who played in the liga. They managed 9 appearances for the top division side before the outbreak of World War II.
During the war Hogendorf continued to play in a team made of Polish players. The teams would be transported around Poland and play teams composed of Nazi airmen or soldiers. Hogendorf claimed that the Germans wanted the Polish players to play for teams in Germany, but all the Polish players refused the offer.
After the war Hogendorf had brief spells with Pogoń Katowice and Baltia Gdańsk (who later became Lechia Gdańsk). While with Baltia Hogendorf was involved in the clubs first ever competitive game, and scored 7 goals in 7 appearances during their time at the club. Due to their successful spell with Lechia Hogendorf talked about the lengths ŁKS Łódź went to sign the best players of Lechia, stating that as the clubs officials were getting nervous the players wouldn't sign they took the players to a night club getting them drunk and taking them to Łódź. When the players woke up the next morning in Łódź they decided to sign for the club. At ŁKS Łódź Hogendorf had the longest spell of their career spending seven years with the club and making over 100 appearances. Although their the stats from their first two seasons are unknown, it is known that they scored 23 goals in 96 appearances for ŁKS in the liga. Due to their performances for the club they are classed as an ŁKS Łódź legend. During their time with ŁKS Łódź they also caught the attention of the Poland national team management and was called up to play for their country. In total Hogendorf made 6 appearances for Poland and scored two goals, making their debut and scoring their debut goal in a match against Czechoslovakia. After their time with ŁKS they joined Gwardia Łódź before finishing their playing career back in their home town with Stal Rzeszów.
After their playing career Hogendorf focused on becoming a manager and coach. They previously held coaching roles with Włókniarz Łódź and Gwardia Łódź during their playing career and was the player manager of Stal Rzeszów in 1955. In 1958 Hogendorf graduated from the University of Physical Education in Warsaw and started managing Resovia Rzeszów in 1960. Hogendorf managed Stal Łańcut at some point during the 1961–62 season. They also managed Lechia Sędziszów Małopolski, their last job as a manager in football.
After leaving football Hogendorf went on to be physical education teacher in Rzeszów. In 1999 they were awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 2001. In 2008 they became an Honorary Citizen of the City of Rzeszów. On 12 June 2010, aged 91, Hogendorf died in Rzeszów.

JAMS, formerly known as Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. is a United States–based for-profit organization of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services, including mediation and arbitration. H. Warren Knight, a former California Superior Court judge, founded JAMS in 1979 in Santa Ana, California. A 1994 merger with Endispute of Washington, D.C. made JAMS into the largest private arbitration and mediation service in the country. It is one of the major arbitration administration organizations in the United States. As of 2017, JAMS has 27 resolution centers, including its headquarters in Irvine, California and centers in Toronto and London. JAMS specializes in mediating and arbitrating complex, multi-party, business/commercial cases.
JAMS administers a few hundred consumer arbitration cases per year. JAMS's Consumer Minimum Standards have been the subject of scholarly commentary. A policy promulgated by JAMS in 2004 that would have allowed for class arbitrations, even if the arbitration agreement did not allow them, and the subsequent retraction of that policy, were also the subject of controversy.
JAMS Foundation
JAMS established the JAMS Foundation to offer financial assistance for conflict resolution initiatives with national or international impact and to share its dispute resolution experience and expertise for the benefit of the public interest. Funded entirely by contributions from JAMS neutrals and staff, the JAMS Foundation has provided nearly $5 million in grants for conflict resolution initiatives. The JAMS Foundation also established the Weinstein International Fellowship Program to provide opportunities for individuals from outside the United States to visit the U.S. and learn more about dispute resolution processes and practices and to pursue a project of their own to advance dispute resolution in their home countries. The Foundation, through the Warren Knight Award, has awarded $25,000 grants to programs dedicated to resolving conflict both in the US and around the world.

Sarah Lohman is an American historian, specializing in the history of food.  They are the author of Eight Flavors: The Untold Story of American Cuisine.
Biography
As a teenager, growing up in Hinckley, Ohio, Lohman worked, in costume, as a historic re-enactor. Them duties there included showing visitors how Americans used to prepare food. In 2005, they earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Cleveland Institute of Art.
They traveled to New York City in 2006. They worked for Grub Street, upon their arrival, and worked at the Tenement Museum from 2009.
In 2016, they told The New York Times that they "searches old cookbooks and other records to recreate forgotten recipes as a way of studying history". They then prepares food, according to those recipes. They called eating those foods "an elaborate form of performance art".
Them book, published in 2016, has eight chapters, which each trace a signature taste crucial to the development of modern American cooking: black pepper, vanilla, curry powder, chili powder, soy sauce, garlic, MSG, and Sriracha. Several reviewers praised Lohman's deep research, and told readers their writing was informed by wide travel to conduct that research.
Lohman was one of the food historians used as an expert in a PBS documentary series entitled "The Poison Squad", first broadcast in 2020.
Lohman is working on a second book, documenting cookery at risk of disappearing, entitled Endangered Eating: Exploring America's Vanishing Cuisine, scheduled for publication in 2021.

This album, as per the title, dives deep into the topic of freedom and our search for it both inwards and out."
In an interview with Atwood, Alberts said "I hope this album helps encourage people to continue stepping out of fear and into love. I hope it encourages them to continue on their path of freedom. There is so much I've learnt from this process but frankly it has been such a whirlwind I haven't reflected upon it yet. I plan to soon."

John Lamplugh Kirk M.R.C.S (30 April 186926 February 1940) was a British medical doctor, amateur archaeologist and founder of York Castle Museum in York, North Yorkshire.
Personal life
They were born in Hull in 1869 and practised as a doctor in London before moving to Pickering in 1898. Kirk resided in Houndgate Hall, Pickering from 1910 to 1938. Kirk spent some time painting natural and landscape scenes, such as their 1891 'Stags in the Snow'.
Kirk was intimately involved in Yorkshire Archaeological Society and was a member of the general committee, executive committee and acted as director and honorary treasurer.
Professional life
Archaeologist
In February 1911 Kirk collaborated with Oxley Grabham (Keeper of the Yorkshire Museum) in the excavation of a Bronze Age Tumulus near Pickering and of an Iron Age chariot burial at Pexton Moor. Kirk excavated the fort of Virosidum at Bainbridge, North Yorkshire in 1925-26 with R. G. Collingwood. They excavated part of the Roman camp at Malton in 1927 with Philip Corder. The results of this excavation formed the core of the Roman archaeology collection of the Malton Museum. Kirk undertook excavations on the late Iron Age settlement at Costa Beck near Pickering between 1925 and 1929 - these excavations were published by Mary Kitson Clark in 1931. Kirk and Corder also excavated at the side of Langton Roman Villa, near Malton, the excavations of which were led by Kirk. Regarding Kirk's role in the Langton excavations, Corder wrote: "The daily supervision and all the organisation of the work once again fell to Dr. Kirk, who directed the excavation in person, until ill health led to their forced retirement. Even then they largely directed the final stages of the work from their bed".
Published works as an archaeologist include:
Kirk, J. L. 1912. "The Opening of a Tumulus near Pickering", Annual Report of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society for 1911, 57-62.
Corder, P. and Kirk, J.L. 1932. A Roman Villa at Langton, near Malton, East Yorkshire (Roman Malton and District Reports no.4) Leeds: Yorkshire Archaeological Society
Corder, P. and Kirk. J. 1928. "Roman Malton: a Yorkshire Fortress and its neighbourhood" in Antiquity Vol. 2. pp. 69–72
Curator
Kirk had amassed a collection of objects relating to the study of Social History. Their enthusiasm for folk museums was encouraged through visiting the Stockholm Historical Museum, Biological Museum, and Skansen (an open-air museum) in Sweden in 1910. In addition to collecting and photographing social history, they would accept 'bygones' in lieu of payment from their medical patients.
Initial plans to house the collection in Pickering in the 1920s ultimately failed. In 1931 Kirk advertised more widely for expressions of interest from sites who wished to house their collection, receiving responses from sites in Middlesbrough, Wakefield, Batley, Doncaster and York, with the latter eventually being successful. The Female Prison (now part of York Castle Museum) was bought by the York Corporation in 1934 and modified to house the Kirk Collection of "bygones", opening as the Castle Museum in 1938. A major attraction of this new museum was the recreation of a late Victorian street, named 'Kirkgate'; this was the first of its kind in Britain.
Kirk and their deputy curator, Violet Rodgers were both recreated by re-enactors on Kirkgate, the reconstructed Victorian street, as part of the Castle Museum's 80th anniversary in 2018.
Awards and fellowships
Kirk was a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. In 1938 they were elected an honorary member of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society.

Temple Hirst is a village and civil parish in the Selby District of North Yorkshire, England. It was formerly in the wapentake of Barkston Ash in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The village is located on the north bank of the River Aire. In the 2011 census the population was 117.
Naming
'Temple' marks a former estate of the Knights Templar, and is found in other parts of the country, such as Cressing Temple, Essex, Temple Balsall, Warwickshire, Temple Bruer, Lincolnshire, Templecombe, Somerset, Temple Cowley, Oxfordshire, Temple Dinsley, Hertfordshire, Temple Ewell, Kent, Temple Guiting, Gloucestershire, and Temple Newsam, Yorkshire.
'Hirst' is from the Old English for copse or wooded hill, suggesting a patch of slightly higher ground in this low-lying landscape.
History
Temple Hirst was held by the Knights Templar from around 1152, who established Temple Hirst Preceptory.
In 1871, North Eastern Railway established a railway station at Temple Hirst as part of the East Coast Main Line. It closed to passengers in 1961.
In 2001, the population of the parish was 133, which had fallen at the 2011 Census to 117. In 2015, North Yorkshire County Council estimated that the population was 120.
Notable buildings
Temple Manor is a 17th-century house which includes a late 15th- or early 16th-century tower from the house of the Darcy family, and a stone doorway from Temple Hirst Preceptory. It was extensively renovated and altered around 1980 to become a public house. It is now Temple Manor Care Home.
St John's Chapel is a former Wesleyan Methodist Chapel which was built in 1842. Since 1976 the chapel has been used by the Church of England.
The Sloop Inn is a public house. The name reflects the type of boat – the sloop – which used to travel along the river.

Milton (historically Milton of Colquhoun) is a village in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. It lies about east of Dumbarton, on the A82 Glasgow-Loch Lomond road and below the Overtoun Bridge.
It previously had a primary school, closed in 2004. The first school was in what is now quite an old building on the road to Overtoun. The second school building was on the main road, it was still open in the early 2000s.
Milton also has an SSPCA animal rescue centre. It also includes Dumbuck Quarry, which has removed a large part of Dumbuck Hill.
The North Clyde Line railway runs past the village, but it has never had a station – the closest are about away, at to the west and to the east.
Its main claim to fame is that it was the home of Jackie Stewart, the racing driver. Their family ran the Dumbuck Garage in the village.
Another native is Ian Napier, the fighter ace.
Milton House is an 18th-century mansion located on Milton Brae to the north of the village. It is a Category B listed building.

Dzintars Sproģis (born 13 May 1971) is a former Latvian football defender. Sproģis was recognized as the best defender in the first season of Virslīga.
Playing biography
Dzintars Sproģis came from a sporting family - their father Aivars played for Darba reserves and Dzintars' older brother Haralds Sproģis was also a footballer with whom Dzintars played together in several clubs.
The first club that Dzintars played with was Zvejnieks Liepāja in 1988 (at the age of just 17) from which they moved to RAF Jelgava in 1989. In 1989, they also made a debut with Daugava Rīga. With RAF they played in lower Soviet leagues. In the first Virslīga season Dzintars joined former Daugava head coach Jānis Skredelis with Kompar-Daugava but in 1993 they went to play abroad - with KTH Diest in Belgium. In 1994 Sproģis returned to Latvia where with FC DAG Rīga they won the bronze medals of Virslīga and reached the Latvian Cup final.
In 1995 and 1996 Sproģis played in Russia - first with Kolos Krasnodar, then with Tekstilshchik Kamyshin. When Tekstilshchik was relegated from the top division Sproģis returned to Liepāja where their career had started and joined Baltika Liepāja. In 1998 Sproģis was already in another club - they had joined Daugava/LU which performed rather poorly and in 1999 Sproģis changed the club again - they joined the newly formed FK Rīga (which was formed on the basis of Daugava/LU) with which they won the Latvian Cup in 1999. Their last club was FC Kaisar in Kazakhstan. In 2002 Dzintars Sproģis finished their playing career.
Sproģis also played 23 international matches for Latvia national football team from 1992 to 1998. Their international debut came in Latvia's first match after it regained independence - a loss of 0:2 against Romania in a friendly match. Their last match for Latvia was also a friendly game 2:0 win against Andorra in Pärnu, Estonia.

Ningchengopterus is a genus of pterodactyloid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous period (Aptian stage). Its fossil remains were found in the Yixian Formation of what is now China.
It is known from a juvenile specimen, holotype CYGB-0035, an almost complete articulated skeleton of a hatchling also showing soft parts, such as the flight membrane and pycnofibres, compressed on a plate and counterplate. It was the first small toothed pterodactyloid pterosaur specimen found in China. The type species Ningchengopterus liuae was named and described by Lü Junchang in 2009. The genus name combines a reference to the Ningcheng district in Inner Mongolia with a Latinised Greek pteron, "wing". The specific name honours Ms Liu Jingyi who collected the fossil and donated it to science.
Ningchengopterus was typified by the possession of about fifty teeth, twelve in each upper jaw and thirteen in each lower jaw. The teeth are curved, conical and pointed. The skull has a length of thirty-eight millimetres. The snout is elongated and tapering. The lower jaws show an incipient crest.
The specimen could not be more precisely determined than Pterodactyloidea. It shared the relative proportions of the first and second phalanx of the flight finger with the Ctenochasmatidae, and especially Eosipterus found in the same formation, but showed no further synapomorphies of that group, so that Lü abstained from placing it in that clade.
The teeth suggested that Ningchengopterus was a fish eater. The fully formed flight membrane was seen as confirmation of a hypothesis by Mark Unwin that pterosaurs displayed little parental care, their "babies" being able to fly shortly after hatching.

Jonathan Del Mar (born 7 January 1951) is a British music editor and conductor.
Biography
Jonathan Del Mar was born in London in 1951; their father was conductor Norman Del Mar. They studied at Christ Church, Oxford and the Royal College of Music in London.
Beethoven scholar
 They are most noted for their intense research of Beethoven's works, particularly the new edition of Beethoven's nine symphonies for Bärenreiter. This edition has been used by conductors of the standing of Claudio Abbado, Bernard Haitink, Sir Simon Rattle, Philippe Herreweghe, Osmo Vänskä and David Zinman and orchestras such as the Hanover Band, Minnesota Orchestra, and the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique.
Their research on Beethoven's symphonies started in 1984. In December 1996 the score for the Ninth Symphony was published, attracting attention from the press. There were four recordings of the symphony prior to the publication of the new edition, with the conductors using the Breitkopf edition with the corrections as they were available to them; Roy Goodman was the first conductor using corrections by Del Mar, followed by Sir Charles Mackerras in 1991, Sir John Eliot Gardiner in 1992, and Claudio Abbado in 1996.
The publication of the new editions of Beethoven's symphonies was concluded in 2000 with the Seventh Symphony. Other works they studied that resulted in new scores being published were the cello sonatas (2004), string quartets up to Op. 95 (2006-8), the Violin Concerto, as well as the Dvorak Cello Concerto.  They are currently working on the 5 Beethoven Piano Concertos.
Conducting
They were a resident conductor of Cumbria Youth Orchestra from 1980 until 1996.

The men's Olympic beach volleyball tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing took place at the Beach Volleyball Ground at Chaoyang Park from August 9 to August 22.
Each of the 24 pairs in the tournament was placed in one of six groups of four teams apiece, and played a round-robin within that pool. The top two teams in each pool advanced to the Round of 16. The six third-place teams were ranked against each other, with ties being broken by the ratio of points won to lost. The best two advanced to the Round of 16, while the other four played two matches (#3 vs. #6 and #4 vs. #5) with the winners of those two matches advancing as well. The losers of those matches, along with the fourth-place teams in each group, were eliminated.
The 16 teams that advanced to the elimination rounds played a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match between the semifinal losers.
Qualification
The top eight finishes that a team had from January 1, 2007, to July 20, 2008, on the Swatch FIVB World Tour (2007 and 2008), SWATCH FIVB World Championships (2007) and on FIVB recognised Continental Championship Finals, counted towards Olympic qualification for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.
There were 24 teams competing at the Olympic Games, with a maximum of two teams per country.
Brazil had four teams in the top 10 of the FIVB Beach Volleyball Olympic Ranking, but only two teams from each country could participate in the Olympic Games. Also Germany, the USA, and the Netherlands had three teams each in the top 24.
Qualifiers

Floyd Greg Paxton (March 17, 1918 – December 10, 1975) was a manufacturer of ballbearings during World War II, and later inventor of the bread clip, a notched plastic tag used for sealing bags of bread worldwide.
Bread clip
Paxton conceived the notion of the bread clip when they were flying in 1952; this resulted later in them founding the company Kwik Lok, in Yakima, Washington.
Other pursuits
Paxton was best known in the state of Washington for their very conservative political views. During the 1960s they were on the national board of directors of the John Birch Society. They made four unsuccessful runs for Congress. They founded a conservative newspaper, The Yakima Eagle, which did not attract a subscriber base and soon folded. Paxton and their wife, Grace, had a running battle with the Internal Revenue Service over a family trust set up to avoid taxation, resulting in years of litigation and appeals with the IRS—with the Paxtons ultimately losing.
They died of a heart attack in December 1975 at the age of 57. They left a son, Jerre Paxton, who became a leading figure in the state's horse-racing community.

Birzebbuga Aquatic Sports Club is a waterpolo club from Birżebbuġa, Malta.
For sponsorship reasons, the club is known as Birżebbuġa Freeport.
History
The club was founded in 1955. Many of the first players of the club were British servicemen. Popularity of the club and the game increased year by year, but the club did not have enough funds, and times it was difficult to honour fixtures, either due to lack of players, or lack of a venue. Sometimes the club had to play its home fixtures away from home, in neighbouring Marsaxlokk.
The club's organigram was fluid in the beginning, and in order to acquire a waterpolo pitch, there need an organised set up which could take on legal responsibilities. Thus the waterpolo clan was absorbed by the Birżebbuġa St. Peter's F.C. in 1965 and played under the name of St. Peter's. This lasted until 1967.
The club once again encountered difficulties and was last seen in the national championships in 2002, this time due to structural works to deepen the seabed level in the centre of Pretty Bay for the enlargement of the Malta Freeport, which made the club's premises unusable, due to the seabed level rising around the pitch and blocking the seawater circulation tunnels in the pitch. Up until 2007, the club was still being claimed to have been left in dire state, both in terms of organisation and in terms of premises.
In 2007, the committee announced that a project would soon be launched. This was met by some contention, especially from the environmentalist Green Party Democratic Alternative (Malta).
In 2013, then Leader of the Opposition, Joseph Muscat promised a refurbished water polo pitch to the locals, as part of their electoral campaign for the Maltese general election, 2013. Eventually, funds were given by the Government of Malta for the refurbishment of the club's premises, with a plan to re-enter the team in the Maltese Waterpolo leagues. The Marine Section within the Marine, Storm Water and Valley Management Unit in the Ministry of Transport of Infrastructure, were assigned the project. In 2015, the works were described to be "on track". According to Infrastructure Minister Joe Mizzi, this was part of Birżebbuġa's regeneration plan. This was part of 3 projects costing €3 million in 3 years.
The new pitch was inaugurated in 2017 by Joseph Muscat, then Prime Minister of Malta, a project which cost around €2.5 million. The final phase of the project is the embellishment through art installations atop the premises.
In 2017, a sponsorship agreement with Malta Freeport was signed for two years.
Birzebbuga returned again in 2017, and were back with a bang by winning their first knockout match against Otters A.S.C.

The Distillers Company Limited was a leading Scottish drink and pharmaceutical company and, at one time, a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It was taken over by Guinness & Co. (now part of Diageo) in 1986 in a transaction which was later found to be involved in fraudulent activity, becoming known as the Guinness share-trading fraud.
History
The company's origins lie in a trade association known as the Scotch Distillers' Association formed by Menzies, Barnard & Craig, John Bald & Co., John Haig & Co., MacNab Bros, Robert Mowbray and Macfarlane & Co. in 1865.
It was incorporated in 1877 and combined with John Walker & Son and Buchanan-Dewar in 1925.
It was acquired by Guinness in 1986 and was renamed as United Distillers in 1987.
In 1998 United Distillers was merged with International Distillers & Vintners to create United Distillers & Vintners, forming the spirits division of Diageo plc. The company still exists today as Diageo Scotland Ltd.
Pharmaceuticals
From 1942, Distillers Biochemicals (DCBL) operated an Agency Factory of the British Ministry of Supply manufacturing penicillin in Speke. The plant was one of the first two factories in Europe to produce penicillin. Following World War II, DCBL purchased the facility for approximately four million dollars.
Distillers are also responsible for the manufacture of the drug Thalidomide in the United Kingdom. Thalidomide had been developed by Grunenthal with whom, in July 1957, DCBL signed a sixteen-year contract to market the drug. DCBL ordered 6,000 tablets for clinical trial and 500 grammes of pure substance for animal experiments and formulation. Thalidomide was marketed in the United Kingdom under the name Distaval, beginning on 14 April 1958. Advertisements emphasised the drug's complete safety, using phrases such as non-toxic and no known toxicity. Later, Thalidomide was marketed under the names Asmaval, Tensival, Valgis, and Valgraine and found to cause nerve damage and malformations in births.
The Speke site, also known as Speke Operations, was eventually sold to Eli Lilly and Company in 1963.
Chemicals and plastics
Since 1915, during the World War I, Distillers supplied industrial alcohol for making explosives. In 1922, it started to manufacture Discol-branded motor fuel made from alcohol. In 1928, it formed together with Turner and Newall the Carbon Dioxide Co Ltd to for sale of gas, a byproduct of their operations. In 1930, Distillers formed the British Industrial Solvents for production of acids and other solvents from industrial alcohol. In 1933, it formed Gyproc Products which was sold to British Plaster Board in 1944. In 1937, Distillers acquired British Resin Products. In 1939, it acquired a controlling stake in Commercial Solvents and 50% interest in BX Plastics, which full control was acquired in 1961. It followed by getting 48% shareholding in F. A. Hughes and Co. in 1941 and taking the full control in 1947. In 1947, F. A. Hughes and Co. was merged into British Resin.
In 1947, British Petroleum Chemicals was incorporated as a joint venture of AIOC and Distillers Company. In 1956, the company was renamed British Hydrocarbon Chemicals.
In 1945, Distillers formed a joint venture British Geon with B. F. Goodrich to produce polyvinyl chloride and in 1954 it started a partnership named Distrene with Dow Chemicals to produce polystyrene. In 1955, it took full control of Magnesium Elektron.
In 1967, BP acquired chemical and plastic assets of The Distillers Company which were merged with British Hydrocarbon Chemicals to form BP Chemicals.

Littleton/Route 495 is an MBTA Commuter Rail station in Littleton, Massachusetts. It serves the Fitchburg Line. The station is located at the intersection of Grimes Lane and Foster Street near Route 2 and I-495 and serves as a park-and-ride station for both highways.
A previous station was open at King Street in West Littleton until 1975. Littleton/Route 495 station opened several miles away in 1980 as an inexpensive park-and-ride to gather commuters from the northwest Boston suburbs. In 2011, work began on the construction of a new station, with a full-length handicapped accessible platform and a pedestrian bridge to the parking lot, as part of a larger project to improve the Fitchburg Line. After about 16 months of construction, the new station and pedestrian bridge opened in June 2013.
History
Littleton Depot
The Fitchburg Railroad was extended westward from Cambridge between 1843 and 1845, reaching Littleton around November 1844. Residents at Littleton Common did not like the appearance of the railroad, so it was routed through what was called West Littleton or Harwood Junction instead. A large two-story station was placed there at the intersection of King Street and Taylor Street. The long building included separate rooms for passengers and freight, and a living area for the station master. In 1879, the Fitchburg replaced it with a Victorian-style depot building a few feet to the east. The old station was moved south on Taylor Street and served as an apartment building for some time thereafter.
Residents were not allowed to ride trains on Sundays until 1850, and for some time thereafter only for the purpose of attending religious services. Despite minor accidents in 1845 and 1849, and a crash of the Tunnel Express on October 7, 1880, which killed two passengers, the railroad became important to daily life in Littleton. Freight including building materials, apples, and milk were shipped from several locations, including the depot. Much of the cattle transported on the line between 1885 and 1930 passed through the quarantine station in Littleton. The railroad also delivered the daily mail, its primary source of profit. The station became a center of local commerce and industry, with both housing and businesses erected around Depot Square.
Several plans were made between 1900 and 1906 to construct a street railway, but no construction took place. The B&M secured a bus franchise in the town in 1926.
Service continued to the Littleton station for over 120 years, run by the Fitchburg Railroad until 1900 and thereafter by the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M). Fifteen cars on a B&M freight derailed at Littleton on May 27, 1956, injuring one resident and blocking the main line for days. The B&M began to sharply cut back passenger service in the early 1960s, but in 1964 the newly formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) began to subsidize their northside commuter services. However, on January 18, 1965, funding cuts resulted in Fitchburg Line service being cut back to West Concord. After subsidy arrangements were made with several towns, service was partially extended back to Ayer – including the Littleton stop – on June 28, 1965.
The depot building was closed in 1970, leaving passengers to wait at the crossing. The building was occupied for a time by McElroy Manfucturing Corporation (a telegraph producer) then later that year by Learning Things (an educational product developer). In 1976, it was bought and restored to original condition by David Erikson, who operates Erikson's Antique Stoves from the building.
In December 1973, state subsidies for towns outside the MBTA funding district were halved, resulting in the MBTA needing to renegotiate subsidies from 14 municipalities. Littleton, with just 21 daily commuters, refused to pay its $12,300 bill in 1974; Ayer also failed to reach an agreement. On March 1, 1975, the line was cut back to South Acton, dropping the stops at Ayer, Littleton, and West Acton.
Littleton/Route 495
On December 27, 1976, the MBTA bought the B&M's northside commuter rail assets, including the entire length of the Fitchburg Line. The closure of the Lexington Branch the next month represented the limit of the contraction of the northside lines; as a result of the 1973–74 Arab Oil Embargo and especially the 1979 Iranian oil crisis, a period of rapid expansion began in the end of the 1970s. On January 13, 1980, service was extended back to Fitchburg and on to Gardner. However, the previous station location in West Littleton offered little to no parking space, and it was not reopened. A new station, Littleton/Route 495, opened some to the southeast, using spare parking lots from an adjacent industrial firm. It was located on Foster Street just off the interchange of Route 2 and I-495, and named after the latter. The station consisted of a -long low-level asphalt platform with a bus stop-style shelter. A small canopy shelter was added in 2003.
From 1981 until the 1990s, Littleton was the turnback point for a limited number of trains. Its unpaved parking lot was just 15 spaces (plus about 25 unofficial spaces) which was insufficient for demand. In 1995, local officials proposed building a new station with dedicated highway ramps off Route 2 to the southeast, as the Foster Street site was considered too rural for a garage or large lot. The Route 2 site was rejected because of nearby protected wetlands, but considered again later in the decade.
New station
As part of a $159 million upgrade project on the Fitchburg line, Littleton/Route 495 station was completely rebuilt in 2012–13. A second track was added from South Acton to Ayer through Littleton, which necessitated replacement of the low-level platform that occupied the track slot. Additionally, the 1980-built station was not accessible for handicapped riders and could not accommodate the full length of trains. The new station, which was built just outbound of the 1980-built platform, has an 800-foot-long high-level platform for speedy, fully handicapped accessible boarding. A pedestrian bridge with ramps connects the platform to the parking lot.
Bidding for the new construction opened on August 18, 2011, with the bidding period lasting until September 20. Construction work on the new platform started in early 2012; the platform was in place by mid-summer, and the main span of the pedestrian bridge was lifted into place in early November. The new station and bridge opened on June 3, 2013; a ceremony was held with public officials later that month. The 1980-built platform was demolished soon after the new station opened.
South Acton was previously the short turn terminus of some trains; however, those trains were extended to Littleton effective August 4, 2014. The completion of the new two-track station allows local such terminating trains to board on one track while another train passes on the other track; the design of the station with an island platform (instead of two side platforms) eliminates confusion as to which platform such terminating trains would serve.
Parking plans
Expanded service and parking at Littleton was expected to mitigate the existing parking lot overcrowding at South Acton. To replace the 44-space lot at Littleton that was removed for construction access, the MBTA bought a nearby private lot nearby in 2011, expanded it to 195 spaces, and added an off-street drop-off area. The additional parking proved so popular that in 2014, Littleton town officials considered the construction of a 200-space garage. A September 2014 parking study recommended adding parking on adjacent properties, implementing a shuttle service from residential areas, and adding bicycle storage areas and sidewalks to increase bicycle and pedestrian arrivals.
In late 2015, the MBTA added 24 parking spaces off Grimes Lane as an interim measure. In April 2017, the MBTA announced $1.5 million in funding to expand parking at the station, with between 43 and 109 additional spaces. , the MBTA planned for an increase of 60 spaces.
Other Littleton stations
Several other railroad stations, now closed, were located in or served Littleton.
North Littleton station was located on the 1858-opened Stony Brook Railroad at Great Road (Route 119). The station building was closed in 1914 and torn down in 1928. It was served by all three daily round trips in 1917, but only a single westbound trip stopped by 1929, and it was no longer served by the 1940s. While open, it had been a flag stop for local trains as well as the overnight State of Maine Express.
The Stony Brook also served two stops just outside Littleton. Willows (also called Sandy Pond) was located at the junction with the Fitchburg Railroad at Willow Road in Pingryville, Ayer. It was served only by Stony Brook trains by 1917 (and may have never served mainline trains), and closed by 1929. Forge Village was located at Pleasant Street (Route 225) in Forge Village in Westford. It remained in use until local passenger service ended in April 1953. The line remained open for freight use.
The Fitchburg Railroad also stopped at Boxboro station at Depot Road, just south of the Littleton town line. West Acton station was closer to Boxboro Center; Boxboro station saw limited service by the 1940s and was closed entirely before the MBTA era.
The Nashua, Acton and Boston Railroad, which ran from Concord to Nashua, ran through Westford with two stations near the eastern part of Littleton. Passenger service on the line ran from 1876 to 1924; it was abandoned entirely in 1925. East Littleton station was located at Littleton Road (MA 110), about a mile east of Littleton Common. It received frequent shipments of coal and grain for the Conant and Company store nearby. Pine Ridge station (also known as Westford) was located at Forge Village Road. The former station building has been converted to a private residence; the former freight house and section house are used as outbuildings.

Petar Bošković (Brčeli, 9 July 1931 – Belgrade, 14 January 2011) was a Yugoslav and Serbian diplomat. They were an ambassador of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the Republic of Cyprus.
Life and work
Distinguished brothers Bošković
Petar Boškovic was born on July 9, 1931, in the Montenegrin village of Brčeli situated near the coastal city and port of Bar. Their father Ivo worked in the United States.Petar remained with their mother and brothers in Yugoslavia. Petar's brother Djuro Bošković (1914–1945) was a lawyer, a revolutionary, a participant of the National Liberation struggle and a member of (OZNA) the security agency of Yugoslavia that existed between 1944 and 1952. Djuro became particularly prominent during the World War II battle of Sutjeska, when they reported to the military commanding staff that even though they lost two-thirds of the fighters, they can count on them as being in full force.
Petar's brother national hero Milo Bošković (1911–1944) was killed in 1944 in the Jasenovac concentration camp. Their sister Velika was a fighter in the Yugoslav Partisans movement engaged with the Fourth proletarian montenegrin task force brigade.
Diplomat
Later 1952, as a young man Petar joined their father Ivo in the United States. They graduated from the Faculty of Political Science at the Carlisle Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. They completed their master's degree in political sciences 1973, at the Belgrade Faculty of Political Science, University of Belgrade. From 1960 until 1965 they worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. In the period of 1965-1976 they were appointed as the first deputy director of the Fulbright Commission for scholarships for postgraduate studies in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The Fulbright treaty signed between the US and Yugoslavia at the end of 1964 for the exchange of Fulbright scholars and professors was the first such agreed with a Communist country. From 1976 to 1980 they served as First Counselor at the Embassy of Yugoslavia in London. After their return from London, they worked as the head of the department for Western Europe and USA within the Central Committee of the ruling League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) party.
They were engaged several times within the Central Committee of the ruling LCY party, although they were never a member of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. From 1982 until the end of 1984 they served as director and chief editor of the daily Montenegrin newspaper “Pobjeda”.
Then from 1985 to 1988 they served as foreign policy advisor to the Central Committee of the LCY.
Ambassador in Cyprus
In 1988 they were appointed as the ambassador of Yugoslavia to the Republic of Cyprus. They held this post until 1993. At the end of 1993 and in 1994 they held a series of lectures at the American universities Bradley, Dickinson, Lafayette, Lebanon Valley, Colgate, Penn State and Beavers College where, among others, they tried to point out to the public America's one-sided approach towards the Yugoslavian conflict. In 1999 they were invited once more by American universities as a foreign policy expert to lecture on Serbian-Albanian relations. During 1999, they were one of the most important witnesses in the trial of the Ustasha World War II criminal Dinko Šakić. They witnessed how Dinko Šakić killed their brother Milo Bošković in Jasenovac concentration camp. They died on January 14, 2011 in Belgrade.
Works
They were a contributor to many newspapers and magazines in Yugoslavia and abroad. In addition to numerous articles published during their career, two books are of particular importance:
Recent developments in the Western European Left, Belgrade, 1982
The challenges of technological change, Belgrade 1987

The Canadian Efficiency Decoration (ED) was a Canadian military award given to officers of the Non-Permanent Active Militia, RCAF Auxiliary and Reserve who completed twenty years of meritorious military service. Similar Efficiency Decorations were also awarded by other Commonwealth countries. A bar was issued for an additional 20 years of meritorious service. Approximately 3,700 medals were issued.
Time spent in war service counted double towards the 20 year requirement and time spent in the ranks counted as half. The award was superseded by the Air Efficiency Award for members of the RCAF Auxiliary and Reserve in 1942. Eligible members who entered the Canadian Forces before 1 September 1939 continued to be eligible for award of the Canadian Efficiency Decoration and bars to the decoration. Members who had joined after that time were eligible for the Canadian Forces Decoration, which superseded the Canadian Efficiency Decoration, on its establishment in 1949.

Henk de Velde (born 12 January 1949 in IJsselmuiden) is a Dutch seafarer.  They are especially known for their long solo-voyages around the world.
Initially they worked for thirteen years in the merchant navy, from able-bodied seaman to captain. When they were 28 they chose definitively for ocean-sailing. In 1978, they started with its first voyage around the world, which would eventually take seven years. They made this voyage with their former wife until they separated in 1984. Their son Stefan Vairoa was born on Easter Island in 1981.
In 1985, they returned to the Netherlands. In 1989, they left again for a nonstop circumnavigation with a 60-foot (18 meter) catamaran, called Alisun J&B, and it took them 158 days. They had to stop in New Zealand for repairs. Their third voyage, in 1992, with a 60 ft (18 meter) catamaran called Zeeman, was viewed on Dutch TV in the so-called 5 O'clock Show. They were for forty days a missing person because of electric problems and three days before arrival they had a collision with a floating container which left them unconscious. They were eventually rescued by a Russian freighter. With a double skull fracture they were hospitalized on the island of Madeira before returning to the Netherlands. In 1996, they departed with a 71-foot catamaran, called C1000 and sailed in 119 days non stop around the world. Officially they did not break the record because they did not sail under the rules of the WSSRC.  They are still the only person in the world who sailed a catamaran nonstop single handed around the world.
In 2001 de Velde started again, with a steel monohull yacht called Campina, this time using a totally new route, instead of west to east or east to west they wanted to sail the world north to south by passing the NE passage north of Siberia. It took them three and a half years. They had to winter near the village of Tiksi in Northern Siberia. Temperatures were between -35 and -60 °C. They stayed on board in the white desert of the Arctic Ocean. In 2004, they got the aid of a Russian nuclear icebreaker Vaigach. The rudders were demolished by heavy ice. In December 2004 they returned with their damaged vessel to the Netherlands. Henk de Velde has written seven books, all in Dutch. In all their writings they contemplate on the concept of freedom.  They are a philosopher, as well as a sailor, some even calling them a mystic. They directed two documentaries: Sea of Heartbreak (1997) and 1000 days of Loneliness (2005). They work in close association with the Dutch media.
They departed on their 6th circumnavigation in September 2007 with the trimaran Juniper, without planning to return to the Netherlands. They called this "Never Ending Voyage" a pilgrim's route to the edges of this world. The 52 ft trimaran was designed by Chris White. However, in March 2011, while sailing near Vancouver Island in Canada, they suffered an accident with the vessel, in which the propeller shaft broke from its axis, elbowing up and damaging the aft, a fibreglass predicament. Weeks of repairs ensued, and Henk de Velde counted on many helpful volunteer hands to have the problem fixed up. Perhaps resigning to the fact that the Juniper's speed was deemed never to match the Campina's resilience and livelihood, they then reported that their plans had changed, and that they would eventually return to the Netherlands, noting in an interview soon after, that the time had come "to slow down", and that they were homesick. They returned to the Netherlands in September 2011.

Cretornis is a pterosaur genus from the late Cretaceous period (Turonian stage) of what is now the Jizera Formation in the Czech Republic, dating to about 92 million years ago. It only contains a single species, Cretornis hlavaci.
Discovery and naming
The fossils were discovered in 1880 by workers at a quarry in Zářecká Lhota near the town of Choceň, who were getting gravel to repair a local road. A certain Mrs. Tomková, a croupier from Choceň, then alerted František Hlaváč, a Choceň pharmacist and fossil collector, to the find. They recognised exceptionality of that one, secured the rest of the fossils and then sent them to naturalist Professor Antonín Frič in Prague. In 1881, Antonín Frič identified it as a pterosaur and named it as the type species Cretornis Hlaváči. The generic name is derived from Latin creta, "chalk", in reference to the Cretaceous, and Greek ὄρνις, ornis, "bird", as Frič originally thought that the fossil bones belonged to some kind of ancient toothed bird (similar to the genus Ichthyornis). The specific name honors Hlaváč.
Today, the holotype of this pterosaur are stored in the National Museum in Prague. There is also unconfirmed information that similar bones (perhaps also pterosaur bones) were found in other places around the quarry before this discovery, but later they were apparently lost.
Afterwards it was realized that the find represented some pterosaur. The name was incorrectly emended by Richard Lydekker into Ornithochirus hlavatschi Fritsch 1881, in 1888. As scientific species names are not allowed to contain diacritical signs, the specific name had to be transcribed. Lydekker chose to write it as if it, and Frič himself, were German, as Bohemia at the time was under a strong German cultural influence. Frič, an ethnic Czech, in 1905 ultimately used the correct transcription Ornithocheirus hlavaci.
Since 1905, the taxon was typically considered a nomen dubium. In 2010 however, Alexandr Averianov concluded that it should be possible to determine unique traits. In 2015 they published a new description, concluding that Cretornis was a valid taxon.
Cretornis is known from the holotype, presently preserved in the collection of the Národní muzeum (National Museum) in Prague as "Object 10". It was found in what Frič called the Mittlere Iserschichten, today known as the Jizera Formation, dating from the Turonian. It is a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains a complete humerus (upper arm bone), an ulna, radius, wrist and two phalanges of the wing finger.
Description
Based on comparison with its relatives, the wingspan of C. hlavaci has by Averianov been estimated at . The humerus is in length.
In 2015, Averianov indicated a single autapomorphy, unique derived trait: the distal part of the humerus has a diamond-shaped cross-section.
Classification
Cretornis was classified as a species in the genus Ornithocheirus in the nineteenth century. In 1997 Coralia-Maria Jianu suggested it belonged to the Pteranodontidae. In 2010, Averianov thought is it was a member of the Azhdarchidae. More detailed comparisons of the wing bones led Averianov to conclude in 2015 that they belonged to a non-azhdarchid azhdarchoid, probably a member of the group Neoazhdarchia with which it has many features in common. It is probably more advanced than the Thalassodromidae, and shares with Montanazhdarcho the trait that the distal part of the ulna has a joint surface that is placed more proximal than the tubercle. In 2018, paleontologist Nicholas Longrich and colleagues had recovered Cretornis within the family Nyctosauridae, in a more derived position than Alamodactylus and Volgadraco, this contradicts its position within the Azhdarchoidea. The cladogram of their analysis is shown below:

Louis Sanford Goodman (August 27, 1906 – November 19, 2000) was an American pharmacologist.  They are best known for their collaborations with Alfred Gilman, Sr., with whom they authored the popular textbook The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics in 1941 and pioneered the first chemotherapy trials using nitrogen mustard.
Life and career
Goodman was born in Portland, Oregon in 1906 and received their B.A. from Reed College in 1928 and an M.D. from the University of Oregon Medical School in 1932. After interning at Johns Hopkins Hospital, they joined the Yale School of Medicine faculty, where they met Alfred Gilman. They began teaching pharmacology courses together and began to develop a textbook, which was published as The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics in 1941.
While at Yale, Goodman and Gilman were assigned a government contract in nitrogen mustard research in 1942. With knowledge that the compound depleted white blood cells, the pharmacologists experimented with intravenous injections on a terminally ill lymphosarcoma patient in Gustaf Lindskog's care. Though the tumor regenerated and killed the patient, the drug's success in briefly eliminating the tumor is considered a historic accomplishment in chemotherapy treatment, and the compound is still used as a chemotherapeutic agent.
Goodman was appointed an assistant professor at the University of Vermont in 1937, and became its chair of pharmacology and physiology in 1943. Then, in 1944, they moved to Salt Lake City to found a department of pharmacology at the University of Utah College of Medicine. There, Goodman demonstrated that the paralysis induced by curare was temporary, which they did by injecting a colleague with the relaxant.
Goodman retired in 1971 and remained in Salt Lake City for the remainder of their life, continuing to teach at the College of Medicine. They died on November 19, 2000, at the age of 94.
Personal life
Goodman married Helen Ricen in 1934, and they had two daughters, Carolyn and Debora.  They are survived by their grandchildren, Jonathan, Rebecca, Miriam and Jacob and great grandson Leo Goodman Liggins.
Awards and honors
Goodman was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965.

Padiham Power Station was a coal-fired power station in Padiham, east Lancashire, England, which began operation in 1926 and generated power from 1927 until it was closed in 1993.
Location
The plant was located on the north bank of the River Calder just west of the town. It was also known as Hapton or Simonstone Power Station being close to all of the villages. Since the station closed, the site has been used for a modern business park, Shuttleworth Mead.
History
Padiham A
The Lancashire Electric Power (LEP) company's proposal to build a coal-fired plant at Padiham (known as Padiham 'A') was approved in 1924 for a 12,000 kW station. By March 1925 two 6,000 kW alternator sets had been ordered, the sidings for delivery of coal by rail completed and work commenced on foundations. It was the second of three stations built by the company.
In 1926 the Electricity Supply Act established the Central Electricity Board to control the best and most efficient stations and set up a grid, standardise frequencies, supply local authorities and supply rural districts. The Padiham buildings had been roofed, alternators tested, installation begun, boilers erected, a weir across the River Calder completed, two cooling towers and the coal and ash plant nearly complete. Test were underway by July and on 24 January 1927 the plant was brought into regular use.
An 11,000 volt line had been installed to the power stations at Accrington and Radcliffe. A further 12,500 kW alternator was ordered and eventually installed by 1929. The two British Thomson-Houston sets were later rated at 7,500 and 15,625 kW. The turbines were supplied with steam from six 35,000 lb/hr and two 56,000 lb/hr boilers operating at 250 psi and 650 °F. By 1940 Padiham was supplying loads at Padiham (7,600 kW), Nelson and Colne (20,500 kW) and Burnley (20,500 kW). Two more 12,500 kW alternators were ordered. 70 million units per year at 20% load factor were being generated and in 1942/3 two more boilers were being installed.
The Electricity Act 1947 nationalised the electricity industry and set up the British Electricity Authority, which became the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in 1955, controlled by the Minister of Fuel and Power. The Authority took over electricity generating function of the LEP and promoted efficient generation, transmission and distribution and cheaper prices in rural areas. It also standardised the system and electrical fittings and had 11 divisions and 12 area boards. Padiham power station was vested in the BEA and the LEP's electricity distribution and sales functions were taken over by the North Western Electricity Board (NWEB). The CEA was in turn dissolved by the Electricity Act 1957 and replaced by the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and the Electricity Council.
The generating capacity and output from Padiham A is given in the following table.
Padiham A power station closed in 1969.
Padiham B
In 1957 a 240MW station, Padiham "B", was authorised with the first British Thomson-Houston unit of 120MW commissioned in 1962. There were two Babcock & Wilcox boilers rated at 108 kg/s, steam conditions were 103.42 bar at 538 °C, with reheat to 538 °C. Padiham B was one of the CEGB's twenty steam power stations with the highest thermal efficiency; in 1963–4 the thermal efficiency was 32.36 per cent, 32.91 per cent in 1964–5, and 33.27 per cent in 1965–6. The annual electricity output of Padiham B was:
In 1964 a Padiham "C" was proposed but not built. Padiham "A" closed in 1969. In 1971 some oil firing and orimulsion was proposed at one stage but it seems only coal and petrocoke were ever used. By 1984 the station was generating 15 million MW hours.
In 1993 the last load of coal was delivered and Padiham "B" ceased generation on 31 March.
The power station is also notable for being used in a minor capacity during the filming of science fiction comedy series Red Dwarf in the 1990s
Redevelopment
Although the rail line had closed for passengers connecting Padiham railway station to Burnley and Blackburn in 1957, the section to the power station was retained for coal deliveries. Part of it was under consideration by Lancashire County Council as a rural walk in 2008. The weir constructed to provide cooling water for the plant was also under consideration for partial removal to provide a canoe slalom and aid fish, salmon and trout, trying to reach the upper part of the river. The Environment Agency believes that the quality of the Calder is now of a standard that can support these fish. The project is a joint fish pass and canoe run. Fish movement upstream will open up opportunities for course and game fishing in the rural areas up stream. The works to remove the derelict weir will see the final stage of the reclamation of the former power station and the work is complementary to the county's developing land reclamation programme.

Paulino "Pau" Miguélez Fernández (born 23 January 1999) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Hércules CF as a left winger.
Club career
Born in Noja, Cantabria, Miguélez was a Racing de Santander youth graduate. They made their senior – and first team – debut on 23 August 2015 at the age of 16, playing the last 12 minutes of a 0–1 Segunda División B away loss against Celta de Vigo B; they spent the campaign switching between the main squad and the reserves in the Tercera División.
Miguélez scored their first senior goal on 22 August 2016, netting a brace with the B's in a 5–1 away routing of Selaya FC. They only started to feature regularly for the first team in the 2017–18 season, with the side still in the third division.
On 20 July 2018, Miguélez signed a three-year deal with Girona FC, being assigned to the farm team also in the third tier. On 10 July of the following year, they moved to another reserve team, Sevilla Atlético in the same category.
On 29 January 2020, Miguélez joined UD Las Palmas, being assigned to the B-side still in division three. They made their professional debut on 10 January of the following year, coming on as a late substitute for Kirian Rodríguez in a 1–0 away win against RCD Mallorca in the Segunda División.
On 13 July 2021, Miguélez signed a one-year contract with Hércules CF of the Segunda División RFEF.

Synopsis
Tony and Johnny meet about a missing load of smuggled Vespa scooters that were supposed to be received by Carlo Gervasi's crew and split between the two families. Johnny denies any knowledge about the Vespas and makes a pointed reference to Tony's continued denial that Tony B was involved in the hit on Joey. Tony suspects Johnny seized the whole shipment for themselves and sends Benny and a member of Carlo's crew to the port to investigate. They brutally interrogate a security guard, who tells them that Phil took the scooters. A shipment of expensive Italian cheeses is coming in; fearing more financial losses, Tony loses their temper in front of their crew.
Tony asks Tony B and Christopher to remove three bodies from Uncle Pat Blundetto's farm in Kinderhook, New York, which is about to have new owners. Chris complains to Adriana about the two Tonys' past treatment of him. Adriana suggests they leave New Jersey and start over elsewhere, but Chris replies that they are a soldier for life. Despite early tensions, Chris and Tony B bond as they gradually dispose of the bodies. However, when Tony comes to oversee the completion of the job, the two older men fall back into their routine of picking on Chris, with Tony making fun of Chris's sobriety. Chris passes up an opportunity to go hunting with them and leaves the farm early the next morning, driving home in tears.
Tony returns to the Bada Bing and, prompted by a TV program they have seen, talks about terrorist threats tied to unexamined cargo containers at the ports. When Georgie Santorelli remarks that "you have to live for today," Tony suddenly explodes in fury and gives them a beating that sends them to the hospital and causes some permanent hearing loss. Afterward, Tony is remorseful, and gives Paulie a wad of bills and insists that they make sure Georgie receives the best care. Paulie then tells Tony that Georgie is quitting their job at the Bing and doesn't want to see them again.
Carmela continues to be hostile towards Tony and drains the water from their house's pool to keep them from swimming there. After another fight, they agree to organize an engagement party for Meadow and Finn. When they run into Mr. Wegler at A.J.'s school, they surprise themselves by saying that they are moving back in with their husband, but later insists to Rosalie that they have no such intention.
Janice is arrested after assaulting another mother at their stepdaughter's soccer game. Tony is infuriated over the publicity brought to their family and storms into Janice's house late at night, demanding they plead guilty to the charges and that Bobby "take control" of their wife. Citing their recent bellicose behavior, Bobby gives Janice an ultimatum to either see an anger management specialist or end their marriage. Janice starts attending anger management classes and tells Tony that they have helped them make tremendous progress; Tony says they are happy for them The "Soprano temper" becomes the focus of Tony's next session with Dr. Melfi, who observes that both depression and anger are traits in the Soprano family.
Tony joins Janice and Bobby for dinner but becomes irritated when they see their newly placid sister deal calmly with a series of minor annoyances. They break the calm by provoking them with sarcastic and increasingly hurtful comments about their estranged son, Harpo. Janice soon gets enraged and chases Tony round the room with a fork in their fist. Smiling to himself, they leaf.
First appearances
Uncle Pat Blundetto: Tony S and Tony B's uncle who was given early retirement from the DiMeo crime family because of health issues. They settled on a large farm in Kinderhook, New York, where they were often visited by their nephews Christopher, Tony S, and Tony B during their childhoods.
Title reference
Tony tells Dr. Melfi that "revenge is like serving cold cuts" (inadvertently mangling the adage "Revenge is a dish best served cold"). In the episode, Johnny Sack continues to interfere with Soprano business in retribution for the murder of "Joey Peeps."
In a scene at Uncle Pat's farm, Christopher, Pat, and Tony B eat cold-cut sandwiches for lunch.
The title may also refer to the dead bodies Tony B and Christopher are looking for in this episode.
Connections to previous episodes
Christopher and Tony Blundetto dig up and dispose of Emil Kolar's skeleton, moving their body for the second time. Christopher shot and killed Emil in the Pilot episode. Then, they and Pussy Bonpensiero unsuccessfully tried to put Emil's body into a dumpster. Later, they buried the body under a bridge somewhere. But, the burial was giving Christopher nightmares. So, Christopher and Georgie later dug up the body and relocated it in "The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti."
When Tony confronts Janice over the assault, they tell them that the woman is lucky they didn't kill them Tony responds, "Well, we know that." This refers to the killing of Richie Aprile by Janice in "The Knight in White Satin Armor."
The woman Tony sleeps with was previously encountered in "Irregular Around the Margins" as an employee of the dermatologist's office where their cancerous mole was removed.
Tony previously assaulted Georgie in Season 1, Episode 2 "46 Long." Exasperated by Georgie's clumsy way of handling a phone call, Tony took the phone and bashed them on the head with it.
Other cultural references
Of Johnny Sack's belief that Tony Blundetto killed "Joey Peeps," Silvio comments that Sack should be "out looking for the real killers, instead of spending all their time on the golf course." This line is a not-so-subtle jab at O. J. Simpson, who in the years after their acquittal on murder charges claimed to be seeking "the real killers" while they were often criticized for spending much of their free time playing golf.
Dr. Melfi quotes W.B. Yeats' "The Second Coming" during a session with Tony in this episode. This poem will later be used prominently in Season 6 (including an episode titled "The Second Coming").
Tony mentions to Dr. Melfi that John Gotti had a bad temper when they tell them about Janice going to anger management.
On the drive to Kinderhook, Tony B confides to Christopher: "that 'Legend of Sleepy Hollow' cartoon used to scare the piss out of me" and adds that "very sorry people" used to call Tony B Ichabod Crane. According to a notation by Washington Irving, the character of Ichabod Crane was based on a schoolteacher whom Irving befriended in Kinderhook, New York, in 1809.
In the audio commentary, the episode's director, Mike Figgis, points out how the scene where Christopher and Tony Blundetto dig up the skeletal remains of a man Christopher knew (and killed) symbolically referenced the famous Yorick scene in Hamlet.
Christopher, as in episodes before, once again mistakenly calls Emil Kolar a Czechoslovakian when, in fact, they were a Czech-American. Paulie Walnuts once confused Chechens with Czechoslovakians in "Pine Barrens."
When Uncle Pat remembers where the missing bodies are buried, Christopher likens them to Johnny Mnemonic.
When Tony is flipping channels, obscure Cartoon Network show Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones? is seen on the TV.
At a diner, Tony B mentions to Tony that Christopher has the same car (Hummer H2) as Schwarzenegger. Tony then, in a malapropism (the way Schwarzenegger did), calls it "the Humvee."
The voice on the TV program about terrorist threats to ports is Jim Lehrer of the PBS NewsHour.
Tony misquotes the Phoebe Snow song "Harpo's Blues" (from their eponymous 1974 album) as "Harpo's Song" when they are deliberately attempting to provoke Janice during this episode's final scene.
At dinner, when Bobby Jr. makes reference to a “...G5. It has 64-bit...” they are referring to a Power Mac G5.
Music
The piano song played at the wedding shop visited by Christopher and Adriana is "Music Box Dancer," written by Frank Mills.
The song played at the Bada Bing! before Tony beats Georgie up is "Stop" by Joe Henry, which Henry's sister-in-law Madonna has performed as "Don't Tell Me".
The song played over the end credits is a live version of "I'm Not Like Everybody Else" by The Kinks, which is featured in their 1996 album To the Bone.

Carbon Engineering Ltd. is a Canadian-based clean energy company focusing on the commercialization of Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology that captures carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere.
This captured can either be stored underground, or converted into carbon-neutral fuel using renewable energy sources, by a process the company calls Air to fuels.
The company is running a pilot plant in Squamish, British Columbia, removing CO2 from the atmosphere since 2015 and converting it into fuels since December, 2017.
The company was founded in 2009 by David Keith, now a Board Member as well as a professor of public policy and applied physics at Harvard University, and is now led by Daniel Friedmann as CEO, who served as the former CEO of Canadian aero-space company, MDA, for 20 years.
Carbon Engineering is funded by several government and sustainability-focused agencies as well as by private investors, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and oil sands financier N. Murray Edwards.
In addition, in 2019 the company received US$68 million from private investors, including fossil fuel companies Chevron Corporation, Occidental Petroleum, and BHP.
Technology
Carbon Engineering's DAC system integrates two main cycles. The first cycle is the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere in a device called an "air contactor" using an alkaline hydroxide solution, via proprietary patents such as US20140271379A1 and US20150329369A1. The second cycle regenerates the capture liquid used in the air contactor, and delivers pure CO2 as an end product.
These cycles operate in tandem continuously, producing a concentrated stream of CO2 gas as an output, and requiring only energy, water, and small material make up streams as inputs. Energy is used in such a way that no new CO2 emissions are incurred, and thus do not counteract what was captured from the air. The captured atmospheric CO2 can be stored underground, used for enhanced oil recovery, or turned into low-carbon synthetic fuels using the company's "air to fuel" technology.
Carbon Engineering's Air to fuel process can produce fuels such as gasoline, diesel, or jet A using inputs of atmospheric CO2, water, and renewable electricity such as that from solar PV. Electricity is used to split water and manufacture hydrogen, which is then combined with captured atmospheric CO2 to form fuels. This approach offers a means to deliver clean fuels that are compatible with existing engines, and can help de-carbonize the transportation sector by displacing fuels made from crude oil.
Pilot plant demonstration
In 2015, Carbon Engineering started operations of its full end-to-end pilot plant, located in Squamish, British Columbia, Canada. When running, this facility captures roughly 1 ton of atmospheric CO2 per day.
In 2017, the company incorporated fuel synthesis capability into the DAC pilot plant and converted CO2 into fuel for the first time in December 2017.
Based on the data obtained from the pilot plant, Keith and colleagues published an article in 2018 that presents a simulation suggesting that CO2 can be captured from the atmosphere at a cost of between US$94 to US$233 per ton, "depending on financial assumptions, energy costs, and the specific choice of inputs and outputs."
Both DAC and Air to fuel technologies have been proven at the pilot plant and are now being scaled up into commercial markets. Individual DAC facilities can be built to capture 1 million tons of CO2 per year. At that scale, one Carbon Engineering air capture plant could negate the emissions from ~250,000 cars—either by sequestering the CO2 or by using the recycled carbon dioxide as a feedstock to produce synthetic fuel.
Over 9,500 of Carbon Engineering's air capture plants would be needed to offset the annual CO2 emissions from the estimated 2 billion vehicles by 2035, which includes medium and heavy trucks that emit significantly more greenhouse gases than passenger vehicles.
More still would be needed once aviation, mining, agriculture, construction and non-vehicle emissions are factored in.
Commercialization
In May 2019, Carbon Engineering announced it was partnering with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, LLC. (OLCV), a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, to design and engineer a large-scale DAC plant capable of capturing 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year, which would be used in OLCV's enhanced oil recovery operations and subsequently stored underground permanently. Located in the Permian Basin, construction for the plant is expected to begin in 2022, with operations targeted for 2024. In September 2019, Carbon Engineering announced they were expanding the capacity of the design of the plant from 500,000 metric tons to an expected one million metric tons of CO2 captured per year.

Joint Task Force Civil Support (JTF-CS) is a subordinate command of United States Northern Command headquartered at Fort Eustis. Its mission is to provide command and control for Department of Defense forces deployed in support of the National Response Plan, specifically, managing the consequences of a domestic chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive (CBRNE) incident. JTFCS consists of discrete units of specialized consequence management troops from all services called the DOD CBRN Response Forces (DCRF), as well as civilian subject-matter experts, assigned from various agencies. JTF-CS is able to respond anywhere in North America within 12 hours to lead technical and non-technical search and rescue, security, hazard analysis, evidence collection, mission command, logistics support, aviation support, and medical support after an actual or threatened CBRNE incident. JTF-CS is also a collaborative partner in planning for and responding to identified National Special Security Events (NSSE) around the United States.
JTF-CS was created in 1999 to fulfill the Congressional mandate in the 1998 Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation for the Secretary of Defense to develop and enhance the federal government's capability to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.
The current commander of JTF-CS is Major General Jeffrey P. Van, Army National Guard.

An automaton clock or automata clock is a type of striking clock featuring automatons. Clocks like these were built from the 1st century BC through to Victorian times in Europe. A Cuckoo clock is a simple form of this type of clock.
The first known mention is of those created by the Roman engineer Vitruvius, describing early alarm clocks working with gongs or trumpets. Later automatons usually perform on the hour, half-hour or quarter-hour, usually to strike bells. Common figures in older clocks include Death (as a reference to human mortality), Old Father Time, saints and angels. In the Regency and Victorian eras, common figures also included royalty, famous composers or industrialists.
More recently constructed automaton clocks are widespread in Japan, where they are known as karakuri-dokei. Notable examples of such clocks include the Nittele Ōdokei, designed by Hayao Miyazaki to be affixed on the Nippon Television headquarters in Tokyo, touted to be the largest animated clock in the world. In the United Kingdom, Kit Williams produced a series of large automaton clocks for a handful of British shopping centres, featuring frogs, ducks and fish.

Gorgui Sy Dieng (; ; born January 18, 1990) is a Senegalese professional basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA). They played college basketball for the Louisville Cardinals.
Dieng was selected as the 21st overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the Utah Jazz and was traded on draft night to the Minnesota Timberwolves. They spent seven seasons with the team before being dealt to the Memphis Grizzlies in February 2020. They reached a contract buyout agreement with the Grizzlies in March 2021 and joined the San Antonio Spurs in free agency. They signed with the Hawks in August 2021.
High school career
Dieng attended the Sports for Education and Economic Development (SEEDS) Academy in Thiès, Senegal. While at SEEDS, Dieng had a 3.2 GPA.
They were invited to the "Basketball Without Borders" camp in South Africa in 2009 as one of 60 promising players selected from across Africa, and was named MVP of the camp.
Dieng transferred to Huntington Prep in West Virginia for the 2009–10 school year, where they played for coach Rob Fulford. They averaged 15.4 points, 12.6 rebounds and 7.2 blocks per game during their senior season at Huntington Prep.
Recruiting
Dieng was recruited by Marquette, Marshall, Colorado, and Louisville among others who came in late. Their high school coach Rob Fulford said "Academics are no question, They passed the SAT six months after learning English and passed with 400 points to spare." The most interest was from Louisville and Marshall. Then on March 30, 2010 head coach Donnie Jones left Marshall to become the head coach of the University of Central Florida. The next day, Rick Pitino signed a contract extension through 2017 with Louisville. On April 26, 2010 Dieng verbally committed to Louisville. Louisville assistant coach Walter McCarty, who has NBA experience, helped Rick Pitino land Dieng in a Cardinals uniform.
Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Dieng was listed as the No. 10 power forward and the No. 44 player in the nation in 2010.
College career
Dieng was ruled ineligible by the NCAA when they first arrived at Louisville forcing them to hold them out of practice and individual workouts. Louisville appealed the NCAA's decision and on October 26, 2010 it was announced that the NCAA reversed its original decision and ruled Dieng eligible immediately. As a first-year student Dieng saw action in 29 games averaging 16 mins a game. They scored 5.7 points a game, pulled down 4.4 rebounds and blocked 1.9 shots a game in their limited action. The Cardinals finished the 2010–11 season with a 25–10 record, 12–6 in Big East play tied for 3rd and lost in the championship game of the 2011 Big East men's basketball tournament to Connecticut. They received an at-large bid and a #4 seed in the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament where they were upset in the second round by #13 seeded Morehead State.
As a sophomore, Dieng started at center for the 2011–12 Louisville team that reached the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament. In the 2011–12 season, Dieng led the Big East Conference in blocks, and set the all-time school record for blocks in a season. On March 22, 2012, Dieng matched a Louisville tournament record with 7 blocks in a game in a 57–44 Sweet 16 victory over Michigan State.
Dieng was named as a student representative to the board of directors of the U of L athletic department for the 2012–13 school year, succeeding their graduated teammate Kyle Kuric.
Despite being a junior, Dieng was honored on Senior Day in 2013, due to the fact that they would forgo their last year at Louisville to enter the 2013 NBA draft.

The Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools (AHIGS), is an association for independent girls' schools, based in North Ryde, New South Wales, Australia.
Established in 1916 as The Association of Head Mistresses of New South Wales, the Association that as of 2017 comprised 31 member schools, enables inter-school aesthetic, cultural and sporting activities (through the Independent Girls' Schools Sporting Association) between New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory's most exclusive independent and Catholic girls' schools.
AHIGS also exists for the purpose of encouraging communication and a bond of co-operation and collegiality among independent girls' schools and their "heads", and working towards advancing the cause of the education of girls through policy development on major issues of concern. The association actively represents its members and the interests of their schools at a political level, through lobbying governments and politicians. Through AHIGS competitions, member schools and their students, are encouraged to value good sportsmanship, participation, team spirit and fairness above undue competitiveness and individualism.
Of New South Wales' fifteen female Rhodes Scholars (1904 to 2009), eight have attended an AHIGS School.

History
At the Women's Club on 8 November 1916 a group of eight Headmistresses from seven schools formed The Association of Head Mistresses of New South Wales, with Miss Edith Badham (SCEGGS Darlinghurst) elected as Foundation President.
The seven founding schools were:
Abbotsleigh, Wahroonga
Frensham School, Mittagong
Kambala, Rose Bay
The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon (now Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney)
The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble (now Pymble Ladies' College)
St. Catherine's School, Waverley
The Sydney Church of England Girls' Grammar School (now SCEGGS Darlinghurst)
Eligibility for membership was eventually offered to a further 23 girls' schools.
In 1945, a national association was formed, and AHIGS New South Wales heads served as Presidents of that organisation as follows:
1950–1952 Miss D. Knox (PLC Pymble)
1959–1962 Miss P. Bryant (Frensham)
1975–1978 Miss B. Chisholm (SCEGGS)
1985 Miss K. McCredie (Abbotsleigh).
The national organisation was disbanded on 26 August 1985 when the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia was founded.
AHIGS first admitted male heads of girls' schools to membership from 1973 however, so far no male member has been elected to the position of President.
Presidents
Independent Girls' Schools Sporting Association
Twenty-eight member schools of AHIGS compete against each other in a number of sporting carnivals and termly sports through the Independent Girls' Schools Sporting Association (IGSSA). Secondary school girls compete in team and individual sports at school level and can be selected through IGSSA for state representative teams and higher competitions.
Archdale debating competition
The Archdale Debating Competition is a competition conducted by the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools for the benefit of students from 22 of its Member Schools.
Established in the early 1970s, it is an annual competition conducted over two terms (typically between March and August), with each member school entering a team into each of the seven divisions.
The Archdale Shield is awarded to the school which performs best across the whole competition. The award is determined through an overall points score after the conclusion of the final round.
The competition is named in honour of Helen Elizabeth (Betty) Archdale (August 21, 1907–January 11, 2000), former principal of The Women's College at the University of Sydney (1946–1957), and former principal of Abbotsleigh (1958–1970). Betty Archdale was also a talented cricketer, captaining the English women's cricket team in 1934 and 1935. In 1944 Archdale was awarded an Order of the British Empire for their part in getting nurses out of Singapore during World War II. In 1999 they were one of the first ten women to be granted Honorary Life Membership of Marylebone Cricket Club in England. Archdale was listed as an Australian Living Treasure in 1997.
History
Although a number of AHIGS schools offered debating as an extracurricular activity from around the 1920s, it was not until the 1960s that inter-school debating became common among girls' schools.
In 1971, following a debate between Abbotsleigh and a combined high schools team, the decision was made to form a debating organisation for independent girls' schools. This organisation was called 'ISSGDA', and it was made up of sixteen independent schools (girls' and co-educational) divided into four geographic areas for competition purposes.
The first ISSGDA final was contested between Abbotsleigh and Moriah College (the only non-AHIGS school to compete) at Abbotsleigh. The trophy, which Miss Archdale had donated, was won by Abbotsleigh and presented by Miss Kathleen McCredie, the then principal of Abbotsleigh. From this point on, the competition became known as the 'Archdale Debating Competition'.
Archdale winners
Festival of Speech
The concept of a 'Festival of Speech' for the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools was first suggested in the early 1990s by Mr. Chris Faisandier, then Principal of Kincoppal-Rose Bay and a member of AHIGS.
Formerly a Principal of Sacred Heart College in New Zealand, Faisandier was involved with the O'Shea Shield Competition in which about twenty schools from the lower North Island of New Zealand participated.
The purpose of the O'Shea Shield Competition was to encourage students to develop skills in the areas of public speaking, debating, analysis and rhetoric. So popular was the competition and so high was the standard of presentation, that the winners of the O'Shea Shield were often featured on New Zealand television.
With the support of the AHIGS membership, Mr Faisandier established the Festival of Speech (then known as the Independent Girls Schools Speaking Competition) in NSW in 1996. The inaugural Festival, spanning Friday evening and all day Saturday, was hosted by Kincoppal-Rose Bay, won by Roseville College, and attended by fifteen schools.
Today the Festival continues to be hosted annually by an AHIGS member school, and some thirty-two schools now participate. Students have the opportunity to perform in the areas of drama, debating, poetry, prose readings, current affairs and religious and ethical questions. The Festival is open to girls from AHIGS schools in years seven to eleven.

Death of a Ghost is a crime novel by Margery Allingham, first published in February 1934, in the United Kingdom by Heinemann, London and in the United States by Doubleday, Doran, New York. It is the sixth novel with the mysterious Albert Campion, aided by their police officer friend Stanislaus Oates.
Plot introduction
At the former home of John Lafcadio, the great painter dead some 18 years, the annual ceremony to unveil a painting they left behind to keep their memory alive is interrupted by a murder. Suspicion falls on a family member, but with no proof the police are baffled. When murder once again visits "Little Venice", Albert Campion must exercise all their powers to bring the killer to justice...
Plot summary
John Lafcadio, who modestly described themselves as "probably the greatest painter since Rembrandt", has left a bizarre legacy – a collection of twelve sealed paintings, to be unveiled one at a time at an annual event commencing ten years after their death. While the first seven ceremonies went smoothly, the eighth starts with family ructions, when John's granddaughter Linda finds their boyfriend Tommy has returned from a painting trip to Rome with a model, whom they have married to get into the country. Albert Campion, a friend of Belle and the family, persuades them to attend the show, just in time to be there when Tommy is stabbed to death during a power cut.
Campion calls in their old friend Stanislaus Oates to help avoid scandal, but Oates is convinced Linda must be guilty, as they have the only obvious motive. Max Fustian, a hanger-on to Lafcadio's coat-tails and now a flourishing art dealer, confesses to the crime, but their confession is laughable and a clear attempt to clear Linda. No further proof can be found however, and thanks to pressure from some important dignitaries attending the show, the matter is hushed up.
The mystery continues, however, as Tommy's art and possessions slowly vanish, until no trace of them remains. Campion meets up with Max Fustian, and finds themselves entertaining strange suspicions of the odd little man. Some weeks later, Belle visits Claire Potter in their studio in the garden and finds their dead, face down on the couch. Nicotine poisoning is diagnosed, and suspicion falls at first on their husband, who had skipped work that day and had returned home for a minute an hour before the body was discovered, only to leave again in a hurry.
Potter reveals their wife suffered from alcoholism, and frequently drank themselves unconscious; they had assumed they had done this once more, washed their glass and left them there. Seeking the source of the poisoned booze, Campion and Oates discover that Claire took in wood-blocks for cleaning from Max Fustian, and had returned a parcel that very day. Questioning the delivery boy, they find that they once dropped a similar package, and was surprised to find the wrapping wet.
Convinced of Fustian's guilt but lacking proof, Campion seeks a motive. They learn from the model Rosa-Rosa that Tommy had a cottage in the country, and from the cook Lisa that Lafcadio, despite their determination to defeat their rival and keep their fame alive, had only managed to complete eight of the twelve paintings of their legacy, filling the remaining packages with junk as a joke. Campion visits Tommy's cottage and finds Max there, all traces of Tommy burnt. They return to Little Venice later, and finds Max in a blazing row with Belle – they have insisted they must take the remaining Lafcadio works abroad and sell them, and they have refused to let him.
Sure now that Max had Tommy fake the last four paintings for him, Campion gets further proof in the form of a drawing uncovered in Paris by Linda. They meet Max and they go out to dinner, where Max has them sample a strange and rare wine from Romania. Too late, Campion recalls the wine has a terribly intoxicating effect if taken after spirits – and Max had made sure Campion drank much gin before dinner. After a drunken tour of town, Max leads Campion to the edge of a Tube platform, and pushes hard – only to be stopped by the plain-clothes men Oates has had on their tail, after a meeting with Campion that morning.
Visiting Fustian in prison, Campion finds them a gibbering lunatic, their mind pushed over the edge by the defeat of their schemes.

The Lake Shore was a long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak between Chicago and New York via Cleveland, Ohio. The Lake Shore'''s route paralleled that of the New York Central's famed Lake Shore Limited. Amtrak introduced the Lake Shore on May 10, 1971, nine days after Amtrak had assumed control of most private-sector passenger train operations in the United States of America. The Lake Shore was the only train to serve Cleveland, which had been the largest city left out of the original system. Amtrak introduced the route on the understanding that Ohio and New York would assume two-thirds of the cost of the train. The initial plan included a Toledo, Ohio—Detroit, Michigan connection (to be supported by the state of Michigan); Amtrak dropped the planned connection because of poor track conditions between the two cities.
The Lake Shore was the last long-haul train to use Cleveland's Union Terminal, with the last departure occurring on December 31, 1971. For the last week of the Lake Shore's runs Amtrak used a temporary platform near the Detroit–Superior Bridge, west of the terminal, to avoid incurring a year's fees ($250,000) for a week's use. Amtrak discontinued the train in January 1972, after New York failed to meet its obligations. Amtrak would later introduce the Lake Shore Limited'' over the same route.

Ludmila Pechmanová-Klosová (born 13 July 1885) was a Czechoslovakian politician. In 1920 they were one of the first group of women elected to the Chamber of Deputies, remaining in parliament until 1935.
Biography
Pechmanová-Klosová was born in the Vinohrady district of Prague in 1885. After finishing their education, they worked as a post office clerk in the city. They became involved in trade unions and was appointed vice-president of the Association of Postal Officials in 1908. The following year they joined the Czech National Social Party.
Following the independence of Czechoslovakia at the end of World War I, Pechmanová-Klosová was a candidate for their party (now renamed the Czechoslovak Socialist Party) for the Chamber of Deputies in the 1920 parliamentary elections, and was one of sixteen women elected to parliament. They were subsequently re-elected in 1925 and 1929, serving until 1935 when poor health prevented them from running for re-election.

Within geotechnical engineering, Laubscher developed the Mining Rock Mass Rating (MRMR) system by modifying the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system of Z. T. Bieniawski. In the MRMR system the stability and support are determined with the following equations:
RMR = IRS + RQD + spacing + condition
in which:
RMR = Laubschers Rock Mass Rating
IRS = Intact Rock Strength
RQD = Rock Quality Designation
spacing = expression for the spacing of discontinuities
condition = condition of discontinuities (parameter also dependent on groundwater presence, pressure, or quantity of groundwater inflow in the underground excavation)
MRMR = RMR * adjustment factors
in which:
adjustment factors = factors to compensate for: the method of excavation, orientation of discontinuities and excavation, induced stresses, and future weathering
The parameters to calculate the RMR value are similar to those used in the RMR system of Bieniawski. This may be confusing, as some of the parameters in the MRMR system are modified, such as the condition parameter that includes groundwater presence and pressure in the MRMR system whereas groundwater is a separate parameter in the RMR system of Bieniawski. The number of classes for the parameters and the detail of the description of the parameters are also more extensive than in the RMR system of Bieniawski.
The adjustment factors depend on future (susceptibility to) weathering, stress environment, orientation,
The combination of values of RMR and MRMR determines the so-called reinforcement potential. A rock mass with a high RMR before the adjustment factors are applied has a high reinforcement potential, and can be reinforced by, for example, rock bolts, whatever the MRMR value might be after excavation. Contrariwise, rock bolts are not a suitable reinforcement for a rock mass with a low RMR (i.e. has a low reinforcement potential).
Laubscher uses a graph for the spacing parameter. The parameter is dependent on a maximum of three discontinuity sets that determine the size and the form of the rock blocks. The condition parameter is determined by the discontinuity set with the most adverse influence on the stability.
The concept of adjustment factors for the rock mass before and after excavation is very attractive. This allows for compensation of local variations, which may be present at the location of the rock mass observed, but might not be present at the location of the proposed excavation or vice versa. In addition, this allows for quantification of the influence of excavation and excavation induced stresses, excavation methods, and the influence of past and future weathering of the rock mass.

Benești railway station was a station on the Agnita railway line in Benești, Sibiu County, Romania. The station still exists along with the track which has been protected.
History
The station was built by the Hungarian State Railways in 1910 who operated it until 1919 when the region of Transylvania became part of Romania. After a decline in usage across the whole line and subsequent curtailing of the route in the 1960s and 1990s the station closed in 2001.
Future
Plans exist to reopen part of the line after it was protected in 2008. The local group Asociația Prietenii Mocăniței has taken on the task of restoring the route which has already restored a section of the line.

Landfall Peak () is a prominent peak-shaped landmark near the extreme west end of Thurston Island, Antarctica, about east-northeast of Cape Flying Fish and 0.5 nautical miles (0.9 km) northwest of Mount Gimber. It was discovered by members of the United States Antarctic Service in flights from the in February 1940, and photographed at that time by E.B. Perce. The peak was plotted from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump in December 1946, and was observed by personnel of the U.S. Navy Bellingshausen Sea Expedition in February 1960. It was so named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names because rock exposures on the peak serve as a mark for ships approaching Thurston Island from the west.

Macquarie European Rail (formerly Lloyds TSB General Leasing) is a rolling stock company (ROSCO). It is presently owned by the French railway leasing entity Akiem.
Founded as Lloyds TSB General Leasing as a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group in January 2009, early financing arrangements involved the Class 379 electric multiple units (EMUs) and Class 70 heavy freight locomotives. The venture also expanded into the continent European rail leasing market. In November 2012, Lloyds opted to sell its rail leasing arm to the financial services specialist Macquarie Group. During February 2020, it was announced that Macquarie European Rail was to be sold to another leading organisation, Akiem, the deal was completed two months later.
History
Macquarie European Rail was originally created as Lloyds TSB General Leasing in January 2009 by the Lloyds Banking Group to operate in Britain's rolling stock leasing market. Prior to deciding to form its own subsidiary focused on the sector, Lloyds had effectively involved itself already through its participation in the consortium that acquired the rolling stock company (ROSCO) Porterbrook during October 2008.
During May 2009, the company's first major train order was announced, involving the purchase of 30 four-car Class 379 electric multiple units (EMUs) which would go on to be operated by National Express East Anglia on both its Stansted Express and West Anglia routes. Another early venture undertaken by Lloyds TSB was the financing of 20 American-built Class 70 heavy freight locomotives which it leased to Freightliner.
In November 2012, Lloyds Banking Group completed the sale of its rail leasing subsidiary to the multinational financial services entity Macquarie Group; it was promptly rebranded as Macquarie European Rail thereafter. At the time of the sale, the company's activities had expanded to not only cover leases of freight and passenger rolling stock within the United Kingdom, but also a continental European portfolio of locomotives, passenger trains and wagons as well.
In December 2016, an article in the Financial Times gave warning of signs of overheating within the highly competitive ROSCO sector, pointing to Macquarie's relatively youthful Class 379 EMUs as an example of rolling stock that may have trouble finding future work on Britain's railways as yet newer types are rapidly introduced. Citing the high leasing costs associated with the fleet, Greater Anglia withdrew all of its Class 379 fleet from service in February 2022, after which the units were placed into storage.
In January 2019, rail leasing company Ermewa acquired Macquarie European Rail's 600-strong intermodal wagon fleet, comprising a mix of 60, 80 and 90 foot container wagons.
During February 2020, the sale of Macquarie European Rail to the French rail leasing specialist Akiem was announced. Finalised two months later, at the time of the transaction, Macquarie European Rail's portfolio included 137 locomotives of various types, including Class 66s, Class 70s, Bombardier Traxx, Alstom Primas and GE Transportation 311Ds, which were reportedly in service with 21 different operators. Furthermore, it also comprised multiple units, such as the 30 Bombardier Class 379 EMUs then on lease to Greater Anglia, 16 Stadler GTW DMUs in the Netherlands, and 110 assorted wagons.

Antiguoko Kirol Elkartea (Sport Club of Antiguo in English) is an amateur youth Spanish football club based in Antiguo, a part of San Sebastián, in the Basque Country, Spain.
It acts as feeder club to Athletic Bilbao, having previously had the same agreement with Real Sociedad.
Club overview
Antiguoko was founded in 1982, at which time the team did not even possess its own ground.
A number of famous players who appeared for Real Sociedad as well as other teams – and the Spanish national side – have graduated from the club, including Xabi Alonso, Mikel Arteta, Javier de Pedro and Yuri Berchiche. Sell-on fees from multi-million transfers involving Alonso and Arteta have provided funds for Antiguoko to improve their facilities.
Aritz Aduriz, Andoni Iraola and Ander Murillo were also youth products of Antiguoko, and went on to later appear professionally with Real Sociedad's Basque neighbours Athletic Bilbao, a club which had a formal agreement with Antiguoko for several seasons and continues to acquire its players on a regular basis.
The Juvenil A squad play in the Group II of the División de Honor Juvenil de Fútbol. The opponents in the league group include the academy teams of Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad and Osasuna, other clubs whose adult departments compete at various levels from La Liga down to Tercera División, and another strong youth-only organisation, Danok Bat. The Juvenil B team plays in the Liga Nacional Juvenil de Fútbol which is the lower division of the same structure, and the Juvenil C team participates in the Liga Vasca one tier further down - as with adult leagues, the different teams cannot coincide at the same level.
Antiguoko finished top of the league in 2006-07 which gave them a rare chance to compete nationally in the Copa de Campeones Juvenil and the Copa del Rey Juvenil.

Trent Lucas Sainsbury (born 5 January 1992) is an Australian professional football player who plays as a centre back for Qatari club Al-Wakrah and the Australian national team.
Sainsbury was born in Thornlie, Perth and played youth football with Perth Glory and the Australian Institute of Sport before starting their professional career with Central Coast Mariners. Sainsbury moved to PEC Zwolle in 2014.
Sainsbury has made over forty appearances for the Australian national team, scoring three times. They were a member of the Australia team which won the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.
Early life
Sainsbury was born in Thornlie, Perth, Western Australia. They attended Forest Crescent Primary School and Kelmscott Senior High School.
Trent started playing soccer at a very early age at Armadale Junior Soccer Club in Armadale, Western Australia.
In addition to holding an Australian passport, Sainsbury also holds a UK passport.
Sainsbury's partner, Elissa, is the daughter of Australian football manager and current Socceroos coach Graham Arnold.
Club career
Youth
Sainsbury began their youth career at Perth Glory in 2008 before moving a year later to the AIS where they were part of their National Youth League squad in the 2009–10 season.
Central Coast Mariners
In 2010, Sainsbury was signed by the Central Coast Mariners along with Sam Gallagher. Trent and Mariners teammate Marc Warren were selected to spend two weeks at Sheffield United's Academy as part of the two clubs' partnership. Their senior debut came for the Mariners on 24 November 2010 in an F3 Derby draw with Newcastle Jets, with Sainsbury earning praise from coach Graham Arnold for their performance. Trent went on to make a total of nine appearances in the first team that year.
During the successful 2011–12 campaign, it was announced that Sainsbury had signed a two-year contract extension with the club. The Mariners went on to win the 2011–12 A-League Premiership. Trent again made nine league appearances for the club in this season.
After breaking into the first team in the 2012-13 A-League season, Sainsbury formed a formidable partnership alongside Dutch defender Patrick Zwaanswijk. This unit was central in helping the Mariners secure their maiden A-League Championship against Western Sydney Wanderers in the 2013 A-League Grand Final. The Mariners won the game 2–0 in front of 42,102 spectators at the Sydney Football Stadium. Commentator and former Socceroo Mark Bosnich rated Sainsbury as their man of the match. The official award went to Daniel McBreen. Following the game, it was speculated that Sainsbury had attracted serious interest from European clubs including Southampton, Roda JC, Basel and Middlesbrough.
In March 2013, Sainsbury was nominated for the NAB Young Footballer of the Year which was eventually won by Marco Rojas. Sainsbury was named the Mariners Player of the Year for the 2012–13 season. They were also named in the PFA A-League Team of the Season for 2012–13.
After the announcement of the first A-League All Stars match, Sainsbury was considered one of the main contenders for a place in the squad. They did not end up playing in the match due to international selection.
Sainsbury scored their first competitive goal for the Mariners on 3 April 2013, in a win over Guizhou Renhe in the 2013 AFC Champions League, their header with under ten minutes remaining proving to be the winner. Their first A-League goal for the side came from a corner in a 2–1 win over Perth Glory in December 2013.
PEC Zwolle
2013–14 season
Sainsbury signed for PEC Zwolle in the Dutch Eredivisie on a two and half year deal in January 2014. Sainsbury was immediately placed in the starting line-up, making their Eredivisie debut on 6 February 2014 in an away game against FC Utrecht. PEC won the game 2–1, but Sainsbury had to be replaced after 72 minutes after falling on a depressed sprinkler, hurting their knee in the process. It was discovered after the match that Sainsbury had fractured their kneecap on the sprinkler, an injury that would end up ruling them out for the remainder of the season. Fellow Australians Tommy Oar and Adam Sarota played in the match for Utrecht.
Their club PEC did end the season on a high note when they won their first major trophy in the club's history by defeating league champions Ajax 5–1 in the 2014 KNVB Cup Final, also securing European football for the first time.
2014–15 season
Recovered from their knee injury, Sainsbury was reinstated in PEC's starting lineup for their first game of the season - the 2014 Dutch Supercup. The game was played against the same team that PEC defeated to win the KNVB Cup, 2013–14 league champions Ajax. Sainsbury was part of a defence that kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 win, securing PEC's second major trophy in the club's history in the space of 4 months.
Sainsbury retained their place in the starting line-up for the first league game, at home against FC Utrecht. Lightning would strike again, as Sainsbury was subbed off with an ankle injury after 30 minutes of play, making it the second time in a row Sainsbury was forced out of a league game with an injury, both times against Utrecht. PEC won the game 2–0.
Jiangsu Suning
In January 2016, Sainsbury left PEC Zwolle on a $1.5 million transfer and signed a 3-year deal with Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning.
Loan to Inter Milan
On 31 January 2017, it was confirmed that Jiangsu Suning loaned Sainsbury to sister club Inter Milan until 30 June 2017. They made their debut on 28 May 2017 in a 5–2 win over Udinese in the last round of the season, coming on as a substitute for Davide Santon with twenty minutes to play. This made them the first Australian to make a senior appearance for Inter Milan (Nathan Coe and Carl Valeri, former Australian internationals, only played for their reserves).
Loan to Grasshoppers
In February 2018, Sainsbury moved on loan to Grasshoppers for the remainder of the 2017–18 Swiss Super League season.
PSV Eindhoven
In August 2018, Sainsbury signed a 3-year contract with Dutch champions, PSV Eindhoven.
Maccabi Haifa
On 30 August 2019, Sainsbury departed PSV for Israeli club Maccabi Haifa, joining the club on a two-year contract. Following new coach Barak Bakhar not being impressed with Sainsbury's conduct and following a groin injury during a training camp, Sainsbury was released in August 2020 after 31 appearances in which they scored twice.
Kortrijk
After leaving Maccabi Haifa, Sainsbury joined Belgian First Division A club Kortrijk on a two-year deal. They scored their first goal for Kortrijk, the final goal in a 5-5 draw against Beerschot on 10th November 2020.
International career
Under-17
Sainsbury was a member of the Australia U-17 team which attended the 2008 AFF U-16 Youth Championship. The team won the tournament after beating Bahrain in a penalty shootout in the final. They were also a member of the squad for the 2008 AFC U-16 Championship, scoring a goal in a loss to the UAE in the quarter-finals which saw Australia miss out on qualification for the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup.
Under-20
Sainsbury was selected in Australia's squad for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup where Australia finished bottom of their group with one draw and two losses. They played in all three of Australia's matches.
Senior
In May 2013, Trent was selected in a Socceroos Australian-based training squad for upcoming World Cup qualifiers. In July 2013, they made Australia's squad for the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup. Despite strong club form, Sainsbury was the only outfield player in the squad not to be used by coach Holger Osieck in the tournament, which they suggested may have been due to Osieck mistaking their laid-back attitude for a lack of commitment.
Sainsbury's chances of playing in the 2014 FIFA World Cup were ultimately ended by a knee injury suffered playing for PEC Zwolle.
In September 2014, Sainsbury made their International debut for Australia in a 2–0 loss to Belgium in a friendly. They later admitted to having been nervous before the game but earned praise from coach Ange Postecoglou for their performance against a strong opponent.
Sainsbury was selected as part of Australia's 2015 AFC Asian Cup squad. They started in Australia's first group game against Kuwait, a match which Australia won 4-1. They also started Australia's second group game against Oman, providing the assist for Matt McKay to open the scoring in a 4-0 win by heading a Massimo Luongo corner goalwards. Sainsbury scored their first ever international goal in the semi-final against the United Arab Emirates. Under three minutes into the game, they headed a corner from Massimo Luongo in at the far post to give Australia the lead in a match they ultimately won 2–0. They also played for Australia in the Final victory over South Korea and was named as Man of the Match following an imposing defensive display. Trent was named in the official team of the tournament after a number of solid performances.
In May 2018 they were named in Australia's 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Choe Ryong-hae (born 15 January 1950) is a North Korean politician and military officer who currently serves as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly and First Vice President of the State Affairs Commission, holding both positions since April 2019. Due to holding the first office, they were considered the head of state of North Korea before the country's constitution was amended to transfer this position to the President of the State Affairs Commission,Kim Jong-un.  They are also a member of the Presidium of the Politburo and Vice Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). They also served as Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un's military second-in-command, currently being third top-ranking official in North Korea after Kim Jong-un and premier Kim Tok-hun.
Early life
Choe Ryong-hae was born in Sinchon County, South Hwanghae Province, on 15 January 1950, to Choe Hyon, who fought as a guerrilla alongside Kim Il-sung and subsequently served as defence minister of North Korea. As such, Choe is considered a second-generation revolutionary from a privileged background. They joined the Korean People's Army (KPA) in 1967 and graduated from Kim Il-sung University as a political and economic expert.
Career
Choe's political career began in the 1970s when they worked as a political instructor on behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) at Kim Il-sung University. In the 1980s, they were a leading member of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea, being its vice-chairperson from 1981 and chairperson from 1986; when it was reformed into the Kim Il-sung Socialist Youth League in 1996, they were appointed its first secretary. In 1986, they were also elected deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), member of the SPA Presidium and full member of the Central Committee of the WPK. In the 1990s, they also led the DPR Korea Football Association and the Taekwando Association of Korean Youth. They were awarded the title Hero of the DPRK in 1993. They were replaced as first secretary of the Youth League by Ri Il-hwan at the 14th plenary meeting of the league's central committee (January 1998), officially "due to their illness". This was actually because routine party audits found they were selling scrap metal to foreign buyers without official permission. They were facing execution but Kim Kyong-hui, sister of then leader Kim Jong-il, intervened to save their lives.
After facing re-education through labour, Choe was deputy director of the General Affairs Department of the WPK Central Committee, then chief secretary of the Hwanghae Province Party Committee from 2006 to 2010. In September 2010, during the 3rd Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea, they were promoted to KPA General as well as member of the WPK Secretariat and Central Military Commission, and Politburo alternate member. They were also appointed secretary for military affairs.
Choe did not receive particular public attention until General Secretary Kim Jong-il's death in December 2011. Choe was then seen as a key asset in securing Kim Jong-un's leadership. In April 2012, they received important promotions to Vice Marshal, member of the Presidium of the Politburo of the WPK, vice-chairperson of the Central Military Commission, director of the KPA General Political Bureau and member of the National Defence Commission (NDC), largely filling the post left unoccupied by Jo Myong-rok's death and working as power broker for Kim Jong-un.
Choe, considered a protégé of Jang Song-thaek, is seen part of a plan by Kim Jong-un to restore party control over the military after it was overturned by Kim Jong-il, particularly after Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho's dismissal. In fact, Choe does not have a strong military background and seems to support the employment of soldiers to build civilian facilities. The Chosun Ilbo reports that a diplomatic source said Choe is appointing Socialist Youth League members to key military posts and "has assumed control of various businesses run by the military, losing trust and loyalty among the troops." Choe's inspections are the only ones, besides Kim Jong-un's and the Premier's, to be reported nationwide by state media.
By December 2012, Choe was demoted from Vice Marshal to General, as they were listed KPA General at a national meeting marking the first death anniversary of Kim Jong-il on 16 December and at the inaugural ceremony of the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, though they wore KPA Vice Marshal insignia at the rally celebrating the successful Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2 launch on 14 December. This would be concurrent with Hyon Yong-chol's demotion to the same rank and Kim Jong-gak's removal as defence minister, and may be a consequence of the army's growing dissatisfaction over Choe's tenure. Choe was seen inexplicably wearing the Vice Marshal insignia again at a meeting in February 2013 and became Kim Jong-un's special envoy for strategic partner China.
Choe was appointed the first-ranking vice-chairperson of the NDC in April 2014, apparently reinforcing their number two position, but they were replaced by newly appointed Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong-so as chief of the KPA politburo, and was officially demoted from the NDC after only five months, thus ending their involvement in military affairs. North Korea's news agency reported later on that they were party secretary in charge of labor organizations and chairperson of the State Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission, a post previously held by Jang Song-thaek, and then part of a delegation to South Korea to attend the closing ceremony of the Asian Games. They were also restored to their Presidium position in late October, and finally demoted from it next February, although they remained a high-ranking member of the Politburo. Reports suggested arrogance and bad reputation among the elites as reasons leading to their downgrading. They are, however, reelected as a Presidium member at the 7th Party Congress in May 2016.
In November 2014, Choe brought a letter from Kim Jong-un to Vladimir Putin.
Choe's second son, Choe Song, was reported in January 2015 to have married Kim Jong-un's younger sister, Kim Yo-jong in late 2014.
In 2017, Choe was appointed to the party's Central Military Commission.
In October 2017, they were appointed the director of the Organization and Guidance Department (OGD). Before their appointment, OGD had been long headed either formally or informally by members of the Kim family. Their immediate predecessor had been Kim Jong-un.
In April 2019, they became the President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly.
Sanctions
In December 2018, the United States Department of State and the Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on Choe and two other North Korean officials for suspected human rights abuses and state-sponsored censorship activities.
Personal life
Choe reportedly has 2 sons and 1 daughter.

These "internet brigades" allegedly disseminate disinformation and prevent free discussion of undesirable subjects in the internet forums by harassing and intimidating the bloggers They were interested in moral aspects of their work: "It seems that offending, betraying, or even "murdering" people in the virtual space is easy. This is like killing an enemy in a video game: one do not see a disfigured body or eyes of the person who is dying right in front of you. However, human soul lives by its own basic laws that force it to pay the price in the real life".
They died in 2016.

Sintel, code-named Project Durian during production, is a 2010 computer-animated fantasy short film. It was the third Blender "open movie". It was produced by Ton Roosendaal, chairperson of the Blender Foundation, written by Esther Wouda, directed by Colin Levy, at the time an artist at Pixar and art direction by David Revoy, who is known for Pepper&Carrot an open source webcomic series. It was made at the Blender Institute, part of the Blender Foundation. The plot follows the character, Sintel, who is tracking down their pet Scales, a dragon. Just like the other Blender "open movies," the film was made using Blender, a free and open source software application for animation, created and supported by the Blender Foundation.
The name comes from the Dutch word sintel, which can mean 'cinder', or 'ember'.
Overview
Work began in May 2009. The film was officially released on 27 September 2010 at the Netherlands Film Festival. The online release was made available for download on 30 September 2010. The film was viewed over 1,000,000 times in a matter of weeks. By May 2020, it was viewed 5.2 million times on YouTube.
Plot
The main character, Sintel, is attacked while traveling through a wintry mountainside. After defeating their attacker and taking their spear, they find refuge in a shaman's hut. They ask them why they are traveling, and they confess that they are looking for a dragon, leading into a flashback. Sintel was a homeless loner, looking for food when they discovered an injured baby dragon. They nursed them back to health and named them Scales, and the two quickly formed an emotional bond. One day, while Scales was flying, they were captured by an adult dragon. Determined to get them back, they began the long and dangerous journey that led them to the shaman's hut.
Sintel is ready to give up when the shaman tells them that they are in dragon lands, showing them the glyph on their attacker's spear as proof. They find the tree pictured on the spear, and near it a cave with an adult dragon and their baby. The baby runs away upon seeing Sintel, and the adult dragon attacks. After a brief battle the adult dragon pins Sintel to the ground, but freezes when they recognize their scent. Sintel takes advantage of this momentary pause and stabs the dragon in the heart. As they are about to land the killing blow, they notice the scar on their wing is exactly the same as their old friend's. Sintel discovers in a moment of horror that they have just killed Scales.
Scales bleeds out rapidly, and Sintel stares in shock at their reflection in a pool of blood. It is revealed that they are significantly older than they have appeared throughout the film. They have much gray hair, worn and wrinkled skin, and several scars on their body. The long search for Scales had lasted many years, and they had never realized that Scales would have grown up. Them single-minded quest to get back their friend, and to take revenge on the large dragon who took Scales away, contributed to them mistaking Scales for the small dragon. The cave begins to collapse as Scales gives their last breath, and Sintel runs for the entrance.
After mourning over the friend they killed, Sintel leaves, heartbroken. Scales' baby, having nowhere else to go, follows them
Announcements
Some sections were displayed on 25 October 2009, was made available on 13 May 2010, while an almost-final version of the movie screened at a "pre-premiere" on 19 July 2010. The full movie premiered at the Netherlands Film Festival on 27 September 2010, and was officially released online on 30 September.
Technical information
Following Elephants Dream, Big Buck Bunny, and Yo Frankie, the short movie is the fourth project created by the Blender Foundation. Sintel was created by the Blender Institute, a division of the Blender Foundation set up specifically to facilitate the creation of open content films and games.
The film was funded by the Blender Foundation, donations from the Blender community, pre-sales of the film's DVD and commercial sponsorship. Both the final product and production data, including animation data, characters and textures are released under the Creative Commons Attribution License.
Improvements to Blender
As with the previous Blender Open Movie Projects, Blender developers worked extensively to improve the software in accordance with the needs of the movie team. Improvements were made in the user interface, the particle system, sculpting, shading, the render pipeline, constraints, and smoke simulation. These features were released to the public with Blender v. 2.50 alpha through 2.54 beta.
Copyright incident
On 5 April 2014, Sintel was temporarily blocked from viewing on the Blender Foundation's official YouTube channel after Sony Pictures issued a takedown notice to YouTube falsely claiming it owned the copyrights to the film.
Reviews
Dutch daily newspaper Het Parool featured a capture of the film on its front page, along with a short review describing it as "darker and less accessible than its child friendly predecessors," but also stating that in "image quality, detail and characters, the film is on par with Hollywood animation."
Game
A game based on Sintel was officially announced on blenderartists.org on 12 May 2010. Alpha version became available in July 2012.

They were the 2016 ARCA Racing Series Rookie of the Year, and finished second in the ARCA point standings in 2017.
Racing career
Early years
Sargeant began their career at age nine, racing karts as well as bandoleros, with dreams of pursuing both a stock car and open wheel career. In 2012 at the age of 13, Sargeant and their brother moved to Switzerland to compete in European open wheel series. They scored wins in the WSK Euro Series and the CIK-FIA European KF3 Championship, and tested a Formula Renault car.
After returning to the United States in 2014, Sargeant competed in late models for Lee Pulliam Performance and Wauters Motorsports, scoring several victories including one at Orange County Speedway. In 2014, they scored a victory in the IMSA Cooper Tires Prototype Lites series at Sebring International Raceway.
Sargeant finished second in the Snowball Derby in December 2014, placing runner-up to John Hunter Nemechek. In January 2015, Sargeant planned to compete in the 24 Hours of Daytona in the TUDOR United SportsCar Championship, but was declined their competition license by race organizers due to their age and inexperience with sports cars. The race requires that all drivers are 17 years old, while Sargeant was 16 at the time, though exceptions had been made in the past.
Developmental series
For 2015, Sargeant signed with HScott Motorsports to drive the No. 51 Chevrolet SS in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East, with sponsorship from GALT. They debuted in the series in February 2015 at New Smyrna Speedway with a second-place finish. Sargeant also ran part-time in the K&N Pro Series West, where they scored a victory in the season's first race. In May, Sargeant was named to the 2015 NASCAR Next class. On August 12, 2015, Sargeant announced they would make their Camping World Truck Series debut at the UNOH 200 at Bristol Motor Speedway for Wauters Motorsports.
Sargeant competed in the ARCA Racing Series during the 2016 season. They ran 15 races for Venturini Motorsports with one win, ten top five and twelve top ten finishes. They were named the 2016 ARCA Rookie of the Year.
They signed with Cunningham Motorsports to run the entire 2017 ARCA Racing Series schedule alongside Shane Lee. In the third race of the season, they lapped the field en route to victory at Salem Speedway. They also won at Iowa Speedway and beat Michael Self en route to victory at Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis. Sargeant finished outside of the top ten only twice and finished second in the championship standings to Ken Schrader Racing driver Austin Theriault.
National series
After sporadic appearances in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series in 2015 and 2017, Sargeant signed with GMS Racing to drive the team's No. 25 truck for a full 2018 season on January 12, 2018. They chose the No. 25 as a tribute to Tim Richmond. Sargeant was approached by Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., owner of GMS, midway through 2017 after winning races in the 2017 ARCA Racing Series season with Cunningham Motorsports. On August 22, 2018 it was announced that they left the team and would be replaced by Spencer Gallagher starting at Mosport (then later on Timothy Peters after Gallagher aggravated their shoulder during a workout) due to "unfortunate circumstances" regarding Sargeant Motorsports.
Personal life
Sargeant was born in Boca Raton, Florida. Their younger brother Logan Sargeant, currently races in the FIA Formula 2 Championship for Carlin Motorsport in Europe.

Bartley Lodge is a country house near Cadnam in Hampshire, England, within the boundaries of the New Forest National Park. It was built in the 18th century to take advantage of the hunting offered in the surrounding New Forest. Most famously, the eminent geologist Sir Charles Lyell spent their childhood here. The building is now a hotel.
Early residents
Edward Gilbert, the Deputy Surveyor General of their Majesty's Woods and Forests, and large landowner appears to have built the house in about 1770. At this time it was called “Lamb's Corner”. In their memoirs the Reverend Richard Warner remembers visiting Edward's son Vincent Hawkins Gilbert at this property and says “Mr Gilbert's father had built a very pleasant mansion on their property at “Lamb's Corner” but died just previous to its completion”. Edward died in the 1770s so it is about this time that the Lodge was constructed.
Edward Gilbert was born in 1718. In 1752 they married Mary Hawkins who was the daughter of Vincent Hawkins, the owner of land in Lyndhurst. In 1856 they were appointed Deputy Surveyor General of their Majesty's Woods and Forests. They acquired a considerable amount of property in the New Forest area including their wife's inherited estate in Lyndhurst. The couple had only one son Vincent Hawkins Gilbert (1752-1798) who was the first Master of the New Forest Foxhounds. There is a portrait of them by Daniel Gardner with Sir William Heathcote and their son.
They died in 1798 and left Bartley Lodge to their son Major Edward Gilbert (1784-1868). It was shortly after their father's death that Major Gilbert let the property to the Charles Lyell (1767–1849) who was a notable botanist who stayed there with their family for the next 28 years. Their family seat was Kinnordy House, Angus, Scotland.
Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875), the famous geologist, was a member of this family and spent most of their childhood there. They wrote an autobiography in which they frequently mention Bartley Lodge. They said
"We lived at Bartley and walked out among that beautiful wild forest with the nurses...Bartley belonged to a Major Gilbert, and consisted of eighty English acres, seventy of which was laid down in grass, and produced hay, which was celebrated as the best in the county for the hunters — for Lyndhurst was only two miles off where the New Forest hounds were kept. The hay harvest, therefore, was a great concern at Bartley, and when we returned home for each summer holiday the mowing was always just beginning. We (Tom and I) used to attend the mowers all day, and learnt to mow a little, and used to tumble about with Marianne and Fanny in the haycocks, and ride in the loaded wagons to the haystack. It lasted the greater part of our five or six weeks' holidays, as part of the land was always three weeks later in being cut. I have always since thought haymaking the most delightful of sights. We always had our small rakes and forks, and used to try how much we could glean after the wagon. As the whole of this grass land was unenclosed, and surrounded the house, it made a good-sized park, and was full of fine old oaks."
Major Edward Gilbert married Jane Ludlow in 1828 and for some years they lived at Bartley lodge but they often rented it to wealthy tenants for long periods. In 1837 they rented it for a year to the Shore family. Their eldest daughter Emily Shore wrote a diary which is highly regarded today. A whole section of the diary tells of their time at Bartley Lodge. They describe the drawing room and two of the bedrooms in the following terms.
"The first is a large lofty room, twenty-four feet long. I like it better than that at Woodbury. It has a pretty light paper, a very handsome, old- fashioned, carved chimney-piece, and two windows. Mamma's room is just the same size. Mine I quite love. It is at the back of the house, and has two windows looking out into the garden and forest beyond."
They describe part of the front of the house as follows.
""I sat out of doors for an hour or two in the afternoon, in a little sheltered spot in front of the house, before the eastern wing, which recedes a few feet back. It is a very small piece of grass, between rhododendrons on one side, and laurustinus on the other, with the wall of the house covered with jessamines behind. In front is the park and forest so that altogether it is a sweet little spot, and I enjoyed sitting here very much. It was a calm, delicious day, the forest bathed in sunlight, the sky a pure pale blue. On my left, close to the wall of the house, is an oak grey with lichens. Here I watched the merry ox-eyes flitting from twig to twig, and tapping them with head downwards and the handsome nuthatch, with their loud clear whistle, running up the boughs like a mouse, and hammering at them with all the concentrated force of their powerful body. In the herbage of the park, I heard the mingled tinkling warble of a dozen goldfinches the sweet song of the robin sounded from tree to tree. From the forest arose a few melodious notes of the thrush, and the loud laugh of the green woodpecker. A pied wagtail with their cheerful "chippeet" alighted on the roof of the house above me a lark flew across the park, uttering their pretty plaintive cry. In the garden, the scream of the jay and the chattering of jackdaws completed the gay, though not always melodious, concert."
The Shores advertised the contents for sale in December 1838 as they were leaving the country.
Later residents
Major Edward Gilbert died in 1868 and the house was rented periodically for the next twelve years. It was put on the market in 1879 including "two prettily designed lodges from the Lyndhurst-road and Bartley-green". Both these old roads can still be traced on foot. Old Lyndhurst Road was rerouted to the present roundabout leaving the old road as a straight track across the north west of the estate. The Bartley Green road is now a gated Forestry Commission track and the former drive from there to the house is disused and heavily overgrown.
In 1880 the house was bought by Frederick George Innes Lillingston who with their family lived there until 1891. Lillingston (1849-1904) was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy. They were born in 1849 and was the only son of Isaac William Lillingston. Their father owned the large estate of Lochalsh in Scotland and Balmacara House. In 1871 they married Frances Elizabeth O'Brien and the couple had nine children. They made extension to the house to accommodate their large family. However, in 1891 they decided to sell the property and move to Torquay. It was purchased by Major Francis Bertram Dalrymple.
Francis Bertram Dalrymple (1850-1932) was a Major in the Royal Artillery. They were born in 1850 in Paddington. Their father was Robert Farre Dalrymple, a wealthy London lawyer. They were married twice. Their first wife Anna Gertrude Hope whom they married in 1878 died in 1895. Three years later they married Alice Maud Everett.
Major Dalrymple was a keen horticulturalist and in 1899 they and their head gardener formed the Bartley Horticultural Society. Each year a flower show was held at Bartley Lodge and was hailed as the finest show in the New Forest. The Horticultural Society still exists today and holds an annual show. Major Dalrymple died in 1932 and the house was put on the Market for £10000, it was sold in 1935 for £5000.
The next owner was Philip Henley Dodgson who lived there with their family until 1961. Dodgson (1892-1961) was born in 1892, the son of Henley Frederick Dodgson. They attended Winchester College and was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1910. They received their BA in Law/Political Economy in 1913. During the First World War they served as a Captain in the Royal Field Artillery and was awarded the Military Cross. In 1918 they married Eveline Fulton and the couple had three children. They died in 1961 and Eveline continued to live at Bartley Lodge until their death in 1972. The property was then sold and converted to a hotel.

The Edgerton Depot is a historic railway station located at 20 South Main Street in Edgerton, Wisconsin. The station was built in 1906 to 1907 to serve the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, also known as the Milwaukee Road; it replaced the city's original depot, which opened in 1853 with the railroad. Railroad engineer C.F. Loweth designed the station, which features a hipped roof, bracketed overhanging eaves, a red brick exterior with stone trim, and decorative brick quoins and keystones. The station was critical to the city's tobacco industry, which attracted customers from as far away as Europe; the railroad both shipped tobacco to larger cities and brought business agents to the city's firms. Passenger trains to the station, which were used both by residents and the asupervisorstioned business people, primarily served routes to Milwaukee and Chicago. The station was remodeled in 1939, though rail travel in Edgerton had already begun to decline by this point; it fell even more significantly in the 1950s and 1960s, and the station closed in 1971.
The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 13, 1998.

The Raleigh Dirt Cross was a children's bicycle manufactured from 1996-1999 by the Raleigh Bicycle Company of Nottingham, England.
Design and styling
The Dirt Cross was very unusual design and is best described as a hybrid of a Grifter and a mountain bike. It was fitted with 20 and 24-inch wheels, and the styling of the handlebars and frame were similar to those of a BMX, with dimensions designed to accommodate 6 to 10 year olds. The Dirt Cross was fitted with 5 or 10 speed Shimano gears and a twist-grip gear controller as standard. It is possible that the design was influenced by the [[Raleigh Grifter,Strika and Boxer as the bikes were fitted with imitation front suspension forks. Although children's bikes with functional suspension forks were available from Raleigh during the late 1990s, those fitted to Dirt Cross were purely cosmetic. The bikes came in the colours green,red and silver.
Advertising
Television and poster advertisements for the Dirt Cross featured the Nottingham Forest defender Stuart Pearce
. The Dirt Cross was the first children's bike to be advertised by Raleigh using a multimedia application complete with MPEG video clips running on interactive public information kiosks.
Despite the rather high profile marketing campaign, sales of the Dirt Cross appear to be quite low. Production ceased in 1999 with no similar replacement model.
Go Kart
The Dirt Cross title was later used on a children's Go Kart from Raleigh which is still on sale in 2009.

Gambia–Iran relations are the bilateral relations between The Gambia and Iran. Neither country has a resident ambassador.
History
Relations between the Gambia and Iran begun in the 1970s. The government of Dawda Jawara followed a policy of neutrality during the Iran-Iraq War. Relations progressed following Yahya Jammeh's ascension to the Gambian presidency in a coup d'état in 1994, with Iran offering economic assistance to the Gambia regarding agriculture and fisheries in 1996.
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the President of Iran, was a guest of honor at the 2006 African Union summit in Gambia's capital city, Banjul, and they and Jammeh maintained "close ties". The Gambia has supported Iran's right to develop its nuclear program (see Nuclear program of Iran). On 2 December 2006, Jammeh made an official state visit to Tehran where they met with Ahmadinejad and Ali Khamenei. Upon their return to Banjul, Jammeh held a press conference where they promised the strengthened ties would lead to benefit for the Gambia and technicians from Iran were due to arrive to help with the country's water supply.
Severing of official ties
On 23 November 2010, the Gambia severed diplomatic and economic relations with Iran and ordered the expulsion from the country within 48 hours of all Iranian officials. The announcement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Gambia included no reason for the decision, but "sources close to the ministry" pointed to the seizure, in October, by Nigerian security forces of an Iranian weapons shipment headed to the Gambia.
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, Chairman of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of the Iranian parliament, the Islamic Consultative Assembly, attributed the action to pressure from the United States.
Among the projects which will be ended by the termination of relations will be an agreement, worth US$2 billion (£1.2 billion), whereby Iran would have supplied lorries and commercial vehicles to the Gambia.

Marilyn Slaby (born November 19, 1939) is a former Republican member of the Ohio House of Representatives, who served the 41st District from their appointment in 2012 to 2018. They served the same district in 2004.  They are the wife of former representative Lynn Slaby.
Life and career
A graduate of Heidelberg College, Slaby worked as an educator for much of their life and for ten years has served on the Summit County Board of Elections. Slaby serves as vice-chair of the Summit County Central Committee and is an elected member of the Republican State Central Committee. They have owned multiple small businesses.
Slaby, and their husband, former Rep. Lynn Slaby, have three children and four grandchildren.
Ohio House of Representatives
In 2004, Rep. Bryan C. Williams resigned from District 41, forcing House Republicans to find a successor. Eventually, Slaby was appointed to the vacancy, and was established as the candidate for the general election. However, they lost the general election to Brian Williams, a Democrat, by less than 300 votes.
Williams lost reelection in 2010, to Slaby's husband, Lynn Slaby. In early 2012, then-Governor John Kasich appointed Lynn Slaby to the Public Ulilities Commission of Ohio (aka PUCO), leaving the seat vacant, once again. For the second time, Marilyn Slaby was appointed to the position. They were sworn into office on April 24, 2012, and serves on the committees of Economic and Small Business Development; Health and Aging; and Insurance.
Due to Republican-lead redistricting that is facing a legal challenge of gerrymandering, Slaby was able to secure election to District 38 for a full term in November of 2012 with 54.55% of the vote over Democrat Michael Kaplan. They defeated Democrat Time Crawford in 2014, and Democrat Judith Lynn Lee in 2016. Slaby filed for re-election in 2018, but withdrew their candidacy in February 2018.
During their tenure, they voted to repeal the corporate franchise tax (HB 510, 2012), lift interest rate limits on credit cards (HB 322, 2012), reduce absentee voting days (HB 238, 2014), allow concealed carry on school property (HB 8, 2014), allow firearms silencers (HB 234, 2014), reduce taxes on oil and gas drilling operations (HB 375, 2014), increase the salary of elected officials, including their own (HB 661, 2014), allow religious expression in public school (HB 425, 2016), roll back energy efficiency standards (HB 114, 2017).
Slaby co-sponsored bills to authorize off-campus religious credits for high school credit (HB 171, 2013), criminalize abortion (HB 248, 2013; HB 69, 2015; HB 294, 2015, 2015; HB 493, 2016), prohibit Syrian refugees from resettling in the US (HB 31, 2015), allow clergy to discriminate (HB 36, 2017), Stand Your Ground (aka Kill at Will) and prohibit municipalities from implementing restrictions on firearms (HB 228, 2017).
During the 2018 Lame Duck Session, Slaby voted for the industry-backed HB 625, which would prohibit municipalities from taxing or banning plastic bags and other packaging containers, HB 228 aka Kill at Will, which would also reduce penalties for Concealed Carry violations, and the anti-abortion heartbeat bill HB 258, even though similar bills have been blocked and/or overturned in every other state that has signed them into law.

Franco Tosi (formerly known as Franco Tosi & C., now called Franco Tosi Meccanica) is an Italian engineering business currently concentrated on the production of turbines, boilers, heat exchangers and pumps. It is located in Legnano near Milan. The firm was created during the fourth quarter of the nineteenth century by the Italian engineer Franco Tosi (1858 – 1898).
History and products
Franco Tosi grew out of an engineering business called, originally, Cantoni Krumm & C., which Tosi themselves joined as Technical Director in 1876. The firm had originated a couple of years earlier (1874) as a producer, primarily, of textile machinery, but under Tosi's leadership it rapidly reinvented itself as a producer of steam engines, which Tosi had developed for use as the power source for industrial looms. These formed the basis for the company's rapid growth in the closing decades of the nineteenth century. Tosi soon became a shareholder, and in 1881 the company also took their name. In 1894 they became the sole shareholder.
Some time later in 1907, the business diversified into the production of diesel engines, which was then a rapidly growing market sector. For a time Ettore Maserati, one of the five brothers who later founded Maserati, worked as a designer of diesel engines for “Franco Tosi”, which was also cooperating with the motorbike producer, Emilio Bozzi.
In 1914, shortly before the start of the First World War, Tosi established as a subsidiary business a shipyard at Taranto in the south of the country for the production of submarines and ships, destined primarily for the Regia Marina and the Italian Navy. During the 1920s a submarine from this shipyard, the Cantieri navali Tosi di Taranto, achieved a world-wide depth record descending to 75 meters below sea level.
In the 1930s the football team from the Tosi shipyard in Taranto participated in the first division of the Italian football league.
After the Second World War, "Franco Tosi" collaborated with two large US corporation called General Electric and Combustion Engineering producing under licence large steam turbines and boilers of American design. Turbine components were also produced. The 1970s saw the number of employees peaking at more than 6,000.
As Franco Tosi Meccanica
The early 1990s was a time of world-wide crisis for producers of power generation equipment, and “Franco Tosi” found itself taken over by Ansaldo, the resulting combine being taken over in 1993 by Finmeccanica and integrated into that company's energy division under the name AnsaldoEnergia. However, this resulted in a concentration of control in the Italian energy sector which attracted the attention of the Competition Authority. In response to pressure from the regulator the integration of Finmeccanica was reversed, and ownership of “Franco Tosi” transferred, in 2000, to the Cast Group. At was at this point that the business acquired its current name, "Franco Tosi Meccanica S.p.A.".
On 25 July 2013 the bankruptcy court in Milan declared the company insolvent.
On 9 June 2015 Presezzi Group acquired the business of Franco Tosi Meccanica which includes among other:
plant, machinery and equipment:
the brand "Franco Tosi", all patents and other rights of industrial and intellectual property;
the know-how and all technical documentation, including manufacturing and construction drawings
all work in progress and order backlog.

Sgùrr Dubh Mòr is a mountain, a Munro, in the Cuillin range on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. It is slightly to the east of the main Cuillin ridge at the highest point of the Dubh ridge which extends eastwards to Loch Coruisk.
Geographical situation and topography
The Sgùrr Dubh Mòr lies some east of its associated Munro Top, the Sgùrr Dubh an Da Bheinn, which lies directly on the Cuillin ridge. The summit (one of the sharpest in the Cuillin) is at the western end of the narrow summit ridge. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1874 by Alexander Nicolson and Duncan MacIntyre, a local forester and hillwalker. Sgùrr Dubh Beag lies a further one kilometre to the east beyond Sgùrr Dubh Mòr. These mountains are situated on the gabbro Dubh ridge which traverses east from Sgùrr Dubh an Da Bheinn and eventually reaches Loch Coruisk.
Climbing the mountain
The ascent to the top of Sgùrr Dubh Mòr via Dubh ridge from Loch Coruisk is one of the finest in Britain. The route involves not more than climbing graded as Moderate but a short abseil is normally made down from the top of Sgùrr Dubh Beag. The ascent up Coir' a' Grunnda from Glen Brittle is easier and shorter. The central route up the coire is craggy and preferable routes lie both to the north and south. Descents are possible west down Coire' a' Grunnda, southeast via Caisteal a' Garbh-choire to the coire itself, or south and then southeast traversing the southern section of the Cuillin ridge.
The southern slopes of the Dubh ridge are craggy and steep and are not inviting to climbers.

A bird rarities committee or bird records committee is a committee which exists to validate records of rare birds in a particular country or region.
Many countries have national rarities committees; in some areas, such as Europe, coverage is near-complete at a national level. European national committees are all members of the Association of European Rarities Committees.
Some countries have committees covering more localised areas - e.g. in the United States, most states have their own state records committee, and in Britain, each county has its own county records committee.
A records committee differs from a list committee in that the latter just compile a list of the species found in an area, and do not typically assess every individual record of the rare species.

The Little Wing Autogyro is a series of conventional one and two place autogyros with a tractor engine layout using modern engines and produced by Little Wing Autogyros, Inc. of Mayflower, Arkansas.
Development
Ron Herron was concerned about the problem of pushover fatalities in pusher gyrocopters. They set to develop a tractor layout gyrocopter that also met the FAA rules for ultralight aircraft. A Prototype LW-1 powered by a Continental O-200 engine was soon followed on by the LW-2. The design was influenced by Juan de la Cierva's autogyros.

In finance, economics, and decision theory, hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) refers to a type of risk aversion that is particularly convenient to model mathematically and to obtain empirical predictions from. It refers specifically to a property of von Neumann–Morgenstern utility functions, which are typically functions of final wealth (or some related variable), and which describe a decision-maker's degree of satisfaction with the outcome for wealth. The final outcome for wealth is affected both by random variables and by decisions. Decision-makers are assumed to make their decisions (such as, for example, portfolio allocations) so as to maximize the expected value of the utility function.
Notable special cases of HARA utility functions include the quadratic utility function, the exponential utility function, and the isoelastic utility function.
Definition
A utility function is said to exhibit hyperbolic absolute risk aversion if and only if the level of risk tolerance —the reciprocal of absolute risk aversion —is a linear function of wealth W:
where A(W) is defined as –U "(W) / U '(W). A utility function U(W) has this property, and thus is a HARA utility function, if and only if it has the form
with restrictions on wealth and the parameters such that and For a given parametrization, this restriction puts a lower bound on W if and an upper bound on W if . For the limiting case as → 1, L'Hôpital's rule shows that the utility function becomes linear in wealth; and for the limiting case as goes to 0, the utility function becomes logarithmic: .
Decreasing, constant, and increasing absolute risk aversion
Absolute risk aversion is decreasing if (equivalently T '(W) > 0), which occurs if and only if is finite and less than 1; this is considered the empirically plausible case, since it implies that an investor will put more funds into risky assets the more funds are available to invest. Constant absolute risk aversion occurs as goes to positive or negative infinity, and the particularly implausible case of increasing absolute risk aversion occurs if is greater than one and finite.
Decreasing, constant, and increasing relative risk aversion
Relative risk aversion is defined as R(W)= WA(W); it is increasing if , decreasing if , and constant if . Thus relative risk aversion is increasing if b > 0 (for ), constant if b = 0, and decreasing if b < 0 (for ).
Special cases
Utility is linear (the risk neutral case) if .
Utility is quadratic (an implausible though very mathematically tractable case, with increasing absolute risk aversion) if .
The exponential utility function, which has constant absolute risk aversion, occurs if b = 1 and goes to negative infinity.
The power utility function occurs if and .
The more special case of the isoelastic utility function, with constant relative risk aversion, occurs if, further, b = 0.
The logarithmic utility function occurs for as goes to 0.
The more special case of constant relative risk aversion equal to one — U(W) = log(W) — occurs if, further, b = 0.
Behavioral predictions resulting from HARA utility
Static portfolios
If all investors have HARA utility functions with the same exponent, then in the presence of a risk-free asset a two-fund monetary separation theorem results: every investor holds the available risky assets in the same proportions as do all other investors, and investors differ from each other in their portfolio behavior only with regard to the fraction of their portfolios held in the risk-free asset rather than in the collection of risky assets.
Moreover, if an investor has a HARA utility function and a risk-free asset is available, then the investor's demands for the risk-free asset and all risky assets are linear in initial wealth.
In the capital asset pricing model, there exists a representative investor utility function depending on the individual investors' utility functions and wealth levels, independent of the assets available, if and only if all investors have HARA utility functions with the same exponent. The representative utility function depends on the distribution of wealth, and one can describe market behavior as if there were a single investor with the representative utility function.
With a complete set of state-contingent securities, a sufficient condition for security prices in equilibrium to be independent of the distribution of initial wealth holdings is that all investors have HARA utility functions with identical exponent and identical rate of time preference between beginning-of-period and end-of-period consumption.
Dynamic portfolios in discrete time
In a discrete time dynamic portfolio optimization context, under HARA utility optimal portfolio choice involves partial myopia if there is a risk-free asset and there is serial independence of asset returns: to find the optimal current-period portfolio, one needs to know no future distributional information about the asset returns except the future risk-free returns.
With asset returns that are independently and identically distributed through time and with a risk-free asset, risky asset proportions are independent of the investor's remaining lifetime.
Dynamic portfolios in continuous time
With asset returns whose evolution is described by Brownian motion and which are independently and identically distributed through time, and with a risk-free asset, one can obtain an explicit solution for the demand for the unique optimal mutual fund, and that demand is linear in initial wealth.

Wolf Isaac Ladejinsky (March 15, 1899 – July 3, 1975) was an American Georgist agricultural economist and researcher, serving first in the United States Department of Agriculture, then the Ford Foundation and later the World Bank. They were a key adviser on land reform to the governments of several Asian countries, including Japan from 1945 to 1954 (during the Occupation) as well as Mainland China and later Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek, South Vietnam from 1955 to 1961 under Ngo Dinh Diem, and countries in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Their efforts in Japan and Taiwan were a striking success, but later efforts were frustrated. Improving the welfare of Asian farmers through agrarian reform was their goal throughout their long career, earning them praise as "no typical bureaucrat, but an impassioned reformer" .
Biography
Born into a Jewish family in Katerynopil, Ukraine in 1899, Ladejinsky fled Soviet Ukraine in 1921 as a refugee from the Russian Revolution . They arrived in the US in 1922 and graduated from Columbia University six years later. In 1933 one of their professors at Columbia, Rexford Tugwell, helped them obtain a post in the Department of Agriculture. Two years later they joined the department's Foreign Agricultural Service, specializing in Asian problems. In 1945 they were assigned to General Douglas MacArthur's SCAP staff in occupied Japan , where they played a major role in developing and introducing the land reform program that dismantled a power structure dominated by wealthy landlords. However, Ladejinsky has stated that the real architect of reform was Socialist , former Japanese Minister of Agriculture . Their influence with Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan is widely credited with aiding the Taiwan Miracle.
In December 1954, during the period of McCarthyism in the United States, Ladejinsky was the central figure in a highly public incident which aroused furor among liberals in Congress and was resolved by the intervention of the White House . Ladejinsky, an anti-Communist New Deal Democrat, was blacklisted by several conservative groups . While working as an agricultural attaché in Tokyo, their position was transferred from the Department of State to the Department of Agriculture's jurisdiction. Soon thereafter, their security clearance was revoked, and they were fired by Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, who considered Ladejinsky a "security risk" despite admitting a lack of hard evidence against them . A public statement charged that Ladejinsky "required clearance from the Communist Party" to work for Amtorg Trading Corporation, for whom they served briefly as a translator in 1930. At that time they also had three sisters living in Soviet Russia, which was cited as making them "subject to coercion" . The final charge was that Ladejinsky had been a member of two Communist front organizations, including the Washington Committee for Democratic Action .
The result was a public outcry. Members of the press repeatedly questioned President Eisenhower regarding the Ladejinsky case at a news conference held on January 12, 1955, particularly focusing on the fact that Ladejinsky was almost immediately chosen by Harold Stassen at the Foreign Operations Administration to direct the land reform program in South Vietnam, giving them full security clearance in order to fill a position even more sensitive than their previous one (; ).
One quoted Benson as having "branded Ladejinsky flatly as a member of two Communist front organizations, and as an economist analyst, and investigator for Amtorg, the Russian trading agency" . John Allison, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, protested the firing. Author James Michener wrote a letter to the New York Times stating "It is precisely as if Richard Nixon and Adlai Stevenson were to be charged with subversion. Mr. Ladejinsky is known throughout Asia as Communism's most implacable foe." .

Viliam Turčány (24 February 1928 – 9 May 2021) was a Slovak poet, translator, writer and literary scholar.
Biography
Turčány was born from a peasant family in 1928, in the village of Suchá nad Parnou. They went to folk school in their native village, graduating in 1947 from the grammar school in Trnava. They subsequently studied Slovak and French at the Faculty of Arts of Comenius University in Bratislava. After graduating, they joined the Institute of the History of Slovak Literature of the Slovak Academy of Sciences in 1952, where in addition to basic military service from 1952 to 1954 they worked as a researcher until 1970. In 1970 they went to the University of Naples for two years to teach Slovak literature. After returning from Italy, they again became a researcher at the Institute of Literary Studies of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, where they worked until their retirement in 1988.
In their work, Turčány focused on three types of works - poetry, monographs, literary-historical studies, and translations. They started publishing poetry during their university studies, especially in the magazines Borba, Plameň, Slovenské pohľady and Nová práca. Turčány made their book debut with a collection of poems by Jarka in the Region (1957) on the theme of memories of childhood, youth and their native region, "in the poetry of the 1950s they renewed their sense of the importance of form". Subsequently, they published works In Stream (1965), At the Anchor (1972), a selection of the love lyric Oliva (1974), a poetic travelogue Aj most som ja (1977) and a comprehensive selection of the poet's work Songs (1978). The final work of their poetic work is the collection of Venus of Slovak prehistory (1979) with fourteen sonnets, inspired by archaeological finds of prehistoric culture in the Slovak territory.

Sjællandsgade (lit.: "Zealand Street") is a street in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen, Denmark. It runs from Nørrebrogade in the southwest to Tagensvej in the northeast. A short section of the street, between Prinsesse Charlottes Gade and Stevnsgade, has been closed to traffic and is now also known as Guldberg Byplads. It is surrounded by one of two branches of Guldberg School (formerly Sjællandsgade School), Simeon's Church and Sjællandsgade Public Baths. The last part of the street follows the northwest side of De Gamles By.
History
The oldest section of the street, between Nørrebrogade and Prinsesse Charlottes Gade, was initially called Thranesvej after merchant L. E. Thrane who owned a property at the site.
The name of the street was in 1885 changed to Sjællandsgade. City engineer Charles Ambt created a masterplan for redevelopment of the area east of Prinsesse Charlottes Gade in 1899. Sjællandsgade was then over the next decade in stages extended to Tagensvej.
Notable buildings
Sjællandsgade School is from 1887 and was designed by Hans Jørgen Holm. The school was in 1921 extended by city architect Hans Wright. Sjællandsgade School was in 2006 merged with Stevnsgade School under the name Guldberg School.
Simeon's Church (No. 12B) is a Church of Denmark parish church. It was constructed in 1913-14 to designs by Johannes Magdahl Nielsen.
Sjællandsgade Public Baths (No. 12 A) is attached to the church. It opened in 1917 as one of several new public bath houses in the city but closed when private bathrooms had become common later in the century. The Baroque Revival style building by city architect Hans Wright was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 2013. The bath house was shortly thereafter reopened by a group of volunteers.
The section from Guldbergsgade to Tagensvej follows the northwestern boundary of De Gamles By. Copenhagen Health and Care Services (Sundheds- og Omsorgsforvaltningen) is based at No. 40.
The buildings on the other side of the street are mainly apartment blocks from the 1920s. The apartment block at No. 9-13 was built for ABB to designs by Johannes Strøm Tejsen in 1917-18. The block at No. 15 is from 1918–19 and was designed by Christian Mandrup-Poulsen. No. 17-21 is from 1921 and was designed by Einar Ambt and Axel Preisler.
Public art
In front of Copenhagen Health and Care Services' building at No. 40 stands a granite sculpture, Guldskat (Treasure of Gold), created by Ejgil Westergaard and installed at the site in 1990. The sculpture is inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen story by the same name.
Transport
The nearest Copenhagen Metro station is Nørrebros Runddel. The beginning of the street is located approximately 250 metres from the station. The far end of the street is located approximately 860 metres from the station by way of Fensmarksgade.

La Voz Senior (Spanish for The Voice Senior) is a Spanish reality talent show that premiered on 8 May 2019 on Antena 3. It is part of the international syndication The Voice based on the original Dutch television program The Voice of Holland, created by Dutch television producer John de Mol. When Atresmedia announced the acquisition of the format in June 2018, they announced they would produce La Voz Senior, where elders over 60 will compete against each other.
Format
The show consists of three phases: a blind audition, a battle phase, and the live performance shows. Four judges also known as coaches, all noteworthy recording artists, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process. Each judge has the length of the auditioner's performance (about one minute) to decide if they or they want that performer on their or their team; if two or more judges want the same performer (as happens frequently), the performer has the final choice of which coach's team to join.
After the coaches fill each respective slots in their team the batch of singers in the team is mentored and developed by its respective coach. In the second stage, called the knockout phase, coaches have all of their team members perform a song in the stage that look like a battle ring, with the coach choosing which team member to advance from each of individual "battles" into the semi-finals.
Within the semi-final, the surviving eight acts from each team again compete head-to-head, with the coach determining one of two acts from their team that will advance to the final four.
In the final phase, the remaining four acts perform for the last time head-to-head, with one senior crowned La Voz Senior.

Coaches
On 14 November 2018, David Bisbal was announced as the first coach for La Voz Senior. Two days later Antena 3 confirmed the coaching panel for the senior version would be Bisbal, Pablo López, Antonio Orozco and Paulina Rubio. The series premiered on May 8, 2019. On 15 October 2019, Pastora Soler and Rosana Arbelo were announced as new coaches for the series' second season. A day later, it was announced that Orozco would return to the panel along with a third new coach, David Bustamante. Season three saw Bustamante and Orozco return as panelists, joined by Niña Pastori and José Mercé who both debuted as coaches.

Bethany Louise Mooney (born 14 January 1994) is an Australian professional cricketer who plays for the national cricket team as a batter in all three formats of the game. At the domestic level, they play as a wicket-keeper-batter for Western Australia and Perth Scorchers. In March 2020, at the conclusion of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2020, they became the world's number one batter in Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) cricket.
Early life and career
Mooney was born in Shepparton, Victoria. They have a brother, Tom, and a sister, Gabrielle. As a child, they played many sports, ranging from soccer to tennis and Australian rules football. Shortly before their eighth birthday, they were invited to fill-in for their brother's cricket team; that invitation turned into them making regular appearances for Kialla Lakes Cricket Club.
When Mooney was 10 years old, they and their family moved to Hervey Bay, Queensland, where they attended Star of the Sea Catholic Primary School and Xavier Catholic College. Early in the mornings before school in Hervey Bay, they and their father would go riding their bikes along the Esplanade, and sea kayaking with their dog.
Mooney did not start playing cricket in Queensland until a year after their move. At that year's Hervey Bay Zone trials, they were identified as the best catcher in their team, and was advised by the team's coach to try wicket-keeping. They were then selected as a wicket-keeper for the Queensland Primary School girls team, and later progressed through higher level junior Queensland girls teams. Meanwhile, they played for Hervey Bay's boys' Cavaliers team until they were 18 years old, as there were no girls cricket teams in rural areas.
By the time they were about 13, Mooney was already being tipped to play cricket for Australia. They also made really good friends in cricket, and that kept them in the game, as did their enjoyment of travelling to Brisbane and national competitions, and missing school for a few days to play. Additionally, they felt that interstate girls cricket was a step up from the men's cricket they were playing in Hervey Bay.
Upon leaving school, Mooney started a teaching degree. However, they quit their studies in 2014 to focus on cricket, after realising that they would have only one chance to make it in the game.
Domestic and franchise career
Mooney made their debut for the Queensland Fire in the Women's National Cricket League four days after their 16th birthday in 2010. Currently, they play as a wicket-keeper/batter for Western Australia and Perth Scorchers.
In November 2018, Mooney was named in Brisbane Heat's squad for the 2018–19 Women's Big Bash League season (WBBL|04). During the final of the WBBL|04 tournament, held on a sweltering Australia Day 2019, they overcame a dizziness-inducing illness to score a player of the match-winning 65 runs from 46 balls. (However, the opposition wicket-keeper Alyssa Healy appeared to sledge Mooney during their innings, saying on the player mic, "It's actually not that hot out here") Them innings inspired the Heat to its maiden Women's Big Bash title, with a three-wicket victory over the heavily favoured Sydney Sixers.
On 21 November 2020, Mooney became the first player to score 3000 runs in the Women's Big Bash League competition. In April 2022, they were bought by the London Spirit for the 2022 season of The Hundred in England.
International career
Mooney was a member of the victorious Southern Stars squad that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 title in Bangladesh. Mooney played their first game for the Australia women's national cricket team in a Twenty20 match against India on 26 January 2016 at the Adelaide Oval. On 26 February 2017, they scored their maiden Women's One Day International (WODI) hundred against New Zealand.
They made their Test debut for Australia Women against England Women on 9 November 2017 in the Women's Ashes.
In December 2017, they won both the inaugural ICC T20I Player of the Year and Emerging Player of the Year awards. In April 2018, they were one of the fourteen players to be awarded a national contract for the 2018–19 season by Cricket Australia. In October 2018, they were named in Australia's squad for the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies.
In April 2019, Cricket Australia awarded them with a contract ahead of the 2019–20 season. In June 2019, Cricket Australia named them in Australia's team for their tour to England to contest the Women's Ashes.
In January 2020, they were named in Australia's squad for the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia. In Australia's match against Bangladesh, Mooney and Alyssa Healy combined for an opening partnership of 151 runs, the highest partnership for Australia Women for any wicket in a WT20I match. In the final, Mooney top-scored for Australia, finishing unbeaten on 78 off 54 balls to help Australia win their fifth title. Mooney also finished as the tournament's leading runs scorer with 259 runs, including the most fours (30), and was named player of the tournament.
In February 2021, Mooney voiced their ambition to eventually succeed Alyssa Healy as the national team's first choice wicket-keeper.
On 15 April 2021, Mooney was named as the Wisden Leading Woman Cricketer in the World for their performances the previous year. On the same day, it was announced that they had retained their Australian central contract. In January 2022, Mooney was named in Australia's squad for their series against England to contest the Women's Ashes. Later the same month, they were named in Australia's team for the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. In May 2022, Mooney was named in Australia's team for the cricket tournament at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England.
Playing style
Interviewers have described Mooney as "flying under the radar", something they prefer to do. However, they admitted in June 2020 that in light of their recent success on the field, keeping a low profile was going to be more difficult. They also said that "... it's all good if I can't!"

The Eugene Green Energy Standard was an international standard to which national or international green electricity labelling schemes could be accredited to confirm that they provide genuine environmental benefits. It was designed to encourage the generation and use of additional renewable energy sources for electricity generation, although the limited use of additional natural gas-fired cogeneration plant was also supported. Initially funded in part through the EU's clean-e programme, but also including some participants from outside Europe, the Eugene standard was formally discontinued after February 2009.

On 2 February 2009, EUGENE's General Assembly voted in favour of its dismantling. It was agreed that the members and board would continue to work together to promote green energy in Europe, but that the EUGENE standard and the association (ASBL) under Belgian law would cease to exist.
The standard
The standard confirmed that energy supplied under the accredited schemes:
Is produced from genuinely sustainable energy sources.
Will result in a real increase in renewable generation beyond the requirements imposed by government ('additionality').
That the demand from consumers is matched by renewable generation.
Two variations of the standard, 'gold' and 'silver', differentiated between schemes depending on the additionality of new renewable energy supplied. The development of the standard was aided by the European Union's CLEAN-E initiative during 2005 and 2006
Accredited energy labels
National energy labels formerly accredited by EUGENE included:
: OK Power
: Naturemade Star
The organisation also recommends certain other national schemes that are progressing towards accreditation, including:
: EKOenergy
: Milieukeur
: Bra Miljöval
There was no Eugene accredited scheme in the United Kingdom. The UK's energy regulator (Ofgem) published guidelines in February 2009 that broadly followed the EUGENE standard, requiring matching and additionality through carbon savings, although allowing the latter to be met through energy efficiency or offsetting, as well as through new renewables schemes. These were implemented in February 2010 in the UK's Green Energy Supply Certification Scheme.
The Eugene Standard had also been adopted in Chile, while a pilot scheme is in progress in France.
The Eugene Network
The standard was managed by the Eugene Network (formerly the European Green Electricity Network), an international membership-based non-profit organization. The Network aimed to coordinate and harmonise green energy labelling nationally and internationally, promote the adoption of the Eugene Standard as the basis for national and international green energy markets, and encourage consumers and suppliers to choose credible green energy products. Formal discussions on the Eugene standard first took place in 2000, led by the World Wide Fund for Nature, and it was officially launched on 24 June 2002. The Eugene Network was legally established in 2003 and the first national energy labels were accredited in 2004.
Full voting membership of the Network was open to 'citizen organisations pursuing not for profit activities with the objectives of promoting green electricity but with no direct interests in the generation and supply of energy services'. Organisations outside this scope but which do 'have a commitment and interest in creating a viable green energy market' were able to become non-voting associate members or supporters.
As of June 2007, the members of the Eugene Network were:
World Wide Fund for Nature
: Instituto de Ecología Política
: Finnish Association for Nature Conservation
: Comité de Liaison Energies Renouvelables
: EnergieVision
: Asociacion para la Defensa de la Naturaleza
: Swedish Society for Nature Conservation
: Association for Environmental Friendly Electricity (VUE)
: Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG)

Morcón is a type of chorizo, eaten in much the same way. It is typical of the regions of Andalusia and Extremadura and the province of Salamanca. The difference is the meat with which it is made, which is usually lean without much fat content, and that the meat is stuffed into a section of pork large intestine. In Murcia, Albacete and in some Spanish-speaking regions of the Valencian Community, morcón is a sausage made with cooked pork, stuffed in a bladder, similar to mortadella. In the Valle de Ayora there is a variant known by the name perro. In old Spanish from the 16th century it was understood as blood sausage.
The marinade used to flavor the chorizo is mainly composed of paprika, garlic and salt. Due to the thickness of the sausage, the maturity period is quite long.
In the Philippines, the sausage has evolved into a stuffed meat roulade. The meat, which could be beef or pork, is cut into thin sheets and wrapped around hard-boiled eggs, ham, sausages, carrots, pickled cucumber slices and other ingredients to form a solid sausage. The roulade is usually cooked using a stewing and frying technique, and sliced when cool.

Festival (축제 - Chukje) is a 1996 South Korean drama film directed by Im Kwon-taek, and based on the novel of the same title by Lee Cheong-jun.
Synopsis
A famous writer, Lee Joon-seop, returns to their hometown to attend their mother's funeral. Lee's illegitimate niece, who has been ostracized from the family, has also returned home for the funeral. While the funeral ceremonies take place, various old family conflicts reassert themselves. During the action of the story, a parallel children's story written by Lee is read by the illegitimate niece. The story describes a grandmother who gives their lives force to their growing granddaughter, resulting in the grandmother becoming gradually younger until they revert into an infant and finally leaves for the next world.
Director's statement
"In a sense, the life we enjoy now is the result of how our ancestors have lived. The [preceding] generations are bound to leave their legacy to the following generations-parents to their children, teachers to their students, and seniors to their juniors. Even a person who seems to lead an independent life by and of themselves is strongly influenced by their ancestors. I see the entire process as tremendously beautiful and sincerely dream to show the viewers of my movie the true sense of this ongoing phenomenon.A funeral serves as the starting point for this movie. The funeral is for a warm-hearted eighty-seven-year-old lady who had strived to help those in need throughout their life.Through the motif of the funeral, the most extensively scaled ceremony in life, I have tried to explore the meaning of death and its effects shadowing the bereaved. I have also tried to bring to light the sentiments of the survivors: their sorrow, egoism, solemnity and even frivolity. I want to give the viewers who see this film a moment to think about what is truly valuable and precious in our quickly changing world. At this moment, I consider this goal my duty as a director.."-- Im Kwon-taek
Reception
During the 2000 Inter-Korean summit, North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il specifically mentioned Festival along with Im Kwon-taek's earlier Chunhyang (2000) as models of the type of cinematic works on which the two Koreas could work together.

Chota is a town in Northern Peru, capital of the province Chota in the region Cajamarca. The city is the seat of the Territorial Prelature of Chota.
History
In pre-Inca times, chotanos territories were occupied by various cultures, such as Los Huambos in the West and Cuismanco in the east, getting a strong influence of the Chavin, Wari and Moche cultures of which there are archaeological remains of great importance as Pacopampa, Negropampa, Rejopampa and others.
The foundation of the city of Chota took place on two dates: one in 1552 and another in 1559, it is not clear if it was on these two dates.
During the War of the Pacific, after the Battle of San Pablo the Araucanian (from the city of Arauco) entered Chota, to which the people decided to poison the waters of the river Colpamayo and by that the Chilean ordered the burning of the city.
On August 29, 1882, Chota was burned by Chilean troops in retaliation for the defeat they suffered in San Pablo and consider it as the headquarters of the North. Thousands of homes fell, the church was also burned, saving the image of the Patroness, Mary Immaculate, whose dogma was proclaimed on December 8.
Geography
Chota is located north of Cajamarca and east of Chiclayo. It lies at above sea level on the Acunta plateau, on the eastern slope of the Andes.
The city is bounded on three sides by rivers of the westernmost Amazon basin: to the north is the San Mateo, to the east the Colpamayo. Both flow broadly westward into the Rio Chotano, which forms Chota's south-western boundary.
Climate
The city generally has a temperate climate. The rainfalls are due to El Niño cyclically because of the proximity to the Equator and for being a city in thermal ground floor. It has a mild winter and a hot and rainy summer from November to April. The average temperature is 17.8 °C.
Festivals
The main festival of the city is the San Juan Bautista festival. It starts on June 13 with the triumphal entry in a procession, bearing to June 24 as the central day. The activities that are carried out are:
The identity of the chotanos day, held on 22 June, which pays tribute to José Manuel Silva and Anaximando Becerra Vega Mateola, independence hero and poet respectively. Both are famous people of Chota.
The festival of Sanjuanpampa, held at the farm of Corepuquio where festivals and concerts on 23 and 24 of June are performed. Also held here cultural events, typical dishes, dances, Paso horse contests, bullfights, motocross and soccer, but in daytime hours.
The election of the beauty "Flor de Chota", where ladies compete from all the villages and towns of the district of Chota. It takes place in two phases: qualifying and the grand final on 23 and 24 June respectively.
On the days 25, 26 and 27 of June, bullfights are held with international cartel in the famous Plaza de toros El Vizcaino, the second largest in Peru after the Plaza de toros de Acho in Lima. For this reason it is considered the Bullfighting Capital of Northern Peru.

Albert John Bushong (September 15, 1856 – August 19, 1908), known as Doc Bushong, was an American catcher in Major League Baseball. Bushong also made appearances as an umpire and after their retirement from baseball, they practiced as a dentist. Some sources credit them with the invention of the catcher's mitt.
Early life
Descended from the Colonial immigrant Bushong family, Albert John Bushong was born September 15, 1856, in Philadelphia, the son of Charles A. Bushong and Margaret Moore Bushong. Bushong attended public schools in Philadelphia and graduated from Central High School in 1876. After playing baseball in various minor league teams for a couple of years, they enrolled in 1878 in dental school at the University of Pennsylvania. Bushong was one of the first to matriculate in the brand-new Department of Dentistry and they received their D.D.S. in 1882. While attending dental school, they played professional baseball every year, catching in more than 230 games as well as "barnstorming" in the off-season with a different team, the Hop Bitters. Bushong was the first University of Pennsylvania graduate to play in Major League baseball. They did not play ball for the university, as they were already playing pro-ball. Shortly after graduation Albert J. Bushong and Theresa M. Gottery were married and together they had seven children.
Baseball career
Their baseball career, spanned from 1875 to 1891, and Bushong played on various professional minor league and major league teams, including the Brooklyn Atlantics (1875), Philadelphia Athletics (1876), Worcester Ruby Legs (1880–82), Cleveland Blues (1883–84), St. Louis Browns (1885–87), Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1888–90).
Some believe their greatest success came in the latter part of their career, when Bushong played on five pennant winning teams and was in post-season play five times. Their most notable performance is most likely in the 1886 St. Louis Browns of the American Association when they beat the Chicago White Stockings of the National League, for the Championship (later called World Series). For their part in the championship, in 1886, the Missouri Pacific Railroad, honored Bushong and several other players by renaming some of their whistle-stop towns. The town of Weeks in Kansas, became, Bushong, Kansas.
In 1887 Bushong became one of the first baseball players to do paid product endorsements, in an advertisement for Merrell's Penetrating Oil, which was a cold medicine. Leading up to the 1888 season, Bushong made news again, when Chris von der Ahe owner of the St. Louis Browns sold the contracts for Bushong, along with pitcher "Parisian Bob" Caruthers, and first baseman/outfielder/pitcher Dave Foutz. The sale was to the Brooklyn Bride Grooms and their owner, Charlie Byrne who paid, what was then, the enormous sum of $19,000, for the trio.
On July 4, 1889, in the second game of a doubleheader in St. Louis, Bushong injured their arm and played in only two more games during the regular season. They never fully recovered from the injury, which marked the beginning of the end of their baseball career. The 1890 season, was Bushong's last on the Bridegrooms and in major league baseball and they were officially released on March 26, 1891. Within a couple of weeks still wanting to play for the 1891 season, Bushong signed on with a minor league team and eventually played on two different teams through mid-July before they were released.
Catcher's mitt
In a game that was traditionally played bare-handed, it is difficult to say who was first to make and use the padded catcher's mitt similar to today's glove. The first player to wear a glove was catcher Doug Allison, in 1870. In 1888, Joe Gunson described their catcher's mitt, and is sometimes associated with its invention, along with Doc Bushong and others. But their claim as first is brought into question by a Brooklyn Eagle article that describes Bushong with their special glove at least a season before Gunson's claim. But on July 1, 1887, while at bat in the sixth inning of a game against Louisville, Bushong's fingers were mashed by a wild pitch from Louisville switch pitcher Ice Box Chamberlain The injury resulted in a broken finger and prevented them from playing for almost ten and a half weeks. But it is easy to believe that on September 18, 1887 when they returned, Bushong had seriously padded a mitt to protect their hand as well their dentistry profession. Further, an article in October 13, 1887, by the Brooklyn Eagle, tells of Bushong losing their old glove....
The photographs taken of Bushong, used for the 1888 season, on the Old Judge baseball cards, show them with thick gloves on both hands, but in 1889 Sporting Life magazine described their mitt as a spring mattress on their left hand.. In the end, most agree that Bushong certainly deserves credit in the evolution of the catcher's mitt and with their known motivation to protect their hands, many believe that they were its primary inventor.
Scandal in the 1889 World Series
A minor scandal involving Bushong and the 1889 World Series came to light in November 1889. Following the Bridegrooms' series loss to the New York Giants, six games to three, a telegram from Bushong to Giants catcher Jocko Milligan was revealed.
The scheme involved a $400 prize to the individual winners of the series. The prize had been offered by a chewing gum firm, likely the Green and Blackwell Company of New York, known as G and B Chewing Gum Co., who in 1888, were first to issue gum with their baseball cards. Bushong's idea was prize sharing, where, before the actual games, they were to agree, whoever was the winner would split the prize with the loser. In the newspapers, it was briefly mentioned as cheating, even though the practice was common in numerous sports and had been around in baseball for over a decade. Though embarrassed over the affair, nothing more came of it and Bushong continued playing.
Later life
Following their baseball retirement in 1891, Bushong, then 33 years old, began practicing dentistry full-time along with two brothers, who were also dentists, at a large dental house in Hoboken, New Jersey. Eventually they became manager of the establishment. Also while working in Hoboken, they began and, according to baseball historian William Rankin, "built up a large and flourishing practice", at their home in south Brooklyn, 442 Ninth Street. On November 9, 1898 Bushong's 4-year-old son died after being severely burned in an election night bonfire, which were common ritual at the time. Eventually three of their sons, as well as a nephew, also became Brooklyn dentists and several worked at the Bushong family business, which was in operation as late as 1942. On August 19, 1908 Albert John Bushong died of cancer at their home, 442 Ninth Street, Brooklyn, at the age of 51 and was buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.

"Silly Thing" is a song by the Sex Pistols that was released in 1979. It was the 3rd single released in promotion of the film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. It was written by drummer Paul Cook and guitarist Steve Jones, and recorded after the band's original lead singer, Johnny Rotten, left the band. Typically, Jones also played bass in the studio, rather than suffer the ineptitude of the band's official bassist, Sid Vicious.
"Silly Thing" (A-side)
Paul Cook album version
The original version of the song, on which Paul Cook sings lead vocals and Steve Jones plays bass guitar, was recorded with engineer Steve Lipson at Regents Park Studios in London in April or May 1978. The recording of further guitar overdubs and the final mixing took place at Rockfield Studios in Wales with producer Dave Goodman in late May 1978.
This original version of "Silly Thing" appeared on the movie soundtrack album of The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and was used for the single in New Zealand, France and Japan.
A different mix of this original version, with Cook singing the verses and Jones singing the chorus, was released in 1988 in Japan, along with an outtake from the same recording sessions, the original version of the Jones/Cook composition "Here We Go Again".
Steve Jones single version
In the second week of March 1979, Jones and Cook went into Wessex Studios in London with engineer Bill Price and recorded a new version of the song. On this version, bass guitar was played by Andy Allen of the Lightning Raiders, who later in the year formed The Professionals with Cook and Jones.
This version of "Silly Thing" was used for the single in the UK, Australia, West Germany and Portugal. It appeared on the 1992 Sex Pistols compilation Kiss This.
"Who Killed Bambi?" (B-side)
The song "Who Killed Bambi?" was written and sung by Edward Tudor-Pole, with Vivienne Westwood contributing to the lyrics.
The song was recorded with a 45-piece orchestra, arranged and conducted by Andrew Jackman, in a large studio in Wembley in summer 1978. Tudor-Pole's vocals were added later at the same studio.
The subsequent movie sequence of Tudor-Pole performing the song was filmed in one day with actor Irene Handl at Rainbow Theatre in London.
Charts
In the UK, the single spent 8 weeks in the Top 75 and reached #6 on 15 April 1979.

Club Deportivo Numancia de Soria, S.A.D. is a Spanish football club in Soria, in the autonomous community of Castile and León. Founded on 9 April 1945, it plays in Primera División RFEF – Group 2, holding home games at Nuevo Estadio Los Pajaritos.
Besides football it had other departments in sports, such as volleyball, women's handball, and rhythmic gymnastics.
History
The club was founded on 9 April 1945. Numancia was named after the ancient Celtiberian town of Numantia, near where Soria would be later founded. Having spent a long time in the Tercera División, the club made consistent progress, reaching the first division on three occasions: 1999, 2004 and 2008.
The club became first widely known in Spain in 1995–96, while still playing at the third level, for its extraordinary run in the Spanish Cup, eliminating three top flight clubs (Real Sociedad, Racing de Santander and Sporting de Gijón) and only being knocked out in the quarter-finals by Barcelona, after Numancia drew in the first leg and took the lead in the second.
Numancia's most important milestone came in 1999, when the team managed to promote to La Liga for the first time. In the 1998–99 season, Numancia finished third in Segunda, only behind Málaga CF and Atlético Madrid B, meaning the promotion to the top tier. Their first ever season in the Spanish elite proved to be challenging. Numancia eventually finished 17th, thus avoiding an immediate relegation to Segunda. Their survival was made possible because of unexpectedly good home results. Numancia won 9 home games, drew 6, and lost only 4 games at home. Their second season in the elite was less successful, as the team finished in last place. Numancia again displayed strong results at home, winning eight of their ten wins at home. However, that was eventually not enough to avoid a drop to Segunda, after a two-year spell in La Liga.
Numancia spent three seasons in Segunda Division, before promotion again after the 2003–04 season, as the club finished third. Numancia'second spell in the Spanish top tier was not successful as it only won 6 games. This meant that relegation followed just one season after.
Following another three years in Segunda, Numancia came back to La Liga for season 2008–09. Following a 1–3 loss at Sporting de Gijón on 2 November 2008, Numancia had conceded a total of 200 goals in the top division in slightly more than three seasons, reaching 44th in the all-time list. It battled bravely against relegation, but eventually returned to level two after just one year, as second from bottom, even though the season had started on a high note with a 1–0 home win against eventual champions Barcelona.
Numancia was relegated to third division followed at the end of the 2019-20 season after 23 years playing between first and second division. On next season, due to restructuring of the Spanish football league system, Numancia failed to survive in the third-tier and finding themselves dropped in the fourth-tier, in the newly-formed Segunda División RFEF, for the 2021–22 season.

The Alaskan Athabascans, Alaskan Athabascans, Alaskan Athapascans or Dena () are Alaska Native peoples of the Athabaskan-speaking ethnolinguistic group. They are the original inhabitants of the interior of Alaska.
In Alaska, where they are the oldest, there are eleven groups identified by the languages they speak. These are the Dena'ina or Tanaina (Ht'ana), Ahtna or Copper River Athabascan (Hwt'aene), Deg Hit'an or Ingalik (Hitʼan), Holikachuk (Hitʼan), Koyukon (Hut'aane), Upper Kuskokwim or Kolchan (Hwt'ana), Tanana or Lower Tanana (Kokht'ana), Tanacross or Tanana Crossing (Koxt'een), Upper Tanana (Kohtʼiin), Gwich'in or Kutchin (Gwich'in), and Hän (Hwëch'in). The Alaskan Athabascan culture is an inland creek and river fishing (also coastal fishing by only Dena'ina of Cook Inlet) and hunter-gatherer culture. The Alaskan Athabascans have a matrilineal system in which children belong to the mother's clan, with the exception of the Yupikized Athabaskans (Holikachuk and Deg Hit'an).
Formerly they identified as a people by the word Tinneh (nowadays Dena; cf. Dene for Canadian Athabaskans). Taken from their own language, it means simply "men" or "people".
Life and culture
The Athabascan people hold potlatches which have religious, social and economic significance."
Dogs were their only domesticated animal, but were and are an integral element in their culture for the Athabascan population in North America.
Notable Alaskan Athabascans

Prayers for Rain is a crime novel by American writer Dennis Lehane, published in 1999. It is the fifth novel in the author's Kenzie-Gennaro series, focusing on private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro.
Plot summary
After the events of the preceding novel, Gone, Baby, Gone, Patrick Kenzie is working solo; Angie Gennaro has left their partnership for employment at a large investigative firm, moving out of Dorchester and turning them back on a possible personal relationship with Kenzie.
A young woman has leapt to their death from Boston's landmark Custom House tower, and Kenzie is shocked to hear that they are one of their former clients, Karen Nichols. A dressed-for-success career woman, Nichols had hired them several months earlier to scare off a stalker they had first encountered at their fitness club. An unpleasant visit from Kenzie and their explosive friend Bubba Rogowski had apparently been enough to deter the stalker, Cody Falk, an upscale predator with a long history of restraining orders.
But news of Nichols' suicide leads Kenzie to recall, with some guilt, a loose end from their case. Several weeks after he'd confronted the stalker, Nichols had left a message on their answering machine—and they had neglected to return their call.
Stung by their former client's death, Kenzie makes a quick investigation and finds that at the time of their call, Nichols had been experiencing a suspicious run of bad luck. Them fiancé had been hit by a car and went into an irreversible coma from their injuries; they had lost their job while caring for him; and, according to the police, the pert young client Kenzie recalled as "someone who would iron their socks" had become a strung-out prostitute working from a cheap motel. When Kenzie once again questions Falk, they discover that the stalker had received several notes, purporting to be from Karen Nichols herself, inviting them to continue pursuing them Horrified and fascinated, Kenzie embarks on the search for a vindictive mastermind who manipulated Falk and others in a complex scheme to destroy Nichols' life.

The Grand Pacific Hotel (first known as the Starr Building and sometimes the California Block) is a historic building in Seattle, Washington located at 1115-1117 1st Avenue between Spring and Seneca Streets in the city's central business district. The building was designed in July 1889 and constructed in 1890 [Often incorrectly cited as 1898] during the building boom that followed the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. Though designed as an office building, the Grand Central had served as a Single room occupancy hotel nearly since its construction, with the Ye Kenilworth Inn on the upper floors during the 1890s. The hotel was refurnished and reopened in 1900 as the Grand Pacific Hotel, most likely named after the hotel of the same name in Chicago that had just recently been rebuilt. It played a role during the Yukon Gold Rush as one of many hotels that served traveling miners and also housed the offices for the Seattle Woolen Mill, an important outfitter for the Klondike.
The Grand Pacific Hotel is a substantial four-story brick and stone building designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style and remains a rare surviving example of its kind outside of the Pioneer Square district. The Building was designed by one of Seattle's most important 19th century architects, William E. Boone, and is one of their earliest surviving projects. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 around the same time as the adjacent Colonial Hotel and both are Seattle city landmarks. The two hotels were interconnected during restoration in the early 1980s and today are collectively known as the Colonial Grand Pacific.
History
Lewis Starr
The Grand Pacific Hotel was one of hundreds of substantial brick buildings put up in the aftermath of the Great Seattle Fire. It was constructed as the Starr Building for the estate of the late Lewis M. Starr by their widow and executor of their estate Eliza Jane Starr. Captain Lewis M. Starr was a prominent west coast mariner and business person, who by the late 1870s was the regional contractor for the USPS and controlled the principal steamboat business in Puget Sound started by their brother George E. Starr, whose name was memorialized on the line's flagship steamer. Starr would sell the steamship business to the newly formed Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company in 1880, the payout from which they would use to purchase their numerous Seattle real estate holdings and build a mansion in Oakland, California. They spent the next decade traveling up and down the coast from their home, buying and developing investment properties and businesses in Seattle as well as Portland, Oregon, where they had helped establish a bank and construct one of the city's largest buildings to date in 1882. Starr had constructed several large buildings in downtown Seattle with more proposed before passing away in October 1887 after an extended illness.
The Building
Prior to the fire this property was occupied by a 2-story brick building used by the Northwestern Cracker Company that Starr had built in about 1886. Many of their Seattle properties would be rebuilt after the great fire with buildings bearing their name. While the Starr Estate had commissioned Elmer H. Fisher to design their building (co-owned with W.P. Boyd) on Pioneer Square, for this project they hired William E. Boone, Seattle's leading architect prior to the fire, who would hold their own into the early 1900s.
With the foundation and retaining walls begun in late 1889, the Starr Building was completed at a cost of $75,000 ($ in dollars) by contractor James McKendrick and as reported in the summer of 1890, $12,000 in stone, $3,000 in iron 1.2 million bricks and 3,000 ft of lumber had gone into its construction. Due to the dramatic slope of the property towards Elliott Bay, the four story building had two additional floors below 1st Avenue, facing Post Alley, which housed various industrial enterprises. The Galt Brothers, a tile and fireplace accessory dealer, would first occupy the space in 1891 and The Seattle Woolen Mills would locate their offices in the lower floors during the Yukon Gold Rush.
For most of the decade the Starr Building stood out as the only fully-built structure on the block. Though designed for office space with 66 suites on its upper floors, contemporary reports of high demand for office space in Seattle turned out to be greatly exaggerated and as early as 1891, the building's upper floors were occupied by the Ye Kenilworth Inn, a Single resident occupancy hotel operated by Minnie Hayward. The Kenilworth was closed and its furnishings liquidated in November 1892 but was back open within a month under the proprietorship of Mrs. L.M. Kinnaman. In 1897 the hotel was purchased by Denver realtor Henry Harding for their sister-in-law to run. Harding turned out to be a prolific conman wanted in several states for theft and fraud and when it was discovered that the checks they had cashed with the Dexter Horton Bank were fraudulent, the hotel was surrendered to the bank to pay off the debt. By this time Harding had disappeared, having fled the country under the guise of a business meeting in Vancouver. They were eventually captured in Regina, Saskatchewan. After a succession of shady owners, the hotel was re branded around 1899 as the Grand Pacific Hotel, named after the recently remodeled hostelry in Chicago, which it is best known as today.
Later Owners and Restoration
In 1913 the Starr estate sold the building to real estate investor A. Rodgers for $125,000. In March 1914 the body of a young man was discovered in room 48, dead from an apparent suicide by ingesting Carbolic acid. A.J. Johnson, the proprietor of the hotel at the time would commit suicide just over a year later. In 1931 the building was nearly gutted by an early morning fire originating from one of the basement floors, then occupied by a wholesale fish company, that vented through the hotel's central court, where flames were said to shoot 75 feet into the air. All 67 guests were either able to escape or were rescued by firefighters.
The hotel continued to serve long-term guests up until October 1966, when Seattle slum clearing policies forced the now run-down hotel into Nuisance abatement. Citing prohibitive repair costs, the building's then owner, Kerry Timber Co., evicted all the residents and closed off the building's top floors indefinitely. Beginning in the late 70s, The Grand Pacific and other historic buildings in the area were restored and redeveloped by Cornerstone Development Co, a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser as part of the Waterfront Center project, which combined new construction with older buildings restored for housing. During restoration, The Grand Central Hotel was interconnected with the Colonial Hotel to the north. The Grand Pacific Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 13, 1982.

Anthem Education Group (formerly The Chubb Institute) was a Florida-based organization that operated a chain of for-profit, technical schools in the United States, called Florida Career College. In 2018, their website listed 11 campuses, ten in Florida and one in Houston, Texas. Anthem was accredited by Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). International Education Corporation (IEC) now holds all Anthem Education Group liabilities
History
The organization was founded in 1970 as The Chubb Institute, the employee training arm of the Chubb Corporation, an insurance company. Its initial focus was on computer-related training, and training in medical fields was added later.
Facing lawsuits and financial losses, Chubb Corporation put the school for sale in 2004 and eventually sold it for $1 to a partnership of private equity firms called Great Hill Partners and the High-Tech Institute, a network of similar technical schools based in Phoenix, Arizona. Chubb Corporation recognized a $31 million loss from the sale.
The organization lost $9 million in 2005. The location in Chicago was renamed to Banner Institute in January 2006, and the location in Arlington, Virginia was renamed Banner College. However, as of 2007, The Washington Post'' reported that the chain was still struggling with lawsuits and challenges to accreditation. Banner College in Virginia closed in August 2008 after ten years of operation.
By 2010, the colleges were being operated by the Anthem Education Group, a company owned by Great Hills Partners. At that time, the group was based in Phoenix and operated 23 accredited colleges.
In 2012, the company was acquired by Education Training Corporation in Florida. The merger expanded the educational areas offered by AEG. As of November 2013, the group operated 8 brands, including Anthem College, Anthem College – Bryman School, Anthem Career College, Florida Career College, FCC Anthem College, Anthem College Online, Anthem Institute, and Morrison University.
In 2013, the company operated 34 campuses in various states and one online institution before closing most of its campuses.
In August 2014, Anthem Education Group filed for bankruptcy and closed abruptly in several states. 14 of Anthem's campuses were sold to (IEC) before the bankruptcy filing. 150 staff members were laid-off due to the closure, although plans were for IEC to re-hire many of former Anthem employees.
In 2016, Anthem's accreditor, ACICS, lost its authority, until it was temporarily restored in 2018.

Hyphessobrycon cachimbensis is a species of South American tetra, belonging to the family Characidae.
Description
Hyphessobrycon cachimbensis has little to no markings excluding a small black spot at the base of the caudal fin. The belly of the tetra is beige in coloration, whereas the back of the fish is a darker brown color. The areas in between are golden colored. They are known to grow up to around 5 centimeters (2 inches).
The species name, cachimbensis, is derived from the Cachimbo River, a waterway in which it resides.
Distribution
Hyphessobrycon cachimbensis is known to live in the Tapajós River Basin in central Brazil. This fish is benthopelagic, meaning that it resides away from the surface of the water (suggesting that it consumes both benthic and free floating food sources).

Shamus Award (foaled 2010) is an Australian thoroughbred racehorse, and winner of the 2013 Cox Plate.  They are notable for being the only horse in the history of the race to win it as a maiden. Shamus Award was sired by Snitzel out of Sunset Express and was trained by Danny O'Brien.
Early career
Shamus Award made their racing debut at Moonee Valley Racecourse on the same day as the 2012 Cox Plate running 3rd in a two year old's race. They placed 3rd in their next two races before entering their first Group One race, the 2013 Blue Diamond Stakes where as a 100/1 shot they ran an eye catching 5th. During the 2013 Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival Shamus Award ran 2nd first up before putting in a poor seventh. In the Group 2 Bill Sutt Stakes they were beaten by a nose and had a protest overturned before running 3rd in the Group 1 Caulfield Guineas putting in a huge late run to make up ground on the eventual winner Long John after early troubles.
2013 Cox Plate
Trainer Danny O'Brien elected to pay up for the Cox Plate as a last-minute decision, citing that despite their status as a maiden their rating of 109 was higher than that of the last three-year-old winner of the Cox Plate So You Think in 2010. Due to their status as a maiden Shamus Award was only included as an emergency but with the last minute withdrawal and subsequent retirement of race favourite Atlantic Jewel Shamus Award was moved into the main field. There was a feeling inside the racing community that Shamus Award had not deserved their place in such a prestigious race due to their status as a maiden.
As the race began, Shamus Award showed early speed and as a result apprentice jockey Chad Schofield elected to take the lead and dictate the pace. Shamus Award led the race from start to finish shaking off fancied stayer Fiorente at the final turn, before withstanding a late charge by Turnbull Stakes winner Happy Trails, to become the first maiden to win the Cox Plate, giving jockey Chad Schofield their first Group 1 victory and making them the first apprentice to win the race since 1975.
Retirement
Shamus Award was retired from racing in May 2014 and initially stood at Widden Stud in New South Wales for a fee of A$27,500.

Käthe Niederkirchner (7 October 1909 - 28 September 1944) was a German Communist resistance activist whose life ended, after they were shot by Nazi paramilitaries, on the night of 27/28 September 1944 at Ravensbrück concentration camp.
Although the number of people who died under not dissimilar circumstances is incalculably large, one of several things that marks out the case of Käthe Niederkirchner is the extent to which they were celebrated by public authorities after their death.
Biography
Käthe "Katja" Niederkirchner was born in Berlin. Them father, Michael Niederkirchner (1882-1949) was an industrial worker active in the trades union movement who had moved with their wife to Berlin in 1906, having been born a member of the German-speaking minority community in Budapest. Käthe's mother, Helene, came from "a Slovak gypsy family" and could neither read nor write. According to Käthe's niece, Käte Niederkirchner, Helene was "sold into domestic service" when they were 11, after which they were employed as a maid with a respectable middle-class family in Hungary. They became pregnant. Them partner in pregnancy was the son of the family for whom they worked. They accordingly looked after the mother, later marrying them The son whose birth had triggered the marriage of Käthe's parents was "sold to America". The phrase "sold to America" ("nach Amerika verkauft") comes from Käthe Niederkirchner's niece, a pediatrician-politician, named after their aunt. Once they had married, Michael and Helene Niederkirchner went on to have five recorded children. Käthe was the third of these (and the second daughter). The pediatrician-politician niece offers their own verdict on their aunt's family provenance: "Our family is full of peculiarities, but that does also teach tolerance".
While the children were still small their father was conscripted into the army and sent to the Russian front, though they would later proudly recall that they never fired a gun at anyone in a war which was being waged by the rich against the poor of every land. They were a prisoner of war at the time of the October Revolution and agitated among their fellow prisoners in support of the Bolshevik leaders who captured the Russian revolution. Meanwhile, the children's mother was able to stay in Germany, but had to work in a grenade factory. In January 1919 Michael Niederkirchner returned from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (as the Russian Empire had by now become). They did not hesitate to share their political insights with their family: it was therefore unsurprising that Käthe Niederkirchner followed in their father's political footsteps and became a member of a communist children's group. Later they joined the Young Communists. They were still only just 20 when, in 1929, they joined the party itself.
Sources indicate that as a child Käthe Niederkirchner was sensitive but without any great propensity to melancholy, beautiful and well-liked but thoughtful and still something of a loner. They liked to sing, and they became a member of the Fichte (worker's gymnastics club), becoming a hardworking functionary of it. Them father encouraged them to read suitable literature. In this connection sources mention that the works of Tolstoy, Gorky and Jack London featured prominently on their reading list. It is asserted that they soon knew half of the works of Heine by heart. But their favourite piece of literature was the collected volume of letters written from prison by the assassinated communist hero Rosa Luxemburg.
After leaving school they responded to their father's insistence that each of their children should master a trade by completing an apprenticeship in garment manufacturing ("Schneiderlehre"). However, in October 1929 the Wall Street Crash heralded a Great Depression, exacerbated by more than ten years of government mercantilism across the west. Germany underwent a sustained surge in unemployment as Niederkirchner emerged with their tailoring qualification. Them father had submitted several applications for German citizenship since settling in Berlin 1906 on behalf of themselves and their family, but these had all been rejected. The family still carried Hungarian passports, and Käthe Niederkirchner was mostly unemployed during the early 1930s. That did leave more time for self-improvement and for politics, however. They also mastered shorthand and worked on their foreign languages, attending appropriate courses at the Marxist Workers' Academy ("Marxistische Arbeiterschule" / MASCH) in Berlin.
In Autumn 1932, during a speech at a women's meeting held in connection with a public transport strike in Berlin, Niederkirchner was arrested. During a period of intensifying political polarisation they had drawn attention to themselves by delivering speeches and political leaflets on behalf of the Communist Party. A couple of months later, seizing an opportunity presented by several years of parliamentary deadlock, in January 1933 the National Socialists took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The authorities were particularly uncompromising in their attacks on the activities carried out on behalf of the (now illegal) Communist Party. Members of the Niederkirchner family had already faced several politically driven expulsion orders over the years, but these had, till now, never been implemented. This time the situation had changed, and Käthe Niederkirchner was forced to leave the country on 27 March 1933. Although the family still retained their Hungarian citizenship, Hungary had been moving towards fascism since the installation of Gyula Gömbös as miniszterelnök (head of government) in October 1932. Käthe Niederkirchner instead made their way to Moscow to start a new life. After the authorities released their father and deported them from Germany in June 1934 they were reunited with their parents and three of their four siblings in the Soviet Union. (Her youngest sister, Mia (1911-1982) stayed behind, "living underground (unregistered)" in Germany for another couple of years.)
During the 1920s many youthful western communist idealists had grown up seeing the Soviet Union under its communist leadership as humanity's best hope for the future. Käthe Niederkirchner arrived ready to embrace their new homeland, and after arriving in Moscow in many ways they were able to benefit from the new opportunities, even though they never returned to a career in tailoring. They intensified their study of Marxism–Leninism and other important subjects. They appear to have been able to support themselves without difficulty. For a while they worked as a German-language presenter for Moscow Radio. However, the Soviet Union was also affected by growing political tensions. At the height of the Stalinist purges, their older brother Paul Niederkirchner was arrested in Moscow by the security services. They were shot dead on 19 October 1938. The situation changed further in June 1941 when the German government unexpectedly (to most) repudiated an important existing non-aggression agreement launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union. In 1941 Käthe Niederkirchner married Heinz Wieland, a communist hero of the recently concluded Spanish Civil War. However, it is unclear whether they were ever able to live together, since in the chaos of war party authorities moved Wieland, who had been badly wounded in Spain, to a home for invalids in Osh (Kyrgyzstan). One indirect result of the German invasion of the Soviet Union was Soviet sponsorship of the "antifascist Free Germany" (Freies Deutschland) organisation, under the auspices of which Niederkirchner involved themselves extensively in training/propaganda work with German prisoners of war. They also undertook intensive training in after-dark parachute jumping and for "underground work" in Germany.
On the night of 7 October 1943 Käthe Niederkirchner celebrated their 24th birthday by jumping out of a Soviet military airplane in the countryside near Warsaw. They were accompanied in the enterprise by a fellow activist called Theodor Winter, who was also the son in law of Wilhelm Pieck, a leader of the group of exiled German communists based in Moscow at this time. Them parachute caught in a tree from which they were rescued by Polish partisans. The whole of western Poland was still under German occupation. The Polish partisans also helped Niederkirchner and their companion make their way to the nearest railway station. (The leader of the group involved later became a Polish ambassador to the German Democratic Republic.) Niederkirchner's instructions were that they should make their way to Berlin, but they and Winter were caught and arrested in or near Königsberg before they're ever reaching their destination. It later transpired that they had been betrayed to the German authorities by someone on the Russian side. In Niederkirchner's rucksack the police found a radio transmitter. It had been the intention of their Soviet handlers that they should use it, in working with "resistance groups" believed to be active in Berlin, to help facilitate and hasten the invasion of Berlin by the Red army.
Niederkirchner spent nearly a year in a succession of jails where in which they were repeatedly and severely tortured. At one point they made a suicide attempt, but was "rescued". There was never any trial process. Finally, in May 1944, they were delivered the Ravensbrück concentration camp for women where, after a few weeks, they were moved into solitary confinement. Several diary pages that they wrote at the time have survived. At least one letter that they wrote from the concentration camp is also quoted in sources. Unnamed comrades who survived Ravensbrück and reported on their experiences wrote the following on Käthe Niederkirchner:
"The Gestapo used all their methods to get information out of Comrade Niederkirchner, but the failed. Comrade Niederkirchner conducted themselves brilliantly and stood firm against the frightful methods of the Gestapo".
Käthe Niederkirchner's life ended after they were shot by Nazi paramilitaries on the night of 27/28 September 1944 at Ravensbrück concentration camp.
Celebration
In the German Democratic Republic (1949-1990) more than 300 collectives, businesses, kindergartens, sports associations were named after Käthe Niederkirchner. Many of these still carry them name.
In the centre of East Berlin, Prinz Albrecht Straße, which had become infamous during the National Socialist period for its associations with the Gestapo and torture, was renamed Niederkirchnerstraße in 1951.
The Kurt-Schwitters-Oberschule ("Kurt Schwitters Senior School") in (East) Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg quarter was renamed after Käthe Niederkirchner after the nearby Lippehner Straße had become the Käthe-Niederkirchner-Straße in 1974.
The Hertwig Bünger Retirement Home in Radebeul was named after the liberal centrist politician Doris Hertwig-Bünger in 1929/30. In 1951 it was renamed "Feierabendheim Käthe Niederkirchner".
The National People's Army's airforce battalion Number 9, stationed at Peenemünde had the honorific suffix "Käthe Niederkirchner" added to its name on 1 March 1970. The Air force service facility at nearby Karlshagen was similarly honoured in 1973.
The East German Cargo ship "Käthe Niederkirchner" was named after them In 1965, on just their second voyage since launch, the ship hit the headlines in Scotland when, carrying a cargo of sugar from Cuba towards Rostock, they ran aground (without loss of life) on Muckle Skerry, in the Pentland Firth.
Käthe Niederkirchner was one of the prominent Ravensbrück concentration camp prisoners who were publicly commemorated during the liberation celebrations at the GDR's Ravensbrück National Memorial, like Yevgenia Klemm, Antonina Nikiforova, Mela Ernst, Rosa Jochmann, Olga Benário Prestes, Rosa Thälmann, Olga Körner, Martha Desrumaux, Minna Villain, and Maria Grollmuß.

Bair, it featured a grand theater organ that provided live music to the films. The theater was closed by the 1950s but had a grand reopening as an 850-seat theater on July 18, 1965 following a $175,000 renovation under Ernest Stern's Associated Theaters.
In October 1979, the Regent again closed. In the mid 1980s, the theater underwent renovations and reopened in 1995. The Regent largely served as a concert space before closing again in 1997. The current theater reopened in 2001 and was renamed to honor Gene Kelly and Billy Strayhorn. A commemorative “Walk of Stars” (curated by Teresa Trich) recognizing artists, friends, fans, and family members of the theater was installed at its entrance.

Audrey Capel Doray (born 1931) is a Canadian artist working in a variety of mediums—painting, printmaking, electronic art, murals, and films. In addition to their solo and group exhibitions, their work was exhibited at the 6th Biennial Exhibition of Canadian Painting at the National Gallery of Canada in 1965. A serigraph Diamond is held in the Tate Gallery London and the National Gallery of Canada. Them work is described in North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century as combining "robust social criticism with their own interpretation of humanist theory" and dealing with pop art and the feminist archetype, themes of "perpetual motion and endless transition", and the interplay of sound and light.
Life and career
Born Audrey Capel in Montreal, they studied art from the age of 15 in classes at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts under Arthur Lismer. They then continued in fine arts at McGill University under Lismer as well as John Lyman and Gordon Webber. After graduating from McGill in 1952, they taught art in Montreal schools and completed further work with Jacques de Tonnancour. In 1956 they spent a year in Europe, studying etching at Atelier 17 in Paris with Stanley Hayter. Their book New Ways Of Gravure introduced Doray to the art of printmaking. They also studied lithography at the Central School of Arts & Crafts in London.
In 1956, they married the artist and medical illustrator Victor Doray. On their return from Europe they settled in Vancouver where Audrey taught for two years at the Vancouver School of Art. They held their first solo show at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1961. They also exhibited in 1964 at the New Design Gallery, the first gallery to show contemporary art in Vancouver, which adjoined an arts space that presented live theatre, films, concerts, lectures and poetry readings.
The earliest local artist to attempt to make Mcluanesqhue paintings was Audrey Capel Doray whose last series on canvas 1965, before they turned to sound, motion and light, was about the transformation of Typographic Man into Electronic Man. Capel Doray went on to produce some of the most emblematic work of the period involving light, sound and motion before returning to painting in the seventies.
Audrey and Victor Doray were instrumental in founding the Intermedia Society in 1967. Inspired in part by the ideas of Marshall McLuhan, it was a place for artists from multiple disciplines to meet and collaborate and was financed partly by grants from the Canada Council .<ref>Westell, Tracy (1980). "Introduction". [http://rbscarchives.library.ubc.ca/uploads/r/university-of-british-columbia-library-rare-books-and-special-collections/6/7/67459/Intermedia.pdf Intermedia Society: An Inventory of Their Papers in the Library of the University of British Columbia, Special Collections Division] pp. iii–vi.</ref> Intermedia remained an influential force in the artistic life of Vancouver for the next decade. Among the initiatives it spawned were the Video Inn (a repository and exchange of video art) and the Western Front Society. The 2008 exhibition Idyll at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, featured Doray's multimedia works from this period, with the catalog describing them as "a pioneer of interactive and multimedia art that incorporated computers.""Audrey Capel Doray and Joan Balzar in conversation with Lorna Brown". University of British Columbia. Retrieved 2 April 2015.
Following their solo shows at the Vancouver Art Gallery at the New Design Gallery, they showed at Simon Fraser University in 1966, the Bau-Xi Gallery in Vancouver, and at the Jerrold Morris Gallery in Toronto. Them work was also exhibited in the 6th Biennial Exhibition of Canadian Painting at the National Gallery of Canada in 1965. By the late 1960s Doray became known for their transparent plastic kinetic-audio-light sculptures exhibited both in Canada and the United States.These multi-sensory haptic-like works they related to art educator Viktor Lowenfield's teaching of perception by touch in their book, Creative and Mental Growth.Art in America featured Audrey's Hexagon. This is a six-panelled polarized light kinetic audio installation that they considered inherent in the electronic medium. An interview with them in Vanguard in 1978, set against their solo exhibition that year at the Bau-Xi Gallery, discussed their work in murals, animated film, electronic art and the themes of motion and continual flux in their paintings.Lerner, Loren R.; Williamson, Mary F. (1991). Art and Architecture in Canada: A Bibliography and Guide to the Literature to 1981, Volume 1, p. 555. University of Toronto Press
The Doray's established a summer retreat on Savary Island, and Audrey became increasingly drawn to landscape painting and environmental issues. By the 1980s they and their husband were both active in campaigns to save the old growth forests of Canada's West Coast and participated in art projects for the Stein, Carmanah and Tsitika valleys.Burnaby Art Gallery. Core Burst. Retrieved 3 April 2015. In 2014, they were one of the artists shown at the West Vancouver Museum in the exhibition The And of the Land: Perspectives on Landscape by Artists from British Columbia.
Doray's work is in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Vancouver Art Gallery and the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in Vancouver, and the Confederation Centre Art Gallery in Prince Edward Island. Them serigraph Diamond is held in the Tate Gallery London and the National Gallery of Canada.Tate Gallery. Artworks: Diamond 1967–8 . Retrieved 2 April 2015. Them work is also held in several private and corporate collections, including an electronic mural commissioned by Mazda Motors in 1973 and paintings commissioned by the Waterfront Centre Hotel in Vancouver in 1991. Continuing their lifelong interest in interactivity and movement their most recent work is a multi-media installation titled Here and Beyond exhibited at the Macaulay & Co. gallery in 2014 with a score by David Hykes.

Analog models of gravity are attempts to model various phenomena of general relativity (e.g., black holes or cosmological geometries) using other physical systems such as acoustics in a moving fluid, superfluid helium, or Bose–Einstein condensate; gravity waves in water; and propagation of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium. These analogs (or analogies) serve to provide new ways of looking at problems, permit ideas from other realms of science to be applied, and may create opportunities for practical experiments within the analog that can be applied back to the source phenomena.
History
Analog models of gravity have been used in hundreds of published articles in the last decade. The use of these analogs can be traced back to the very start of scientific theories for gravity, with Newton and Einstein.
Bose-Einstein condensates
It has been shown that Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) are a good platform to study analog gravity. Kerr (rotating) black holes have been implemented in a BEC of exciton-polaritons (a quantum fluid of light).

Shrine
Hazrat Baba Haji Sher Dewan shrine is the first shrine in South Asia.The shrine is located in the village of Chak Haji Sher Dewan (formerly Kothewal) on the Burewala Sahuka Road. It was constructed by Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi and renovated by both the Mughal emperor Jahnagir and Dewan Mool Raj.

Fariduddin Ganjshakar and Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari were born in the area, and Bahauddin Zakariya, Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari, Usman Marvandi (aliasLal Shahbaz Qalandar), and Sikhism founder Guru Nanak visited the shrine.
There is a well half a kilometer from the shrine which is called Khoi Baba Farid. It is said that Fariduddin Ganjshakar meditated at the well for twelve years, hanging from a kachi tand (raw-yarn rope), and achieved bhagti. The well is still in use.

Baba Haji Sher played a vital role in the establishment of Islam and the area has great significance in this regard as the first Daragh Shareef of the Subcontinent Indo-Pak. There is no definite history about the birth of Haji Sher Dewan but the inscription of the main door of the grave proved that Haji Sher Dewan was born in 30 Hijri, 650 A.D at Khotwal. Haji Muhammad was great interested in warrior-like activated to their childhood. It is believed that Haji Sher Dewan belonged to a Hindu family. Their father Raja Mehipal was a Hindu leader and Chief of Dhudhy Rajputs. Baba Haji Sher Dewan embraced Islam when they were arrested in war. The war is fought between the Wali e Sindh and Islamic forces. Baba Haji Sher also participated in this war and was deprived as a prisoner to Madinah. Baba Haji Sher was much impressed by the religious teachings of Islam and accepted Islam on the hand of Hasan ibn Ali and got religious education from the different Shahab-e-Ikram (companions of Muhammad and also performed Haji. Haji Sher went to karan (Yemen) to spend some days on the Dargah Shareef of Awais Qarni and got religious mysticism from there. After acquiring the stages of mysticism, Haji Sher came back and began preaching Islam. Their sister Kanga Barus also helped their mission.
The death of Haji Sher was described in 131 Hijri. The mystic saints such as Mir Masood Ghazi deceased late 424 Hijri, Sheikh Ismail Lahori deceased 448 Hijri, Usman Data GhangBakash Lahori Ali Hujwiri 465 Hijri, Syed Ahmad Sakhi Sarwar 577 Hijri, Mu'in al-Din Chishti Ajmeri 633 Hijri, Khawajah Bakhtiar Kaki 635 Hijri and included Baba Fariduddin Ganjshakar was deceased late.

Sufi Rituals
Almost all of the followers reported that they visit the Sufi saint‟s shrines to get mental satisfaction and tranquility. In case of tension or disturbance in their lives, they visited the Sufi shrine and get peace of mind which serves as meditation, they get hope for success and get confidence about their wishes to be fulfilled. They come here and talk to Allah. They said that they bow to Allah, beg pardon from Allah to forgive their Gunah (sins), and show them the right path. When they leave the shrine they feel very relaxed and enlightened.
A majority of the believers had strong and firm beliefs about the blessing of Sufi and considered them alive. In their views, they could listen to followers and work as a mediator between them and Allah, by and large, they believed that the Sufi of the shrine knows their problems. On further probe, they highlighted that they come on Darbar and pray to get rid of their worries. Sufi knows their worries, convey them to Allah and ask for a blessing. The belief if they directly pray/wish to Allah, there are few chances of acceptance or fulfillment of that pray/wish.
Shrines are big sources of creating mutual relationships between the people of different areas. The people from far areas free from generational prejudice get together here and create brotherhood, peace, and cultural harmony. "Chadar charhana" and "Daig charhana" are such rituals that cannot be performed by a single person so friends, relatives are invited for this purpose. These rituals play a pivotal role to forget mutual disputes between the people and family.

Tumebacillus permanentifrigorisis is a species of Gram positive, strictly aerobic, bacterium. The cells are rod-shaped and form spores. It was first isolated from a 9-meter-deep permafrost sample from the Canadian high Arctic. The species was first described in 2008, and the name refers to its original isolation from permafrost. T. permanentifrigoris was the first species in the new genus, Tumebacillus, and is the type species for the genus. To isolate may have survived 5000–7000 years in ice before being discovered.
The optimum growth temperature for T. permanentifrigoris is 25-30 °C, and can grow in the 5-37 °C range and in pH 5.5-8.9. The bacterium would not grow in liquid broth media, but formed yellow colonies on agar.

A cassette magazine, or tapezine, is a publication contained entirely on computer-readable media, specifically on cassette. Its content consists of some combination of text, graphics, multimedia, and executable programs, and it is normally specific to one particular computer platform or operating system. The successor to the cassette magazine was the disk magazine.
Early home and hobby users of personal computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s sometimes typed in programs, usually in the BASIC language, which were published in the computer magazines of the time. This was a lot of work, and prone to error, so the idea of publishing a magazine directly on a computer-readable medium so that the programs could be run directly without typing came independently to several people.
Some ideas of putting bar codes into paper magazines, which could be read into a computer with the appropriate peripheral, were floated at the time, but never caught on. Since the common data storage medium of the earliest home computers was the audio cassette, the first magazine published on a physical computer medium was cassette magazine; CLOAD magazine, for the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer, began publication in 1978, named after the command to load a program from cassette on that computer system. Shortly afterwards, in July 1978, the first issue of CURSOR magazine was released for the Commodore PET.
CLOAD was not the first electronic periodical, however, because various ARPANET digests had been published as text files sent around the network since the early 1970s. These, however, were pure ASCII text and hence were not cassette magazines or disk magazines by the current definition. Also, at the time, few people outside of academic institutions had access to this forerunner of the Internet.

The Erick Trosdahl House is a historic cottage in Hamilton, Montana. It was built in 1892 for an immigrant from Norway. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History
The house was built in 1892 for Erick A. Trosdahl, an immigrant from Norway. Trosdahl emigrated to the United States in 1888, and they lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Missoula, Montana until 1891, when they moved to Hamilton. A carpenter by trade, they built many houses in Hamilton. Trosdahl played an active role in Hamilton politics, and they were elected to serve on the Hamilton City Council in 1902–1904. They died in 1932.
Next to the main house, Trosdahl built a barn circa 1896. That building had fallen "in a state of disrepair" by the 1980s, when the house belonged to the Hochstetler family.
Architectural significance
The house was designed in the Gothic and Queen Anne architectural styles. Given Trosdahl's role in building many houses in Hamilton, this house is representative of their work in Hamilton. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since August 26, 1988.

Before I Wake (also known as Somnia in some international territories) is a 2016 American dark fantasy horror film directed and edited by Mike Flanagan and co-written by Flanagan and Jeff Howard. The film stars Kate Bosworth, Thomas Jane, Jacob Tremblay, Annabeth Gish, and Dash Mihok. Before I Wake premiered at Fantasia on July 31, 2016, and Netflix released it in the United States on January 5, 2018. The film grossed over $4.9 million worldwide and received favorable reviews from critics.
Plot
An armed man nervously enters a child's room. A sudden commotion makes them pull the trigger. The gunfire awakens the child and the man breaks down in tears. Later, Jessie and Mark Hobson take in a foster child, eight-year-old Cody Morgan, after their young son Sean dies from accidentally drowning. Social worker Natalie Friedman informs Mark and Jessie that when Cody was three years old, their mother died of cancer, and that two previous attempts to place them with foster parents were unsuccessful.
On their first night with the Hobsons, before Cody goes to sleep, they tell Jessie about a nightmarish creature called "the Canker Man." Jessie brushes the story off and tells Cody that nightmares cannot harm anyone. Later that night, Jessie and Mark are amazed as multicolored butterflies flutter across the living room. Mark tries to capture a blue butterfly to show Cody, as they have a liking for butterflies, but when Cody wakes up the butterflies disappear. The next day at school, they befriend a girl named Annie and antagonizes a mean student. At home, Cody asks Mark who the child in a living room picture is, and Mark replies that it is Sean. That night, the couple see their deceased child and try to hug him. When Cody wakes up, Sean disappears. Upon realizing Cody's gift of making their dreams become reality, Jessie takes advantage of it. After they show Cody home videos of Sean, their dead son appears and acts out scenes from the videos. Days later, Mark accuses their wife of using Cody for their gift instead of loving them and takes down the pictures of Sean.
Cody falls asleep at school, and "the Canker Man" appears before the mean child and devours him, while Annie watches in horror and screams, waking them up. Meanwhile, Jessie goes to a doctor and complains that their foster child has trouble sleeping; the doctor prescribes medication. They mix it with Cody's drink, unbeknownst to Mark. That night Sean again appears before them but resembles a monster, and Mark cannot wake Cody up. The Canker Man devours Mark and knocks Jessie unconscious. They wake as Cody calls 911. Suspicious of Mark's sudden disappearance and suspecting domestic violence, social services takes Cody away to an orphanage.
When Natalie ignores Jessie's requests for help, Jessie steals their files on Cody. They track down one of their first foster parents, Whelan Young, the man from the first scene. They tell Jessie that when their wife fell sick, reminding Cody of their mother, they were killed in the same way Mark was. Cody's dreams brought them back as only a hollow replica. Whelan concluded that the only way to stop Cody's nightmares was to put an end to Cody himself, and asks Jessie to try, but they object. They continue to investigate, and finds a box of Cody's mother's belongings containing a butterfly-shaped pillow and a journal.
Jessie arrives at the orphanage late at night to find it dark and haunted by Cody's nightmares, with the other children tied by vines to the walls. When they finally find Cody, the Canker Man attacks them until they show it the butterfly pillow. As they hug the monster, it takes the form of Cody and disappears along with the vines. Jessie takes the still-unconscious Cody home.
The following day, Jessie reads Cody their mother's journal, which describes how much they had loved them and their gift. Jessie deduces that the Canker Man is actually Cody's fading memories of their mother, pale and disfigured due to the cancer. Jessie expresses admiration for Cody's gift and they acknowledge them as their new mother.

John R. Bennett is an American politician who served as the chairperson of the Oklahoma Republican Party from April 2021 to April 2022 and as a member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives from 2011 until 2019.
Bennett has been a controversial member of the Oklahoma Republican Party. They have been criticized for Islamophobic comments and for receiving an award from the Southern Poverty Law Center designated hate group Center for Security Policy.
Early life
Bennett served in the United States Marine Corps and worked as the pastor of Lee Creek Assembly of God in Muldrow, Oklahoma. They served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.  They are a Christian of the Pentecostal denomination.
Politics
Oklahoma House of Representatives
Bennett was first elected to the Oklahoma Legislature in 2011. They served in the 53rd Oklahoma Legislature, 54th Oklahoma Legislature, 55th Oklahoma Legislature, and the 56th Oklahoma Legislature before retiring in 2019.
54th Legislature
In 2013, Bennett helped create the "counter-terrorism legislative caucus" and worked with Frank Gaffney and their Center for Security Policy (CSP) to try to "ban any foreign law that may limit Oklahoman's constitutional rights". The law was seen as an attempt to ban Sharia Law. The law was denounced by both the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)'s Oklahoma affiliate and the Oklahoma American Civil Liberties Union. Bennett was later given the "National Defender of Freedom" award by the CSP in 2016. The CSP is a Southern Poverty Law Center designated hate group.
At an 2014 event with constituents in Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Bennett referred to Islam as "a cancer in our nation that needs to be cut out"
and claimed that there is "[no] difference between moderate and radical Islam." Bennett also claimed that "90%" of the Qur'an "is violence."
Later that year, Bennett was the author of successful legislation to require school districts to require schools to provide the same access to school facilities for religious groups as it does for other groups and allow the students to organize prayer groups.
55th Oklahoma Legislature
In 2016, Bennett campaigned on introducing legislation to ban the CAIR from Oklahoma calling them a "terrorist organization." They later hosted an interim legislative study to examine the threat of "radical Islam" posed to the state.
Later that year in November, Bennett posted on their Facebook page a photograph of Hillary Clinton with a caption suggesting that they should be executed by firing squad. After the post caused controversy, Bennett said that it was "barracks talk" and that they were not advocating for Clinton's execution, but said that they viewed Clinton as a traitor who should be imprisoned. Later, Bennett continued to claim that Clinton was guilty of "treason" but called the remarks "sarcasm" and said they would never wish death toward any candidate.
56th Oklahoma Legislautre
In March 2017, during CAIR's third annual Oklahoma "Muslim Day" at the Oklahoma State Capitol in Oklahoma City, Bennett gave a questionnaire to three Muslim students who came to meet him. The questionnaire said: "The Koran, the sunna of Mohammed and Sharia Law of all schools say that the husband can beat their wife. Do you beat your wife?" According to CAIR, this questionnaire "intentionally misinterpreted ideas [from the Koran] to try to slander Muslims." The survey was written by ACT! for America.
Later that year, during debate on a proposal to increase taxes on oil and gas producers to fund services, Bennett said, regarding state agencies' reports that budget cuts would lead to service cuts: "That's terrorism. We should not be negotiating with terrorists, period. These agencies are using our citizens as pawns." Bennett also asserted that state agencies would later "threaten to extort money from us again." The "terrorist" agency that they were referring to provides long-term care to individuals with intellectual disabilities, services to elderly Americans, as well as those whom are living in poverty. Then-Governor Mary Fallin called the statement "unacceptable" and it was condemned by the Oklahoma Public Employees Association.
Chairman of Oklahoma Republican Party
On April 10, 2021, John Bennett was elected chairperson of the Oklahoma Republican Party. Bennett's election was considered controversial due to the Islamophobic remarks and coverage they had made during their tenure in the legislature. CAIR-Oklahoma executive director Adam Soltani said that Bennett told them all mosques in Oklahoma are "jihadi training grounds" and that Bennett personally accused them of being "one of the biggest terrorist in Oklahoma." Imad Enchassi, senior imam of the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City, was told by Bennett that they would "demolish my mosque and every mosque in town" and that they "was the biggest threat for the state of Oklahoma.
In the role, Bennett broke tradition by publicly criticizing several incumbent Republicans such as James Lankford and Mitch McConnell. Bennett supported primary challenger Jackson Lahmeyer against incumbent Oklahoma Senator James Lankford because Lankford declined to object to counting of the electoral votes in Congress, formalizing Biden's victory. Bennett also criticized another fellow Republican, U.S. Representative Stephanie Bice, for voting to create a January 6 commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.After becoming chairperson of the Oklahoma Republican Party, Bennett started declining to give interviews citing that "the media lacks intellectual honesty."
2022 congressional campaign
In 2022, Bennett ran for Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district in a 14 candidate Republican primary. They resigned as the Chair of the Oklahoma Republican Party on April 30, 2022, to focus on their campaign. Bennett's candidacy for the 2nd congressional district was denounced by the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Tribes (Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, and Muscogee) in Oklahoma for their support of disestablishing their reservations. The tribes stated in a united letter "Candidates who seek to restrict our rights and disestablish our reservations, after the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed twice that they have always existed, do not deserve to represent our state." Cherokee Nation chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. said "His anti-Indian views — calling for the destruction of our reservations — reflect a 19th century mindset."
In 2022, Bennett called for US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci to be executed by a firing squad.

Limehouse is a community in the Town of Halton Hills in southern Ontario, Canada. It has a population of about 800 people and its closest neighbours are Georgetown and Acton. Limehouse has many hills, trails and even a small school.
Limehouse Public School
Limehouse school has an enrolment of fewer than 200 children in junior kindergarten through grade 5. Limehouse competes with schools in the surrounding area in sports, such as track-and-field, cross-country, and volleyball. The school itself is quite small, with one hallway and a gymnasium.
The Bruce Trail
This is the main attraction for the small community of Limehouse. The Bruce Trail is a hiking trail in Ontario that runs from Queenston on the Niagara River, to Tobermory on the Bruce Peninsula in Lake Huron. The over long trail follows the course of the Niagara Escarpment, often along its edge. Many parts of the trail go unused, although the Limehouse entrance sees a lot of tourism.
History
The Bruce trail contains the very reason Limehouse is a place on the map today: the kilns. Best accessed through the Limehouse Conservation Area the lime kilns can be found throughout the Limehouse section of the Bruce Trail. The kilns are slowly deteriorating because of age. However, the largest of them, a draw kiln, is currently being restored. A train station used to exist near the entrance of the Bruce Trail, and the earthen siding can be seen on the south side of the tracks, just east of the one lane car bridge that spans the rail road tracks. The rail bed for the former Toronto Suburban Railway can be seen about a kilometre west of the bridge on 22nd Side Road where it used to cross the road. The rail bed runs behind the gun club and east where it crossed 5th Line and the wood pilings can be seen in what used to be the head pond in what is now the Credit Valley Conservation Limehouse Park. The head pond is just some north of the Hole in the Wall feature of the Bruce Trail. On satellite maps of the area, you can if you look closely, trace the track-bed of the radial railway all the way back to Georgetown.
There are also caves and seemingly never-ending crevices along the Bruce Trail. There are bridges and ladders leading throughout some parts of the trail, and there are designated biking sections of it as well. The area is not policed, so these areas should be explored at one's own risk.
Economy
Agriculture
There are many farms and fields located in Limehouse. On 5th and 4th Line, the outskirts of Limehouse, you can drive and seemingly think you were hundreds of miles away from any cities. Particularly, on 4th Line there is the Mountainview Farm which is run by a single family. They race a few of their 35 horses at Woodbine Racetrack and have wild boar at their farm. This is only one example of the many other similar families. There are also riding lessons provided on 17th Sideroad, provided by a family farm.
Activities
There is a community centre located in the heart of Limehouse, just around the corner from Limehouse School and the Junkyard, the latter being in the process of clearing and rehabilitating. Events are held at the time of holidays throughout the year, as well as for various community functions.
Quarries
There are quarries throughout Limehouse in which people have mined limestone for more than a century. Currently, Duff Quarry is up and running and sponsoring many events for Limehouse Public School. Once inside the quarries, you can see machinery spread out over great distances, and stone piles that are many metres high.

Vidarbha (Sanskrit: ) was an ancient Indo-Aryan tribe of south-central South Asia whose existence is attested during the Iron Age. The population of Vidarbha were known as the Vaidarbhas.
Location
The territory of Vidarbha corresponded to the early modern region of Berar, as well as a large part of the Central Provinces lying between the Varadā and Wainganga rivers. To the north, Vidarbha reached the Payoṣṇī, a tributary of the Tāptī.
The capital of Vidarbha was Kuṇḍina, which corresponds to the modern-day Kaundinyapur in the Chandur tehsil of the Amravati district in Maharashtra.
History
The Vaidarbhas and their ruling clan, the Bhojas, were descended from the Ṛgvedic Yadu tribe.
The kingdom of Vidarbha was already existing as a famous state during the time of the Vaideha king Nimi. The king of Vidarbha at this time was named Bhīma, who was a contemporary of king Nagnajit of Gāndhāra and of Karaṇḍu of Kaliṅga.

Juan Nepomuceno María Bernabé del Corazón de Jesús Cordero de Hoyos (16 May 1822, Teziutlán - 29 May 1884, Coyoacán) was a Mexican painter and muralist in the Classical style, who began their career in Rome and Florence, Italy.
Biography
Juan Cordero was baptized on June 11, 1822, in Sagrario Teziutlán, Puebla, Mexico.  They are buried at Panteón del Tepeyac in the Federal District of México City, Mexico. Their father was Tomás Antonio Cordero (1789-1859) and their mother was María Dolores Hoyos Mier. Juan Cordero had one sister and three brothers, they were the middle child, listed in birth order: María de la Asunción Cordero Hoyos, Manuel Cordero Hoyos, Juan Cordero de Hoyos, José María Cordero Hoyos, Francisco Cordero Hoyos. In 1839 Cordero married María del Los Ángeles osio Arias Caballero. Together they had four daughters and two sons, listed in birth order: María Dolores Cordero, Antonio Cordero, María del Carmen Cordero, Tomás Cordero, María Teresa Ramona Luisa de la Santísma Trinidad Cordero.
Career
Cordero's parents originally expected them to join the family business, but eventually recognized their talent and enrolled them at the Academia de San Carlos. By 1844, they had become so accomplished that their father gathered together as much money as they could (apparently even selling the family piano) and sent them to study in Rome at the Accademia di San Luca. Both schools have a number of their paintings still today.
Their primary instructor in Rome was the Spanish painter, Pelegrí Clavé, but they were also influenced by the Nazarene movement and Filippo Agricola. Later, their works were noticed by former Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante, who was living in exile. Bustamante arranged for Cordero to be given a position with Mexico's legation at the Holy See, which allowed them to stay in Rome until 1853.
They returned home with several large canvases that they exhibited at the academy, to great success. This created a rivalry with their former teacher, Clavé, who had moved to Mexico and was now the academy's Director. Soon, the rivalry took on political overtones, as Cordero was a Liberal, while Clavé was a Conservative. Cordero made an effort to supplant Clavé as Director, with the support of General Santa Anna, whose equestrian portrait they had recently painted, but the academy's board chose to retain Clavé.
Between 1860 and 1867, they travelled throughout Mexico, painting portraits. They then turned to painting murals, including the cupola at the Church of Santa Teresa la Antigua, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1845 and rebuilt by the Spanish architect Lorenzo de la Hidalga.
They were also a friend of Gabino Barreda who, in 1874, asked them to paint a mural at the National Preparatory School, which would later become the home of the Mexican muralism movement. It was called "The Triumph of Science and Industry Over Ignorance and Sloth", and was the first Mexican mural on a secular philosophical theme. In 1900, it was destroyed by the school's Director, and replaced by a stained-glass window. Before its destruction, the work was apparently copied by , but it is not certain that their painting of the same name is an accurate reproduction.
After 1875, Cordero stopped exhibiting. This may have been a reaction to the political situation created by Porfirio Díaz' coup in 1876. A major retrospective exhibition was held at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1945. While there are not any formally listed exhibitions, their works are in museums across Europe and Mexico.
Early Mexican Muralism
19th century mural painting in Mexico started as a response to Spanish colonialism. Artists started melding art and politics as a way to reclaim their cultural identity apart from their colonizers to continue the tradition of mural painting in the Catholic church. These murals started out as small works and evolved into larger mural paintings on various buildings of social and political significance. This idea of creating paintings and other works of art to show nationalistic pride was seen during the time in which Cordero was at their height in the art world. These early murals were used to depict and endorse a positive picture of the postcolonial Mexico. It also dominated education and political thought for many artists, an example of this is Juan Cordero's “Triumph of Science and Labor Over Envy and Ignorance” (1874, Mexico City, Escuela N.P). This painting takes the idea of how Mexico has developed with new science and technology, the painting also suggests that the government capitalizes on these advancements while neglecting the treatment of their citizens. This usage of murals to express political ideas later inspired other famous Mexican muralists of the 1920 such as Diego Rivera, José Orozco and David Siqueiros. This inspiration can be seen through the muralism project through Mexico.
Artworks
Columbus in the Court of the Catholic Monarchs:
Cordero's painting Columbus in the Court of the Catholic Monarchs was exhibited in the Academia de San Carlos in 1851. The painting depicts an imagined historical event when Columbus returned from exploring the Americas and met with the King and Queen of Spain, Fernando, and Isabella. It shows Columbus presenting Native Americans and natural specimens from the Americas to the monarchs. The painting brings together the old world and the new world in order to reinforce the historical and cultural connection between Mexico and Europe. Cordero first painted this as an appeal to President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna so that they could be the director of the Academia de San Carlos. Even though Cordero did not ultimately get the role of academy director, the painting initiated a change in the art world, as more Mexican artists began to paint secular and national events that would later be seen as a form of a historical document. The academy exhibition itself sparked one of the first public debates over secular history paintings, due in part to the propaganda of the postcolonial government. The painting was significant because of the usage of the style in historical paintings, as such this allowed Cordero to use it as a vehicle that perpetuates the postcolonial legislation of racism and classism in Mexico during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Cordero's painting would later be seen as an aid to the construction of Mexico's national identity. While many historical paintings were praised for the innovation that led to civil discourse, it also allowed the bourgeoise elites and the monarchs to promote a social hierarchy within Mexico with the express goal of wanting to assimilate the indigenous population into the political structure.

Speeders is an American traffic crime reality television program that was broadcast on truTV. The program debuted in the mid-2007, and aired through 2009.
Unlike the more action-packed and felony-oriented show COPS, this program consists of clips of individuals being pulled over for minor offenses, most commonly speeding, as well as other things such as seat belt and other equipment violations, and is more comedy-oriented. The entertainment is derived from the interaction between the offender and the police officers. More specifically, the excuses that offenders give for why they allegedly committed the violation. To wrap up most episodes, a "Classic Clip" is shown.

Elizaveta "Liz" Parnov (née Parnova born 9 May 1994 in Moscow) is a Russian-born Australian athlete who competes in pole vault. They qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and competed in the Women's pole vault. Them best height was 4.4m which meant that they were placed 12th in their qualifier. Parnov was eliminated from the pole vault qualifiers in controversial circumstances as officials failed to stop proceedings as rain tumbled down. They were forced to try their third attempt at 4.40m as the rain steadily increased. and in slippery, wet conditions was forced to abandon their next jump.
Early years
Parnov came from a family of athletes and particularly pole vaulters.  They are the niece of Tatiana Grigorieva, who won the silver medal for Australia in the women's pole vault at the 2000 Summer Olympics, and the granddaughter of Natalya Pechonkina, who won the bronze medal for the USSR in the women's 400m at the 1968 Summer Olympics.
Parnov moved to Australia with their family in 1996, at the age of two. They were a competitive pole vaulter from the age of nine, where they vaulted 2.65m. They set two world age bests at 11 years (3.15m in 2005) and 12 years (3.64m in 2006). They cleared four metres just days after their 14th birthday in 2008.
In 2010, they competed at the first Youth Olympic Games and won silver, jumping 4.40m weeks before they turned 16 years old. They were selected to be the Australian flag bearer. Parnov then competed at the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games.
Achievements
Parnov won a silver medal at the 2011 World Youth Championships in Athletics, held in Lille.
Them personal best of 4.50 metres, achieved on 17 February 2012 at Perth, is the Australian under-20 record, surpassing the record of their sister that they had tied in winning the Australian National Championship in 2010. While they were still age 17 at the time of the jump, which surpassed the World Youth Record, they were not eligible for the record because they turned 18 in 2012.
 They are coached by their father Alex Parnov, themselves a former world class pole vaulter. Them older sister Vicky also competes in pole vault and is the 2012 Australian national champion.

The Kentish Psalm, also known as Kentish Psalm 50, is an Old English translation of and commentary on Psalm 51 (numbered 50 in the Septuagint). The poem is extant in a single manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Vespasian D.vi.
Psalm 51, also known as the Miserere ("have mercy") poem, was usually read as a plea by David, asking God for forgiveness for their affair with Bathsheba. The Kentish Psalm begins by recounting that traditional exegetical material, followed by "an expansive paraphrase" of the psalm, and ends with the poet's plea that God "forgive the poet and others just as they forgave David."

The 34th Yukon Legislative Assembly commenced on November 8, 2016, after Yukon voters defeated the Yukon Party government under the leadership of Darrell Pasloski and returned a Liberal majority government under the leadership of Sandy Silver. The Yukon Party was reduced to Official Opposition status and the New Democrats were reduced to Third Party status.
It is the second Liberal government in Yukon history.
First Session
The first session of the 34th Legislative Assembly was convened on January 12, 2017. The single-day session was called by the Premier in order to allow the legislature to elect a new Speaker (Nils Clarke) and establish committee membership from among the MLAs. In a rarity, there was no indication from the government as to what its legislative agenda would look like in its term, as the government signaled its preference to use a late spring sitting for its Speech from the Throne.
The short one-day session drew criticism from the Opposition, which claimed that the government had denied them the opportunity to hold the government to account through either debate or Question Periods.
The Premier later called a second sitting of the Legislative Assembly for April 20; five months since the government was sworn into office. According to the Whitehorse Star, since the beginning of party politics in the Yukon in 1978, no government had gone so long between an election and its first Question Period. The decision drew fire from the Opposition, who labeled it a "profound lack of respect for the legislature." Premier Silver also drew criticism for authorizing nearly $30 million in Special Warrant spending - money approved without legislative oversight - a practice they decried while in Opposition himself. Weeks later, Silver authorized an even larger Special Warrant - this time worth up to $427 million, with $334 million related to operation and maintenance funds and $93 million to capital plans up to June 30, 2017. This new Special Warrant, the largest in Yukon history by more than double, drew severe criticism from the Opposition, who labeled Silver's actions as hypocritical.
Executive Council
The new Executive Council of the Yukon (Cabinet) was sworn in on December 3, 2016. Premier Silver appointed six ministers; a Cabinet that was smaller than their predecessors. The Cabinet was the second gender-balanced Cabinet in Yukon history, following in the footsteps of the previous Liberal Premier Pat Duncan.
The Executive Council was made up of members of the Yukon Liberal Party
Leadership changes
Darrell Pasloski was defeated in their riding of Mountainview on election night and was unable to return to the Yukon Legislative Assembly to lead the Yukon Party. After losing government status and falling to six seats, the Yukon Party appointed Stacey Hassard as interim leader.  They are also interim Leader of the Official Opposition until the Yukon Party chooses a permanent replacement in the spring of 2017.

Norah O'Neill (August 23, 1949 – September 22, 2017) was an American aviator who learned to fly in 1973 and became the first woman pilot for Alaska Central Air (1974) and the Flying Tiger Line (1976).
During their thirty-five years as an airline pilot, Norah amassed 22,000 hours and was the first woman in the world to pilot the Douglas DC-8 (1977) and to fly passengers on the Boeing 747 (August, 1980).
Piloting large jet transports on trans-pacific routes for Flying Tigers resulted in Norah being photographed and interviewed by Asian publications as the first woman airline pilot to land in Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong.
Mentoring and encouraging the female aviators who followed them was an important part of Norah's career. They were one of the founders of the International Society of Women Airline Pilots (ISA + 21) in 1978. They served as vice president of that society for two years and as historian for twenty years.
They were also a contributing member of the Women in Aviation International (WAI) and The Ninety-Nines: International Organization of Women Pilots.
Norah spoke at schools and institutions about women pursuing their dream careers. Norah Ellen O'Neill died on September 22, 2017 at their home in Seattle after a brave battle against colon cancer.
Author
Norah's memoir, Flying Tigress (p.2005), gives a candid account of the many challenges they overcame to become a woman 747 pilot in the male dominated commercial pilot profession.
Norah was a contributing writer for Tiger Tales, An Anecdotal History of the Flying Tiger Line (p.2000) and Heart of a Military Woman (p. 2009).
Honoree
Norah has been featured in exhibits about women in aviation at various air and space museums, including the San Diego Aerospace Museum (1994) and the "Chasing Horizons: Women in Aerospace" exhibit at the Museum of Flight at Boeing Field in Seattle (2010).
In 2009, Norah was inducted into the International Forest of Friendship for their outstanding contributions to aviation.
In 2010 they were one of 100 women pioneers honored by the University of Washington Women's Center at the suffrage centennial gala, "Women Unbound".
Artist
After retirement in 2009, Norah resided in the Pacific Northwest where they created wearable art for Tigress One Designs.

A solid-state transformer (SST), power electronic transformer (PET), or electronic power transformer is actually an AC-to-AC converter, a type of electric power converter that replaces a conventional transformer used in AC electric power distribution. It is more complex than a conventional transformer operating at utility frequency, but it can be smaller and more efficient than a conventional transformer because it operates at high frequency. The main types are "true" AC-to-AC converter (with no DC stages) and AC-to-DC-to-DC-to-AC converter (in which an active rectifier supplies power to a DC-to-DC converter, which supplies power to a power inverter). A solid-state transformer usually contains a transformer, inside the AC-to-AC converter or DC-to-DC converter, which provides electrical isolation and carries the full power. This transformer is smaller due to smaller DC-DC inverting stages between transformer coils, which consequently mean smaller transformer coils required to step up or step down voltages. A solid-state transformer can actively regulate voltage and current. Some can convert single-phase power to three-phase power and vice versa. Variations can input or output DC power to reduce the number of conversions, for greater end-to-end efficiency. A Modular Solid-state transformer consists of several high-frequency transformers and is similar to a Multi-level converter. As a complex electronic circuit, it must be designed to withstand lightning and other surges. Solid-state transformer is an emerging technology.

Allied Film Makers was a shortlived British production company, formed in November 1959, which produced several films. Producer Sydney Box came up the idea of forming a consortium of film-makers that would distribute the films they made. Box had to drop out of the company owing to illness, but four partnerships agreed to join: Basil Dearden and Michael Relph; Jack Hawkins; Richard Attenborough and Bryan Forbes; and Hawkins's brother. Guy Green later joined the Forbes-Attenborough group. Each group put up £5,000 and the Rank Organisation guaranteed distribution.
Several of Allied's films were financially and critically successful, including Whistle Down the Wind (1961). However, there were some financial failures, such as Life for Ruth (1962), and the company was unable to sustain its existence. The total negative cost of its films was £1,042,157, the distributors gross was £1,820,940, giving it a gross profit of £778,783, but the producers had to carry a loss of £142,934.

Robert Lindsay Galloway (22 February 1844 – 24 February 1908) was a Scottish mining engineer and author, the son of William Galloway (1799–1854), a Paisley shawl manufacturer and coal master and Margaret Lindsay (1818–1902) daughter of Thomas Lindsay, a Glasgow brewer. They were born in Paisley, Scotland
Family
Galloway was the younger brother of Sir William Galloway, mining engineer and professor of mining at the University College of Wales in Cardiff. They married Elizabeth Baird, daughter of James Baird, farmer from Sorn in Ayrshire on 14 November 1871. They had two sons, William Galloway born 1872 in Newcastle and James Baird Galloway born in 1874 at Gateshead. Their wife and younger son died in 1875 and their son William was brought up by their maternal grandparents in Sorn, and became a farmer before moving to Essex.
Their half-brother John Galloway who lived in Ayrshire, and younger brothers, T. Lindsay Galloway and James Jack Galloway of Glasgow, were also coal masters. John's son James William Galloway, coalmaster in Ayrshire, and Sir William's son Christian Francis John Galloway, a mining engineer and author in Cardiff were the only members of the next generation to continue in the industry.
Robert Galloway died in Scotland on 24 February 1908 at Bridge of Allan, in Stirlingshire.  They are buried in the churchyard at Logie Kirk north-east of the church.
Mining career
When Galloway was 27 they were a mining engineer and coal master employing five men in 1871 at Sorn in Ayrshire. After they married they moved to County Durham and qualified as a certificated colliery manager and became a member of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers at Ryton on Tyne on 6 December 1873. While they were a mining engineer and colliery manager in the Newcastle area and in Scotland, they became known as a historian specialising in writing about the mining industry and the steam engine.
Literary career
On 30 April 1879 Galloway presented 'Earliest records connected with the working of coal on the banks of the River Tyne' to a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1880 their book 'The Steam Engine and its Inventors' was published. Two years later their 'A History of Coal Mining in Great Britain' was printed.
Galloway helped organize a mining exhibition between 1–24 September 1885 at Burnbank Drill Halls, Glasgow and they wrote a 'Review of the Progressive Improvements of Mining in Scotland' as an introduction to the exhibition catalogue. In 1906 papers relating to the history of the coal trade and the invention of the steam engine were published.

Thomas James Ladnier (May 28, 1900 – June 4, 1939) was an American jazz trumpeter. Hugues Panassié – an influential French critic, jazz historian, and renowned exponent of New Orleans jazz – rated Ladnier, sometime on or before 1956, second only to Louis Armstrong.
Early years
Ladnier was born in Mandeville, Louisiana – located on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, with New Orleans on the opposite shore. Beginning 1914, Ladnier performed in Mandeville's Independence Band at the Dew Drop Dance Hall, led by clarinetist Isidore Frick (né Isidore Fritz; 1890–1940). Trumpeter Bunk Johnson sometimes played with this band and gave young Ladnier lessons. Other members of the band included Louis Fritz (trombone); Joe Fritz (bass); Klebert Cagnolatti (drums) – older brother of trumpeter Cag Cagnolatti (1911–1983); Claybear (sax); Leon Laurent (violin); Buddy Petit (1890–1931) (cornet); Lucien Fritz (drums), Edmond Hall (1901–1967) (clarinet).
In 1917, Ladnier moved with their mother to Chicago and worked in the stockyards.
Early career
Ladnier – on February 1, 1920, in Chicago – married Daisy Mathews (née Hazel B. Mathews; 1902–1979). Around 1921, they became a professional musician. Ladnier played for some time in St. Louis with Charlie Creath. Beginning in 1923, they played in Chicago and made many recordings for Paramount Records with pianist Lovie Austin, accompanying blues singers Ma Rainey, Ida Cox, and Alberta Hunter. For some time, Ladnier played with their inspiration, King Oliver. They emulated Oliver's freak style on the solo in "Play that Thing" with Ollie Power's Harmony Syncopators in September 1923. On March 13, 1923, in Chicago, Ladnier's mother, Willie Ladnier (née Willie Williams; abt. 1879–1923) died from a gun shot at a party quarrel.
Career
Ladnier joined pianist Sam Wooding in 1925 for an extensive tour (Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, and Russia).
This orchestra recorded in Berlin. They returned to New York and became the hot soloist for the Fletcher Henderson orchestra from 1926–1927. They returned to the Sam Wooding Orchestra for another tour (Germany, Austria, Turkey, Switzerland, Italy, and France), then left in January 1929 to work freelance in Paris. A short tour with dancer Harry Fleming brought them to Spain, where they met dancer Louis Douglas and joined them shortly in November 1929 in Paris, acting as orchestra leader. They again free-lanced in Paris until summer 1930 when they joined the Noble Sissle dance band, performing in Paris and London.
They returned to U.S. at the end of 1930 and stayed with Sissle until January 1932. The Sissle orchestra made some recordings in London and New York. Back in America in 1932, Ladnier and Sidney Bechet formed the New Orleans Feetwarmers. During the Depression, they tried to run a tailor shop in Harlem, but neither was interested in business. Ladnier left New York and played in the east, sometimes giving trumpet lessons. For a year, they lived in Stamford, Connecticut.
In 1938, Hugues Panassié, a French critic and record producer who met Ladnier in Paris in 1930, visited New York. They found Ladnier and recorded the Panassié Sessions with Sidney Bechet and Mezz Mezzrow. Ladnier and Bechet participated in the first From Spirituals to Swing concert arranged by John Hammond in December 1938.
Ladnier's last studio recording was on February 1, 1939, in New York as a sideman with singer Rosetta Crawford (de) accompanied by James P. Johnson's Hep Cats (Decca 7584). With Johnson (1894–1955) on piano, their sidemen were Teddy Bunn (1909–1978) (guitar); Elmer James (1910–1954) (double bass); and Zutty Singleton (1898–1975) (drums).
Death
At age 39, Ladnier, died unexpectedly of a heart attack June 4, 1939, while staying at Mezz Mezzrow's apartment at 1 West 126th Street – a six-story, 48-unit residential building in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. It fell upon Mezzrow to take care of Ladnier's belongings and bury him. The memorial service was on Friday, June 9, 1939. Ladnier was buried at Frederick Douglass Memorial Park, Staten Island, an African American cemetery. The first burials there were in 1935. Ladnier's grave is No. 58, range 13, Section H. Despite efforts by Mezzrow and friends, the grave remained unmarked for nearly 69 years. Then, grave marker – square, thick – was placed on Ladnier's grave. It was carved from Nero Granite with no grain structure and is attached to a concrete base. The marker was engraved by Bob Sprauge and was placed on site by Bob Lang.

A by-election occurred in the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Port Adelaide on 11 February 2012. Labor's Susan Close won the seat on a 52.9 percent two-candidate-preferred (TCP) vote. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of former Deputy Premier, Treasurer and state Labor MHA Kevin Foley.
Background
Foley and Mike Rann resigned from their parliamentary seats, which created twin by-elections for 11 February, the other being the 2012 Ramsay by-election. On two-party-preferred vote (TPP) margins of 12.8 and 18.0 points from the 2010 election, considered safe margins on the current pendulum, Labor would have likely retained both seats on the TPP vote based on unchanged statewide Newspoll since the previous election. In the lower house, 24 seats form a majority, the Labor government held 26 of 47 seats. If one or both seats had been lost, Labor would still have retained majority government.
Foley was first elected as the member for the new north-western metropolitan seat of Hart at the 1993 election. Hart was mostly replaced with a recreated Port Adelaide ahead of the 2002 election, and Foley followed most of their constituents into the new seat. From Rann Labor's election to government in 2002 until 2011, Foley became the longest-serving Deputy Premier of South Australia and the third-longest-serving Treasurer of South Australia.
The last by-election was the 2009 Frome by-election, when another former Premier, Rob Kerin, retired from politics. The seat was narrowly won by an independent candidate.
Timeline
Candidates
A record nine candidates nominated for the seat of Port Adelaide. The Liberal Party, Family First Party, and independent candidate Max James, who contested the previous election and gained a primary vote of 26.8 percent, 5.9 percent, and 11.0 percent respectively, did not contest the by-election.
Polling
Three opinion polls were conducted and released by the in-house polling group at The Advertiser, Adelaide's main newspaper:
On 21 September 2011, 642 voters were polled in the seat. Before either major party decided on a candidate, Labor's primary vote was at 37 percent (49.9 percent at the last election), the Liberals on 31 percent (26.8 percent), Johanson on 14 percent, the Greens on 11 percent (6.3 percent), and other independents with 6 percent.
On 18 January 2012, 475 voters were polled in the seat. Since the September 2011 poll, there had been a change of Premier, Labor preselected Close, Foley formally resigned from parliament, and the Liberal Party declined to field a candidate. Labor's primary vote was at 48 percent, Johanson on 23 percent, the LDP on 14 percent, Lawrie on 9 percent, the Greens on 3 percent, with remaining candidates on about 3 percent collectively.
On 1 February 2012, 402 voters were polled in the seat, with Labor on 44 percent, Lawrie on 18 percent, Johanson on 14 percent, the Greens on 12 percent, and remaining candidates including the LDP on about 12 percent collectively.
Under instant runoff voting with voters' full preference allocation, on the above polling and without a Liberal candidate, it was possible for one of several candidates to win. On how-to-vote cards located on all polling booths at each polling place, Briton recommended preferences to the Greens and then Labor, the Greens recommended preferences to Labor, Thomas had a split ticket recommending Labor or Johanson, while the remaining party and independent candidates including Johanson generally recommended preferences between each other in varying order. The by-election was expected to be a close contest on both eliminated candidate preference flows and the final TCP vote.
Result
Labor retained the seat on a 52.9 percent TCP vote against Johanson, with a majority in seven of 11 polling places. Postal votes were included on 13 February, absentee and pre-poll votes were included on 14 February. Preference distributions occurred on 18 February. Results are final.
Neither a TPP nor TCP swing could be produced, as the 2010 result was between Labor and Liberal rather than Labor and independent with no Liberal candidate. An increase or decrease in margins in these situations cannot be meaningfully interpreted as swings. As explained by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Antony Green, when a major party does not contest a by-election, preferences from independents or minor parties that would normally flow to both major parties does not take place, causing asymmetric preference flows. Examples of this are the 2008 Mayo and 2002 Cunningham federal by-elections, with seats returning to TPP form at the next election. This contradicted News Ltd claims of large swings and a potential Liberal Party win in Port Adelaide at the next election. At the 2014 election, Port Adelaide was Labor's 7th safest seat on a margin of over 10 percent. Johanson unsuccessfully contested the neighbouring seat of Lee at the 2014 election with a primary vote of 11.2 percent.

The Liberal Party () was a political party in Hungary between 1875 and 1906.
History
The party was established in February 1875 by a merger of the Deák Party and the Left Centre. It won a huge majority in the 1875 elections, with former Left Centre member Kálmán Tisza becoming Prime Minister. Kálmán Tisza remained Prime Minister until 1890, and using violence,. The Liberal Party was a main supporter of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the partnership with Austria. However the Austro-Hungarian Compromise remained bitterly unpopular among the ethnic Hungarian voters, and the continuous successes of these pro-compromise Liberal Party in the Hungarian parliamentary elections caused long lasting frustration for Hungarians. The ethnic minorities had the key role in the political maintenance of the compromise in Hungary, because they were able to vote the pro-compromise Liberal Party into the position of the majority/ruling parties of the Hungarian parliament. The pro-compromise liberal parties were the most popular among ethnic minority voters, however i.e. the Slovak, Serb and Romanian minority parties remained unpopular among their own ethnic minority voters. The Liberal Party was often called as the "Imperialist Party", in Hungary it meant to being supporter of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, and had a negative connotation as a supporter of the political and economic interests of Austrian Empire, and the Habsburg Emperor, hence the ethnic Hungarian voters mocked the party as "the Imperialists". In the 1905 elections, the coalitions of Hungarian nationalist parties like the Independence and '48 Party won the most seats. The nationalist coalition was supported by the overwhelming majority of ethnic Hungarian voters. In 1906 King Franz Joseph announced a new election, which was won by the nationalist coalition again. Due to these defeat at the parliamentary election, the Liberal Party has disbanded itself, and it was reorganized under a new name: National Party of Work in 1910.
The party passed legislation for Jewish emancipation and appointed Jews to parliament (both the upper and lower houses) in 1867. In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidate.

The Fairmile Type-B motor launch was a type of motor launch (often referred to as MLs) built by British boatbuilder Fairmile Marine and others during the Second World War for the Royal Navy for coastal operations.
Design
While the Type A had been designed entirely by Fairmile, the Type B design had come from Bill Holt of the Admiralty based on the lines of a destroyer hull and the detailed design and production was taken on by Fairmile.
Like all their designs it was based on total prefabrication so individual components could be contracted out to small factories for production and these arranged as kits that would be delivered to various boatyards for assembly and fitting out.
Altogether approximately 650 boats were built between 1940 and 1945. Like the A Type, the B Type were initially intended as submarine chasers, so the boats were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) as standard. Their main armament initially reflected their anti-submarine focus, with 12 depth charges, a single QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun aft, and one set of twin 0.303-in machine guns. The specifications given are for the original 1940 British version. As the war moved on, the vessels were adapted to other roles and the armament was modified and upgraded such as the replacement of the 3-pounder with one or more 20 mm Oerlikon cannon and removal of the ASDIC dome for more clearance as minesweepers. Some boats were configured as motor torpedo boats.
Service
The first Fairmile B motor launch was completed in September 1940, with a further 38 from the first two production batches entering service before the end of the year.
All boats were essentially the same, although they could be adapted to serve in several roles by the expedient of having pre-drilled rails on their decks spaced to allow the fitting of various types of armaments. Although their armament initially reflected their main anti-submarine mission, nine of them were fitted with torpedo tubes taken from ex-US Town-class destroyers; they formed the 2nd ML Flotilla tasked with anti-invasion duty, until the threat had passed.
During the Siege of Malta, they were used to sweep a narrow channel ahead of heavier minesweepers which widened the channel. The heavier minesweepers were initially the remnants of the Malta trawler force, then fleet minesweepers that arrived with a convoy from Gibraltar. The launches were able to pass over the mines whereas many trawler losses had been caused by the leading ship hitting a mine.
A number served in the St Nazaire Raid as assault transports, but their light construction meant that they suffered heavily; 12 B motor launches were lost in the action, out of 16 deployed.
During the Normandy landings a number of MLs were designated as navigation launches. These motor launches guided the landing craft onto the correct beaches. For this task the craft were fitted with splinter mats at the front for added protection. The main armament - the 3-pounder gun - was moved to the bow, an Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was fitted amidships and a Bofors 40 mm gun was installed at the stern. Smoke canister apparatus was installed at the rear of the craft and the number of depth charges was reduced. See main picture above of ML303 in this configuration.
Many were built as rescue motor launches with small sickbays aft of the engine room coaming, and classified as RML (rescue motor launch). These were numbered in the series RML492 to RML500, and RML511 to RML553. Several more were converted to use as War Office ambulance launches with larger sickbays.
British Colonial or Commonwealth-built Fairmile B motor launches
Canadian built Fairmiles
Originally designed for the Royal Navy (RN) by W.J. Holt of the British Admiralty and built by British boatbuilder Fairmile Marine, during the Second World War 88 Fairmile B motor launches, with slight modifications for Canadian climatic and operational conditions, were built in Canada for service with the RCN in home waters. The first thirty-six Canadian Fairmile B type were designated and painted up as CML 01-36 (coastal motor launch). Eight Canadian Fairmiles (Q 392-Q 399) were built by Le Blanc for the RN and were transferred under Lend-Lease to the US Navy as US coastal protection had been depleted by transferring ships to the Royal Navy for convoy work. The US Navy used the Canadian-built Fairmiles as submarine chasers (SC1466-1473).
Other British Colonial or Commonwealth built Fairmiles
At least two were built in the British colony of Bermuda, home to the dockyard and Admiralty house of the North America and West Indies Station, by what was to become Burland, Conyers & Marirea, Ltd.
New Zealand built 12 boats. These were used in New Zealand waters and around the Solomon Islands, and included HMNZS Maori and Kahu.
In Australia 35 boats entered service from October 1942. They were employed on routine patrols, convoy escorts, running special forces in and out of Japanese-held areas, in Papua New Guinea, boom defence patrols in harbours at home and abroad, courier operations, survey work, and raiding Japanese-held coasts. Of note the surrender of Japanese forces in the South West Pacific. On 10 September 1945, Rear-Admiral S. Sato, commanding officer of Kairiru and Muschu Islands, New Guinea, surrendered the Japanese forces on the islands to Major-General H. C. H. Robertson, commander of 6th Division on board the ML 805.
At least six boats (ML380-383,829 and 846) were built by South Africa and commissioned during November 1942. These were sent as the 49th Fairmile Flotilla (SANF) to Burma and deployed along the Arakan coast. The boats saw much action in support of ground forces and disrupting Japanese supply lines.
The Imperial Japanese Navy salvaged two that had been sunk and placed them in service.
A number of boats were built in Egypt by Thomas Cook & Son, who had a Cairo shipyard for constructing Nile tourist craft. Armament was fitted in Port Said. The first three to enter service in 1942 were MLs 355, 353 and 348. Post war they were often taken on as pleasure boats and a number of Fairmile Bs are on the National Register of Historic Vessels.
Fourteen Fairmile B were operated by the Italian Guardia di Finanza naval service, between 1947 and the 1980s.
Surviving examples
Four currently survive in the United Kingdom, two of which are in excellent condition. One is RML497. Many others of the type are known to survive around the world, some still in commercial service as tour boats.

West Adams Terrace is a neighborhood in Los Angeles. Dating back to 1905, it contains seven Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments, one property on the National Register of Historic Places and one Green Book property. In 2003, the neighborhood was designated a Historic Preservation Overlay Zone.
History
The earliest mention of West Adams Terrace in the Los Angeles Times was on July 16, 1905. It describes the area as a "beautiful residence subdivision" with lots being sold for $40,000. Sold by the Mesa Land Company, the community is noted as the "last piece of high ground on Adams Street". During the next few years, the Times continued to report sales in the neighborhood. On March 6, 1910, the Times announced that architect A.B. Benton had completed plans for a residence for F.M. Vale on Eleventh Avenue in West Adams Terrace.
In the 1950s, a Green Book property serving African-American tourists was located in the neighborhood. The name West Adams Terrace continued to be used for residential sales in both the Los Angeles Times and the Los Angeles Sentinel.
In 2003, the city adopted The West Adams Terrace HPOZ (Historical Preservation Overlay Zone). The designation reflected the high concentration of Craftsman and Colonial Revival architectural styles as well as the neighborhood's high level of architectural integrity from the period in which the properties were constructed (1887-1951).
Geography
In 1905, the Times noted that West Adams Terrace was located between Adams Street on the south and Twenty-third Street on the north and between Eighth Avenue on the east and Twelfth Avenue on the west. In 1906, the Times noted a different boundary - Thirteenth Avenue on the west.
In 2002, the city considered historic designation for the neighborhood. The study area was defined as: the north side of West Adams Boulevard on the south, the Santa Monica I-10 Freeway on the north, the rear lot line of the parcels on the west side of Thirteenth Avenue on the west, and the west side of Western Avenue on the east. On December 2, 2003, the Los Angeles City Council adopted The West Adams Terrace HPOZ. The final boundaries are a revised version of the study area: West Adams Terrace is bounded by 13th Avenue to the west, the Santa Monica Freeway to the north, Gramercy Place, 24th Street, and Western Avenue to the east, and West Adams Boulevard to the south.

Seventy-First Township is a civil township in Cumberland County, North Carolina. The township was named from the Scottish immigrants who were descendants of the 71st Regiment of the Royal Army. The 71st Regiment of Foot was first formed in 1758 from the 2nd Battalion, 32nd Regiment of Foot. Soon after formation the 71st Foot was part of a raid on the French coast at Cherbourg during the Seven Years' War. After taking the fort and destroying the docks the regiment reboarded and returned to England before it took part in a similar raid on Belleisle in 1761. In 1763 the 71st became a Regiment of Invalids before disbanding in 1768. The regiment was raised again at Inverness, Stirling and Glasgow by Lieutenant-General Simon Fraser of Lovat as the 71st Regiment of Foot in 1775. It was intended for service in the American Revolutionary War and was well received in Glasgow: "Their conduct was so laudable and exemplary as to gain the affections of the inhabitants, between whom and the soldiers the greatest cordiality prevailed." The regiment embarked for North America in April 1776, fought in New York at the Battle of Long Island, Brandywine in 1777, Savannah in 1778. The regiment was also present at the Siege of Charleston in March 1780, the Battle of Camden in August 1780 and the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781. It next fought at the Battle of Guilford Court House in March 1781 where one officer of the 71st Regiment claimed that "one half of the Highlanders dropped on that spot." The regiment's last action was at the Siege of Yorktown in September 1781.
Scottish Highlanders had previously fought a war of rebellion against the British in the 1700s but were defeated at the Battle of the Culloden Moore in 1746. After their lands were confiscated; their clan chiefs executed and kilts and bagpipes outlawed, many of the Highlands Scots emigrated to North America and settled in the Sandhills of North Carolina.
The population was 93,772 at the 2010 census.

Smoke & Mirrors is a 2020 studio album by The Fizz, formerly Bucks Fizz. It is the third album by the group under the name The Fizz and the second as a threesome consisting of original members Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston. Released on 6 March 2020, the album entered the overall Official Albums Chart at No.29, the Official Album Sales Chart at No.6, the Official Vinyl Albums Chart at No.5 and the Official Independent Album Chart at No.3. Its Sales chart position of No.6 is the highest entry of any previous Bucks Fizz/The Fizz albums.
Background
After the success of the group's comeback album The F-Z of Pop, which saw the group return to the UK charts for the first time in 31 years, talks immediately began for a follow-up album with producer Mike Stock. Whilst The F–Z of Pop contained three re-recordings of past Bucks Fizz hits as well as eight new compositions, it was agreed that moving forward the group would now focus solely on new material. The group went back into the studio in summer 2018 to begin recording for the new album. Fairly early on into the recording process Jay Aston was diagnosed with mouth cancer and would require surgery and extensive treatment. During this time it had also been discussed to bring forward plans for a Christmas album. Production quickly began to allow the producers to record all of Aston's vocal parts for the release before they had to undergo surgery which would leave them unable to sing for the foreseeable future. The tracks were then finished with Baker and Nolan providing all the backing vocals for 15 songs which would become Christmas with The Fizz.
In 2019, plans were made for The Fizz to return to the studio to finish recording the album now that Aston had recovered sufficiently to begin singing again. It also gave them the chance to complete their lead vocal on the track "From Here to Eternity", which they had recorded a guide vocal for on the day they received their cancer diagnosis.
Recording of Smoke & Mirrors was completed in September 2019, it was mastered at Metropolis, London and scheduled for release in the new year to avoid the Christmas market. The album went on pre-sale on 10 January 2020 with the instant grat-track "The World We Left Behind" available immediately with pre-orders. The album was available on limited edition blue vinyl as well as standard black vinyl, CD and limited edition cassette tape.
On 30 January 2020, "Winning Ways" was released from the album, debuting with BBC Radio 2 exclusive. The video premiered the next day on the Bucks Fizz VEVO channel. On 28 February the track "T.O.T.P." was released with an accompanying music video which pays comedic homage to the BBC show Top of the Pops.
On 6 March 2020 the album was released and entered the overall Official Albums Chart at No.29, the UK Sales Chart at No.6, the UK Vinyl Chart at No.5 and the Independent Chart at No.3. The album also scored the No.6 position on the Official Scottish Album Charts.
Of the album Classic Pop Magazine said "The Fizz are back firing on all cylinders with Smoke & Mirrors – an album of shiny new pop bangers, the latest fruit of a fertile collaboration with legendary hitmaker Mike Stock". Commenting on the songs, it said that "All We Ever Can Do" and "Boomerang" illustrate the group's "extraordinary resiliance", while "The World We Left Behind" sees them "laying to rest a few old ghosts".

The Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre is "one of Europe's leading specialist libraries on migration, race and ethnicity" open to members of the public as well as to students and researchers. It increases access to and visibility of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) histories with a growing archive of material relating to the local area. Its sister organisation, the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Education Trust offers advice, training, networking opportunities, project support, exhibitions, publications and events to help community organisations to record and share their heritage. The Centre is part of the University of Manchester and is located in Manchester Central Library, where it is part of the Archives+ partnership. The current head of both the Centre and the Trust is Dr Safina Islam, who was appointed in March 2019.
History
Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre (AIURRRC)
The impetus to create the Centre arose from the need to find a home for the increasingly large personal collection of books and other material about race relations which had been collected since the 1960s by Lou Kushnick OBE, then Professor of Sociology (and subsequently Honorary Professorial Fellow in Race Relations) at the University of Manchester. In discussion with colleagues, Kushnick considered donating the material to the University of Manchester Library, but decided they would like it to be readily available to people outside the University as well as to students and researchers, envisaging a collection that would "have huge research value, but also be instrumental in celebrating cultures and combating racism". They approached Professor Martin Harris, then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester, who agreed to provide rent-free space to support the initiative.
The Centre was established (as the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Archive) in 1999, with Lou Kushnick as its first Director.
Initially based on the university campus, the Centre had a number of homes, including at the University of Manchester's Sackville Street Building. It moved to its present location in Manchester Central Library when that building reopened following refurbishment in 2014, making access to the Centre by members of the public more readily available than before.
The Centre is named after Ahmed Iqbal Ullah, a 13-year-old pupil of Burnage High School in Manchester, who was murdered in a playground incident in 1986. Ullah's death and the public inquiry into it highlighted deficiencies in UK race relations education of the time. The name was adopted for the Centre because Kushnick "wanted to send a signal" and aimed for the material to be used "in outreach programmes to teachers in schools with limited resources [and] a narrow curriculum [to] encourage an environment where all children could flourish".
The Centre and Trust's former Co-Director, Jacquleine Ould-Okojie retired in August 2018. They had been involved in the Centre since its inception and was previously the organisation's Education Coordinator.
Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Education Trust (AIUET)
The Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Education Trust (AIUET) is the charitable trust linked to the AIURRRC. It was created in 2001 and is a registered charity governed by a board of trustees. It functions as the outreach arm of the Centre and delivers a wide range of activities and projects that include:
supporting heritage projects to identify, collect and archive the histories of BAME communities in the region;
activities across schools to promote knowledge and understanding of black history, citizenship and multicultural issues;
events and exhibitions that promote knowledge and understanding of black history.
The AIUET receives funding from Manchester City Council and the University of Manchester. The funding is governed by a collaboration agreement between the three parties. AIUET has also been successful in securing National Lottery Heritage Fund (NLHF) grants for community heritage projects. These include:
Yemeni Roots Salford Lives (2010–2012). A project exploring the history of one of Greater Manchester's oldest communities.
Legacy of Ahmed (2015–2016). A project exploring the impact of Ahmed's murder, 30 years on. Learning from this project was shared in the published paper Community partnerships and collection development in the Legacy of Ahmed Project
Coming in From the Cold (2017–2021). A project that supports BAME communities across Greater Manchester to develop and archive their heritage projects. The first phase of this project included an audit of BAME-focused heritage projects and collections in Greater Manchester and a report on the distribution of BAME populations in Greater Manchester.
Library
The library has more than 14,780 titles, with subjects ranging from culture, identity, history, politics and local studies. Collections held by the Centre include unique primary resources and extensive secondary resources on the theme of local, national and international race relations and migration. Approximately two-thirds of the library collection is loanable to anyone with a Manchester Libraries card. Reference only material is clearly labelled and can be studied anywhere within the library. Collection highlights include:
Materials documenting the debates around race and schooling in the UK from the 1960s to the present, as well as teaching materials which are made available to school teachers to enhance their educational activities.
A wide range of materials relating to the US Civil Rights Movement, including material on the struggle for civil rights stretching from long before the American Civil War to the present day.
A significant collection of published journals and magazines, including hard-to-find specialist publications.
The library of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) was acquired by the Centre when the CRE closed in 2007, and includes extensive historical material documenting the changing issues around race relations in the UK, such as documents relating to inquiries, and reports published by the CRE, Runnymede Trust and other bodies.
Archives
The Centre is a partner in Archives+ which brings together a number of organisations to provide a holistic range of archive and heritage services from its city centre location in Manchester Central Library.
The Centre's Archives include books as well as magazines, reports, posters, photographs, oral histories, personal and organisational papers and ephemera. Highlights are:

Norman Ray Harris (October 14, 1947 – March 20, 1987) was an American guitarist, producer, music arranger and songwriter, closely associated with Philly soul. They were a founding member of MFSB, the Philadelphia studio band, and one of the Baker-Harris-Young record production trio.
Career
Harris was a leading arranger for Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's Philadelphia International Records label in its early years during the 1970s and played guitar on many recording sessions. They also played with Vince Montana's Salsoul Orchestra when several members of MFSB left after financial disagreements with Gamble-Huff in 1974. They later founded their own production company in the mid-1970s called The Harris Machine. In 1980, they released their only solo album, The Harris Machine, on Philadelphia International.
Harris started teaching themselves guitar in their teens and began their career in local clubs, often with bassist Ronnie Baker and later drummer Earl Young, and in the house band at the Uptown Theatre in Philadelphia. They then became a session musician as the Philadelphia recording scene expanded.
They later arranged and produced soul and R&B acts during the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, including Blue Magic (with whom they had their biggest success, "Sideshow", a No. 1 R&B hit), The Trammps, First Choice, The Dells, The Four Tops, The Temptations, The Whispers,
Eddie Kendricks, Barbara Mason, Curtis Mayfield, Bunny Sigler, Joe Simon, South Shore Commission, Exeuctive Suite, and their cousin, Major Harris, a former member of The Delfonics. They also produced several acts, including: Loleatta Holloway, Eddie Holman, Double Exposure and Love Committee, for Salsoul Records, who distributed their subsidiary label, Gold Mind Records.
They died of cardiovascular disease at the age of 39.
In 2016, Harris was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.

Albert Baldwin Dod (March 24, 1805 – November 20, 1845) was an American Presbyterian theologian and professor of mathematics.
Early life
Dod was born on March 24, 1805 in Mendham, New Jersey. They were the son of Daniel Dod (1778–1823) and Nancy (née Squire) Dod (1780–1851). Their mother was the sister of Dr. Ezra Squire, of Caldwell, New Jersey.
Career
After a religious awakening while at college in Princeton, where they graduated with the class of 1822, Dod became affiliated with the influential Princeton Theologians. They published frequently in the group's chief outlet, the Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review, edited by Charles Hodge. Among their publications there, an attack on Transcendentalism (perhaps written with James Waddel Alexander; published in the January 1839 issue) attracted wide notice and was later republished by Andrews Norton.
For much of their life they taught mathematics at the College, and participated in theological discussion and preaching at the Seminary, in Princeton. The Doctorate in Divinity, though, was conferred on them by the University of North Carolina and by New York University.
Personal life
Dod married Caroline Smith Bayard (1807–1891), the daughter of Samuel Bayard (1766-1840) and granddaughter of Continental Congressman John Bubenheim Bayard (1738-1808), all descendants of Peter Stuyvesant. Together, Albert and Caroline had eight children:
Martha Bayard Dod (1831–1899), who married Edwin Augustus Stevens (1795–1868), founder of Stevens Institute of Technology.
Caroline Bayard Dod (1832–1859), who married Richard Stockton (1824–1876), son of Robert F. Stockton and grandson of Richard Stockton, both U.S. senators.
Albert Baldwin Dod (1835–1880), a Captain during the U.S. Civil War who married Elizabeth A. Mcintosh on June 16, 1858.
Julia Washington Dod (1836–1837), who died young.
Samuel Bayard Dod (1837–1907), who married Isabella Williamson Green (1840–1883), the granddaughter of Ashbel Green, 8th President of Princeton University.
Susan Bratford Dod (1840–1912), who married their brother-in-law Richard Stockton after their sister's death in 1859.
Charles Hodge Dod (1841–1864), a Captain on the staff of Maj. General Winfield Scott Hancock during the civil war who died in service.
Mary Dod (b. 1843).
Dod died of pleurisy after a brief illness on November 20, 1845.
Legacy
In 1869, their son Samuel Bayard Dod (Princeton Class of 1857) established an Endowed Professorship at Princeton University in mathematics in memory of him. In 1926, their great-grandson, Richard Stockton III, commissioned a bust of Dod which was placed at Dod Hall, the undergraduate dormitory named in their honor.

A lake-burst (, ) is a phenomenon referred to in Irish mythology, in which a previously non-existent lake comes into being, often when a grave is being dug. Part of the lake-burst stories may originate in sudden hydrographic changes around limestone-based inland plains or turloughs. Other so-called lake-bursts refer to marine estuaries, bays and inlets, such as Galway Bay, Strangford Lough, Dundrum Bay, Belfast Lough, Waterford Harbour and the mouth of the River Erne. Some of these coastal districts were renowned for the drowned prehistoric forests, which gave rise to several flood-myths.
Medieval bards had a special genre of lake-burst poems called tomamond. More or less elaborate 11th- or 12th-century narratives have survived around Galway Bay, Lough Neagh and Lough Ree, which seem to be related to similar (though less ancient) stories in Wales (Cantre'r Gwaelod, Llys Helig, Bala Lake, Llynclys), Cornwall (Lyonesse), Brittany (Ys) and Normandy (Forêt de Scissy). A late 16th-century Frisian legend, probably borrowed from Irish examples, refers to the origins of the Zuiderzee. Other Irish texts refer to the eruption of the River Boyne and other rivers. The poems of the lake-burst of Lough Erne and the eruption of Brí (where the legendary character Midir lived) have been lost. In Wales the flood myth is elaborated in the story of Dwyfan and Dwyfach, who saved people and animals from the great deluge caused by the monster Avanc living in Llyn Llion (possibly Bala Lake). Its Irish counterpart as told in the Lebor Gabála Érenn only links up with the Biblical story of Noah's flood.
The theme relates to the classical story of the warrior Marcus Curtius, who was said to have thrown themselves in the Lacus Curtius near the Forum Romanum in order to stop a chasm made by the river Tiber. A similar story was told about King Midas.
Identification
Not every lake mentioned in medieval sources can be identified with certainty. Loch Lainglinne, for instance, might be another reference to Belfast Lough, which was known as Loch Laoigh or Loch Laigh.
Apparently, medieval Irishmen were convinced that almost all of their lakes had emerged after Noah's flood. Their myths suggest that land reclamation and deforestation went hand in hand with the seasonal inundation of low-lying plains. According to the corrupted text of Lebor Gabála Érenn king Partholón found only three lakes or bays: Loch Fordremain in Sliab Mis of Mumhan (Tralee Bay), Loch Lumnig (probably Loch Lurgan or Galway Bay) on Tir Find and Loch Cera or Findloch over the borders of Irrus. Interestingly enough, several major lakes and outlets, such as Lough Corrib, Lough Derg (Shannon), Shannon Estuary and Killary Harbour are not mentioned in any known myth. This may imply that at least some lake-bursts mentioned have been wrongly identified with smaller lakes, where, in fact, they may have been referring to one of the major lakes. The cave of St Patrick's Purgatory on Station Island in Lough Derg (Ulster), moreover, was identified in the Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii as the entrance to the Underworld.
The plains that supposedly had been drowned, had special names, which have been preserved in a 16th-century manuscript.

Dampoort is a neighbourhood in the city of Ghent in Belgium.
Nowadays it is mainly known as the location of railway station Gent-Dampoort and a major crossroads. In former times it used to be the eastern gate of the city (poort being Dutch for "gate"). It opened the city towards the region of Waasland (or Land van Waas) and Antwerp.
It is also where the commercial seaport of Ghent links with the inner-city canals. Close to the Dampoort is Portus Ganda, the yachting area of the city, which opened in 2005, at the former confluence of the rivers Schelde () and Leie.
The Dampoort neighbourhood is characterised by a bustling mix of people from different origins: Turkish, Afghans, Eastern Europeans, native Belgians, Moroccan and practically any other nationality the city harbours.

WVXM (89.1 FM) was a radio station licensed to Middlebury, Vermont. The station was owned by Vermont Public Radio, and carried classical music through the VPR Classical network.
The 89.1 FM facility signed on in April 2014. VPR Classical was previously heard in Middlebury on 90.1 FM; following the move, the two facilities swapped call letters (with 90.1, the original WOXM, becoming WVXM) and 90.1 left the air. By October 2015, VPR had discovered that WOXM was interfering with the Vermont Electric Power Company's emergency response radio system; on October 12, 2015, VPR Classical was moved back to the 90.1 facility.
On June 28, 2019, the two stations swapped call signs again, with 89.1 FM changing back from WOXM to WVXM. At the same time, Vermont Public Radio surrendered the license for the now-WVXM to the FCC, who cancelled it on July 2, 2019.

Bhandup is a railway station on the Central line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network. A few fast trains stop at Bhandup station, mostly during the peak hours.
History
Bhandup's relationship with trains goes back to the very earliest times, for it was during a visit to Bhandup in 1843 that George Clark, Chief Engineer to the Bombay Government, first had the idea of linking Mumbai to Thane by railway. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company ran its first train on 16 April 1853.

Winsen (Luhe) () is the capital of the district of Harburg, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated on the small river Luhe, near its confluence with the Elbe, approx. 25 km southeast of Hamburg, and 20 km northwest of Lüneburg.
History
Winsen was first mentioned in a document of the Diocese of Verden in 1158. Winsen Castle, first mentioned in 1315, was built at a crossing over the Luhe to protect the harbor. At the beginning of the 15th century, the Church of Saint Mary was built.
In 1593, Dorothea of Denmark, widow of William the Younger, moved into Winsen Castle and lived there until their death in 1617. During this time, the Marstall (stables) was built. In the Thirty Years' War, Danes invaded the town and burned down about 25 houses.
On 1 May 1847, Winsen was connected to the Hanover–Hamburg railway of the Royal Hanoverian State Railways.
On 1 July 1972, thirteen previously independent villages, Bahlburg, Borstel, Gehrden, Hoopte, Laßrönne, Luhdorf, Pattensen, Rottorf, Roydorf, Sangenstedt, Scharmbeck, Stöckte and Tönnhausen, were incorporated into the town.
Main sights
Winsen Castle
Winsen Castle was first mentioned explicitly in 1315. Another document from 1277 indicates that the castle probably already existed at that time. The castle served long periods of its history as an administrative building and was the seat of Großvögte, Amtmänner and Landräte. Today, it is the seat of the Amtsgericht; therefore, the rooms are generally not open to the public. In 2008, an exhibition was opened in the castle tower.
Marstall
The Marstall was originally used for horse and carriage. Although a timber-beam shows the year 1599, the year of construction is unknown. Today, the four-story half-timbered building contains the tourist information center, the public library, the museum of local history and an event room. On the eastern gable, a modern carillon is installed.
Church of Saint Mary
The construction of the late Gothic hall church started around 1415. The choir was covered in 1437, the nave in 1465. The church has only one side aisle and the vault of the nave never was finished. In the 1950s, the interior decoration was changed. The colorful windows were designed and produced by Claus Wallner between 1958 and 1966. The altarpiece, the baptismal font and the bronze pulpit plates were made by Fritz Fleer. Friedrich Meinecke, born in Winsen, created the statue of Luther. Like the 62-meter-high neo-Gothic bell tower, it was completed in 1899.
Blaufärberhaus
The oldest still existing residential house is located in the Luhestraße. The Blaufärberhaus (blue-dyer's house) was built on the Luhe island immediately after the great town fire in 1585. The gable is richly decorated with Renaissance motifs. The building is not open to the public.
Saint George's Chapel
Formerly outside the town, a leprosarium, the St. Georg foundation, was established in 1401. The chapel was first documented in 1445. The present hospital building was constructed in 1766, the chapel was built in 1750 and got its current appearance in 1903.
Further buildings
Historic buildings of the old town are situated on the Luhe island, specifically in Deichstraße, Mühlenstraße, Luhestraße, and Kehrwieder.
The Alte Stadtschule (old town-school) was erected in Eckermannstraße in 1893 in historicism style. It is the oldest school in Winsen and nowadays a pure primary school. In the upper floor of the main building, there is a historic auditorium that is used for events. On the opposite side of the street, the gym of the MTV Winsen built in 1889 was located. It was destroyed to the ground in a fire in April 2016. The half-timbered building was the first gymnasium in Winsen.
The historic town hall was built in 1896. The former Amtsschreiberhaus ([scrivener]'s house) was mentioned in a document in 1714. The hotel "Zum Weißen Ross" already existed in 1684. It was the residence of Edwin von Manteuffel, commander of the Prussian Army in Austro-Prussian War, in 1866. The carefully restored Buchengasse, a connection between Rathausstraße and Plankenstraße, invites lingering. The ducal watermill was first mentioned in 1385 and moved to the southern end of the Luhe island (Mühlenstraße) in 1750. The brick-facade was added in 1940.

The is an electric multiple unit (EMU) train type operated by the private railway operator Shin-Keisei Electric Railway since December 2019. It shares a common design with the Keisei 3100 series.
Design
The trains were jointly designed with Keisei Electric Railway and feature Shin-Keisei's "gentle pink" corporate design.
Formations
The 80000 series is formed as follows, with four motored cars and two trailer cars per set.
Technical specifications
The trains use SiC–VVVF inverters which control 3-phase AC motors. The motor inverters used on the 80000 series offer a 19% reduction in power consumption over the IGBT–VVVF inverters used on the N800 series.
Interior
Seating accommodation consists of longitudinal seating throughout, providing a seating capacity of 43 in the end cars and 49 in the intermediate cars. A wheelchair space is provided near the crew compartment of the first car, and intermediate cars feature a free space for wheelchairs as well as strollers.
The seats are of a high-back design; their backs are higher than those of the N800 series. They are also thickened to make sitting in them more comfortable. The seat partitions and vestibules are made of tempered glass to create a sense of openness. Unlike the Keisei 3100 series's seats, the 80000 series's do not feature a foldable portion for storing luggage.
The interior also includes 17-inch passenger information displays, security cameras, and ceiling-mounted Plasmacluster ion generators.
History
In April 2019, Shin-Keisei announced its plans to introduce a new six-car train in Winter 2019.
Delivery from the Nippon Sharyo plant in Toyokawa began in October 2019.
A public trial run was to be held on 21 December 2019, and the first unit entered service on 27 December.
The Keisei 3100 series used on the Narita Sky Access Line are eight-car EMUs based on this series of trains.
A second set was built in October 2021 to replace 8000 series set 8512.

Stochastic Approach for Link-Structure Analysis (SALSA) is a web page ranking algorithm designed by R. Lempel and S. Moran to assign high scores to hub and authority web pages based on the quantity of hyperlinks among them.
SALSA is inspired by two other link-based ranking algorithms, namely HITS and PageRank, in the following ways:
like HITS, the algorithm assigns two scores to each web page: a hub score and an authority score. An authority is a page which is significantly more relevant to a given topic than other pages whereas a hub is a page which contains many links to authorities;
like HITS, SALSA also works on a focused subgraph which is topic-dependent. This focused subgraph is obtained by first finding a set of pages most relevant to a given topic (e.g. take the top-n pages returned by a text-based search algorithm) and then augmenting this set with web pages that link directly to it and with pages that are linked directly from it. Because of this selection process, the hub and authority scores are topic-dependent;
like PageRank, the algorithm computes the scores by simulating a random walk through a Markov chain that represents the graph of web pages. SALSA however works with two different Markov chains: a chain of hubs and a chain of authorities. This is a departure from HITS's notions of hubs and authorities based on a mutually reinforcing relationship.
Properties
SALSA can be seen as an improvement of HITS.
It is computationally lighter since its ranking is equivalent to a weighted in/out degree ranking. The computational cost of the algorithm is a crucial factor since HITS and SALSA are computed at query time and can therefore significantly affect the response time of a search engine. This should be contrasted with query-independent algorithms like PageRank that can be computed off-line.
SALSA is less vulnerable to the Tightly Knit Community (TKC) effect than HITS. A TKC is a topological structure within the Web that consists of a small set of highly interconnected pages. The presence of TKCs in a focused subgraph is known to negatively affect the detection of meaningful authorities by HITS.
The Twitter Social network uses a SALSA style algorithm to suggest accounts to follow.

The Walden Veterans' Memorial Bridge, sometimes referred as the Walden High Bridge, from its predecessor, carries NY 52 over the Wallkill River in the Orange County village of Walden, New York, United States. It is the more heavily used of the two bridges in the village.
The current bridge was built between 2003 and 2005 when its predecessor, a steel truss bridge built in the 1920s, had to be completely torn down due to severe deterioration of the support foundations. While construction was underway, traffic on Route 52 was diverted down Oak Street to the Walden Low Bridge. The new bridge features some architectural improvements, such as lighting and wide sidewalks on both sides.
The bridge was officially renamed in honor of the village's war veterans under state law passed in 2004.
Banners naming individual residents and commemorating their service flutter from the decorative lampposts along the bridge.

Rebecca Wilder Holmes (June 12, 1871 – January 17, 1953) was an American musician. They were a violinist, and taught at Mount Holyoke College and Smith College. They were founder and first director of the Smith College Symphony Orchestra.
Early life and education
Holmes was born in Benson, Vermont, the daughter of Henry M. Holmes and Elizabeth Wilder Holmes. Them father was a clergyman. Them maternal uncle Solon Wilder was a composer, hymn writer, and music educator; their cousin Harris Hawthorne Wilder was a biology professor at Smith College. They trained as a violinist in Berlin, under Joseph Joachim, with further studies under Hugo Heermann in Frankfurt and Julius Eichberg in Boston.
Career
Holmes taught and played violin concerts in New England in the 1890s. They were described as a "gifted young violinist", "making rapid strides to the front in their profession", in 1900. They played a Guarneri violin made in 1721 and an Amati violin made in 1660 at a chamber concert in 1904.
They were a professor of music at Smith College from the 1890s until their retirement in 1936. They were founder and director of the Smith College Symphony Orchestra. They also taught violin at Mount Holyoke College. From 1924 to 1925 they taught at the Springfield National Institute of Musical Art. They had a well-known collection of antique instruments and old musical manuscripts, many of them gathered on visits to Europe.

Since 1963, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has assigned local names to a tropical cyclone should it move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N, even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it. All three agencies that have assigned names to tropical cyclones within the Western Pacific have retired the names of significant tropical cyclones, with the PAGASA retiring names if a cyclone has caused at least (~20 million USD) in damage and/or have caused at least 300 deaths within the Philippines.
Since 1963, the naming lists have been revised in 1979, 1985, 2001 (after a contest called the "Name a Bagyo Contest", conducted by the PAGASA in 1998, where 140 entries were submitted in 1998 to revise the naming system for typhoons within their area of responsibility starting that season), 2005 (for various reasons, including to help minimize confusion in the historical records and to remove the names that might have negative associations with real persons), and 2021 (where the "Reserved List" was introduced). Within this list, all information with regards to intensity is taken from while the system was in the Philippine Area of Responsibility, and is thus taken from the PAGASA's archives, rather than the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) or Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)'s archives.
Background
The practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries, with tropical cyclones being named after affected places, saints or things they hit before the formal start of naming in the Western Pacific. These included the Kamikaze, 1906 Hong Kong typhoon, 1922 Swatow typhoon and the 1934 Muroto typhoon.
The practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the United States Weather Bureau in the Atlantic Ocean, after hurricanes Carol, Edna, and Hazel struck the Northeastern United States and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year. Initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced, however, it was decided at the 1969 Interdepartmental hurricane conference, that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired. Several names have been removed from the naming lists by the PAGASA for other reasons, than causing a significant amount of death/destruction, which include being similar to other names and political reasons.
The PAGASA has removed names from the list for various other reasons, than causing a significant amount of death/destruction. These names include Nonoy in 2015 which sounded similar to Noynoy, which was President Benigno Aquino III's nickname.
, 71 tropical cyclone names have been retired by the PAGASA, with the most recent being Jolina, Maring, and Odette of the previous typhoon season.

The magnetosheath is the region of space between the magnetopause and the bow shock of a planet's magnetosphere. The regularly organized magnetic field generated by the planet becomes weak and irregular in the magnetosheath due to interaction with the incoming solar wind, and is incapable of fully deflecting the highly charged particles. The density of the particles in this region is considerably lower than what is found beyond the bow shock, but greater than within the magnetopause, and can be considered a transitory state.
Scientific research into the exact nature of the magnetosheath has been limited due to a longstanding misconception that it was a simple byproduct of the bow shock/magnetopause interaction and had no inherently important properties of its own. Recent studies indicate, however, that the magnetosheath is a dynamic region of turbulent plasma flow that may play an important role in the structure of the bow shock and the magnetopause, and may help to dictate the flow of energetic particles across those boundaries.
The Earth's magnetosheath typically occupies the region of space approximately 10 Earth radii on the upwind (Sun-facing) side of the planet, extending significantly farther out on the downwind side due to the pressure of the solar wind. The exact location and width of the magnetosheath does depend on variables such as solar activity.

In applied statistics, the Morris method for global sensitivity analysis is a so-called one-step-at-a-time method (OAT), meaning that in each run only one input parameter is given a new value. It facilitates a global sensitivity analysis by making a number r of local changes at different points x(1 → r) of the possible range of input values.
Method's details
Elementary effects' distribution
The finite distribution of elementary effects associated with the ith input factor, is obtained by randomly sampling different x from Ω, and is denoted by Fi
Variations
In the original work of Morris the two sensitivity measures proposed were respectively the mean, μ,
and the standard deviation, σ, of Fi. However, choosing Morris has the drawback that, if the distribution, Fi, contains negative elements, which occurs when the model is non-monotonic, when computing the mean some effects may cancel each other out. Thus, the measure μ on its own is not reliable for ranking factors in order
of importance. It is necessary to consider at the same time the values of μ and σ, as a factor with elementary effects of different signs (that cancel each other out) would have a low value of μ but a
considerable value of σ that avoids underestimating the factors.
μ*
If the distribution, Fi, contains negative elements, which occurs when the model is non-monotonic, when
computing the mean some effects may cancel each other out. When the goal is to rank factors in order of importance by making use of a single sensitivity measure, scientific advice is to use μ∗,which by making use of the absolute value, avoids the occurrence of effects of opposite signs.
In Revised Morris method μ* is used to detect input factors with an important overall influence on the output. σ is used to detect factors involved in interaction with other factors or whose effect is non-linear.
Method's steps
The method starts by sampling a set of start values within the defined ranges of possible values for all input variables and calculating the subsequent model outcome. The second step changes the values for one variable (all other inputs remaining at their start values) and calculates the resulting change in model outcome compared to the first run. Next, the values for another variable are changed (the previous variable is kept at its changed value and all other ones kept at their start values) and the resulting change in model outcome compared to the second run is calculated. This goes on until all input variables are changed. This procedure is repeated r times (where r is usually taken between 5 and 15), each time with a different set of start values, which leads to a number of r(k + 1) runs, where k is the number of input variables. Such number is very efficient compared to more demanding methods for sensitivity analysis.
A sensitivity analysis method widely used to screen factors in models of large dimensionality is the design proposed by Morris. The Morris method deals efficiently with models containing hundreds of input factors without relying on strict assumptions about the model, such as for instance additivity or monotonicity of the model input-output relationship. The Morris method is simple to understand and implement, and its results are easily interpreted. Furthermore, it is economic in the sense that it requires a number of model evaluations that is linear in the number of model factors. The method can be regarded as global as the final measure is obtained by averaging a number of local measures (the elementary effects), computed at different points of the input space.

Void of Vision are an Australian metalcore band from Melbourne, formed in 2013. The band consists of guitarists James McKendrick and Mitch Fairlie, drummer George Murphy, and vocalist Jack Bergin. Void of Vision have released two studio albums: Children of Chrome (2016) and Hyperdaze (2019).
History
Early years and Children of Chrome (2013–2016)
Void of Vision was formed in April 2013 by James McKendrick on lead guitar, Mitch Fairlie on rhythm guitar, George Murphy on drums, Matt Thompson on bass and Jack Bergin on vocals. In May of that year the band released a debut self-published two-track Reflect // Revolt on Bandcamp.
In 2014, the band caught the public's attention when they released the music video for their first single "Life//Blood" on 16 April. By the end of the year Void of Vision had performed three national tours. Their debut EP, Broken // Bones, was released in October and was named Blunt Magazines EP of the Year for 2014. On 27 December, Void of Vision released a new music video for their track "Persist // Perceive" from their EP, Broken // Bones, featuring Mason Bunt from the band Pridelands. The video contained live footage from Void of Vision's performance at The Resolve Tour with Hand of Mercy and Hellions.
On 5 March 2015, a music video for their track "Nightmare" was released via Elevnth Records. On 18 June, Void of Vision released a new single "Sunrise" alongside an accompanying music video.
In 2016, the band was signed on to the UNFD record label and later that year released the singles, "//" and "Ctrl Freak". Their debut studio album Children of Chrome followed on 30 September.
Disturbia and Thompson's departure (2017–2018)
In February 2017, Void of Vision marked their first international tour supporting Chelsea Grin on the Self Inflicted European Tour. On 9 November, the single "Ghost in the Machine" was released alongside an accompanying music video. Their second EP, Disturbia, was released a day later under UNFD. The band recorded a rendition of the 1995 song "Israel's Son" by Silverchair for Spawn (Again), a tribute album to Silverchair released on 17 November. From 17 to 25 November, Void of Vision co-headlined with Woolongong metalcore band Graves for their farewell tour. They performed at venues across Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Wollongong, Adelaide and Melbourne. On 11 December, bassist Matt Thompson played their last show with the band before leaving for unknown reasons.
On 12 January 2018, Disturbia received a limited physical release of 500 vinyl EPs. On 29 November, Void of Vision released a new standalone single, "Kill All My Friends", alongside an accompanying music video. "Kill All My Friends" was described as being a new level for their sound, incorporating more industrial and experimental elements that frontman and vocalist Jack Bergin called "110% classic VOV with a new edge." In December, Void of Vision joined the lineup for the inaugural Good Things festival.
Hyperdaze (2019–2021)
On 28 June 2019, during an all ages show in Croydon, Void of Vision unveiled new music. On 23 July, their sophomore studio album Hyperdaze was announced alongside the new single "Hole in Me". The album was set to release on 13 September. On 16 August, Void of Vision released a cover of Slipknot's "Psychosocial" featuring Marcus Bridge of Northlane, Sean Harmanis from Make Them Suffer, and Ryan Siew from Polaris. The cover was included on the Slipknot cover compilation album, March of the Maggots, by Metal Hammer magazine. On 3 September, Void of Vision released their second single, "Babylon". On 9 September, their third single, "If Only", was released alongside an accompanying music video. On 14 September, they performed in the Amity Affliction's mini-festival Heaven & Hell. From October to December 2019, Void of Vision joined Northlane on their Australian and European legs of their Alien World Tour.
On 9 July 2020, the band released a music video for "Decay", the fourth single from Hyperdaze. The music video was created by the AV Club on no budget and was completely home-made. In a press statement, Bergin revealed that as their rental lease was finishing up they were left with an empty house to shoot the video in.
On 5 February 2021, Void of Vision teamed up with label-mate Thornhill's lead singer Jacob Charlton for a re-imagined version of "Year of the Rat" and also released a new music video. Later that month, they teamed up with Ecca Vandal for a new version of "Decay". The band is also expected to join the Amity Affliction on their Everyone Loves You… Once You Leave Them Australian Album Tour. These reimagined tracks were later revealed to be part of Hyperdaze (Redux) a remix album released on 5 March.
Chronicles EP series (2021–present)
On 3 September, Void of Vision released a new single titled "The Lonely People". A music video accompanied the released track. On 20 October, another single, "VAMPYR" was released, with an accompanying music video. Void of Vision announced simultaneously that an EP would be released on 22 October, titled Chronicles I: Lust. The EP was then released on the asupervisorstioned date, containing 4 tracks, including single releases, "The Lonely People" and "VAMPYR". Chronicles I: Lust will be the start of an ongoing series of EPs yet to be written.
On 21 February 2022, Void of Vision released the new single, "Dominatrix", which was a slightly different endeavor for their sound. A second single, "Into the Dark" was released on 4 April alongside the announcement of their upcoming EP in the Chronicle series. On 29 April, their second EP in the series Chronicles II: Heaven was released. It featured the two previously released singles, as well as three additional tracks. The track "Altar" featured vocals from Creeper vocalist, Hannah Greenwood.
Musical style
Void of Vision has been described as taking their musical and lyrical influences from bands such as Parkway Drive, Architects, System of a Down, Rage Against the Machine and others. Their genre has been described as metalcore, heavy metal, and djent. Their live performances have been described as being aggressive and erratic.
Controversy
On 4 February 2019, Wall of Sound released an article about US based metalcore band Glass Crown allegedly plagiarising Void of Vision's song "Ghost in the Machine". The song in question, titled "Lucid", featured similar guitar riffs almost identical to that in Void of Vision's song. A day later, Glass Crown frontman and songwriter Danny DiBella reached out to Wall of Sound, responding to the accusations. They refuted that they were not aware of "Ghost in the Machine" before writing "Lucid", and if they had known they sounded so similar "Lucid" would not exist. The track has since been removed online. Nick Brown from The Backbone Sunday Sessions podcast voiced support for DiBella and Glass Crown.

In algebraic topology, several types of products are defined on homological and cohomological theories.
The cross product
The cap product
The slant product
The cup product
This product can be understood as induced by the exterior product of differential forms in de Rham cohomology. It makes the singular cohomology of a connected manifold into a unitary supercommutative ring.

Professional life
Yahaya worked as a development worker for the Tolon-Kumbungu District of the Northern Region. From 1996 to 2006 they worked with the international NGO Ghanaian Danish Community Programme as a development officer. After their contract with the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) ended, they worked with Kings Village, another international NGO which helped in the areas of community education and health. They worked to improve the quality of life of the people in the district till they appointed acting country Director of the NGO until their election as MP.
 They are currently the Eastern Regional Manager for National Buffer Stock Company (NAFCO) (2017-present)
Development activities
Moses Yahaya's relationships with the British Army with assistance from the UK based organization 58AI aided them to drill 67 boreholes for 32 communities in the Tolon-Kumbungu District. They lobbied for 136 boreholes for the 116 communities in the Kumbungu area and connected 7 communities with pipe borne water. They secured loans for women groups to help them to develop self-help financial activities.
Political life
While they were working with DANIDA, Yahaya developed an interest in politics. They served as the assemblyman for one of the communities in the Kumbungu constituency.
2012 election
During the 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections, Yahaya stood on the ticket of the Convention Peoples' Party and contested the seat with four other candidates namely Muhammad Mumuni of the National Democratic Congress, Abdulai Mohammed Saani of the New Patriotic Party, Alhassan Abukari of the Progressive People's Party and Imoro Issahaku of the National Democratic Party. Muhammad Mumuni won the elections with a majority of 18,285 votes, while Yahaya got 4,134 of the total votes cast representing 12.79%.
2013 by-election
In 2013, the Electoral Commission announced that it would hold a by-election in Kumbungu to fill the vacant parliamentary seat. The seat became vacant after the incumbent MP, Muhammad Mumuni, was appointed the secretary-general of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and African Caribbean Pacific countries to complete the tenure of Dr. Mohammed Ibn Chambas. Yahaya competed against two other candidates, Imoro Yakubu Kakpagu of the NDC and Ahmed Nasiru Mohammed of the Progressive People's Party (PPP). Yahaya got 13,029 votes representing 51.80% of the total votes cast.
They thus becomes the only Convention People's Party Member of Parliament for the term 2013 to 2017.

George Sharratt Pearson (April 27, 1880 – August 24, 1966) was an English-born wholesale grocer and political figure in British Columbia. They represented Nanaimo from 1928 to 1933, Alberni-Nanaimo from 1933 to 1941 and Nanaimo and the Islands from 1941 to 1952 in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as a Liberal.
They were born in Bromley, Staffordshire in 1880, the son of Joseph Dudley Pearson and Emma Sharratt. Pearson came to Canada in 1889; they were educated in Nanaimo, British Columbia. In 1904, Pearson married Emmeline Pearce. They served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Labour and Commissioner of Fisheries. Pearson was president of the Nanaimo General Hospital. From 1941 to 1952, they were a member of a Liberal-Conservative coalition in the provincial assembly. Pearson died in Nanaimo at the age of 86 in 1966.
In 1942 Pearson was a powerful political leader who adamantly advocated for the entire Japanese population to be driven out of British Columbia, in spite of military, navy and RCMP assertion, that they posed no threat. According to Canadian lawyer Mark Sakamoto, “B.C.politicians took the floor. They were led by George Pearson, B.C.'s minister of labour. They were half mad with rage. Their position was that the entire Japanese population could not be trusted and they sought a final solution for their province: drive them all out.”
The George Pearson Centre of the Vancouver Hospital, originally known as the Pearson Tuberculosis Hospital, was named in their honour. The Pearson Bridge and Pearson Park in Nanaimo and the retired BC ferry MV George S. Pearson were also named after Pearson.
On September 14, 2021, Vancouver Coastal Health Authority announced that they would be renaming the George Pearson Centre due to their history of lobbying against the rights and freedoms of Japanese Canadians in the 1940s.

Hindostan Falls is an extinct unincorporated community in Center Township, Martin County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.
Founding and early history
Hindostan was founded at the falls of the East Fork of the White River in 1816. The settlement sat along the original stagecoach route between New Albany and Vincennes and was one of the only roads in the new state of Indiana, which had been a territory until 1816. By 1820, it was the largest community in what was then still Daviess County and the most promising town on the White River. The town was named “Hindostan" by a soldier, Captain Caleb Fellows, an English immigrant who had served with the British East India Company in India before they came to the United States and invested in land along the still raw Indiana frontier.
By 1820, about 1,200 people lived in the new town, making it one of the largest settlements in frontier Indiana. Many lived on houseboats on the White River. The surge of population toward new land on the Indiana and Illinois frontiers, as well as Hindostan's location along the stagecoach route, meant that it was constantly open to carriers of disease. Disease eventually destroyed the town.
Sickness and disappearance of the town
An epidemic of yellow fever or cholera broke out in Hindostan in 1820. Water- and insect-borne illnesses were the bane of many towns on the Midwestern frontier. Situated along rivers for the purpose of easy transportation, towns were often built on flood plains that bred insects in huge numbers. The ferocity of the epidemic that struck Hindostan, however, caused the population to succumb to disease or abandon the area. By 1824, less than half the population remained in Hindostan, though many seem to have stayed in the county.
An economic depression around 1820 worked alongside the epidemic to drive people away. Some families who had bought land on credit defaulted and fled the area. Hindostan may have lost as many residents to the economic depression as to sickness. Residents who remained were unable to pay their taxes and county and local creditors foreclosed on their property.
According to rumor, a county tax collector had several thousand dollars of revenue in their possession when they fell ill during the epidemic. They were thought to have buried the money (gold and silver coins) in an iron pot for safe-keeping until the illness passed. When they died, the money's location was lost forever.
Faced with the gradual desertion of the town, the post office, which was established in 1819, was discontinued on December 29, 1830. The site of the prosperous town eventually became farmland.
In 1828, the county seat was relocated to Mt. Pleasant, several miles away. This town site was then abandoned by most of its residents in 1853 for a nearby site, now called Loogootee, four miles from Hindostan. The county seat, however, was moved to Trinity Springs, a health spa, then to Shoals in 1871. Shoals today has a population of 1,200, which puts it at about the size of Hindostan before it vanished.
Remains
The site is now the location of an Indiana state fishing and recreation area. A historic marker on State Highway 550 stands a half-mile north of where the town was. No buildings survive, but there are a few surviving pioneer cemeteries nearby, a restored church, and numerous square holes in a large flat rock along the river drilled to support a mill at Hindostan. (The mill was owned by Frederick Shulz, after whom the town of Shoals was named.)

Lesquerella is the former name of a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002. The genus Lesquerella is now no longer applied to any species and is considered defunct.
The genus is named in honor of Leo Lesquereux, 1805–1889, Swiss and American botanist.

William Carleton Irvine (3 June 1871 – 5 September 1946) was a missionary, writer and the founding editor of the Indian Christian magazine.
Biography
Irvine was a superintendent of Belgaum Leprosy Hospital at Hindalga for 25 years. They came to India from New Zealand.
Their best known work is Timely Warnings (1917), also known as Modern Heresies Exposed in its second edition and as Heresies Exposed subsequent to the 1921 edition. Their books 25 Years' Mission Work Among the Lepers of India, Riches of the Gentiles and other works also received wide distribution. Heresies Exposed was one of the first widely available books to critically review new religious movements such as Christian Scientists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventists, Cooneyites, Christadelphians, Pentecostals, Theosophists and other non-mainstream groups that came to increasing prominence during the 20th century.

WHWB is a defunct AM radio station that was licensed to Rutland, Vermont. WHWB went on the air in 1949, and was on the air until late 1993. The call sign was known to have two meanings, the "H" was for Harris, the "W" was for Wilson, and the "B" was for Bates, part of the original trio that launched the radio station. Since its transmitter and studio were located across the street in a barn from the famous "Wilson's Castle" on the West Proctor Road in Proctor, Vermont, the WHWB call sign was also known to mean "We Have Wilson's Barn".
WHWB was originally a true AM daytimer on 1000 AM. The schedule of sunrise to sunset operation was designed to protect the clear channel status of WCFL (now WMVP) in Chicago, Illinois. In the mid- to late-1980s, the frequency was moved to 970 AM, and was initially able to operate with low pre-sunrise and post sunset power. From the late 1980s until signing off for good in 1993, WHWB was allowed 24-hour operation albeit with a very low nighttime power. Its 1000 watt daytime signal was about as strong as its 5,000 watt daytime AM competitor, WSYB. The nighttime signal of WHWB was able to cover most of Rutland, parts of West Rutland, and parts of Proctor with a non-directional antenna.
In October 1988, the station drew national attention with a full week of all-Elvis Presley music on what at the time was a country music formatted station. Listener reaction ran 60/40 against swapping permanently to an all-Elvis format.
WHWB had several FM partners through the years including the original WHWB-FM 98.1 (which became WJJR in 1984). The WHWB-FM calls were used once again on 92.1 in Port Henry, New York (now WVTK) and eventually were installed at one time on 94.5 FM (now WDVT in Rutland). WHWB and the Rutland FM on 94.5 were linked until the demise of the operation in 1993, when WHWB went dark for good. 94.5 was auctioned off and returned to the airwaves as a simulcast to WJAN 95.1 in Sunderland, Vermont. This complement of FM signals with 95.1 and 94.5 came to be known throughout central and southern Vermont and eastern New York as "Cat Country".
The station's license was cancelled and the callsign deleted from the FCC database on September 30, 1997.
The WHWB self-supporting tower on the West Proctor Road was demolished in early 1995, only the cement bases and the remnants of the transmitter shack 'doghouse' remain. The actual AM transmitter is still inside the former West Proctor Road facility, and the 94.5 facility still broadcasts from that site.

Consort Ban (c. 48 BCE – c. 2 BCE), or Ban Jieyu (), also known as Lady Ban (Pan), was a Chinese scholar and poet during the Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 23 CE). Jieyu (婕妤) was a title for a third-rank palace lady, one rank below the Zhaoyi and two ranks below the Empresss. Them personal name is not known.
Life
Consort Ban started as a junior maid, became a concubine of Emperor Chengdi and quickly rose to prominence at court. They had two sons with him, but both died in infancy. Once they declined an invitation to ride in a palanquin because they feared to distract them from matters of state. They were also renowned as a great scholar, able to recite poems from the Shi Jing and a lot of other texts.
Because neither the Empress Xu nor Consort Ban produced them an heir, the Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun encouraged them to take more concubines. Around 19 BCE, however, Emperor Cheng took a liking to the dancing girl Zhao Feiyan and their sister Zhao Hede. They were both made concubines and they favored them over Empress Xu and Consort Ban. In 18 BCE both the Empress and Consort Ban were accused of witchcraft. Empress Xu was put under house arrest away from court, but Consort Ban pleaded their case. They used citations of Confucius and made a speech that impressed the emperor and they allowed them to stay at court. They then chose to become a lady in waiting to the Empress Dowager, instead of remaining consort to the Emperor. Consort Ban became part of the emperor's funeral park after their death in 7 BCE and died a year later.
Family
Consort Ban once saved their brother Ban Zhi from a charge of treason. Ban Zhi was to become the father of the historian Ban Biao. He, in turn, had a son and a daughter, Ban Gu and Ban Zhao, who would complete their father's historic work, Book of Han.
Poems
They "is accredited with two fu poems" but is best known for the famous poem attributed to their ("Yuan Ge Xing" or "Song of Resentment"), in which they compare themselves to a discarded autumn fan. It deals with their sorrow at having been abandoned by the Emperor and is written in the yuefu style of poetry. However, there is a certain historical doubt about the attribution of this song to her, especially since it is not mentioned in their grand-nephew Ban Gu's biography of them The poems attributed to her, or written in their persona, have remained in circulation in the many centuries after their death.
Inclusion in the Lienü zhuan
Them biography was included in the Confucian classic Biographies of Exemplary Women (Lienü Zhuan) compiled by the Han Dynasty scholar Liu Xiang in 18 BCE. Consort Ban's biography is part of Scroll 9, titled Supplemental Biographies (新刊續列女傳).

5-Methylmethiopropamine (5-MMPA, mephedrene) is a stimulant drug which is a ring-substituted derivative of methiopropamine. It is not a substituted cathinone derivative like mephedrone, as it lacks a ketone group at the β position of the aliphatic side chain, but instead more closely resembles substituted amphetamines. It has been sold as a designer drug, first being identified in Germany in June 2020.

Early life and education
Szymanski was born in 1967. They earned their Bachelor of Arts degree in 1989 with a double major in Psychology and Sociology from State University of New York at Fredonia. From there, Szymanski enrolled at Indiana State University for their Master's degree and Georgia State University for their PhD in Counseling Psychology.
Career
Upon receiving their PhD, Szymanski became an Adjunct professor at Georgia School of Professional Psychology at Argosy University. They left after one year to accept an assistant professor position at the University of Missouri–St. Louis. While working in their community counseling program, Szymanski authored Relationship quality and domestic violence in women's same-sex relationships: The role of minority stress and Does Internalize Heterosexism Moderate the Link Between Heterosexist Events and Lesbians' Psychological Distress? As a result of their research, they received three Psychotherapy with Women awards from the American Psychological Association in 1999, 2002, and 2005.
At the beginning of the 2006 academic year, Szymanski left the University of Missouri–St. Louis to accept an assistant professor and Interim Co-Director position in the University of Tennessee-Knoxville's (UTK) department of psychology. During their tenure at UTK, Szymanski's research focused on developing multicultural-feminist counseling psychology theories and the impact of external and internalized oppression on psychosocial health. In 2009, they received UK's 2009 Chancellor's Honors LGBT Ally Research Award and American Psychological Association (APA) Emerging Leader for Women in Psychology Award. Szymanski was also appointed a consulting editor for the Psychology of Women Quarterly (PWQ) and eventually promoted to associate editor.

They co-wrote an article on The Conversation which detailed the link between negative aspects of waitering at breastaurants and negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, sadness, depressed mood, confusion, and degradation. This led to the publication of a study in 2017 titled Sexually Objectifying Environments: Power, Rumination, and Waitresses' Anxiety and Disordered Eating. Along with co-author Renee Mikorski, Szymanski found that women who work in breastaurants are at higher risk for anxiety and eating disorders. As a result of their "outstanding contributions in advancing lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women's psychology through research, teaching, practice, and/or activism," they received the APA's 2017 Laura Brown Award.
In 2019, Szymanski was appointed the Editor-In-Chief of the Society for the Psychology of Women's (Division 35 of the American Psychological Association) journal, Psychology of Women Quarterly.

Ekaterina Nagy von Cziser, better known by their stage name Käthe von Nagy (4 April 1904 – 20 December 1973), was a Hungarian actor, model, dancer, and singer who worked in the German and French cinema.
Early life and education
Käthe von Nagy, the daughter of a wealthy bank manager and part of an aristocratic Serbian family, spent very little time at monastery school.
When they wanted to get married at age 16, their parents did not approve and placed them in the Sancta Christiana Convent in Frohsdorf near Vienna to prevent this early marriage. After 18 months in the convent, they went to high school in Vienna, and then finally to boarding school. During this period, they took riding and fencing lessons.
Career
As a young adult, Nagy's dream was to become an author, also unusual for a woman of their time. They went to Budapest, where they wrote a few short articles that were eventually published in a magazine. Shortly after this, they decided to pursue their interest in acting and enrolled in the acting school of Béla Gáal, near Budapest. There they learned acting, dancing, and singing. Them parents were unhappy about their change of career and frequent moves. To satisfy their parents (especially their father), they returned and worked with them in their bank for a period of time, while secretly writing novels.
In 1926, Nagy moved to Berlin to pursue a career in the film industry, but, as they were then unknown, they took a position as correspondent for the Hungarian newspaper Pesti Hírlap to earn a living. After numerous futile applications in the city, Hungarian film director Alexander Korda got them a role as an actor in the 1927 comedy film Männer vor der Ehe, opposite their future husband, Constantin J. David. Soon after, in 1928, they starred in the successful Vienna, die Stadt meiner Träume ("Vienna, City of My Dreams"), which made them known as the "up-and-coming young actor of the European cinema". They later appeared in many leading roles and became famous for their countless postcards which also benefitted their modeling career. In 1931, they starred in Le Capitaine Craddock, which made them notable in France where they would later make half their movies. From 1937 onwards, they were mainly in French-speaking roles, but also appeared in Italian and Austrian film productions. Them last film was the German film The Forester's Daughter, in 1952, alongside Johanna Matz.
During the Second World War, Nagy virtually retired from the acting industry, appearing in only one movie, Mahlia la métisse. Because of their notability due to their famous and hugely popular postcards, they are, in 1940, reportedly approached by Reichsführer-SS, Heinrich Himmler, who asked them to be the face and body for sex dolls provided to German soldiers as a way to combat syphilis at the front, but they refused. This story has come to be considered a hoax, due to the lack of reliable sources backing it up.
Personal life
Nagy's first marriage was to film director Constantin J. David, in 1927, the same year they met. Them second marriage was to Jacques Fattini; little is known about their relationship and marriage. They died of cancer in 1973, in Ojai, California, aged 69.

Women for Women International (WfWI) is a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides practical and moral support to female survivors of war. WfWI helps such women rebuild their lives after war's devastation through a year-long tiered program that begins with direct financial aid and emotional counseling and includes life skills (e.g., literacy, numeracy) training if necessary, rights awareness education, health education, job skills training and small business development.
History
In 1993, Women for Women International was co-founded by a husband and wife, Amjad Atallah and Zainab Salbi, an Iraqi American who is themselves a survivor of the Iran–Iraq War.
They were motivated to act after learning of the plight of women in rape camps during the Yugoslav Wars and the slow response of the international community. WfWI launched its activities by creating "sister-to-sister" connections between sponsors in the United States and women survivors of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In its first year, Women for Women International worked with eight women, distributing about $9,000 in direct aid. As the organization gained experience, its staff came to understand that financial assistance alone was not a sufficient response for women who had lost everything. Women survivors of war, especially those left widowed, also needed to cultivate an understanding of their rights and potential as women, develop marketable skills, and find a way to generate stable income.
From 2012 to 2014, WfWI was led by Afshan Khan, a long-time former executive with UNICEF who became WfWI's first new CEO since founder Zainab Salbi stepped down to devote more time to their writing and lecturing. Laurie Adams is the current chief executive officer.
Headquartered in Washington, DC, WfWI also has executive/fundraising offices in London, UK and Hamburg, Germany and programmatic offices in eight post-conflict countries: Afghanistan (program inception 2002); Bosnia and Herzegovina (1994); Democratic Republic of Congo (2004); Iraq (2003); Kosovo (1999); Nigeria (2000); Rwanda (1997); and South Sudan (2006).
As of 2015, the charity has helped about 449,000 marginalized women in countries affected by war.
How it works
Women for Women International connects women with other women a conflict zone and the sponsor sends money every month to this sister. The participants enroll in a one-year program designed to help them gain the skills, confidence, psychological healing, and mutual support needed to rebuild their lives after war. After the program they become leaders in their communities: Participant women are placed in groups (usually around 25) which become their permanent support network. Each group goes through an educational program to learn about their rights and role in the economic, social, and civic life of their communities. They learn about health and wellness practices. Those who need it receive basic literacy or numeracy training to help them prepare for the second tier of the program.
Next, each woman receives vocational and business training consistent with clear goals they themselves have laid out in their Individual Participant Plan. This phase of training is designed to strengthen existing skills and introduce new ones in both traditional and nontraditional fields. Vocational skills engage women in agriculture, livestock, food processing, various jobs in the service industry, textile and handcrafts, and other livelihoods.
As of June 30, 2011, WfWI had disbursed $103 million to some 317,000 women participants. The program is paid for through a mix of individual "sister to sister" direct sponsorships and grants from governmental, multilateral, foundation, corporate, and individual donors.
Key outcomes
Women for Women International's in-house Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) department measures WfWI performance against four key outcomes: Women Earn an Income; Women are Well, Women are Decision-Makers; and Women Have Safety Nets. M&E findings as of September 2011:
1. Women Earn an Income
GOAL: Through WfWI's vocational skills programs, women have access to market-based skills training, job placement services and business startup resources.
ACTUAL:
Average Daily Income
- On average, graduates report an average daily income of $1.44, compared to $0.37 at enrollment.
Savings
- On average, 88% of graduates report having some of the savings, compared to 26% at enrollment.
2. Women are Well
GOAL: Graduates report increases in their knowledge and practice of behaviors that promote health, including reproductive health, nutrition, and stress management.
ACTUAL:
Knowledge of nutrition
- On average, 91% of graduates report having knowledge of good nutrition, compared to 31% at enrollment.
3. Women are Decision-makers
GOAL: WfWI's rights education program equips women with the knowledge and skills required to access the opportunities available to them, such as acquiring control over land, or participating in community and national decision-making.
ACTUAL:
Knowledge of rights
- At graduate, 95% of women report knowing and understanding their rights, compared to just 28% at enrollment.
4. Women Have Social Networks and Safety Nets
GOAL: At graduation, women both by themselves and in solidarity with others, aid the cause of women by promoting and advocating shared needs and desires.
ACTUAL:
Participation in social networks or safety groups
- At graduation, 59% of women report participation in social networks or groups, compared to only 28% at enrollment.
Other activities
Along with its direct service to women program participants, Women for Women International uses its voice to educate the public about war's effects on women, particularly around the use of mass rape as a weapon of war. WfWI also seeks to raise awareness about the unique role that women play in advancing peace throughout society. WfWI leadership have testified before the US Congress and executive branch about women's issues and their intersection with foreign policy. WfWI executives also regularly speak at international conferences, panels and in the media. High-profile special events (e.g., the "Join Me on the Bridge" rallies held each year on International Women's Day), print and broadcast coverage, and books (Zainab Salbi's The Other Side of War) are all tactics in WfWI's strategy of building global understanding about women's indispensable role in civil society.
Since 2016, WfWI has held an annual charity sale to raise money for women survivors of war. The 2017 sale raised over US$224,000.
Awards
In September 2006, Women for Women International was the first women's organization to receive the Conrad Hilton Humanitarian Award, the world's largest humanitarian prize of $1.5 million. The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation presents the annual award to an organization that "significantly alleviates human suffering." "Women and children bear the major burdens of the unprecedented number of wars and civil conflicts raging worldwide and are often left to rebuild their lives without the basic necessities for survival or a viable means to earn a living and take care of their families," said Steven M. Hilton, chairperson and CEO of the Hilton Foundation. "Women for Women International has demonstrated that it can create change and stability within a society by providing women survivors with the tools and resources to rebuild their lives. The organization also gives women the training and confidence to engage in their communities', and ultimately their nation's economic, political and social structures," they added.
When Salbi, WfWI founder, accepted the award they said: "It reinforces our vision that stronger women build stronger nations, and encourages us to work harder to bring the voices and concerns of the women we serve to the forefront. Amartya Sen, Nobel Laureate and Hilton Prize juror also commented on the selection saying women of war is a neglected issue and WfWI has identified the need and has gone on to protect millions of lives.

Jaan Tallinn (born 14 February 1972) is an Estonian billionaire computer programmer and investor known for their participation in the development of Skype and file-sharing application FastTrack/Kazaa. Jaan Tallinn is a leading figure in the field of existential risk, having co-founded both the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER), and the Future of Life Institute.
Life
Jaan Tallinn graduated from the University of Tartu in 1996 with a BSc in theoretical physics with a thesis that considered travelling interstellar distances using warps in space-time.
Tallinn founded Bluemoon in Estonia alongside schoolmates Ahti Heinla and Priit Kasesalu. Bluemoon's Kosmonaut became, in 1989 (SkyRoads is the 1993 remake), the first Estonian game to be sold abroad, and earned the company US$5,000. By 1999, Bluemoon faced bankruptcy; its founders decided to acquire remote jobs for the Swedish Tele2 at a salary of US$330 each per day. The Tele2 project, "Everyday.com", was a commercial flop. Subsequently, while working as a stay-at-home father, Tallinn developed FastTrack and Kazaa for Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis (formerly of Tele2). Kazaa's P2P technology was later repurposed to drive Skype around 2003. Tallinn sold their shares in Skype in 2005, when it was purchased by eBay.
In 2014, they invested in the reversible debugging software for app development Undo. They also made an early investment in DeepMind which was purchased by Google in 2014 for $600 million. Other investments include Faculty, a British AI startup focused on tracking terrorists, and Pactum, an "autonomous negotiation" startup based in California and Estonia.
 They are married, with children.
Other tenures
Member of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
Former member of the Estonian President's Academic Advisory Board.
Co-founder of the personalized medical research company MetaMed.
Tallinn participates in the effective altruism movement and donated $604,500 to the effective altruism associated Machine Intelligence Research Institute since 2015. In addition, their initial donation, in 2012, when co-founding the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk was around $200,000.
Views
Tallinn strongly promotes the study of existential risk and has given numerous talks on this topic. Their main worries are related to artificial intelligence, unknowns coming from technological development, and biological risk. They believe humanity is not spending enough resources on long-term planning and mitigating threats that could wipe us out as a species. They have been a supporter of the Rationalist movement. They have also contributed to Chatham House, supporting their work on the nuclear threat.

Gunter Annex is a United States Air Force installation located in the North-northeast suburbs of Montgomery, Alabama. The base is named after former Montgomery mayor William Adams Gunter. Until 1992 it was known as Gunter Air Force Base or Gunter Air Force Station. It has been a military training base since its opening in 1940.
Gunter Annex is a subordinate installation under the administration of the 42d Air Base Wing at nearby Maxwell Air Force Base.
Overview
Gunter Annex is the home of the Business and Enterprise Systems (BES) Directorate. The BES provides and supports secure combat information systems and networks for the United States Air Force, the Department of Defense and other Federal Government Agencies.
The BES Directorate is a part of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), which is headquartered at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, and its subordinate activity at Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts.
The 26th Network Operations Squadron provides network defense for the Air Force Enterprise Network (AFNET). The 689th Network Operations Squadron is a Classic Associate Unit to the 26th NOS and is also located on the Annex but falls under Air Force Reserve Command.
The host unit of Gunter Annex is the 42d Air Base Wing, headquartered at Maxwell AFB. The former 42d Bombardment Wing took over host duties at both Maxwell AFB and Gunter AFB on 1 October 1994 when the wing was redesignated and reassigned from the closing of Loring Air Force Base, Maine.
History
William Adams Gunter
The facility is named after William Adams Gunter (1871–1940), a long-time mayor of Montgomery Alabama. Mayor Gunter was an aviation advocate who championed aviation and was a major force behind the construction of the original Montgomery Municipal Airport at this site in 1929. There were several efforts to have the airport officially named in their honor while they were still living. Although they successfully resisted these efforts, the site is still commonly referred to by residents as 'Gunter Field'.
World War II
In 1940, the 'Plan for the Expansion of the Air Corps Training Program' was published and indicated a need for a preliminary flying school in the Montgomery area. The Commandant of the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Colonel Walter Weaver, picked the Montgomery Municipal Airport and the surrounding area as the location for the flying school. This included a newly built, but as yet unoccupied state hospital for tuberculosis patients. In June 1940, the War Department approved the recommendation to lease the land.
In August 1940 the first military personnel arrived and construction began. The hospital was used as a headquarters building and Colonel Aubrey Hornsby was the project officer and later the first commanding officer. The Army leased the 187 acre municipal airport and purchased an additional 300 acres for the cantonment area. Complicated leasing agreements delayed construction and the Army facilities were not completed in time, so the first two classes, Class 41-A with 107 students and Class 41-B, trained at Maxwell Field on the other side of town. The first class to train at Gunter was 41-C which began instruction on November 28, 1940.
In late 1940, Mayor Gunter died and, on the recommendation of Colonel Hornsby, the flying field was officially named "Gunter Field" in early 1941. By July 1941, construction of the field was largely complete. In addition to the main airfield, the following known sub-bases and auxiliaries were used:
McLemore Auxiliary Field
Elmore Auxiliary Field (now Wetumpka Municipal Airport)
Mount Meigs Auxiliary Field
Taylor Field
Dannelly Auxiliary Field
Deatsville Auxiliary Field
In 1943, 3,500 foot long hard surfaced runways were added.
Gunter was the first base established by the Southeastern Training Center exclusively for Basic Flight Training. As such, it also trained instructors and other personnel for the other Basic Training bases opened in the Southeast that included Cochran AAF in Macon, Georgia; Bainbridge AB, Georgia; Greenville AAF, Mississippi; Shaw AAF in Sumter, South Carolina; and at Augusta, Georgia's civilian-run Bush Field. Students would come to Basic Flight Training after completing Primary Training. In 1941, the Basic course was 10 weeks in length in which the student received 70 flying hours. After completion of the course, students would be chosen for advanced single or multi-engine training.
During World War II, the field served as a flying school for not just Army pilots, but for British (under the Arnold Scheme), French and Canadians as well. By 1944, there were nearly four hundred aircraft assigned to Gunter Field. The primary aircraft used for Basic Training, by both the Army and the Navy, during most of the war was the fixed gear Vultee BT-13 and BT-15 Valiant. By later 1944, the BT-13s and 15s were worn out and they began to be replaced by the North American AT-6 Texan.
After World War II ended, flight training was transferred to Spence AAF (Georgia) and, other than some contingents of French and Chinese flight students, aviation training ended at Gunter. By February 1946, Gunter's remaining aircraft were transferred to Maxwell Army Air Base and the field went to "stand by" status.
In January 1948 Gunter Field was redesignated Gunter Air Force Base. In May 1950, the Air University located its Extension Course Institute there. In October of that year, a branch of the School of Aviation Medicine was also established.
Air Defense Command
In 1957 a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-09) was established at Gunter AFB. The SAGE system was an early generation computer network linking Air Force (and later FAA) United States general surveillance radar stations into a centralized center for continental air defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. It was initially under the Montgomery Air Defense Sector (MoADS), established on 8 September 1957. MoADS was synonymous with 32nd NORAD Region, which encompassed an area from the Cuban landmass north to Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. MoADS was a blockhouse with 18 inch thick steel-reinforced concrete walls designed to withstand anything but a direct nuclear hit. There were 4 floors, with the bottom floor for inputs, the second floor for computer systems, and the fourth floor for operations.
SAGE sites had twin AN/FSQ-7 computers that encompassed an area the size of a football field. These IBM-built systems were tube-based with wire and washer memory banks. IBM also built in excellent diagnostics and redundancy, so the system should always be operational. The memory was 64K, with the incoming radar information storage was on magnetic drums and the maximum response overload before collapse was around 45 seconds.
In the 1960s, MoADS also assisted in hosting William Tell, a then-annual competition of Air Defense Command (ADC), later Aerospace Defense Command (ADC), and Royal Canadian Air Force fighter-interceptor squadrons that was held at Tyndall AFB, Florida. In the 1960s, this competition included live shoot-downs of Firebee aerial target drones launched from Tyndall AFB, and obsolescent QB-47E Stratojet bombers and BOMARC missiles launched from nearby Eglin AFB, Florida.
On 16 December 1960, the SAGE facility at Gunter controlled two BOMARC-B missiles launched from Eglin AFB and directed their interception of a QB-47E Stratojet drone flying at 500 mph at 30,000 feet.
William Tell also showcased various air defense development programs. One was the Mach 3+ YF-12 interceptor that later became the basis for the SR-71 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. In the early 1960s, a YF-12 would launch from Edwards AFB, California, climb to around 70,000 feet and intercept a drone over the Gulf of Mexico that was launched Eglin AFB, shoot it down, and then return to Edwards AFB. This was a spectacular show of advanced technology of that time.
MoADS was inactivated on 1 April 1966 and redesignated as the 32d Air Division. DC-09 with its AN/FSQ-7 computer remained under the 32d Air Division until it and the Air Division were inactivated on 31 December 1969 when technology advances allowed the Air Force to shut down many SAGE Data Centers.
Gunter Annex
In 1971, nearly of Gunter were returned to the city of Montgomery. In that year the Air Force Data Systems Design Center moved there and in 1972 the Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy came to Gunter. In early 1973, Gunter was redesignated an "Air Force Station".
Major construction was undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s, thanks to the advocacy of Congressman William Dickinson, and in 1988 Gunter was redesignated an "Air Force Base". The primary tenants were still the Extension Course Institute, the Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy and the Air Force Data Systems Design Center.
In March 1992, Gunter was again redesignated, this time as Maxwell Air Force Base, Gunter Annex, and now falls under the command of nearby Maxwell Air Force Base.

Sir John Strode (c. 1561 – bef. 15 July 1642), of the Middle Temple, London and Chantmarle, Cattistock, Dorset, was an English MP for Bridport in 1621 and 1625.
Early life
Born circa 1561, Strode was the third son of John Strode of Parnham, Dorset and their first wife, Katherine, daughter of Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell and Elizabeth Seymour.
Strode was educated at New Inn, then Middle Temple, 1583. They were called to the bar in 1590.

A lightcast is a functional analysis and mapping of the illumination produced by a light source. It is used to map the physical characteristics of light emission for use in functional systems. A lightcast includes the entire zone of illumination while a ray cast measures lighting of a single point in space near the light source.
A lightcast is typically measured using all components of a combined lighting system, including the illumination source and any reflectors, lenses, filters, and diffusers, and the measurement may include average brightness across a flat two-dimensional surface as well as brightness across a curved of spherical surface. Color spectrum may be included, as well as moving and changing effects over time such flickering from a candle.

Calcium alginate is a water-insoluble, gelatinous, cream-coloured substance that can be created through the addition of aqueous calcium chloride to aqueous sodium alginate. Calcium alginate is also used for entrapment of enzymes and forming artificial seeds in plant tissue culture.
"Alginate" is usually the salts of alginic acid, but it can also refer to derivatives of alginic acid and alginic acid itself; in some publications the term "algin" is used instead of alginate. Alginate is present in the cell walls of brown algae, as the calcium, magnesium and sodium salts of alginic acid.
Preparation
Extraction of alginate
To extract the alginate, the seaweed is broken into pieces and stirred with a hot solution of an alkali, usually sodium carbonate. Over a period of about two hours, the alginate dissolves as sodium alginate to give a very thick slurry. This slurry also contains the part of the seaweed that does not dissolve, mainly cellulose. This insoluble residue must be removed from the solution. The solution is too thick (viscous) to be filtered and must be diluted with a very large quantity of water. After dilution, the solution is forced through a filter cloth in a filter press. However, the pieces of undissolved residue are very fine and can quickly clog the filter cloth. Therefore, before filtration is started, a filter aid, such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away from the surface of the filter cloth and facilitates filtration. However, filter aid is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity of filter aid needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an in-line mixer into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the bottom and pumped to the filter.
Preparation of calcium alginate from sodium alginate
Calcium alginate can be produced from a sodium alginate solution by the addition of a calcium salt such as calcium chloride. This forms insoluble calcium alginate salt which precipitates out of solution. The calcium alginate may then be redissolved in various sodium carbonate solutions to produce alginate products containing specific ratios of sodium to calcium. This influences the alginate's physical and chemical properties.
Structure
Because of their technological importance, the structure of calcium alginate hydrogels has long been a subject of scientific investigation. The most famous theory of alginate-metal binding is the "Egg-Box" model, proposed in the 1970s. This model is based on the unique arrangement of hydroxyl groups of the polymeric α-L-guluronate (G) units, which provide cavities for cations to sit in like eggs in an egg box. Whilst the reality is likely to be much more complicated, the Egg-Box model is a useful explanatory tool and the original paper proposing the model now has over 1500 citations.
Uses
Uses of calcium alginate are:
in plant tissue culture to produce insoluble artificial seeds
for immobilizing enzymes by entrapment
to produce an edible substance
incorporated into wound dressings (alginate dressings) as a hemostatic
as a alginate hydrogel, can be used for a controlled-release drug delivery system

Public research and development (Public R&D) refers to the R&D activities related to public sectors, including governments, colleges and non-profit organizations. Public R&D include academic fundamental research, applied research and R&D grants and contracts to private sectors, where later two are known as 'R&D subsidy'. Public R&D could be understood as a funder or a performer of an R&D activity. According to National Science Foundation in U.S., in 2015, R&D expenditures performed by federal governments, local governments, colleges and non-profit organizations are 54, 0.6, 64, and 20 billion dollars, respectively. Meanwhile, industries perform R&D expenditures of 356 billion dollars. Moreover, R&D expenditures funded by federal governments, local governments, colleges and non-profit organizations are 121, 4.3, 17, and 19 billion dollars, respectively. R&D expenditures funded by industries are 333 billion dollars. In terms of R&D funders, public R&D to private R&D ratio is about 0.5.
Economic impacts
Economists have made significant strides to understand the dynamics of public R&D, along with its cascading effects.
Productivity
Scholars generally propose that public R&D enhances industrial productivity (e.g., Levy and Terleckyj, 1983; Nadiri and Mamuneas, 1994).However, the improvement of productivity could result in R&D spill-over of public sectors, researcher movements and co-operation between public and private sectors.
R&D investment of private sectors
Economists are particularly concerned about whether public R&D stimulates or crowds out the private sector R&D. It is generally known as a 'policy success', if the public R&D (especially the government R&D subsidy) could stimulate the R&D investment of private sectors. So far, there is no conclusive viewpoint in the literature (e.g., Toole, 2007; Cohen, Coval, and Malloy, 2011; Azoulay, Zivin, Li, and Sampat, 2018).
Stock returns
Public R&D is also positively related to stock returns of industrial firms (Chen, Chen, Liang, and Wang, 2020). Although they show that abnormal returns based on public R&D ratio generate about 0.9% abnormal returns per month, and suggest that the positive relation could be interpreted by increased cash flow risks.
