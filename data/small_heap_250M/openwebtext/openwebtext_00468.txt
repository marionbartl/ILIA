When new runners go to buy shoes, it's common for running store employees to assess their degree of pronation, or how much their feet roll in after landing. The employees then recommend shoes based on the amount of pronation, in the belief that matching shoe type to degree of pronation will help new runners avoid injury.
A new study suggests this practice can be skipped and new runners can safely run in neutral shoes, regardless of their degree of pronation.
Writing in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, a Danish team of researchers reports that injury rates were similar in a large group of new runners with varying degrees of pronation, even though the runners all wore the same neutral running shoe, the Adidas Supernova Glide 3.
Rasmus Nielsen, Ph.D., of Aarhus University in Denmark, and colleagues used the Foot Posture Index to classify the feet of 927 new runners as highly supinated, supinated, neutral, pronated, or highly pronated. The Foot Posture Index is increasingly favored by researchers as a way to measure pronation, because it takes into account several factors rather than one isolated aspect, such as footprint shape or amount of ankle motion.
Nielsen's team followed the new runners for one year. They defined an injury as "any musculoskeletal complaint of the lower extremity or back caused by running, which restricted the amount of running for at least one week."
During the study, 252 of the runners met that definition of sustaining a running injury. What was significant, Nielsen says, is that there was no difference in injury rate among the five types of foot posture, even though they all ran in the same neutral shoe.
"Based on our findings, healthy new runners with pronating feet face the same injury risk as their neutral peers when taking up running in a neutral shoe," Nielsen told Runner's World Newswire via email. "It seems like a neutral shoe is a feasible choice regardless of the foot posture. New runners may focus on comfort feeling rather than foot posture when choosing a running shoe."
Nielsen is quick to point out his findings might apply only to new runners.
"I think we would get a different result" with long-time runners, he wrote. "Since experienced runners have familiarized themselves using a specific type of shoe, it would be potentially injurious to transfer from a different shoe type than the neutral to the neutral shoe. Since most pronators use another shoe than the neutral shoe and the ones with a neutral foot posture use neutral shoes, I would expect the experienced pronators to sustain more injuries than the experienced neutrals if they had to run in a neutral shoe."
At the same time, Nielsen says that his findings are in line with a study published in 2011 that found no difference in injury rate in women who were randomly assigned to wear neutral, stability or motion-control shoes. Such results, he wrote, "question the validity of using pronation as a method to select the 'correct' shoe."
The WikiLeaks founder says he also believes the internet is not a technology that favours freedom of speech
The internet is the "greatest spying machine the world has ever seen" and is not a technology that necessarily favours the freedom of speech, the WikiLeaks co-founder, Julian Assange, has claimed in a rare public appearance.
Assange acknowledged that the web could allow greater government transparency and better co-operation between activists, but said it gave authorities their best ever opportunity to monitor and catch dissidents.
"While the internet has in some ways an ability to let us know to an unprecedented level what government is doing, and to let us co-operate with each other to hold repressive governments and repressive corporations to account, it is also the greatest spying machine the world has ever seen," he told students at Cambridge University. Hundreds queued for hours to attend.
He continued: "It [the web] is not a technology that favours freedom of speech. It is not a technology that favours human rights. It is not a technology that favours civil life. Rather it is a technology that can be used to set up a totalitarian spying regime, the likes of which we have never seen. Or, on the other hand, taken by us, taken by activists, and taken by all those who want a different trajectory for the technological world, it can be something we all hope for."
Assange also suggested that Facebook and Twitter played less of a role in the unrest in the Middle East than has previously been argued by social media commentators and politicians.
He said: "Yes [Twitter and Facebook] did play a part, although not nearly as large a part as al-Jazeera. But the guide produced by Egyptian revolutionaries … says on the first page, 'Do not use Facebook and Twitter', and says on the last page, 'Do not use Facebook and Twitter'.
"There is a reason for that. There was actually a Facebook revolt in Cairo three or four years ago. It was very small … after it, Facebook was used to round-up all the principal participants. They were then beaten, interrogated and incarcerated."
Assange said that cables released by WikiLeaks played a key role in both fomenting unrest in the Middle East and forcing the US government not to back former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.
Assange said diplomatic cables concerning US attitudes to the former Tunisian regime had given strength to revolutionary forces across the region.
"The Tunisian cables showed clearly that if it came down to it, the US, if it came down to a fight between the military on the one hand, and Ben Ali's political regime on the other, the US would probably support the military."
He continued: "That is something that must have also caused neighbouring countries to Tunisia some thought: that is that if they militarily intervened, they may not be on the same side as the United States."
Assange, who is appealing against his extradition to Sweden on alleged sex charges, said the WikiLeaks releases had also forced the US to drop their tacit support of Mubarak.
"As a result of releasing cables about Suleiman [the vice-president of Egypt under Mubarak], the US and Israel's preferred option for regime takeover in Egypt, as a result of releasing cables about Mubarak's approval of Suleiman's torture methods, it was not possible for Joseph Biden to [repeat his earlier claim that Mubarak was not a dictator]. It was not possible for Hillary Clinton to publicly come out and support Mubarak's regime."
Responding to a question about Bradley Manning, the US soldier incarcerated for allegedly leaking classified information, Assange said: "We have no idea whether he is one of our sources. All our technology is geared up to make sure we have no idea."
He expressed sympathy for Manning. "He is in a terrible situation. And if he is not connected to us, [then] he is there as an innocent … and if he is in some manner connected to our publications, then of course we have some responsibility. That said, there is no allegation that he was arrested as the result of anything to do with us. The allegation is that he was arrested as a result of him speaking to Wired magazine in the United States."
Assange also criticised the New York Times, which he claimed had suppressed stories about secret American military activity in Afghanistan.

North Korea is facing severe food shortages after being hit by its worst drought since 2001, a report from the United Nations says.
Crop production in the country has been hampered by a prolonged dry period and food imports are now urgently required to fill the gap, the UN has warned.
The most vulnerable, such as children and the elderly, will be worst hit.
In the 1990s, hundreds of thousands of North Koreans are believed to have died during a widespread famine.
The latest drought is serious, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said on Thursday, because bilateral food aid to the country has dramatically fallen in recent years.
This is due in part to sanctions implemented to punish North Korea over its weapons development programme. The UN's World Food Program (WFP) has also seen a steep drop in contributions, the agency says.
What's happening?
A persistent lack of rainfall in North Korea in recent months has decimated staple crops such as rice, maize, potatoes and soybean, which many of the country's citizens depend on during the lean season that stretches from May to September.
In key crop-producing areas, rainfall from April to June 2017 was well below the long-term average. This severe dry spell disrupted the early stages of the agricultural process, according to experts from the FAO quoted in the report.
The harvesting of crops from the early season, including wheat, barley and potatoes, has also been affected, the FAO said.
The FAO estimates that the production of 2017 early season crops has plunged by over 30% from the previous year's level of 450,000 tonnes to 310,000 tonnes.
Why is this drought so bad?
When the rain finally came in July, it was too late to boost crop production as the planting and growth period for food to be harvested in October and November had already passed.
This also means that any rainfall from now on will not make up for the dry weather of the last few months, a crucial period for the country's agrarian economy.

The key regions affected include the major cereal-producing provinces of South and North Pyongan, South and North Hwanghae and Nampo City, which normally account for about two-thirds of overall cereal production, the FAO said.
With forecasts of a reduction in crops overall this year, the food security situation is expected to further deteriorate in the coming months and demand for imports is likely to increase.
What's the possible effect?
Inefficient food production means that large parts of the North Korean population face malnutrition or death.
As key crop planting and production periods for 2017 elapse, the country requires food imports for at least the next three months to ensure that it has an adequate supply, the FAO said.
North Korea's ability to stave off famine has also been hampered in recent years by flooding, which destroys crops, along with homes and villages.
The cumulative effects of flooding, combined with inefficient food production, have led to a stagnation in the country's ability to deal with food shortages and malnutrition.
A series of regeneration projects are now needed, the FAO said, including upgrading the country's irrigation systems to help reduce water losses and increase water availability.
Has this happened before?
North Korea suffered serious famine in the 1990s.
It began in 1996 and in 1998 the WFP mounted what it said was the biggest emergency operation in its history to help avert a further escalation of the crisis.
That year, the agency said it planned to provide aid to about a third of the population, or nearly seven-and-a-half million people.
Children between the ages of one and two who were surveyed at the time were described as acutely malnourished, with some families having to rely on leaves and twigs to stay alive.
In 2001, after North Korea suffered its worst winter in 50 years, the country faced a serious lack of corn and wheat.
In the period between 1996 and 2001, the WPP said it had supplied food to about eight million of the country's citizens.
North Korea's government controls one of the world's most secretive societies which, until the food crisis emerged in the mid-1990s, resisted seeking help from international bodies.
Changes in North Korea's economy over the past 20 years make a repeat of the disastrous famine of the 1990s much less likely.
Agriculture is still controlled by the state but reforms have been quietly introduced to allow farmers to keep more of their produce, leading to an increase in production.
Foreign access to the country, however, is still tightly controlled.
Grant. By Ron Chernow. Penguin Press; 1,104 pages; $40. To be published in Britain by Head of Zeus in November; £30.
IN 1948, a survey of historians ranked Ulysses S. Grant as the second-worst American president. Corruption had badly tarred his administration, just as it had that of the man at the bottom, Warren Harding. But recent surveys have been kinder. Grant now lands in the middle, thanks to his extraordinarily progressive work on race relations. “Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter—as he is, and must remain,” he told Congress in 1874, close to a century before the South would finally consent to doing so. The victorious general in the civil war, Grant tried to see that the principles his men had fought for endured.

Ron Chernow's 1,100-page biography may crown Grant's restoration. The author of defining books on George Washington and Alexander Hamilton—the latter formed the basis for a hit Broadway musical, after Lin-Manuel Miranda read it on holiday—Mr Chernow argues persuasively that Grant has been badly misunderstood. The corruption in his administration never touched him—the soul of integrity—personally. Sometimes portrayed as an ignorant drunk, he was in fact a profound thinker with a sensitivity to suffering that underlay his kindness to vanquished armies and people of other races. His bibulous reputation was exaggerated by his opponents, Mr Chernow believes, and indeed with discipline and the support of his beloved wife, he abstained from drinking almost fully during his presidency.
Grant may have been America's most improbable president. His early military career showed flashes of brilliance before he resigned from a post in California amid accusations, almost certainly justified, of drunkenness. He then failed at various business ventures, a lifelong tendency that accompanied a penchant for trusting swindlers. Not long before the civil war he was virtually broke, walking the streets of St Louis in shabby clothing selling firewood.
War brought salvation. The Union army was afflicted with generals who hesitated to engage, or failed to follow-up victories by chasing vulnerable opponents. Not Grant. “I can't spare this man; he fights,” Lincoln supposedly said of him, a year before the general engineered a landmark victory at Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863. Robert E. Lee, his chief opponent, concurred: “He is not a retreating man.”
Lee has been lionised by those nostalgic for the South's “Lost Cause”. Mr Chernow argues that “however brilliant Lee was as a tactician, Grant surpassed him in grand strategy.” Far from embracing blunt butchery, as critics maintain, Grant saw the political dimensions of the war and patiently crafted its endgame, even if it was painfully bloody. His legendary magnanimity at Appomattox in 1865 was part of that political calculation: he allowed Lee and his men to return home with dignity, keeping some possessions like horses, and without fear of treason charges.
The defining issues of Grant's presidency, from 1869 to 1877, became the reintegration of the Union and the maintenance of civil rights for blacks. On these, he excelled. Intolerant of unreconstructed white terrorism, including the Colfax massacre of at least 73 (and perhaps many more) blacks in 1873, he ordered federal authorities in the South to take the strongest possible measures to stamp out violence. He helped push through the 15th Amendment, which gave male citizens of all colours the right to vote. “To Grant more than any other man the Negro owes his enfranchisement,” wrote Frederick Douglass, a black leader and a frequent White House guest. It did not stop there. Grant named blacks, Jews and native Americans to federal positions. Small wonder, then, that he has risen in the presidential pantheon, while Woodrow Wilson, who segregated much of the civil service in the early 20th century, has sunk.
But Grant's record in the White House remains mixed. His appointments were “brilliant and disastrous”. Corruption in the form of gold speculation and whiskey-tax evasion reached deep into his administration, a sign of the oncoming Gilded Age. In foreign policy, he showed a peculiar obsession with annexing the modern-day Dominican Republic. But he did notch up a major achievement: settling American claims over Confederate sympathies among the British, who had built the CSS Alabama, a ship that destroyed many Union commercial and naval vessels. The settlement, achieved through an international panel of arbitrators, may have averted a trans-Atlantic war and, says Mr Chernow, “launched a new fraternal relationship of great consequence”.
Grant's push for racial equality did not endure, of course. The North wearied of the expense of keeping federal troops in the South, and the disputed election to choose Grant's successor, in 1876, resulted in a deal to end Reconstruction. The Klan rose viciously again. Would things have been different had Lincoln lived, his full presidency followed directly by eight years of Grant, without an interruption for the retrograde Andrew Johnson? It is unknowable. In a remarkably pithy memoir, written while he was dying, Grant forecast this: “As time passes, people, even of the South, will begin to wonder how it was possible that their ancestors ever fought for or justified institutions which acknowledged the right of property in man.” Imperfect the 18th president may have been, but he was certainly far-sighted.
There is outrage in Mexico over the second killing of an unarmed Mexican citizen, in the space of a little more than a week, by the U.S. Border Patrol. This time, there are also accusations that a member of the patrol fired into Mexico to shoot a minor.
The new killing took place on Monday at about 7 P.M. in Ciudad Juarez, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, across the border from El Paso, Texas. Various accounts in the U.S. and Mexican media say that the incident began with some people on the Juarez side of the Rio Grande (called Rio Bravo by Mexicans), next to a bridge that connects Juarez with El Paso, throwing stones at Border Patrol agents on the El Paso side. According to Mexican sources, at least one Border Patrol agent fired across the river into Mexico and shot dead 15 year old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Güereca, with a bullet in the eye. The teenager's friends and family have told the press that he was with a group of friends and was not involved in the stone-throwing incident.
Initially some sources claimed that the youth was on the U.S. side. But El Universal, a Mexico City daily, posted a video on its website which clearly shows a Border Patrol agent firing across the river into Mexico. Forensic medical authorities of the State of Chihuahua make the accusation that the Border Patrol agents actually crossed the river and killed the youth on the Mexican side, with a shot to the face at very close range.
Subsequently, there was an effort, according to various sources, by Border Patrol agents to cross to the Mexican side to “gather evidence”, but Mexican police, either from local police forces or from Mexico's Federal Judicial Police but not the military, pointed their guns at the U.S. agents and forced them back. No shooting took place between the U.S. Border Patrol and the Mexican police officers, but the confrontation was said to have been very tense.
On May 28, Anastasio Hernandez (no known relation), 32, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who had lived and worked in the U.S. since he was 14 years old, died after being struck and tasered by Border Patrol agents just at the San Ysidro crossing point between California and the Mexican city of Tijuana. Evidently Mr. Hernandez struggled with Border Patrol agents as they were in the process of deporting him. The San Diego County Medical Examiner's office has declared that the killing a homicide, and there is said to be an FBI investigation.
The Mexican foreign ministry has protested both incidents and demanded punishment of the Border Patrol agents involved, pointing out in the case of Sergio Hernandez that a stone-throwing incident does not justify opening fire with live ammunition and killing a minor. Mexico also complains of increased physical attacks against its citizens within the United States. The White House has expressed concern and called for a full investigation.
The border region has been the focus of intense anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican agitation on the U.S. side. The conservative government of Mexican President Felipe Calderon has been using heavy-handed military tactics to deal with a rampaging drug trafficking war, in which Juarez is a key battleground. The Obama administration has followed up a Bush administration program, called the “Merida Initiative” to supply Mexican police and army units with massive amounts of weaponry. The left and human rights organizations in Mexico have denounced both the Mexican and U.S. governments for this, pointing to a vast increase in human rights violations that have followed Calderon's mobilization of the army to fight the drug gangs. Everybody in Mexico, both government and opposition, agrees that the United States contributes to the drug war in Mexico in two ways: By the vast demand for illegal drugs in this country, without which the drug cartels would have no market or income, and by the ease with which Mexican criminals can purchase high powered arms in the United States due to our lax gun laws, leading to a situation in which criminal gangs often out-gun Mexican police forces. There are said to be as many as 10,000 gun shops in the United States along the border with Mexico. The power of the gun lobby has so far prevented the U.S. government from doing anything about this.
The ultra-right, in the United States, citing the drug war in Mexico and the recent killing of a U.S. rancher by persons unknown, is demanding that the U.S. Mexico border be “sealed” and no more documented or undocumented immigrants be admitted from Mexico. Anybody who has actually seen the border realizes that this is physically impossible, and so it is a demagogic demand designed to stave off immigration reform and contribute to the scapegoating of Latinos and immigrants for our current economic troubles, while portraying the Obama administration as being weak on national security.
President Obama recently announced he will be sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the border.
Well it's been a long time coming hasn't it? The 3 other classes of Shattered PD have all received gameplay reworks, and it's finally coming time for the huntress to get the same treatment.
Each time I rework a class I look to accomplish two things:
1. Address any major design or balance concerns that exist with the class currently.
2. Ensure that the class has unique gameplay opportunities presented to them by their mechanics.
Depending on the existing class the rework will lean more toward one direction or the other. The mage rework was almost entirely about giving him some really cool ways to interact with wands, as his balance was already fine. The warrior rework by contrast leaned more heavily on sorting out balance issues, as I wanted the warrior to be the simplest class to use effectively without also just being the strongest one.
The huntress is the first rework that leans heavily on both points. The huntress needed both more unique gameplay, and a solution to the troublesome balance that her boomerang presented. Depending on how you play Shattered, you'll likely have one of two opinions on the boomerang: either it's mostly useless, or a free win. That sounds odd, but it all comes down to willingness to dump all upgrades into it, and play to the strengths of that particular strategy. For players with the right technique, dumping upgrades into the boomerang is a surefire way to win the game almost every time. This is problematic because either the huntress's unique item is a non-factor, or she becomes the ‘upgrade boomerang, ignore all other items, and win' class. Either of these possibilities put her class in a really bad light.
The Rework Itself
So, firstly we need a solution to the balancing issues of the boomerang. I wasn't too eager to abandon it entirely though, as the base concept of the huntress having a unique unlimited-use ranged weapon is a really good one. The problematic part isn't the base idea itself, but rather how the boomerang interacts with the upgrade system. So, the solution is to simply remove that interaction! Rather than having a weapon which can be upgraded, have it scale in power along with the huntress's levels, somewhat like the rogue's cloak of shadows. This gives its baseline power a big boost, without letting it scale to ridiculous levels. I also took this opportunity to adjust the item thematically, to fulfill the desire of many players to have a bow-style weapon in the game:
Introducing the spirit bow! A unique weapon which grows in power with the huntress, and has an unlimited supply of magical arrows.
Of course, this alone isn't quite enough to fill the class out, so I also wanted to see if I could give the huntress something entirely new as well to enhance her interaction with the game's environment. Environmental interaction has a lot of potential for the huntress, as it naturally ties into use of ranged weapons, and the existing nature theme of her warden subclass. As part of her rework, the huntress will no longer trample high grass, but will instead 'furrow' it. This furrowed grass can't drop additional items, but still blocks vision just like tall grass. This means that smart huntress players can now use grass to give themselves a substantial advantage by breaking line of sight with enemies.
Subclasses
A rework of the huntress herself also comes with changes to her subclasses. Both of them are already really solid thematically, but need some changes to their base mechanics.
The Warden already has a substantially powerful ability in her barkskin, but it doesn't encourage the player to really play substantially differently. The warden ends up being basically a warrior that wants to stand in grass when possible. I've decided to double-down on the theme of nature, and give the warden a grab-bag of benefits when interacting with plants, grass, and seeds. Her original barkskin boost is still there, but now has less direct power. The warden is also capable of seeing through grass, grows grass around seeds she plants, and gains various bonus effects when trampling plants. The intention here is to keep warden as the more flexible class choice which can work with regular equipment, but to also encourage some unique gameplay. This prevents the warden from just feeling like a weaker warrior. Of course, the furrowing grass mechanic of the base character also plays into this nicely.
The Sniper's base mechanics played into the problematic nature of the boomerang. Her ranged powers mostly encouraged boomerang use, as regular ranged weapons were too limited to be used consistently. While the sniper definitely should want to use her bow, it shouldn't be encouraged to the point that it's the only real choice. Just like before the sniper gets some base bonuses to all ranged attacks, but now have two new unique powers. Firstly, she can see 50% further, which helps her see threats coming sooner, especially in darker areas. More importantly, she's trading her old attack speed boosting sniper's mark for a new one which encourages using a mixture of weapons. When the huntress attacks an enemy with a thrown weapon, she can then follow up with a special attack from her bow! This forces the sniper to use more than just her bow, but also gives her some really cool new powers when she does use her bow. Still, it does feel like there's something missing here…
Thrown Weapons Again?
When designing the sniper one major problem came up: especially now that her bow isn't upgradeable, what should the sniper upgrade? Investing in equipment by upgrading it is one of the cornerstones of PD, and as it currently stands the sniper has no way to invest in the items she's meant to work best with. Thrown weapons have been showing this as a problem especially since 0.7.0, which gave a bunch of investment opportunity to most other consumable items. Currently thrown weapons have absolutely nothing, aside from dart tipping and one specific ring which enhances them. This is absolutely pitiful compared to basically every other item category. The thrown weapon rework of 0.6.2 fixed a lot of surface level problems with thrown weapons but failed to address this core issue.
So then how can the player invest in thrown weapons? Should they just be upgradeable?
Yes!
But wouldn't that be pretty weird?
Yup!
Upgrading thrown weapons sounds absurd at face-value, but I'm pretty sure I've figured out a way to make it work. Thrown weapons are sort of one part equipment and several parts consumable, but as you upgrade them the equipment aspect grows while the consumable aspect diminishes. Thrown weapons will be upgradeable one at a time, scale in damage in a similar way to melee weapons, and will gain a massive boost to durability with each upgrade. Thrown weapons begin to turn from something you use in a pinch to a major source of damage which you can use in most or every fight. The 'single use per battle' is still there as a limiting factor, so non-sniper runs built entirely on thrown weapons aren't too likely, but they can become an amazing assist tool with a few upgrades. A huge amount of the game's power budget is tied up in scrolls of upgrade, so letting thrown weapons access that gives them so much more potential to be impactful and interesting.
0.7.1 is going to be out by mid December, so look forward to these changes, and a few more, coming to ShatteredPD soon!

When we heard Silver mention the name "M. Malone" as who she was told killed Bruce Wayne's parents, our immediate conclusion was that the M stood for "Matches." We were right.
Michael Bowen, best known as Uncle Jack on Breaking Bad (also Lost, multiple Quentin Tarantino films), has been cast in the role of Patrick "Matches" Malone on Gotham, set to debut in the second half of season two, ComicBook.com can exclusively report. The character description doesn't give us too much to go on, but does offer a tiny bit of insight into him.
"One of Gotham's deadliest killers, Matches Malone is a weathered, philosophical hitman who may be the triggerman behind one of the most important crimes in Gotham's history." Matches Malone in the pages of DC Comics is a small-time crook who really is just a product of Gotham City, committing crimes simply to get by. When he dies, Batman covers the death up, and assumes the identity of Matches when he needs to go undercover amongst Gotham's criminal element. He's even been thrown in prison (on purpose) as Matches Malone before.
Obviously, Gotham is taking some considerable liberties here with the character, especially if he really is Thomas and Martha Wayne's killer. It's hard to imagine Bruce ever using their killer's identity in the future (and of course, as he's nearly five decades younger, pretty hard to pull off), as well. Going into the second half of the season dubbed "Rise of the Villains," it's easy to see that Matches will be not just an important part of Gotham's story, but certainly of Bruce's as well.
Gotham airs Monday nights at 8pm on Fox. After tonight's mid-season finale, the show returns February 29, 2016 with a second run of 11 episodes for Season 2.

Matthew Youlden speaks nine languages fluently and understands over a dozen more. We work together in the Babbel office in Berlin, so I constantly hear him using his skills, switching from language to language like a chameleon changing colors with ease. In fact, for the longest time I didn't even know he was British because he was constantly changing his speech.
When I told Matthew how I've been struggling to pick up a second language, he had the following advice for me. If you currently believe that you can never become bilingual, get ready to take some notes! Here are Matthew's tips to best learn any language:
1. Know your motivation
This might sound obvious, but if you don't have a good reason to learn a language, you are less likely to stay motivated over the long-run. Wanting to impress English-speakers with your French is not a very good reason — wanting to get to know a French person in their own language is another matter entirely. No matter your reason, once you've decided on a language, it's crucial to commit:
“OK, I want to learn this and I'm therefore going to do as much as I can in this language, with this language and for this language.”
2. Find a partner
Matthew learned several languages together with his twin brother Michael (they tackled their first foreign language, Greek, when they were only eight years old!). Matthew and Michael, or the Super Polyglot Bros. as I'd like to now refer to them, gained their superpowers from good-ol' healthy sibling rivalry:
“We were very motivated, and we still are. We push each other to really go for it. So if he realizes that I'm doing more than he is, he'll get a bit jealous and then try and outdo me (maybe because he's my twin) — and the other way round.”
Even if you can't get a sibling to join you on your language adventure, finding some kind of partner will push both of you to always try just a little bit harder and stay with it.
“I think it's a really great way of actually going about it. You have someone with whom you can speak, and that's the idea behind learning a new language.”
3. Talk to yourself
When you have no one else to speak to, there's nothing wrong with talking to yourself in a foreign language.
“It might sound really weird, but actually speaking to yourself in a language is a great way to practice if you're not able to use it all the time.”
If you don't know how to go about learning a new language, this can keep new words and phrases fresh in your mind. It also helps build up your confidence for the next time you speak with someone.
4. Keep it relevant
If you make conversation a goal from the beginning, you're less likely to get lost in textbooks. Talking to people is one of the best ways to learn a language, because it keeps the learning process relevant to you.
“You're learning a language to be able to use it. You're not going to speak it only to yourself. The creative side is really being able to put the language that you're learning into a more useful, general, everyday setting — be that through writing songs, generally wanting to speak to people, or using it when you go abroad. You don't necessarily have to go abroad; you can go to the Greek restaurant down the road and order in Greek.”
5. Have fun with it
Using your new language in any way is a creative act. The Super Polyglot Bros. practiced their Greek by writing and recording songs. Think of some fun ways to practice your new language: make a radio play with a friend, draw a comic strip, write a poem or simply talk to whomever you can. If you can't find a way to have fun with the new language, chances are you aren't following step four!
6. Act like a child
This is not to say you should throw a tantrum or get food in your hair when you go out to a restaurant, but try learning the way kids do. The idea that children are inherently better learners than adults is proving to be a myth. New research cannot find a direct link between age and the ability to learn. The key to learning as quickly as a child may be to simply take on certain childlike attitudes. For instance, lack of self-consciousness, a desire to play in the language and willingness to make mistakes.
We learn by making mistakes. As kids, we are expected to make mistakes, but as adults, mistakes become taboo. Think how an adult is more likely to say, “I can't” rather than, “I haven't learned that yet” (I can't swim, I can't drive, I can't speak Spanish). To be seen failing (or merely struggling) is a social taboo that doesn't burden children. When it comes to learning a language, admitting that you don't know everything (and being okay with that) is the key to growth and freedom. Let go of your grown-up inhibitions!
7. Leave your comfort zone
Willingness to make mistakes means being ready to put yourself in potentially embarrassing situations. This can be scary, but it's the only way to develop and improve. No matter how much you learn, you won't ever speak a language without putting yourself out there: talk to strangers in the language, ask for directions, order food, try to tell a joke. The more often you do this, the bigger your comfort zone becomes and the more at ease you can be in new situations.
“At the beginning you're going to encounter difficulties: maybe the pronunciation, maybe the grammar, the syntax, or you don't really get the sayings. But I think the most important thing is to always develop this feel. Every native speaker has a feel for his or her own language, and that's basically what makes a native-speaker — whether you can make the language your own.”
8. Listen
You must learn to listen before you can speak. Every language sounds strange the first time you hear it, but the more you expose yourself to it the more familiar it becomes, and the easier it is to speak it properly.
“We're able to pronounce anything, it's just we're not used to doing it. For example the rolled r doesn't exist in my form of English. When I was learning Spanish there were words with the hard R in them, like perro and reunión. For me, the best way to go about mastering that is actually to hear it constantly, to listen to it and to kind of visualize or imagine how that is supposed to be pronounced, because for every sound there is a specific part of the mouth or throat that we use in order to achieve that sound.”
9. Watch others talk
Different languages make different demands on your tongue, lips and throat. Pronunciation is just as much physical as it is mental:
“One way — it might sound a bit strange — is to really look at someone while they're saying words that use that sound, and then to try to imitate that sound as much as possible. Believe me, it might be difficult at the beginning, but you will. It's something that is actually quite easily done; you just need to practice it.”
If you can't watch and imitate a native-speaker in person, watching foreign-language films and TV is a good substitute.
10. Dive in
So you've made the pledge. How to proceed? Is there a proper way to go about learning? Matthew recommends the 360° maximalist approach: no matter which learning tools you use, it's crucial to practice your new language every single day and immerse yourself:
“I tend to want to absorb as much as possible right from the start. So if I learn something, I really, really go for it and try to use it throughout the day. As the week progresses I try to think in it, try to write in it, try to speak to myself even in that language. For me, it's about actually putting what you're learning into practice — be that writing an email, speaking to yourself, listening to music, listening to the radio. Surrounding yourself, submerging yourself in the new language culture is extremely important.”
Remember, the best possible outcome of speaking a language is for people to speak back to you. Being able to have a simple conversation is a huge reward in itself. Reaching milestones like that early on will make it easier to stay motivated and keep practicing. And don't worry, you won't annoy people by speaking their language poorly. If you preface any interaction with, “I'm learning and I'd like to practice…” most people will be patient, encouraging and happy to oblige. Even though there are approximately a billion non-native English-speakers around the world, most of them would rather speak their own language if given a choice. Taking the initiative to step into someone else's language world can also put them at ease and promote good feelings all around:
“Sure, you can travel abroad speaking your own language, but you'll get so much more out of it being able to actually feel at ease in the place you are — being able to communicate, to understand, to interact in every situation you could possibly imagine.”
Forged documents originating on 4chan alleging that French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron was evading taxes spread online thanks to an ecosystem that includes social media, “alt-right” outlets, and fake news purveyors. The campaign was seemingly aided by Russian-linked entities, and it subsequently reached Macron's opponent, who aired the claim in a public debate.
Macron is competing in a May 7 runoff against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. On May 3, hours before a scheduled debate between Macron and Le Pen, an anonymous user on 4chan posted documents purporting to show that Macron used a shell company to dodge taxes. Users on the forum responded that the documents should be sent to “independent journalists” and “the alternative media” like “Cernovic (sic), Breitbart, and so on,” and encouraged each other to “spam” the documents “on social media” such as Twitter to get “it trending.” They also said to “send it to Le Pen.” The documents soon spread on Twitter, with many of the Twitter accounts promoting them appearing to have connections to Russia, according to a Belgian researcher. The claim was promoted by “alt-right” media figures such as Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec.
That these figures would attempt to smear Le Pen's opponent is not surprising given that Le Pen is widely admired by much of the “alt-right” and closely tied with Russia.
Along with Twitter, 4chan's campaign was picked up by forums on 8chan and Reddit; “alt-right” fringe outlets The Gateway Pundit, Got News, Zero Hedge, and Daily Stormer; and fake news purveyor Before It's News.
The 4chan-based documents eventually reached Le Pen herself. During her debate with Macron, she said, “I hope that we will not find out that you have an offshore account in the Bahamas.” Le Pen later backed down on her claim, and Macron filed a legal complaint against her for the statement. Multiple outlets have reported that the documents were fake, with The Telegraph noting that they were “widely denounced as crude forgeries.” Additionally, following Le Pen's accusation, the French prosecutor's office has opened an investigation regarding “suspicions of fake news being spread to influence Sunday's presidential vote.”
The case is yet another example of the way the misinformation ecosystem involving the “alt-right” and fake news purveyors amplifies fringe falsities and lies (and even Kremlin-connected conspiracy theories). The network has often succeeded in pushing those false claims into more traditional conservative and mainstream outlets and, thus, the public realm.

Coolearth HQ (TGW) – Cool Earth Solar has raised $21 million for its innovative solar ‘balloons'.
The design of the company's product is extremely unique. Solar ‘balloons' are suspended on wire structures, which frees the land below for other activities, like farming.The balloons can withstand the elements and up to 100 mph winds.
Because its design uses relatively cheap and readily available components, these solar concentrators can generate electricity at a cost comparable to that of natural-gas plants. According to Cool Earth Solar, the technology is 25x cheaper than installed solar panels.
Cool Earth Solar uses a technique called concentrated solar photovoltaics, in which light is magnified onto solar cells to maximize output. This reduces the number of panels needed in a given area.

Imagine you are at a restaurant and the menu doesn't have any prices. You ask one of the waitstaff how much a particular dish costs. It sounds like a reasonable question, but the waiter is dumbfounded. It's like no one ever asked him that question before. He tells you that he has to check with the cook. A few minutes later, he comes back and tells you that the cook has to check with another person. Finally, after what seems like an hour, you are told the price of the dish you were thinking about ordering. It's a little high, but not too bad and you have been sitting at this restaurant now for over an hour. You get the food, eat it, and ask for your bill. Here's the kicker. The price on the bill is three times higher than what you thought it would be. A new waiter shows up explaining that whoever told you the original price didn't know what they were talking about and that this is actually the price. Plus, you have to pay to use the plate that the food was on and that is an extra cost that wasn't part of the price you were originally quoted. You ate the food and you can't un-eat it. Now you have to pay for it even though it costs much more than your thought it would cost. This is our healthcare system.
Anyone who has spent hours on the phone being bounced around from automated system to automated system, and then to an occasional person before being transferred back to an automated system, again and again, understands that our healthcare system is horrible. The fact that it is so hard to find out the cost of a procedure, before actually having it done and getting billed for it, is extremely concerning. Fighting with insurance companies and medical billing companies over who pays what and how much you are getting screwed over is so frustrating that I can't understand why anyone would not want to fix this system.
Forget about the huge costs of prescriptions and the large co-pays and deductibles; I would do almost anything to no longer have the headache of fighting with the various healthcare entities, trying to get procedure codes, referral numbers, etc. and relating them to back and forth from doctor's offices and billing companies to insurance companies.
I guess most people just get whatever they need done and then get a bill for whatever it is. If you have a lot of money, then I guess it is easy to pay that and you don't have to bend over backwards to find out the costs before a procedure. But my family doesn't have a lot of money and so we are forced to spend time arguing with these various for-profit entities trying to find out costs and then trying to find out why the costs weren't what we were told they were.
Of course, there is a very simple solution to all of this, and that is a single-payer, government-run healthcare system. Anyone who has ever had to spend more than 15 minutes on the phone fighting with insurance companies and medical billing companies should be voting for Bernie Sanders.
It's that simple. If you like the system we have now then vote for whoever you like, but if you think as I do, that the system is broken and you fantasize about moving to a country with government-run health care, then there is only one real choice for president and that is Bernie Sanders.
Bernie Sanders is the only one running for president who understands that healthcare is a right that every American deserves and needs to have. It is time for hardworking Americans to rise up and tell the establishment that this system isn't working for us anymore and that it is time for a change. Other nations around the world have government healthcare systems. People in these other countries don't have to spend hours on the phone trying to find out how much a medical procedure will cost. They just get it done and that's it. No hassle, no arguing with insurance companies or medical billing companies, and no surprise costs.
The healthcare industry in this country is so frustrating to deal with that I have to think that people are ready for BernieCare.
SEOUL (Yonhap) — North Korea threatened on Monday to target the United States with its nuclear weapons, saying its front-line targets include the Pacific Ocean, not just South Korea.
The communist party's official newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, said the North is ready to conduct nuclear attacks on U.S. soil.
“North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's resolute determination is to defeat the U.S. on its own soil,” the newspaper said. “Our punishment will be the demise of the U.S.”
The North's threat came amid concerns that Pyongyang has advanced its nuclear capabilities, raising tension in the region.
U.S. Forces Korea Commander Curtis Scaparrotti said in mid-April that he assumes the communist nation has the ability to deliver a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead, but the North falls short of actually firing it as it has not yet been tested.
The North's road-mobile KN-08, though untested, is believed to have a range of at least 5,500 km, which puts Alaska at risk, according to U.S. officials.
North Korea has been under heavy sanctions by the United Nations Security Council for three nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 and multiple missile launches.
This image provided by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope May 4, 2006 shows a second red spot, smaller, emerging on Jupiter. For the first time in history, astronomers witnessed the birth of a new red spot on the giant planet, which is a half a billion miles away. The storm is roughly one-half the diameter of its bigger and legendary cousin, the Great Red Spot. This image was taken with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys on April 25, 2006.
Jupiter has a rocky core that is more than twice as large as previously thought, according to computer calculations by UC Berkeley and University of Arizona scientists.
Burkhard Militzer, an assistant professor of astronomy and earth and planetary science at Cal, simulated conditions inside the planet on the scale of individual hydrogen and helium atoms.
The simulation predicted the properties of hydrogen and helium for temperature, density and pressure at the surface, all the way to the planet's center. The technique is often used to study semi-conductors, according to a UC Berkeley statement on the discovery.
Militzer's partner, William B. Hubbard, from the University of Arizona, used the data to build the new model for Jupiter's interior.
A comparison of the model with the planet's current known mass, radius, surface temperature, gravity and equatorial bulge implies that Jupiter's core is an Earth-like rock 14 to 18 times the mass of Earth, or about one-twentieth of Jupiter's total mass, Militzer said.
Previous models predicted a much smaller core of only 7 Earth masses, or no core at all.
Jupiter, like many planets its size already discovered throughout the galaxy, is believed to be a failed star. Most of the planet's mass is made up of gas.
The results were published Nov. 20 in Astrophysical Journal Letters.
The simulation suggests that the core is made of layers of metals, rocks and ices of methane, ammonia and water, while above it is an atmosphere of mostly hydrogen and helium.
At the center of the rocky core is probably a metallic ball of iron and nickel, just like Earth's core, scientists said.
"Our simulations show there is a big rocky object in the center surrounded by an ice layer and hardly any ice elsewhere in the planet," Militzer said. "This is a very different result for the interior structure of Jupiter than other recent models, which predict a relatively small or hardly any core and a mixture of ices throughout the atmosphere."
"Basically, Jupiter's interior resembles that of Saturn, with a Neptune or Uranus at the center," he said.
Neptune and Uranus have been called "ice giants" because they also appear to have a rocky core surrounded by icy hydrogen and helium, but without the gas envelope of Jupiter and Saturn.
"This new calculation by Burkhard removes a lot of the old uncertainties of the 19-year-old model we have had until now," Hubbard said. "The new thermodynamic model is a more precise physical description of what's going on inside Jupiter."
Scientists said the large, rocky core implies that as Jupiter and other giant gas planets formed 4.5 billion years ago, they grew through the collision of small rocks. The rocks formed cores that captured a huge atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.
"According to the core accretion model, as the original planetary nebula cooled, planetesimals collided and stuck together in a runaway effect that formed planet cores," Militzer said. "If true, this implies that the planets have large cores, which is what the simulation predicts. It is more difficult to make a planet with a small core."
In order to match the observed gravity of Jupiter, Militzer's simulation also predicts that different parts of Jupiter's interior rotate at different rates.
Jupiter can be thought of as a series of concentric cylinders rotating around the planet's spin axis, with the outer cylinders - the equatorial regions - rotating faster than the inner cylinders. This is identical to the sun's rotation, Militzer said.
How They Did It …
Militzer modeled Jupiter's interior as a collection of 110 hydrogen and nine helium atoms in a tiny cube that is replicated throughout the planet, a common approximation in "density functional theory."
The ratio of hydrogen to helium atoms approximates the ratio measured on the surface of Jupiter.
Each simulation took from one to seven days on parallel computing clusters.
Based on this simulation, under the high pressure and temperature deep within the planet, hydrogen changes from a molecular to a metallic state, which provides good electrical conductivity and gives rise to Jupiter's magnetic field.
This transition happens gradually, contrary to earlier models that predict a sharp transition.
The new model of Jupiter predicts that most of the ices are concentrated in the outer layer of the core, while only a small amount is mixed in the hydrogen-helium gas envelope that contains 95 percent of the planet's mass.
The "planetary ices" in the envelope amount to about four Earth masses, or 1 percent of Jupiter's mass, Militzer said.
"The simulation was in pretty good agreement with what the Galileo probe measured" when the NASA spacecraft descended through Jupiter's atmosphere in 1995, Hubbard said.
Militzer plans to use the new model to simulate other planets' interiors, and to investigate the implications for the formation of planets outside our solar system.
Future data from NASA's Juno mission, to be launched in 2011, orbit Jupiter by 2016 and measure the planet's magnetic field and gravity, will provide a check on Militzer's predictions. Hubbard is one of the mission's co-investigators.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation supported the research.
Until now, the Obama campaign has consistently taken the position that the candidate's coat tails were sufficient help to down-ticket races. But in the closing days of the campaign, with Republicans imploding and tearing each other apart, they've decided to step up their efforts:
Now, with his lead in the polls holding steady, the Illinois senator has begun to volunteer his campaign staff to assist fellow Democrats, channel funds to state Democratic parties and appear himself on the campaign trail with other candidates.
That's good, but I hope they go further.
John Podesta, who is in charge of the transition, was here at FDL the other day and said that Democrats really need 60 votes in the Senate or there isn't much hope for the Employee Free Choice Act.
Likewise, the contours of health care legislation or an economic stimulus package would largely be determined by Republicans like Susan Collins or Olympia Snow if the Democrats are one or two votes shy, and that would make them the new powerbrokers.
We're just too close right now to let the opportunity slip away to let that happen. The potential is there to shut down any potential GOP filibuster in the Senate for the next 2 years.
Here's where Pollster has the McConnell/Lunsford race in Kentucky right now:
Mitch McConnell is the glue that holds the Republicans together. He has almost single-handedly kept the Democrats on the ropes since he became Minority Leader, and he's managed to run rings around the Democrats. Without him, the Republicans would be severely crippled. He's in bad shape in Kentucky — he's trending downward in the polls, and as shrewd an organizer as he is he's never been a good campaigner.
Now is the time to take him out.
Chambliss is likewise 46.1 to Martin's 42.2, and the gap is closing fast. Musgrove (45.6) is within shouting distance of Wicker (47.1). Franken, Merkeley and Hagen all have slim leads over their Republican opponents. A serious infusion of cash into these races could seal the deal for Obama's ability to legislate the kind of dramatic change he has promised, and the kind of change we desperately need right now.
Obama will raise more money than he can possibly spend before election day. He shouldn't take his eye off the ball — nothing is a lock in terms of the presidency, and his own race rightly demands all of his attention.
But if he can guarantee a loan to the DSCC, or send out a fundraising appeal to his email list on their behalf (or on behalf of Democrats in key Senatorial races), now is the time to do it.
Have your say
Pompey were held to a 0-0 draw at Braintree in a dreary clash.
There was virtually nothing in the way of excitement as Guy Whittingham's side continued their pre-season preparations against the Conference National outfit.
Ashley Harris had a chance on the stroke of half-time saved by Nathan McDonald.
And there was a penalty appeal for Braintree as Daniel Holman and Joe Devera tangled after the restart.
But that was where the action of note finished at the Amlin Stadium.
Still, Pompey could take a clean sheet and another 90 minutes of fitness under their belts as positives.
Sonny Bradley was the only player missing from the Pompey squad as a precaution after feeling groin plan in training.
He would have been glad to have given a wretched opening 45 minutes a miss.
It proved to be bleak stuff with next to nothing in the way of clear-cut opportunities.
Braintree were proving a solid test after turning over League Two rivals Southend last weekend.
Johnny Ertl had one of the few opening on 10 minutes after being teed up by Patrick Agyemang following good work from Jed Wallace - but he hit his shot out of the ground.
England C international Kenny Davis was busying himself in the middle of the park and Daniel Holman was putting himself about, and blasted a shot over after 33 minutes.
The best chance of the half came on the stroke of half-time as Agyemang freed Harris, but McDonald saved sharply from the Purbrook teenager's low drive.
Pompey made one change at the break as Agyemang was replaced by Tom Craddock.
Braintree had strong appeals for a penalty turned down when Devera and Sean Marks collided in the box on 54 minutes - but the ref waved play on.
And then Holman just missed a cross whipped across Phil Smith's box as Braintree pushed.
The wholesale subs anticipated around the hour mark duly arrived as Pompey made seven switches.
That gave a much more youthful look to Guy Whittingham's side as the likes of Nick Awford, Josh Warren, Liam Triggs, Jack Maloney and George Branford were given run-outs.
But the pattern of the game remained much the same with little in the way of clear chances.
Sub Nicky Symons did bring a save out of Phil Smith with a shot from long distance.
And there was time for Harris to fire a 25-yarder out of the ground on a night in Essex that will be quickly forgotten.
Pompey: Smith, Yassin, Webster, Devera, Butler, Wallace, Ertl, East, Holmes, Harris, Agyemang. Subs: Awford, Warren, Triggs, Craddock, Branford, Maloney, Barcham, Padovani. Not used: Sullivan, Connolly.

A consortium of organisations representing nurses in Australia is advocating for their role in digitally transforming the country's healthcare, arguing that it makes sense for nurses to lead in decision-making and act as knowledge brokers to transform services and empower patients.
The Nursing Informatics Position statement, developed by the Health Informatics Society of Australia, Nursing Informatics Australia, and the Australian College of Nursing, touts the role of nurses in the widespread implementation and adoption of digital health technologies as pivotal for the primary purpose of improving safety and quality of patient care.
"While the Australian healthcare system is the envy of many countries, in recent years, levels of improvement in health system performance have remained static and it may be argued, have plateaued," the report [PDF] explains.
"With strong commitment and enthusiasm to invest in clinical systems and rapidly move away from paper-based clinical documentation, there is an expectation that improved information management capability and data analytics will break through existing health system performance thresholds.
"However, technology alone will not achieve results."
Informatics is defined by the group as the integration of nursing science with multiple information and analytical sciences to identify, define, manage, and communicate data, information, knowledge, and wisdom in nursing practice.
According to the report, nursing informatics supports the likes of nurses, consumers, patients, and the inter-professional healthcare team in decision-making through the use of information structures, information processes, and information technology.
"All nurses must have some knowledge of nursing informatics to deliver healthcare in the digital age," the report adds.
The group also argues that building systems without clinician involvement has not been successful in the past, and that without opportunity for co-design with healthcare providers, the unintended consequence of further fragmentation of information and services is likely to arise.
"Practising clinicians -- nurses specifically -- must be enabled to take a leading role in digital healthcare to ensure technology is designed and used effectively," the report said. "Nurses must ensure that technology does not get in the way of patient care, but rather enhances capacity to deliver better, safer care."
The consortium believes successful planning, implementation, management, and sustainability of such technologies cannot be achieved without the "unique" contribution of nurses.
The report followed the release of Australia's digital health strategy on Monday after the green light was given from the Council of Australian Governments Health Council to automatically sign citizens up to the service.
It will see all Australians have a My Health Record by 2018, and all healthcare providers able to contribute to and use health information in My Health Record on behalf of their patients by 2022.
Despite approval from the council, there is currently no overarching standard in place to govern the sharing of data, with a public consultation on draft interoperability standards to determine an agreed vision and roadmap for implementation of interoperability slated to occur "by the end of 2018".
"Base-level requirements for using digital technology when providing care in Australia will be agreed, with improvements in data quality and interoperability delivered through adoption of clinical terminologies, unique identifiers, and data standards," the strategy explains.
"By 2022, the first regions in Australia will showcase comprehensive interoperability across health service provision."
The strategy, compiled with support from all eight Australian state and territory governments, said governments are embarking on major projects to implement state-wide electronic medical records and to achieve integration across the range of clinical information systems in hospitals and health services managed by a state or territory government.
While each state and territory is working within its own investment cycle, with its own software and integration partners, and is at a different point in achieving their respective goals, Australia's Digital Health Agency said there is a common pursuit to make health and, for some jurisdictions, human services information available in a more "timely and usable way".
Orion Health this week scored a five-year interoperability contract with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in Victoria.
The company's interoperability solution, Rhapsody Integration Engine, will be installed across the DHHS and 15 public health agencies. The organisation sought a vendor to help with its state-wide Health ICT Strategic Framework to connect all systems across the state, and deliver a health messaging integration application to replace a legacy solution.
Meanwhile in South Australia, concerns have been raised by the Australian Medical Association (AMA) over a new electronic records system being rolled out across the state's public hospitals. The AMA argued it is possibly not fit for purpose after surveying over 200 staff, including doctors and nurses, on their views of the AU$422 million enterprise patient administration system.
Almost 40 percent of respondents said their opinion of the system was poor.
The state's Health Minister Jack Snelling believes those who responded to the AMA survey were not representative of the wider medical workforce, calling them "serial whingers" in SA Parliament.
UNLAWFUL: Timaru police employee John Wainwright with a Bushmaster gun that has a pistol grip urges gun owners to comply with law changes.
Timaru police are urging firearm users to abide by a change in gun laws.
People with semi-automatic firearms fitted with free-standing pistol grips must contact police urgently to ensure they meet the new requirements.
The guns were reclassified as military style semi-automatic firearms in December last year.
Anyone with such a firearm has until June 11 to apply for an endorsement on their existing licence specific to the guns. Alternatively they can change the stock, or dispose of the firearm to a licensed person, firearms officer John Wainwright said.
The application fee of $204 will be waived for people applying for the endorsement, up until June 11.
"People located after the June 11 deadline will have to pay the full fee and may have the firearm in question seized by police."
Imagine if a company sent out a letter telling all their female staff to start wearing thick black tights. That “in the interests of modesty”, women had to cover up their legs with hosiery of no less than 40 deniers.
There would be a public outcry. How dare they tell women how to dress? Why does a woman have to dress ‘modestly' so long as she looks professional? And what's wrong with 20 deniers?
But this is exactly what has happened in a Hartlepool primary school.
"Girls, some of whom won't have reached puberty, are being told that they must cover up their legs 'in the interests of modesty.'”
Grant Carswell of St Hild's Church of England school recently wrote to parents telling them girls had to wear opaque black tights to make sure pupils were “properly safeguarded on their way to and from school.”
Let that sink in for a second.
Girls, most of whom won't have reached puberty, are being told that they must cover up their legs – either with black tights (of no less than 40 deniers, don't forget) or wear trousers – all “in the interests of modesty.”
It is reminiscent of Trentham High School in Stoke-on-Trent, who this summer said that girls had to wear “businesslike” trousers and not short skirts. Headteacher Dr Rowena Blencowe explained: "It's not pleasant for male members of staff and students either, the girls have to walk upstairs and sit down and it's a complete distraction.”
A screenshot of the letter from the school's website
There's nothing wrong with wanting to enforce a respectable dress code – most of us would agree it's inappropriate for both schoolgirls and women in the workplace to wear overly revealing clothes. Those in charge should have necessary regulations in place and enforce them only in extreme cases.
But what these schools are doing is focusing on female sexuality. The language gives it away. They are concerned about ‘safeguarding', about how girls are ‘distracting' male staff and boys, and how they are being ‘immodest'. Imagine if they asked boys to stop 'perving' instead.
"The ‘you were asking for it' culture – where female victims are told they're at fault for ‘encouraging' sexual crimes by wearing revealing clothes or behaving in a certain way – starts here."
The problem all comes when girls hit puberty and there's a mad scramble to make them hide their sexuality. The onus is all on them to change their behaviour, rather than on educating both sexes on appropriate behaviour.
Instead of using the opportunity to tell boys and girls about sexual harassment, personal boundaries and respect, these schools seem to have only imposed restrictions on the girls - some as young as five.
It's one the earliest examples of girls being told their sexuality and bodies are to blame for men being 'distracted'.
The ‘you were asking for it' culture – where sexual assault victims are told they're at fault for wearing revealing clothes or behaving in a certain way – starts here.
This kind of thinking stays with girls for the rest of their lives. Boys grow up thinking that when girls show too much flesh, it's somehow ‘wrong' and they should cover up to be ‘modest'. Girls grow up feeling shame around what they wear, and if ever they're sexually harassed, wonder if they're to blame.
Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society agees:
“It's fine for schools to have a uniform and a dress code but let's see them apply it equally to boys and girls. Modesty and safeguarding don't come into it. What they should be focusing on is opening up a world of opportunity to their young women, not controlling what they wear.”
None of this is new. It has been happening for generations, but as girls hit puberty earlier, they're being subjected to this kind of thinking at even younger ages. It's something I experienced when I started secondary school aged 11.
Much of the criticism was fair enough – when we rolled up our skirts, we expected to be told to take them down to the regulatory ‘two inches about the knee' length.
But what wasn't OK was being told to make sure our bras weren't visible through our pale green shirts – a near-impossible feat, so this was the material – or told to cross our legs so we didn't show our underwear in our skirts.
In my primary school we were even chastised for wearing knickers underneath our leotards during gymnastics.
It was embarrassing. We didn't feel like we'd done anything wrong, but we were being told off – our only crime seemed to be growing boobs and having a vagina. Whenever we inadvertently revealed our developing bodies, we were accused of being ‘immodest' and provocative.
"We didn't feel like we'd done anything wrong but we were being told off – our only crime seemed to be having growing boobs and a vagina."
We had no idea we were doing anything wrong. It brought about feelings of shame, of guilt, and of humiliation.
The boys in the neighbouring school escaped this. They were criticised for not looking smart, or having inappropriate hairstyles, yes. But they were never chastised for tempting us girls with their adolescent bodies .
If schools want to ensure that the next generation grow up without damaging stereotypes, they need to stop demanding that girls start covering up at the first sign of puberty - or before.
Instead they need to be respectful - a lesson they can pass on to their pupils, of both sexes.
So held federal District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan in yesterday's Zhang v. Baidu, Inc. (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2014). An excerpt (one paragraph break added):
In this suit, a group of New York residents who advocate for increased democracy in China sue one of China's largest companies, Baidu, Inc…. Plaintiffs contend that Baidu, which operates an Internet search engine akin to Google, unlawfully blocks from its search results here in the United States articles and other information concerning “the Democracy movement in China” and related topics.
The case raises the question of whether the First Amendment protects as speech the results produced by an Internet search engine. The Court concludes that, at least in the circumstances presented here, it does. Accordingly, allowing Plaintiffs to sue Baidu for what are in essence editorial judgments about which political ideas to promote would run afoul of the First Amendment….
The central purpose of a search engine is to retrieve relevant information from the vast universe of data on the Internet and to organize it in a way that would be most helpful to the searcher. In doing so, search engines inevitably make editorial judgments about what information (or kinds of information) to include in the results and how and where to display that information (for example, on the first page of the search results or later). In these respects, a “search engine's editorial judgment is much like many other familiar editorial judgments,” such as the newspaper editor's judgment of which wire-service stories to run and where to place them in the newspaper, the guidebook writer's judgments about which attractions to mention and how to display them, and Matt Drudge's judgments about which stories to link and how prominently to feature them….
[Plaintiffs] they seek to hold Baidu liable for, and thus punish Baidu for, a conscious decision to design its search-engine algorithms to favor certain expression on core political subjects over other expression on those same political subjects. To allow such a suit to proceed would plainly “violate[] the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.”
[Footnote:] That Plaintiffs allege that Baidu exercises editorial judgment “in cooperation with and according to the policies and regulations of” China makes no difference to the analysis. Plaintiffs allege that Baidu “purposely designs its systems and search engines to exclude” specific content. Whether it does so at the behest, or in furtherance of the interests, of China does not bear on the nature or extent of Baidu's First Amendment rights….
There is no irony in holding that Baidu's alleged decision to disfavor speech concerning democracy is itself protected by the democratic ideal of free speech. As the Supreme Court has explained, “[t]he First Amendment does not guarantee that … concepts virtually sacred to our Nation as a whole … will go unquestioned in the marketplace of ideas.” For that reason, the First Amendment protects Baidu's right to advocate for systems of government other than democracy (in China or elsewhere) just as surely as it protects Plaintiffs' rights to advocate for democracy. Indeed, “[i]f there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.”
Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has been a hot topic this year as energy companies and environmentalists battle over environmental concerns. The debate could soon intensify as new studies sponsored by the fracking industry show there might be connections between fracking and earthquakes. Read along to learn about the research and who might be affected.
The first study
Our story begins in England, where in the spring, two small earthquakes struck in a region where Cuadrilla Resources had drilled and fracked two wells. After the earthquakes, the company voluntarily stopped fracking until a study could be done to determine if there was a connection between fracking and the earthquakes.
The study, called "Geomechanical Study of Bowland Shale Seismicity," was published last week. A summary states:
The report concludes that it is highly probable that the fracking at Preese Hall-1 well triggered the recorded seismic events. This was due to an unusual combination of factors including the specific geology of the well site, coupled with the pressure exerted by water injection. This combination of geological factors was rare and would be unlikely to occur together again at future well sites.
While the report concludes that it would be unlikely for the combination to occur again, other studies and recent events suggest it may not be as unusual as the report claims.
Oklahoma
In January, a series of 43 small earthquakes shook Oklahoma. A study by the Oklahoma Geological Survey, currently under peer review, concludes that "there is a possibility these earthquakes were induced by hydraulic fracturing. However, the uncertainties in the data make it impossible to say with a high degree of certainty whether or not these earthquakes were triggered by natural means or by the nearby hydraulic-fracturing operation."
While inconclusive, there's no doubt that more studies will need to be done to determine if fracking and earthquakes are linked. With another earthquake last week in Oklahoma -- the largest recorded in the state in more than 50 years -- this question will be on residents' minds. With Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK) and SandRidge Energy (NYSE: SD) both headquartered in Oklahoma City, residents know who to ask.
SandRidge spun off some of its Oklahoma holdings this year when it IPO'd the Sandridge Mississippian Trust I (NYSE: SDT) . Other drillers in the area include RAM Energy Resources (Nasdaq: RAM) and Range Resources (NYSE: RRC) .
More studies are likely in the near term. It will be interesting to see how residents respond if increased earthquake activity is indeed caused by hydraulic fracturing.
A handful of new states legalized marijuana on Election Day, so could Texas be next?
Newly elected Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg already plans to decriminalize the drug when she takes office.
“I want to send offenders for non-violent offences, especially marijuana, around jail. I don't want them to pay bail. Most importantly, we don't have people to have a permanent criminal record for a small offense that then stands in the way of future opportunity,” Ogg told KHOU 11 News on Election Day.
State lawmakers have already filed six new bills involving marijuana. Most involve decreasing punishments for people caught with small amounts of the drug.
House Bill 58 would create a specialty court for certain first-time marijuana possession offenders to free up law enforcement and correction resources, according to the Texas Tribune.
House Bill 81 replaces criminal penalties with civil fines for offenders caught with up to an ounce of marijuana.
House Bill 82 would classify possession of up to an ounce of marijuana as a Class C misdemeanor instead of a Class B misdemeanor.
Senate Joint Resolution 17 proposes voters decide if they want to legalize pot.
Senate Joint Resolution 18 proposes voters decide if they want to legalize pot for medical use.
The Texas Tribune reports Senate Bill 170 would also change possession of a small amount of weed from a criminal offense to a civil offense.
Drug policy expert Katharine Neill thinks the recent legalization of marijuana in several states has created momentum for change in Texas.

“We have to wait and see how republican leadership is going to respond to that and whether there's going to be a lot of resistance to that kind of change,” said Neill, Postdoctoral Fellow in Drug Policy at the Baker Institute at Rice University.
Neill explained current pot penalties in Texas don't match the severity of the crime.
She says she is a believer in legalizing marijuana, especially when it comes to medical use.
“I think we have a good chance of seeing some reforms happen this session," she said.
Groups in favor of legalizing the drug are already rallying support for the new proposals.
“We encourage everyone to contact your representatives and tell them to support House Bill 81, Senate Joint Resolution Number 17 and 18. This would put it on the ballot for voters to decide, which is important because that would also open up a lot more public discourse and discussion about the issue," said Jason Miller, communications director for NORML. "The question isn't whether Texas should legalize marijuana, it's when is it going to happen and what is it going to look like in terms of the regulatory framework and the licensing."
However, others aren't so sure S.J.R. 17 and 18 will ever make it on a ballot.
“I think both would have a decent chance of passing if voters were allowed to decide. Whether or not voters will be given that option, I think that's the big question here," Neill said. "I think that's something we're going to have to wait and see how this plays out. I do imagine there will be some opposition to that."
KHOU 11 News asked Governor Greg Abbott for a response to the proposed legislation.
Press Secretary John Wittman said, “Governor Abbott opposes the legalization of marijuana in the State of Texas.”
Swiss star Fabian Cancellara became the first four-time men's world champion in the elite ranks on Thursday with a thoroughly dominant performance. Cancellara finished over a minute ahead of Great Britain's David Millar, with Tony Martin (Germany) pulling off an impressive bronze medal ride despite puncturing. Related Articles Worlds record: Cancellara the TT king
The elite men had to cover two laps of a 22.8 kilometre circuit that included two climbs per lap and a difficult descent. Unlike the U23 Men and elite women, however, they did not face rain and gusting wind.
The riders were sent off in four waves, with Jose Ivan Gutierrez (Spain) setting the top time in the first group. His stay in the hot seat lasted until halfway through the second wave, when Maciej Bodnar (Poland) knocked nearly 42 seconds off the leading time.
Bodnar's time would be good enough for ninth, but faster riders were starting in the third wave, with one of the local Australian favourites, Michael Rogers, last to start in the group. Rogers came close to breaking the one hour mark, and would take the hot seat until the final five riders started to come in. He would eventually finish a solid fifth.
In the final wave, some of the top contenders struggled, including 2008 world champion Bert Grabsch (Germany) and Canada's Svein Tuft. Koos Moerenhout (Netherlands) came close to Rogers, and David Zabriskie finished eighth, despite almost missing his start when the U.S. team showed up for the bike check barely a minute before his start. The American was getting visibly agitated as the clock ticked down to 20 seconds and no bike appeared. He finally got clipped in with about 10 seconds to go.
Millar was fifth from the end, and he started very strongly, setting the fastest opening split, 6.5 seconds ahead of Cancellara. He continued to ride strongly through the rest of the race and become the first rider to crack the one hour mark with a finishing time of 59:11.94.
The Olympic sliver medalist, Gustav Larsson (Sweden) followed, but was never in contention. Tony Martin was next, and was only ten seconds back until a front-wheel puncture late in the first lap slowed him. An impressive final eight-kilometre run saw him pull back 20 seconds on Millar, and move into third. He finished less than ten seconds down on the British rider, so the flat may have meant the difference between bronze and silver.
Martin displaced Australian Richie Porte for the final podium spot, as the pair of young riders battled back and forth, each finishing a shade under the hour. However, the battle for the gold medal was over halfway through the first lap, as the defending world champion pegged back Millar's lead and then inexorably began to pull away.
After 14.7 kilometres he was one second up on Millar, after a full lap it was 11seconds, then 24 seconds, 44 seconds and, finally, over a minute. Once again, Spartacus had decisively answered the question of who is the top man in the race of truth.
The hardest-earned rainbow jersey
"Yeah, I am really happy," Cancellara said afterwards. "I think this might be the hardest one of all the four [wins]. To come here and not be 100% was difficult, but since the Vuelta I started to be really focused on everything I could in order to be 100% for this day and to do whatever I could, which was a 100% performance. This was a really, really hard parcours that, from the beginning, I didn't really expect would be so hard.
"I've learnt a lot from the other years that when people say, 'it looks like this, or that' [that] only when you see it for real you can then say how it really is. Tony [Martin] said before that he also expected a different parcours, so it was the same for everybody, and I did what I had to do, which was to ride 100% perfect. I did a great tactic in not riding too fast in the beginning, because I knew in the end it would be really really hard with the wind and these two climbs.
"It is never easy. People think you can ride with one leg and win easily always, but it is never easy to win bike races. Even when people expect that 'any way, Cancellara is going to win' it is never true. There are always riders that keep going and trying and become a star, and beat me and I have seen also when I came here I have not the same power inside my body. When you win three times already and you come close to four times I had to find another motivation. Today, this motivation was to make history. That was actually the big strength that kept me focused on it. My season is already perfect with the spring and the Tour and now with this victory today. But you can have ups and downs - nobody is perfect - sometimes you can have a bad day. That is part of a human being.
"This was the hardest for sure. I was pretty nervous yesterday, the other day, and this morning, because I have high ambitions on my own and expectations of my own," Cancellara said. "I wasn't 100% for these conditions but sometimes it is not so important to be 100%. To be 100% and make mistakes or not be 100% and make things right from the focus. I pulled out of the Vuelta to focus on this and relax at home before coming to Australia. It is a long travel and takes many days to recover from this jetlag. I think I am getting over that now, and I am really happy to have done what I did today."
For his part, David Millar was content with silver, commenting, "Congratulations to Fabian first. There is no doubt he is a phenomenon. But I came here hoping to get on the podium and that's what I did, so it is a lovely feeling to be actually achieve the objective I was aiming for.
"I felt good. I felt great on the first lap. My tactic was the opposite of Fabian's, it was to attack the first lap and then hang on for dear life. And that's basically what I did. I felt great and even at the first lap with the three climbs, by the end of the last climb I was coming up that the first time and I thought, 'Oh god this is going to hurt the next time round', and it did. It was very hard and I think we can safely say that in the road race that is going to be a hard climb. We suffered enormously just going up it twice. It is a hard course.
"I went a bit slow through a couple of corners, especially on the descent, but I am very happy with my ride. My power was good, everything was good. Unfortunately, I just need to be going faster and stronger to beat Fabian. And corner faster. But I am pleased with my ride and there is nothing I would change about it."

Kip Tom, the Leesburg Indiana farmer who will stand today with President Trump complaining about the federal estate tax, cashed over $3.3 million in farm subsidy checks, including $2.6 million between 2004 and 2014, the most recent data available.
Kip Tom and Tom Farms is one of the biggest corn and soybean producers in Indiana and the ninth largest farm subsidy recipient in Indiana.
Arriving at a total for Tom Farms subsidies required examining subsidies to three different ownership entities, as the farm went from individual ownership to an LLC in roughly 1995 and then formed Tom Farms Partners in 2004.

In 1995, Kip Tom took in $42,826, but then refunded $17,494 for a net of $25,332. Between 1995 and 2014, this equals over $3,305,625 in government subsidies,
It's It's long been known that Jordan Klepper, a charming upturned broom who is also a correspondent on Comedy Central's “The Daily Show,” would be getting his own series at that network. Now, at last, we're getting some details on the production called “The Opposition”.
According to a statement published on According to a statement published on Deadline , the show, which will blend elements of “The Daily Show” with Klepper's meet-the-public segments on it, will, “satirize the hyperbolic, conspiracy-laden noise machine that is the alternative-media landscape on both the right and left.” The description continues, saying the show is, “the voice of the new America. It is the America that defines its own reality. It's the America of paid protestors, Obama's birth certificate, and the certainty that CNN is fake news.”
Clearly, the paranoid, red-faced, screaming hedgehog that is Alex Jones is the target here, as is Breitbart, Donald Trump, Fox News and, yes, the wide collection of leftie, progressive news sites that claim Hillary Clinton invented chemtrails and Flintstones Chewables cause autism. How wonderfully timely.
In this, “The Opposition” seems primed to mirror the success and aim of “The Colbert Report” — the show starring Stephen Colbert as a bloviating right-wing host of an America-first Fox Newseque program that ran on Comedy Central from 2005 to 2014. Like the “Colbert Report,” “The Opposition” is a spin-off of Comedy Central's tentpole light-night series, “The Daily Show,” and will appear right after it in the 11:30 p.m. time slot. Both Colbert and Klepper were popular correspondents and sometime hosts of “The Daily Show”.
Remember those creepy human anatomy dolls from science class? The ones with the removable organs? Mojang and Jinx have teamed up to make one for Minecraft's most iconic villain, and it's incredibly educational.
Due to be released next month via Jinx and Toys'R'Us, just in time for the 2014 San Diego Comic Con, the Minecraft Creeper Anatomy Doll is a clever piece that takes the original Jinx vinyl Creeper and splits it in two. On one side, the green goblin's familiar exterior. On the other, bones and brains and stuff to make your precious creations blow-up real good.
The piece comes packaged in a clear box with an insert that helpfully points out the important bits. Indeed, one could keep this packaged on a shelf and it would still be just as informative, if not more so. But screw that.

If you left this in its box, you'd never know the joy of putting it together and taking it apart. Sure, you could point to bits like the brain, a finely-honed organ with the sole purpose of targeting your stuff.
Now would you enjoy the immediacy of the explosives stuffed into its torso, attached to the brain via a spinal column that doubles as a fuse (hence the hissing noise).

But most importantly you would not be able to take it apart and put it together again on video, while trying desperately not to give away the fact that you could really use a manicure.
The folks at Jinx are calling the Creeper Anatomy Doll "probably our biggest new release of 2014." Considering the most hardcore Minecraft fans have just about everything they need inside of the game, this educational tool should make a fine gift, reminding them that the people not made of simple polygons wouldn't mind hanging out with them once in awhile.

The Minecraft Creeper Anatomy Doll will be available next month at Jinx and Toys'R'Us. I'm guessing it'll run somewhere between $30 and $40, which seems a small price to pay for learning.
The court date for a French political big-shot accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid was put off until tomorrow while authorities examine him at a hospital for evidence.
Lawyers for International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was yanked off a jet and arrested in the alleged sodomy attack of a hotel maid yesterday, said their client agreed to a “scientific and forensic examination” that will be conducted tonight.
The 62-year-old had been expected to be arraigned tonight on charges a criminal sex act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment.
“Our client willing consented to a scientific and forensic examination tonight at the request of the government,” said one of Strauss-Kahn's attorneys, Bill Taylor. His client is “tired, but he's fine.”
Earlier today, the maid identified Strauss-Kahn out of a police lineup, cops said. His lawyers say Strauss-Kahn denies any wrongdoing and will plead not guilty.
Strauss-Kahn was arrested last night for allegedly sodomizing the hotel maid yesterday — hauled off an Air France flight just moments before takeoff from Kennedy Airport, police sources said.
Three Port Authority detectives pulled Strauss-Kahn from the plane's first-class cabin just two minutes before it was due to depart for Paris, according to the police sources.
Strauss-Kahn — who was expected to challenge French President Nicholas Sarkozy in the 2012 election — was turned over to NYPD officers and brought to the Special Victims Unit's uptown squad room.
FRENCH POL A WOMANIZER
AGENCY'S GLOBAL MONEY MISSION
The trouble began at around 1 p.m. yesterday when a 32-year-old housekeeper entered Strauss-Kahn's $3,000-a-night suite at the luxury Sofitel on West 44th Street — apparently unaware he was still inside.
The married Strauss-Kahn was in the bathroom, and emerged naked, chased her down a hallway and pulled her into a bedroom, where “he jumps her,” a source said.
“She pulled away from him and he dragged her down a hallway into the bathroom where he engaged in a criminal sexual act, according to her account to detectives,” Browne said. “He tried to lock her into the hotel room.”
Soon afterward, Strauss-Kahn got dressed and headed off to JFK for a flight to Paris.
When he was approached on the plane by Port Authority cops, he said, “What is this about?” sources said. He was taken off the aircraft without handcuffs.
Two law-enforcement sources said Strauss-Kahn was trying to flee authorities. Police said he left his cellphone and other personal items in the room.
“It looked like he got out of there in a hurry,” Browne said.
Strauss-Kahn, who had a meeting planned for today with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, has an arrangement with Air France that allows him to get on any flight and sit in first class, the sources said. He was traveling alone.
Browne said Strauss-Kahn does not have diplomatic immunity. He was expected to be brought to court today.
The victim was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where she was treated for trauma.
The shocking arrest came hours after a Socialist Party ally of Strauss-Kahn accused Sarkozy of kicking off a smear campaign against his longtime rival — focusing on his lavish lifestyle, including his preference for suits from the same tailor favored by President Obama.
“There is now a totally structured and orchestrated campaign, which has already been announced by Mr. Sarkozy and his closest allies, to attack the character of Strauss-Kahn,” Socialist politician Jean-Marie Le Guen told Europe 1 radio.
Strauss-Kahn's stint at the helm of the IMF in Washington does not officially end until September 2012, several months after the scheduled date of France's presidential vote.
But the French political world has been buzzing with speculation that the man popularly known as “DSK” would bring a premature end to his tenure and throw his hat in the ring.
And some opinion polls suggested he would win.
In France's 2007 elections, Strauss-Kahn lost the Socialist nomination to Segolene Royal, who in turn was defeated in the general election by Sarkozy, leader of the right-wing Union for a Popular Movement.
But Sarkozy, who still sees Strauss-Kahn as his likeliest electoral rival, is believed to have maneuvered Strauss-Kahn out of France by backing him to head the Washington-based IMF.
A spokeswoman for the State Department had no comment, nor did a spokesperson for the French Embassy.
Caroline Atkinson, an IMF spokeswoman, issued a statement this morning that said the agency would have no comment on the New York case. She referred all inquiries to Strauss-Kahn's personal lawyer and said the “IMF remains fully functioning and operational.“

Feb. 6 (UPI) -- Is the sex real? At lamprey spawning sites, the answer is often no.
New research suggests much of the sex at lamprey gatherings is simulated. Though males may release sperm during the act, females don't make their eggs available. Scientists call the act "sham mating."
Scientists knew the nonparasitic lamprey, Lethenteron kessleri, like many lamprey species, was promiscuous -- taking on dozens of mates. But they wondered why. Mating uses up significant amounts of energy and exposes the involved parties to the risk of predation.
Experiments suggest females use "sham mating" as a way to maintain control over her eggs. Females can can go through motions until they find the right male.
RELATED Chimpanzees seek out genetically different mates
When a scientist at Hokkaido University in Japan placed two lampreys, one female and one male, in the same tank, sham mating was infrequent. Most of the sex was real. Females had no choice.
But when a female lamprey was placed in a tank with multiple males, the rate of sham mating -- mating without the release of eggs -- increased. Females faked it more often.
"The study shows there is a possibility that, despite the presence of many males, females recognize individual males and actively control when they release their eggs; and that this depends on the body size, nest-building abilities, and other qualities of the male," researcher Itsuro Koizumi said in a news release. "The discovery of pre-breeding mate selection in highly promiscuous creatures is a new finding and of great interest."
RELATED Study explores why male baboons become domestic abusers
Researchers detailed their findings in the Journal of Ethology.
"It is highly advantageous for females if they can choose their mate even when a large number of females and males gather at a single spawning site," Koizumi added. "Even though our results are only preliminary, further examination of the lampreys' breeding behavior should give us a deeper understanding of mate selection and the evolution of breeding systems."
An Islamist rebel administration in Somalia had a 13-year-old girl stoned to death for adultery after the child's father reported that three men had raped her.
Amnesty International said the al-Shabab militia, which controls the southern port city of Kismayo, arranged for a group of 50 men to stone Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow in front of a crowd of about 1,000 spectators. A lorryload of stones was brought to the stadium for the killing.
Amnesty said that Duhulow struggled with her captors and had to be forcibly carried into the stadium.
"At one point during the stoning, Amnesty International has been told by numerous eyewitnesses that nurses were instructed to check whether Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow was still alive when buried in the ground. They removed her from the ground, declared that she was, and she was replaced in the hole where she had been buried for the stoning to continue," the human rights group said.
"Inside the stadium, militia members opened fire when some of the witnesses to the killing attempted to save her life, and shot dead a boy who was a bystander."
Amnesty said witnesses originally reported that Duhulow was 23-years-old, based on her appearance. But the human rights group found out from her father that she was a child.
Duhulow's father told Amnesty that when they tried to report her rape to the militia, the child was accused of adultery and detained. None of the men Duhulow accused was arrested.
"This was not justice, nor was it an execution," said Amnesty's Somalia campaigner, David Copeman. "This child suffered an horrendous death at the behest of the armed opposition groups who currently control Kismayo.
"This killing is yet another human rights abuse committed by the combatants to the conflict in Somalia, and again demonstrates the importance of international action to investigate and document such abuses, through an international commission of inquiry."
Amnesty said al-Shabab had created a climate of fear in which government officials, journalists and human rights activists faced death threats and killing if they spoke against the militia.
Russians are divided almost fifty-fifty on the possibility of a new ‘cold war' between Russia and the United States, a state-run pollster said Monday.
MOSCOW, October 7 (RIA Novosti) – Russians are divided almost fifty-fifty on the possibility of a new ‘cold war' between Russia and the United States, a state-run pollster said Monday.
Some 46 percent of respondents said they believe a new cold war scenario is possible, while 48 percent said it was unlikely or impossible (up from 37 percent and 44 percent respectively, in 2009), according to the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTsIOM).
The respondents cited the case of US intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden as the chief problem in Russia-US relations (9 percent), followed by the struggle for global domination (6 percent), the situation in the Middle East (6 percent), and differences on policy issues (5 percent).
Only 3 percent said nuclear weapons were a problem, down from 8 percent in 2009.
Key areas of collaboration between the US and Russia named by respondents included international terrorism (12 percent) and efforts to prevent armed conflicts (10 percent). Other priorities include economic collaboration (5 percent), cultural and scientific exchanges (4 percent) and space (2 percent).
The poll was conducted on August 24-25 among 1,600 residents in 130 cities and towns across the country. The margin of error is under 3.4 percent.
LUCKNOW: Nine activists of Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha SCS ), the student's wing of Samajwadi Party , were detained by the police on Friday when they sat in protest outside Lucknow University vice-chancellor SP Singh 's residence.They were demanding the withdrawal of cases against students arrested on June 7 for showing black flags to chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi.LU authorities said four of these students had been expelled earlier for indiscipline and indulging in violence on the campus in different cases. Of the remaining, two are currently LU students, and the rest outsiders.Police said all activists were detained for vitiating peace and order and charged under section 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code. They, however, refused to sign a bail bond and preferred to go to jail, said inspector Mahanagar RN Rai. Earlier, high drama had marked the detention of the SCS activists. Around 30 activists sat on a 'hunger strike' outside the VC's residence. They put up banners and chanted slogans demanding release of the arrested students. They also demanded that LU revokes their suspension. The protest continued for two hours before heavy police was rushed to the spot.On June 7, 14 students including two girls were arrested for showing black flags to the CM and blocking his cavalcade when he was a on way to attend a function in LU. Three were released the same day after they signed personal bonds. However, 11 were sent to jail on serious charges of rioting and breaching VIP security. Since then, various students organizations have been protesting against the action. "Student leaders said they sat on a demonstration because the VC was not available for a meeting despite an appointment," said Trishul Dhari Singh, an SCS activist.The VC said he had given time to these students for a meeting on Wednesday but they didn't turn up. "I am available in my office...what is the need to protest outside my residence," he added. About the four students expelled earlier, LU spokesperson Prof NK Pandey said Vivek Singh Baba and Neeraj Shukla were expelled in 2016 for passing lewd comments at girls, Suraj Pratap Singh in 2015 on charges of carrying a firearm, indulging in violence, extortion and kidnapping, and Karunesh Dwivedi for vitiating peace.

Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski, an educated geologist, presents an article today at the online Spiegel explaining how the once highly ballyhooed “97% consensus” claim is in fact deceptive and “a half-truth”: Failed Scientists' Call To Action at UN Climate Conference: The 97 Percent Trap.
Bojanowski begins by describing how last year even President Obama tweeted the claim, but then adds that the “claimed consensus among scientists is actually something other than what Obama suggests“.
97 scientists “deceiving the public”
And on the latest pre-New York Climate Conference campaign by 97 scientists promoting the idea of consensus, the Spiegel journalist writes that “they are deceiving the public“.
Last year scientists led by John Cook of the University of Queensland published in the journal Environmental Research Letters a study showing that more than 97% of scientists claim global warming is man-made. Bojanowski writes: “They [the scientists] had asked environmental activists at the Internet site ‘Skeptical Science' to evaluate thousands of climate studies.”
On the results Bojanowski writes that “less than 1% of the studies expressly disputed the impact by man. A good two thirds took no position on the topic – and so were not included.”
No consensus to speak of
Bojanowski blasts the results of the survey, explaining that “the study confirms only a banality: Scientists are for the most part in agreement than man contributes to climate warming. Even hard-nosed critics of climate science do not doubt the physical principle that exhaust from automobiles, factories and power plants warm the air.” He then reminds readers that man's impact is a side issue, and that the real issue is the extent man has an impact and whether or not the climate warming is a dangerous thing. Here on the real central issues Bojanowski writes there is absolutely no consensus to speak of.
So why are the 97 scientists trying to produce a different impression? Bojanowski provides an answer:
The public, so the authors justify the idea behind the study, are hesitating to support climate protection because of uncertainty over the consensus among scientists. […] The 97 percent campaign is to ‘strengthen' the study, the initiators at ‘Skeptical Science' write.”
Massive criticism from experts worldwide
Critical reaction from other experts came rapidly, Bjoanowski cites Dan Kahan of Yale Law School, who believes the message “promotes the polarization of society“. Also cited is meteorologist Victor Venema of the University of Bonn, who wrote that “‘consensus' is in itself uncomfortable to many scientists.”
Bojanowski also puts Georgia Tech professor Judith Curry down as a harsh critic of the Cook study asl well. Curry calls the nature of such a survey “senseless”.
Also Richard Tol is cited in the Spiegel article. Bojanowski writes:
Richard Tol of the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin aims methodical criticism at Cook's study: The evaluated climate studies were haphazardly selected. And whether or not the people evaluating the studies worked reliably was not tested. ‘People who want to argue that climate researchers are secretive and incompetent,' says Tol polemically, ‘only have to point to the 97% consensus paper'.”
Bojanowski ends the piece with a shot of sarcasm, telling readers that “the Environmental Research Letters, which published the paper, was impressed by the Cook study. They selected it “best article of 2013“.
The order of your pH dependent products
as I don't use any retinoids
Click image to view: What's In My Skincare Wardrobe: Actives (Prescriptions, Antioxidants, and Acids) Edition
at night because it makes your skin photosensitive
if there was a reason for that specific order
was the wait time necessary
and if they all function at a low pH, can't they just apply them one after the other?
Borderline NSFW analogies if the technical terms are making your head spin
The reason for the order has to do with the relative pH requirements of the different products. Vit C and the other acids need to be at different pHs to be effective. Think of it as cooking temperature- different meats require different temperatures, right? So say that you are cooking beef and pork to medium-rare.
If you cook them both together at the same temp, you are going to get into trouble - beef needs a temp of 130-135 but pork needs a temp of 145-150. So if you cook them at the 'beef temp', the pork will be undercooked, but if you cook them at the 'pork temp' the beef will be waaay overcooked. So you have to do them separately. Does that make sense?
Also, your Hada Labo is hydrating so it will contain moisturizing ingredients that will block the acids' ability to access the skin. It should go after all your acids.
Start with the lowest pH dependent product, which is the Vit C. It needs to go on a 'bare' face, and it's so low-pH-dependent [link] that you either have to wait 15-20 min after washing your face for your skin to naturally go back down to pH 4.2-5.6 on its own [link], or force it down with a pH adjusting toner (I use Mizon AHA BHA toner, which is around 4.5, so on the low end of 'natural' skin pH) if your skin will dry out too much for waiting.
The harder your Vit C has to work to get your skin to a sub-3.5 pH, the more wasted effort- when the Vit C could have been working its magic on your skin, instead it's burning its efforts on lowering pH. Vit C needs 15 minutes ~alone in a candlelit room with smooth jazz~ with your skin (and by that I mean Vit C has a 15 min absorption time/effectiveness window), and if it's gotta waste time pleading at the door for you to lower that pH and let it in baby! Then that's minutes of antioxidant sexytime that you are giving up.
However, BHA has a higher pH effectiveness range, of 3-4, so you really don't want it crashing your Vit C party. AHA is higher still, all the way up to 4.5. So since your Vit C is ~sensitive~ you want to take care of it before you start flirting with higher pH products like BHA and AHA, because it will get huffy and sulk off.
The reason you want BHA before AHA is less about pH (unless your AHA is between 4-4.5 in which case it's going to mess up your BHA) and more about oil. BHA is oil-soluble, AHA is not. So, you need the BHA to go in first and battle the sebum in your pores and clear them out, so it's not in the way when you apply your AHA.
Some last notes and warnings
To be honest, the first time I ever saw Fable – Lionhead's 4v1 multiplayer remix of Fable, due out later this year – I could have made a confident educated guess that it would be free to play. Its reliance on team play and selection of different, customisable heroes suggested a splash of LoL and DOTA might have found its way into the design document. The developer has now officially confirmed it, shortly after announcing that players on PC can join Xbox One owners in the same matches.
For fans already thrown by the idea of multiplayer-only Fable, this might not seem like the most reassuring news, but it certainly appears that Lionhead aspires to the Valve model of free-to-play as opposed to, say, the Candy Crush model – or, worse, the increasingly prevalent "paymium" model, where a developer asks for £45 up-front and then also tries to tempt you into micro-payments. This inspires confidence, at least in me.
The game itself, which was already promisingly fun when I played it last year, is a convincing action-orientated arena combat experience when you're playing as one of the team of four heroes and a reactive strategy game when you take on the role of the villain, placing enemies for them to slaughter (or succumb to). With ten heroes now in place it's got a robust selection of playstyle options. The combat was never the best thing about Fable – not by a mile – but Legends' fighting spans a variety of third-person action styles: playing a ranged character, it feels like a Gears-style third-person shooter, whereas some of the sword-wielders have a touch of Devil May Cry flavour.
Here's how things will work: any PC or Xbox One player will be able to download the game for free. There will be a whole story's worth of quests at launch, with more to be released episodic-style every few months, and continuous updates. There will be no paywalls, no limited game time, no horrible "energy bars" or "gems" or whatever that take time to recharge. There will be 4 heroes available to play at any one time, and they will rotate every 2 weeks. Then, if you want to keep playing a character, you can either wait for them to come back into rotation (with all your XP and equipment intact), or pay to unlock them permanently. You can pay either with earned in-game money or real money, and you can also pay for cosmetic items; everything gameplay-related can only be earned through play. The same goes for villain players: different villain monsters will rotate every few weeks, and you can pay to unlock them permanently.
Creative director David Eckelberry clearly wants Fable Legends to lead the way for high-budget free-to-play games on consoles, in terms of value and fairness as well as, presumably, popularity. "The right version of F2P is a very good thing for the world. The wrong version is kind of an abomination, but if you're very fair to your players and they can play as much as they want, then it seems right."
Statistically, usually 90 per cent of players of free-to-play games never spend so much as 50 pence on a new hat, which means that any successful game needs to have a pretty huge player base. "We need scale," says Lionhead's studio head John Needham. "PC gives us that scale element, but even with the core Xbox audience, we've got a lot to work with there."
"[We need] millions, probably," reckons Eckelberry. "But then, previous Fable games have hit those kinds of numbers. We're taking on a lot of risk, I accept that and so does Microsoft, but there's no risk for you, as a player."
Of course, the biggest problem for Lionhead and Fable Legends might not be the business model, but the challenges of making an online-reliant game that launches without enormous game-breaking problems on two platforms simultaneously (Xbox and PC). Making a multiplayer game at all is new ground for this studio, let alone one with 4-versus-1 gameplay that relies on servers. With disasters like Drive Club and Halo: Master Chief Collection fresh in the memory, how can Lionhead ensure that Fable Legends launches well?
"The honest answer is a really long beta," says Eckelberry. "There's a lot of new stuff for us both in game design and technologically: cross-platform, Windows 10, all of the networking we have to do is mostly new to us. We run into game-crashing bugs frequently in our beta. But we want to find them NOW, so we have time to fix them... a bad launch week sticks with you forever. Nobody ever forgets – and they shouldn't, I think fans are right not to forget it. They might forgive it… but I don't blame fans for saying “dude, you screwed this up”. I don't want to be in that place."
To that end, Fable Legends has no solid launch date beyond "2015", and is unlikely to get one until much nearer the end of the year. That way, Lionhead can gradually open up the (currently closed) beta to more and more people and launch when there's confidence that everything is working at scale. It's never going to be a 100 per cent sure thing, but the studio is giving itself ample time to ramp up Fable Legends gradually.
Multiplayer-only Fable will always be a tough sell for some, but the game's fun, crucially, the fairytale Fable feel is definitely there, and the barrier to entry is low, so anyone can try it out (and then walk away with wallet intact if it doesn't appeal). Free-to-play actually seems less risky to me than asking people to pay £45 for a multiplayer-focused take on a series that's got such strong single-player memories attached to it. The beta is likely to expand its player population in the coming months. If you're curious, you can sign up here.
On May 4, The New York Times published an article about Brendon Babenzien's recently revamped Noah clothing label. Originally launched in 2002, Babenzien's clothing line favored nautical inspiration, upscale fabrics, and elevated menswear staples that predated the #menswear blogosphere and Frank Muytjens' tenure at J. Crew. The pricey line was sold at stores like Nom de Guerre, a sub rosa SoHo menswear shop that was equally ahead of its time.
It shuttered after a few seasons and Babenzien returned to Supreme, leaving last year to resurrect Noah as a vertical label with its own store and independent distribution methods—eschewing a more traditional wholesale business in favor of linking up with his friends, like Chris Gibbs at UNION Los Angeles, to stock his label. Other than that, it's pretty much exclusively available at the Noah store or website.
But that information is a footnote the NYT article. Instead, it focuses on his previous time as Supreme's creative director, implying a sense of competition between the two brands. It's a story that feels tone deaf. To say that Noah is competing against Supreme is missing the point—once you have a clear understanding of the brand's DNA it becomes apparent that its ethos is built upon opting out of the race entirely. Babenzien knows a thing or two about building a strong brand, and he and his brother Ryan talked about it at length on one of our recent podcasts.
To the uninitiated, Supreme and Noah may seem similar at the product level—both carry plenty of hats, t-shirts, and hoodies with graphics on them. But often, when mainstream publications and writers unfamiliar with street culture attempt to cover buzzy brands, they get it wrong because they don't operate on the same wavelength. It takes a certain cultural literacy to understand the intricate relationship between streetwear, lifestyle, and the influences behind a Cav Empt, a Noah, and a Supreme. To break it down between age demographics is inaccurate.
Describing Noah as merely a grown-up version of Supreme discredits the adults who have worn it for years, like Jason Dill, Mark Gonzalez, and Glenn O'Brien. It also glosses over the fact that Supreme makes plenty of wares that are far from teenage staples, like its recent knit polo shirts, suits with Adam Kimmel and Brooks Brothers, oxford shirts with Thom Browne, and even a Rolex watch so limited it never hit any of the label's stores. Babenzien was less than pleased with the Times‘ take, and sent them the following e-mail expressing the amount of umbrage he took with the final article:
To Whom it May Concern,
I'm sorry to have to be writing this email, however I am extremely disappointed in the article written about Noah. Aside from the fact that it is written in a style that makes it seem as if I have some issue with Supreme, there are many inaccuracies in the actual reporting. The photos are old. The product listed was old. The writer told us this piece was not going to run, and then surprise – here it is – with no notice. Every interview opportunity we have gone after up until this point has said, “unless we can talk about current product, we don't want to do it,” and every single item and picture in this article is way way outdated.
Just to further emphasize, all of the products circled in this photograph have not been in stock for months. We even switched out the rug pictured 2 months ago. The products being linked to either don't exist in our shop anymore or have been sold out for a very long time and so the author has linked to the “archive” section of our site instead. There are countless other articles in existence highlighting these pieces when they were relevant in October when we opened – it's now May.
Is this typical of the NY Times to run a piece without really checking the facts? Is it typical to write an article pitting friends against each other. I have already received emails from old friends at Supreme. I don't quite understand this but it is extremely disappointing. I'd like the article taken off your website and I prefer it did not run in the paper.
It saddens me to say this as the Times has always been something I've looked to for accuracy and truth. Again, we received no opportunity to fact-check and no notification of this going to print… We have literally been pitted against the company we admire the most and could face legal ramifications based on the verbiage. Please get back to us about this. We really feel like our reputation is being put on the line.
Best,
Brendon
According to Babenzien, his e-mail was met with “deaf ears.” So yesterday, he responded to the Times via Instagram, where he laid out all his problems with the article and completely disavowed it. The situation between Noah and The New York Times is indicative of why so many brands who operate in the currency of coolness are notoriously press-shy, and in the rare instance that they do decide to give an interview, more often than not they vet the reporter or writer.
Such is the case with Supreme and James Jebbia, who has worked with writer Alex Hawgood on stories for the Business of Fashion, and 032c. It isn't about nepotism as much as making sure the story is in good hands. It's a given that from first draft to publication, a few of the details will be lost in the process, but the importance of having a person who “gets it” cover a market where mystique, nonchalance, and reputation can affect a small, independent business's bottom line is often underestimated.
There's a precarious line publications like The New York Times tread when writing about the unique culture brands like Noah exist in. It's admittedly challenging to put it in the right context while having a mass appeal, mainly because the authenticity of streetwear usually depends on a never-ending struggle against normalcy. Articles about the enduring influence of skateboard style in The Wall Street Journal read like they were written by your dad after watching a few episodes of Epicly Later'd. Respected fashion journalists like Suzy Menkes can come off as condescending to designers like Matthew Williams, a multi-hyphenate creative and former creative director to Kanye West and Lady Gaga.
Last year, Menkes interviewed Williams for British Vogue and describes her initial expectation as “some cool dude whom I hoped would take his mirrored shades off long enough for me to see his face.” She's surprised to meet “a polite man, looking as open and easy as his Californian origins, with hair skimming the shoulders of a fresh white T-shirt. If he had any particular characteristic, it seemed like modesty.”
Like minority culture is often misconstrued when covered by someone who can't actually relate, there's a similar cognitive dissonance when a tourist writes about streetwear versus a native. No one can tell the narrative as accurately as someone with firsthand experience.
As outsiders become more curious about street culture, we are in the midst of an interesting time in which we examine how publications are covering it. Former niche media entities like Hypebeast and Complex have now gone public or been acquired by larger companies like Hearst. Seeing articles about Supreme is as common on GQ as it is on Highsnobiety. Mainstream and enthusiast media culture is meeting in the middle, and both need to take a closer look at what they can learn from each other.

I'm writing this in Montana, location of the Little Bighorn battlefield (which is why I'm here, no offense to the city of Billings, which is very nice). The Little Bighorn, of course, is the place where an experienced guide said to General Custer, “that's the biggest Indian village I've ever seen,” to which Custer replied, “great, let's split up and go in three different directions.”
But that was a simpler time, back when saying dumb things could actually have real consequences. This no longer appears to be true.
The other day in Washington, D.C., for example—and this is far from the worst recent example, but still—Sen. Mitch McConnell blamed President Obama for legislation that would let families of the 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia. Everybody wants justice for the 9/11 families, but many have argued that the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act is a really bad idea for policy reasons. That's what the president has been arguing, in fact, and that's why he vetoed the bill. But it became law last week anyway after Congress overrode his veto. So—
Wait a sec.
What?
You said McConnell blamed Obama for the law.
He did.
But Obama vetoed it.
Yes.
Which means he didn't want it to pass, right?
Yep, that's what it means.
So why would McConnell blame the president if they agree?
They don't.
Well, they both voted against it.
No, McConnell voted to pass the bill.
Oh. But not to override, obviously.
No, he also voted to override and therefore pass the bill despite the president's objection. In fact, the specific question was “Shall the Bill S. 2040 Pass, the Objections of the President of the United States to the Contrary Notwithstanding?” He was one of 97 senators to vote yes.
And then he blamed …
The president.
I'm confused.
Well, shut up then and let me finish, Mr. Bold Print.
Fine.
Fine.
What the bill did was create an exception to the doctrine of state sovereign immunity, which (generally speaking) means you can't sue a foreign state in a U.S. court unless it did something to you here in the U.S. If you're on safari and Vladimir Putin shoots off your hairpiece, for example, you might be able to sue Russia for that in Zimbabwe (or wherever it happened) or maybe in Russia (ha, is joke) but you can't force it to defend in a U.S. court. We give other countries immunity not because we love them but because we don't want their citizens suing the U.S. in their courts for whatever the U.S. might do around the globe. It's called reciprocity, and the concern is that if we start making exceptions then other countries will too. (This excellent explainer at Vox has more details.)
Supporters of JASTA say, though, that people should be able to sue state sponsors of terrorism, and everybody knows the alleged sponsor in question here is Saudi Arabia. But there's already an exception for suits alleging injuries caused by terrorism, as long as the foreign state has been officially designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, and—oops! Saudi Arabia is not on that list for reasons known as “oil.” So JASTA adds another exception, this one for injuries caused in the U.S. by terrorism and an act of a state or its officials anywhere in the world. It then goes even further by authorizing “aiding and abetting” liability (a notoriously vague concept) for anybody who helps or conspires with the terrorist. And of course terrorism = bad, but the problem is that other countries can define “terrorism” however they want, and the broader we make the exception the more likely they are to reciprocate.
But you don't have to take my word for it on this one. Just read this letter that 28 senators sent to the bill's bipartisan sponsors after the override, pleading with them to do something about the risk that the new law would have the “potential unintended consequences” of subjecting the U.S. to private lawsuits in foreign courts, and asking them to help fix it. They—
Excuse me.
… Yes?
You said the Senate voted 97-1 to override.
Yes.
So these 28 senators—
—had all just voted in favor of the bill they were now complaining about, yes.
McConnell didn't sign the letter, as far as I can tell, but he did blame the president for this terrible bill he had just voted to pass. “I hate to blame everything on him, and I don't,” McConnell said, although neither of those things are true. “But,” he continued, “it would have been helpful had we had a discussion about this much earlier than last week,” he continued, meaning that the White House should have alerted Congress to the potential problem. (It did, repeatedly.) This meant that “[n]obody [in Congress] really had focused on the potential downside in terms of our international relationships,” McConnell said, accusing Obama of “dropping the ball.”
The short version, of course, is that everybody knew this was a bad idea but nobody wanted to vote “against” 9/11 families in an election year. So everybody voted for it and then immediately started looking for a way to undo what they had just done. A truly noble effort all around.

People may differ from each other in their interpretation of love. For Cao Yuehua and Wang Deyi, love means a happily married life that has lasted for 70 years.
On November 25, Cao Yuehua, 97, and his wife Wang Deyi, 98, went back to the Beiwenquan scenic area where they had their first wedding photo photographed in 1945 and took another wedding photo, celebrating their platinum wedding anniversary.
"My darling, please give me a definite answer, which will reflect my once-pale youthful-ness……," Cao Yuehua read the love letter he sent to his wife 70 years ago in front of the Shufan building in the Beiwenquan scenic area.
Cao Yuehua recalled that he wrote the letter in the trenches the night he arrived in Myitkyina after taking a military aircraft. Cao, a translator, was ordered to go to the battlefield in Myanmar in late July 1944.
Cao returned China in triumph in late August 1945 and their engagement announcement was published on the Yunnan Daily on October 20, 1945. More than 10 days later, they went to Chongqing and held a grand wedding ceremony in Shufan building in Beiquan scenic area.
Wang was struck by a cerebral infarction last year and from then on she cannot think clearly like before and even makes mistakes when she is asked how old she is. But she can still remember the details of their 70 years of love.
Cao Pangpei, the youngest son of this old couple, said that his father, a student of Fudan University has a good command of English, Russian and French and his mother had studied in five universities in a succession.
With votes from more than 10,000 readers, Cao Yuehua and Wang Deyi crowned the World's Love Hero List 2013, an activity organized by the Chinese media.

May Employment Data Show U.S. Surpassed Pre-Recession Job Totals
The Labor Department released its monthly employment report on Friday. The economy added 217,000 jobs in May, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.3 percent.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Dave Greene.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. The government's monthly jobs report released earlier today shows the U.S. economy hit a milestone in May. The report shows that after years of painfully slow job growth, the United States has finally surpassed the number of jobs it had before the great recession. NPR's John Ydstie has the good news and bad news.
JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The good news is that the economy added 217,000 jobs last month. That puts the total number of jobs well above the 138.4 million record set back in December of 2007, just before the economy tumbled into recession. Labor economist Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution says the bad news is that it's taken almost six and a half years just to get back all the jobs we lost in the recession. That's the longest jobs recovery since before World War II.
GARY BURTLESS: It's happy that we're hitting this threshold, but it's sad it's taken us this long.
YDSTIE: Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute agrees that hitting this employment milestone isn't necessarily a proud moment.
HEIDI SHIERHOLZ: We should have added around 7 million jobs over the last six and a half years, just to hold steady. So just getting back to where we were before the recession began nearly six and half years ago, leaves us in a really big hole.
YDSTIE: Burtless says job growth has been steady in the past few years, but too slow to provide employment for all the new working age Americans added during the past six and a half years and the millions laid off during the recession. And he says the relatively rapid decline in the unemployment rate from 10 percent to 6.3 percent is somewhat misleading.
BURTLESS: The unemployment rate is covering up for the fact that lots of people are so discouraged that they are not actively seeking work. They're not counted as unemployed.
YDSTIE: After a big drop in April, many economists had expected the unemployment rate might tick up a notch in May. But it remained at 6.3 percent. Despite the steady decline in the unemployment rate over the last years, May's numbers show that nearly 10 million American remain unemployed. It also showed no change in the number of long-term unemployed, people who've been out of work more than 26 weeks. And partly because many workers are too discouraged to look for employment, the percentage of Americans in the job market remains at a 35-year low. So what's the reason for this slow growth that's held back the job market? Here's one big reason, says Heidi Shierholz, weak consumer demand.
SHIERHOLZ: Employers are smart. They're going to hire people exactly when they need them to meet some increased demand for their goods and services. That's the missing piece. Demand is the missing thing out there.
YDSTIE: The solid May jobs numbers do brighten the picture a bit. They show average job growth over the past three months above 230,000. That suggests the economy continues its steady recovery. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

Two members of a Muslim motorcycle club alleged to have been plotting terror attacks in Belgium on New Year's Eve will appear before a magistrate on Thursday (31 December). The magistrate will decide whether the men should be held in police custody for another month.
An official close to the investigation told CNN on condition of anonymity that the two men are members of the Kamikaze Riders Muslim motorcycle gang, and allegedly discussed attacking Brussels' Grand Place Square, as well as police and military targets.
Grand Place Square is where crowds gather to celebrate the new year in the city. The official said the men were inspired, though not directed, by Islamic State (Isis).
The two Kamikaze bikers were arrested following police raids on properties in Brussels and in other parts of the country on Sunday and Monday (27- 28 December). They are not believed to have links to the Paris attackers, said the official.
Authorities have now cancelled the traditional New Year's Eve fireworks display in Brussels amid fears the event may be the target of a terrorist attack. The country remains on a state of high alert in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.
Several of those involved in the Paris attacks were from Brussels, and one of the alleged perpetrators, Salah Abdeslam, remains on the run. In November the city was in lockdown, with schools, restaurants and the city's metro closed amid fears a terror attack was imminent.
Today's a notable day for Capital Region book nerds because it's the opening of the Saratoga Springs location of the Northshire Bookstore. The 9,000-square-foot store on Broadway in the heart of downtown is just the second location for the much-admired Manchester, Vermont independent.
The last decade or so has been tough on book publishers and bookstores. The big national chain stores have either fallen (Borders) or are teetering (Barnes & Noble). The rise of e-readers has cut into sales of hard-copy books. And Amazon and Apple have been engaged in various attempts to control the pricing of books.
Given all that, we were curious why -- and how -- someone would open a new bookstore. So we stopped by the Saratoga Northshire location on Friday to get a peek at the new store, and talk with co-owner Chris Morrow about why they picked Saratoga Springs, how they made it happen, e-readers, and the future of the bookstore.
There are a handful of large-format photos above -- scroll all the way up. The photos are from this past Friday as the store was still being set up.
Northshire co-owner Chris Morrow. His parents started the Northshire Bookstore in Manchester, Vermont in 1976.
You're well established in Vermont, in Manchester, 30some years now. Why open in Saratoga?
Saratoga has a real need for a good bookstore. When they lost their Borders bookstore two or three years ago, I kept getting emails and letters from people asking me to look at opening a store here. And I ignored the first few. And then after a while, there was a pattern. So I thought I'd come over and just look around, because I hadn't been here in a long, long time. And I was immediately impressed with the city and the people. And thought there might be an opportunity here.
So I started researching and writing a business plan and talking with lots of people. And became convinced that Saratoga Springs could support a good, large, high-quality independent bookstore.
What was it about Saratoga that convinced you?
A combination of the demographics, the traffic here, the growth here, and the interests of people. It's clearly an erudite and artistic community. There are a lot of arts organizations. There are a lot of diverse customer bases -- we have the locals, we have tourists, we have the track, we have GlobalFoundries which is bringing people to town, and then the City Center which brings people in regularly. So for a bookstore to survive in this day and age, you need a diverse customer base. And Saratoga really has that.
I hope. (laughs)
You mentioned that people in the community have reached out to you. And a lot of people have really rallied to get the store to come here. How important was that in your decision?
That was absolutely essential. In fact, half the money to get this place open came from community members because I didn't have the money to open this store. So I kind of modeled my fundraising after some businesses in Vermont. So I have over 30 local investors in the store.
So that was another test of whether this was going to work or not, was whether I could raise the money locally. If I couldn't raise the money, it wouldn't happen. And that was just another indication that there was interest and enthusiasm for this venture at this point in time.
[Morrow says the cost of opening the Saratoga location -- including the inventory -- is over $1 million.]
The publishing industry has been changing and struggling for going on a decade now. How would you describe the state of the bookstore business now?
It's been extremely dynamic. In the last year or two it's started to stabilize a little bit in the sense that there's some growth in independent bookstores around the country. The growth curve of electronic books has slowed very dramatically, and plateaued in some categories and some publishers. So that was really the the big moving question for a lot of physical stores, just how much of the business was going to go all digital and how much was going to stay in print. You still have around 70 percent of the business nationwide as print books.
And that's a number that we can live with, as long as people value the value-added elements of what we do in terms of creating this space, having high-quality book sellers and buyers, and all the community aspects of what we do.
Would you say that bookstores and e-books are not compatible in the long run?
No, I think they're compatible. We sell e-readers and e-books. It's not an either-or. A lot of people who read e-books in certain circumstances -- like especially when they travel -- and print books the rest of the time. So it's definitely not an either-or.
It's kind of like people still go to the movie theater, and sometimes they watch movies at home, and sometimes they just watch movies on TV. They're not in any way mutually exclusive.
The second floor includes space for author events.
What do you think a bookstore has to do in this situation where there are e-readers, and there's Amazon, and all this competition?
Obviously, to start with, you have to offer a compelling experience. That has to do with the ambiance. The experience of being in the space, the selection. We have very good buyers who have been with us for decades who are combing through literally hundreds of thousands of titles a year to pick what comes on the shelves. And then we hire and train very good booksellers. And those three elements in combination are essential.
Then there's the whole community aspect of what we do, in terms of bringing author events to town, partnering with other organizations to either sell books or put on other kinds of events, literacy initiatives that we have. There's a lot to being a community bookstore that we want to develop here, that we've developed in Manchester... There's so much that a bookstore can do give support from the community.
I was telling the staff a lot of what we do here is we're in service to our customers, to each other, to the book as a physical thing, and to the larger culture of this country.
Five years, ten years from now, what role do you hope this store is playing in this community?
Well, I really hope we're kind of one of the main linchpins of downtown, and it's a place the community comes to get their entertainment and information and to be with other people.
This is kind of a promotion of culture in a way. I was telling the staff a lot of what we do here is we're in service to our customers, to each other, to the book as a physical thing, and to the larger culture of this country. Not in a snobbish way, but we take that as part of our mission to promote an environment of dialog and information flow and entertainment.

AUBURN CA - A 20-year-old Auburn man is dead after being stabbed Wednesday in what the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office is calling a possible homicide.
The Sheriff's Office identified the victim Thursday as Auburn resident Matthew Martin Steele.
Steele was reportedly stabbed and went into cardiac arrest after what was described in a 911 call at 4:10 p.m. as an altercation in the area of Brown's Road and Cold Springs Road, just north of Placerville, Sheriff's Sgt. Jim Byers said.
At the same time, the reporting party said the possible suspect had fled on foot from the scene, Byers said.
When deputies arrived, witnesses and local residents were administering CPR to Steele, Byers said. Paramedics transported Steele to Marshall Hospital in Placerville, where he was pronounced dead at 6:24 p.m., he said.
The suspect – 18-year-old Wesley Ronald Hampshire of Placerville – was located at his residence on Brown's Road and taken into custody without incident, the Sheriff's Office reported. Hampshire was booked into El Dorado County Jail on a charge of murder. Arraignment in court could come Friday or Monday.
Byers said late Thursday that the circumstances surrounding the altercation were continuing to be investigated. There had been no word from detectives on what precipitated the incident, he said.
The Sheriff's Office was not identifying the type of implement used in the stabbing.
Steele was driven after the stabbing to a parking lot on Cold Springs Road, adjacent to the pull-in to the private Brown's Road subdivision. The lot was empty Thursday. The Cold Springs Store Market and Deli was no longer in business and a cleanup crew was inside repairing water damage from pipes that had burst in the cold in the empty building.
Outside, a patch of blood and discarded medical supplies used in an attempt to revive Steele were stark evidence of the tragic afternoon altercation.
The site of the stabbing is about a 23-mile drive southeast of Auburn and four miles past Coloma. The area is outside Placerville city limits but in the same postal address area.
The community of Cold Springs is a mix of agricultural and residential lots. Lyle McAtee has lived in Cold Springs for 46 years and said Thursday that the homicide the day before was the first he'd heard of there in nearly 50 years.
“Every nine or 10 years, there might be a fight,” McAtee said. “But that's a random thing.”
McAtee said he couldn't recall meeting either of the two people involved in the altercation that led to the death of Steele. Cold Springs is a quiet community, where people generally keep to themselves, he said.
Steele's death was met with shock and sadness by people who knew him in the Auburn area.
Curtis Sproul of Newcastle said that Steele went to school with his twin boys, Gordon and Kyle, and he was a frequent guest at their home.
“Matt was not an angel or a ‘perfect kid' but he was a wonderful human being,” Sproul said. “He was funny, upbeat and a talented guitar player.”
Dani Elle Neft went to Placer High School and had classes together with Steele.
“I'd never met someone more animated or thirsty to experience life,” Neft said. “He always managed to put a smile on everyone's face – even mine when I thought no one could. He was truly an exceptional human being and he will be missed by every person who ever was lucky to meet him.”

A frightening story this week in The New Yorker tells of a Texas couple that headed toward the Texas-Louisiana border to buy a used car. They were carrying all their savings in cash. They were stopped by the police. The police found cash and a tiny pipe, and arrested them both.
Then the police made a deal. They could go to jail and have their kids put in foster care or fork over all the cash they were carrying with them. Yes, it's legal and ever more common under civil asset forfeiture law. In fact, this law has become a huge revenue source for government (the Justice Department collected $4.2 billion in 2012 through such seizures).
Now consider a different scenario. The couple was stopped and had no cash at all. Instead, they were carrying a different kind of currency that lives inside a smartphone. When they made it to their destination, they cashed out this currency and bought their used car.
It does raise the question: Is Bitcoin a possible defense against civil asset forfeiture?
Consider the case of Argentina, which right now has extreme capital controls, price controls, and serious inflation. It also happens to be the country with the highest rate of Bitcoin adoption of any country on the planet. Everything including rents and land prices is being quoted in Bitcoin. It is being bought in order to be held, and only later used for more purchases.
In other words, it is being used as money. This is new territory for regulators. Most all dollar transactions today are digital — just ledger entries, not physical. But people think of the dollar as physical because of its history and roots in real stuff.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, began as a protocol written in computer code. In some ways, it is no more or less a piece of math than the dollar is. But it is much harder to wrap your brain around whether and why it could function as money.
This poses a real problem for government regulators. The Bitcoin economy is growing and expanding by the day, with ever more of a commercial infrastructure. Government can ignore it and pretend it is not emerging money. This path is one of denial. It states, without evidence, that only the government can make money, and all other attempts are invalid. This strategy is rather dangerous, because the growth of “crypto currency” appears all but unstoppable.
The other path is to admit it is money and is being used as money. At least this way the regulators and government can preserve their role as sovereign overseer. But this path too is dangerous, because admitting the monetary properties of Bitcoin offers a path of legal legitimacy that can end only in helping promote further adoption and use.
This was the problem that confronted the federal judge in the case of the well-known scam “Bitcoin Savings and Loan.” From 2011-12, Trendon Shavers took in hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin, promising a 7% return, but just ended up spending it. (It's hard to believe that anyone really got taken in by this guy, whose pseudonym was “pirateat40.”
In any case, in his own defense, Shavers argued that Bitcoin was not really money. He was receiving code and nothing more, so he can't really be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or be subjected to taxes and other requirements. The federal judge disagreed, and in doing so, provided Bitcoin the most decisive statement yet on its moneyness.
The judge wrote:
“Bitcoin was designed to reduce transaction costs, and allows users to work together to validate transactions by creating a public record of the chain of custody of each Bitcoin. Bitcoin can be used to purchase items online, and some retail establishments have begun accepting Bitcoin in exchange for gift cards or other purchases. The value of Bitcoin is volatile and ranges from less than $2 per Bitcoin to more than $260 per Bitcoin…. “It is clear that Bitcoin can be used as money. It can be used to purchase goods or services, and as Shavers stated, used to pay for individual living expenses. The only limitation of Bitcoin is that it is limited to those places that accept it as currency. However, it can also be exchanged for conventional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, and yuan. Therefore, Bitcoin is a currency or form of money, and investors wishing to invest in BTCST provided an investment of money.”
So there you have it, a federal judge clearly stating what is a rather obvious reality, but not one anyone could have foreseen in years past. Because it has ideal properties we associate with money, it has taken on value as money through gradual adoption from 2009 to the present.
In one amusing part of his statement, the judge writes: “Bitcoin is an electronic form of currency unbacked by any real asset and without specie, such as coin or precious metal.”
I wonder if he knows that this statement could be applied word for word to the dollar itself.
Every time I speak to people about this issue of crypto currency, people say that government is certainly going to destroy it through high regulations, taxations, and the like. But let's make some distinctions here. Certainly government can regulate exchange between government currencies and Bitcoin. It already does that, and that regulation can only intensify. It can also regulate income in Bitcoin the same as with other currency. This is not some tax-free nirvana in the making. The government can also oversee contractual regulations and securities activities in Bitcoin.
However, Bitcoin itself is a peer-to-peer system of cryptographically guarded exchange, and it lives on a distributed server model. It is not a company. It is not a stock. It is not a product. It is a ledger that no one in particular runs or owns. In this sense, it is not possible for Bitcoin as such to be destroyed any more than government can destroy algebra. This is why there is such interest in its future and why conferences are being organized to discuss the legal, economic, and commercial implications.
It is also for this reason that many people in the Bitcoin world are more welcoming of government regulation that you might expect. These people are very confident that statements such as that of the federal judge above, as well as intensifying regulations over exchanges and the like, are actually bullish signs that help legitimize this money and payment system. Fundamentally, at its very root, the currency unit itself is invulnerable. So the hope for government involvement is really expression of confidence in the underlying code.
Meanwhile, the academic monetary economists can continue to debate this thing called Bitcoin. The market has already decided, and the black-robed judges can only defer to the new reality that crypto currency is a growing part of economic life in the digital age.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey Tucker
A federal appeals court will rehear a landmark case that prevented the federal government's top online privacy regulator from taking action against online giants like Verizon or Google.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for the Northern District of California said this week it's bringing the case back before the court's full panel of judges to decide if the Federal Trade Commission has the authority to regulate “common carriers,” a public utility designation the Federal Communications Commission reclassified broadband providers under with its net neutrality rules in 2015.
“Upon the vote of a majority of nonrecused active judges, it is ordered that this case be reheard en banc,” Chief Circuit Judge Sidney R. Thomas wrote Tuesday. “The three-judge panel disposition in this case shall not be cited as precedent by or to any court of the Ninth Circuit.”
Last August, the FTC lost a lawsuit it brought against AT&T for deceptive practices related to the carrier's unlimited data plans. AT&T argued the FTC couldn't take action against it because of its common carrier status.
The FTC can't oversee common carriers according to federal law — a statute acting FTC Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen, many predecessors, and others have advocated repealing.
“It was put in place at a time when common carriers were pervasively regulated monopolies,” Ohlhausen said in January. “Obviously our telecommunications space is vastly different than it was when these rules were put in place.”
Before net neutrality, the FTC had jurisdiction over the internet ecosystem of internet providers like AT&T and content creators like Netflix. It used that authority to enforce transparency rules, like ensuring customers are notified when their data downloads reach a threshold at which they'll automatically be slowed by the provider — the crux of the FTC's case against AT&T.
“We have reviewed the court's order, and we look forward to participating in the en banc review,” AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris said Tuesday.
The FTC used the same authority to enforce privacy standards for how service providers and content creators can collect and use consumer data until the AT&T case. The FCC passed its own privacy rules last fall, but Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration repealed those rules in April as they imposed higher standards on internet providers than edge providers like Facebook.
Even if the FCC were to continue policing the privacy of broadband providers with the same restrictions it places on telephone companies, there are still instances where user data would fall into an enforcement gap. A court ruling from an earlier case brought by the pro-net neutrality group Public Knowledge found “the FCC's authority ends with the act of communication — physical transmission.”
“So companies like Yahoo! and AOL, all based in the Ninth Circuit, may fall into a no man's land of consumer protection, policed by neither agency,” Berin Szoka, president of TechFreedom, a center-right D.C-based policy think tank, said last August.
It also means the web giants like Google with a side business as a broadband provider (Google Fiber) could fall within “a privacy vacuum” between both agencies. It's not hard to imagine the implications on web privacy if more telecommunications providers like Verizon buy more popular edge providers (and targeted ad giants) like AOL and Yahoo.
“Say for example you have a common carrier who decided to sell dietary supplements,” Ohlhausen explained in a January interview. “The FCC isn't going to be there policing over dietary supplements, but this could divest the FTC of oversight over them as well.”
In April, Trump's pick to head the FCC, Ajit Pai, put forth his own plan the agency will hold a preliminary vote on May 18 to put the lines back where they were before net neutrality. Pai's plan would scale back the rules and reverse the common carrier reclassification.
While he's expressed confidence the plan will pass the FCC finish line later this year, Pai described the court's decision as a win for privacy enforcement.
“Today's action by the Ninth Circuit is a big win for American consumers. Now that the court's prior decision is no longer effective, it will be easier for the FTC to protect consumers' online privacy,” he said Tuesday.
He added the case is further justification for his own plan to reverse reclassification of broadband as a Title II common carrier service under the Communications Act, the same authority used to break up telephone monopolies in the 1930s, which allows the FCC to impose tougher regulations including price setting.
Pai is seeking to reclassify internet service as a Title I information service regulated by the FTC, as it had been from the Clinton to the Obama administrations.
“Indeed, it moves us one step closer to having the consistent and comprehensive framework for digital privacy that the American people deserve,” Pai said.

This is one of the prices that cities often pay for falling into bankruptcy: the police force is cut, crime skyrockets and residents are left trying to ensure their own safety.
A little over a year ago, this city's falling crime rate was a success story. An aggressive gang intervention effort helped cut the homicide rate by nearly half since the 2005 peak, and in 2011 the program was held up by the National League of Cities as a model for other cities to follow.
But nearly all that progress was erased last year as San Bernardino collapsed under the weight of the same forces that have hit cities all over California and threaten to plunge still more of them into insolvency: high foreclosure rates that eroded the city's tax revenue, stubborn unemployment, and pension obligations that the city could no longer afford.
Stockton, Calif., which filed for bankruptcy in June, has followed a similarly grim path into insolvency, logging more homicides last year than ever before. In Vallejo, Calif., which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, cuts left the police force a third smaller, and the city became a hub for prostitution.
In San Bernardino, dozens of officers have been laid off since the bankruptcy filing, leaving the police force with 264 officers, down from 350 in 2009. Those who remain call in sick more often, said the police chief, Robert Handy. Emergency response times are up. Nonemergency calls often get no response.

Police Officer Suffers Major Head Injury In Skateboard Attack, Listed In Critical Condition
Video: South San Francisco Police Officer Attacked With Skateboard
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO (BCN)
A South San Francisco Police officer suffered a major head injury when knocked unconscious by a suspect with a skateboard this afternoon and is listed in critical condition.
The officer was waved down around 2:20 p.m. in the 300 block of Grand Avenue by a witness who reported someone causing a disturbance.

The officer approached the suspect, who was not cooperative, and called for backup. As another officer arrived, the suspect fled on a skateboard and a short chase ensued.
The suspect, later identified as 28-year-old Luis Alberto Ramos-Coreas of South San Francisco, turned and hit the officer in the head with the skateboard, which rendered the officer unconscious.
The backup officer took Ramos-Coreas into custody without further incident.
The injured officer was transported to a trauma center to undergo surgery, according to police. The incident remains under investigation.
Here is a challenge to News Limited CEO John Hartigan. Publish the News Limited Code of Professional Conduct.
I have no doubt Margaret Simons has a mate somewhere in News who claims never to have seen our Code of Conduct, therefore allowing her to assert that most of our people have never seen it, never been encouraged to read it and don't abide by it. Etc etc.
The code has been published and updated twice in the past 5 years as far as I know and hard copies distributed to all newsrooms. It is also available on the intranets of each of our major divisions. It is included in induction packs when we employ staff, including journalists of 15 minutes or 50 years' experience.
Hartigan made two points about the code in his note to staff. One, his personal belief is that the code should guide everything we do. If it doesn't, it should. And, implicit in that is a warning to any journalist who has left the code unread in the bottom of a drawer. Take it out, read it and abide by it.
As for Margaret's reference to Jay Rosen's tweet, would any decent media outlet allow a reference like this to be included in a story in this way, gratuitous, unchecked, without elaboration, explanation or qualification? Clearly Crikey works to different standards. If Crikey has a code of conduct please send it to us.
Regards,
Greg Baxter| Director, Corporate Affairs
Here is a challenge to News Limited CEO John Hartigan. Publish the News Limited Code of Professional Conduct. Not only internally, where it can be found buried on the staff intranet, but publicly, clearly linked from all News Limited's mastheads and available in hard copy to anyone who asks. And if you don't publish it, Crikey will. This challenge arises from a dust up I have been having with the News Limited spin doctor, Greg Baxter. ( Not the first .) Last Friday, Hartigan issued a public statement about the News of the World scandal, in which he said that unethical and immoral practices are not tolerated in the Australian News Corporation mastheads. He referred to the News Limited Code of Professional Conduct, which, he said, was "the guiding principle to everything we do". I wrote in response that much News Limited journalists in Australia did not even know there was such a code, and that to suggest it lay at the heart of how they understood their jobs was "pure fiction". Well, following that story being published, Baxter emailed Crikey as follows:I posted that on my blog, together with a response . I also did a call out to News Limited journalists past and present, asking them to email, comment or Tweet their experiences (if any) with the code. See my blog here and here for the results. Still collecting them. Emails received in confidence at [email protected] To sum up, 10 responses so far in a mix of comments threads, Twitter DMs and emails, covering reporters who have worked or are still working at community newspapers, metropolitan daily tabloids and The Australian. Of these, only one (from The Courier-Mail) said they had been given a copy of the code and had read it. Meanwhile on Twitter, outsiders commented that most corporations require new employees to sign off on major corporate policies as part of the induction process. Nothing like that at News Limited, so far as the editorial Code of Professional Conduct goes in any case. But the pointier issue is that the punters -- the audience with whom News Limited supposedly cultivates a relationship of trust -- cannot get a copy of the code. It is not published, other than internally. A Google turns up, not the code itself but, in the top six results, my reporting on its invisibility. This cannot be good for News Limited. So please, Mr Hartigan. Publish it, and send us the link. Make it easy for your readers to find. We will help you promote it. And if you can't or won't do it, we are happy to help. Meanwhile, the News of the World crisis rolls on, with up to nine journalists facing arrest, the announcement of public inquiries, and Rupert Murdoch's closest adviser Les Hinton likely to face questioning over what he knew and when he knew it. Meanwhile, furious News of the World journalists who have lost their jobs apparently used the crossword in the last edition to take out their fury against the bosses. Rupert Murdoch himself has flown to London, and everyone agrees that this is only the beginning. The focus is likely to shift away from News International over the next week, as other news companies and mastheads are caught in the web. This affair is likely to be a tipping point in the history of media and politics, at least in the United Kingdom but probably more widely. Locally, The Australian's Media section gave the scandal considerable straight-shooting coverage and commentary today, which is a relief given the partisan flavour that section has taken on other issues affecting the corporate parent in recent times. True, the coverage did not address the question of local relevance, nor were there any calls for the sacking of favoured Murdoch lieutenant Rebekah Brooks. There were also suggestions, in Mark Day's column and elsewhere, of a "poor us" regret that critics of News International were taking the opportunity to beat up on them. Over the past few days, a few commentators have been quick to state that ethical breaches such as paying police or phone hacking would not happen in Australia. I think that is probably right for the most part, but I would not be as confident as some appear to be. One of the reasons it would probably not happen here is precisely because of the Murdoch press's undoubted dominance, meaning that we don't have the red-hot competition for yarns that exists on Fleet Street. And I think it is true that for the most part, Australian journalists would pull up short of bribery and illegal behaviour. If one was looking for ethical misbehaviour in Australia one would look first, not to newspapers but to tabloid television current affairs. But are we really justified in saying that it could not happen? I think not. And I suspect several news editors and producers are a bit nervous. In the current climate, it would take only one instance of a police officer or other public official being paid for information, or a single instance of a phone or email account being hacked by or on behalf of a media organisation, and we would see public inquiries and fury being unleashed here, too. The Gillard government, and Communications Minister Stephen Conroy in particular are clearly in just the right mood to take on News Limited and other media. Are we really confident that nobody will give them a reason to do so?

The Titans couldn't make up their mind about Mike Munchak as the curtain came down on the 2013 season, but their once-happy marriage ended with an awkward split a week later.
In the search for his replacement, the Titans showed no such hesitancy.
In hiring former San Diego Chargers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt on Monday, the Titans displayed an aggressive approach that not only got the attention of beleaguered fans in Nashville, but NFL observers across the country as well.
DOMINO EFFECT: Lions turn attention to Caldwell
Whisenhunt becomes the 17th head coach in franchise history. He was considered the best candidate remaining as the Detroit Lions, Minnesota Vikings and Cleveland Browns were also in the market for new head coaches.
The Titans knew landing him wouldn't be easy, however. After interviewing Whisenhunt in San Diego on Friday, Titans general manager Ruston Webster and president/CEO Tommy Smith had to move swiftly.
The 51-year-old former Arizona Cardinals head coach had also interviewed with the Lions and Browns. The Titans knew the odds were against them considering the Lions – a team with an established quarterback and numerous offensive weapons -- had long been considered the favorite to land Whisenhunt.
Webster traveled to Houston to meet with Smith on Monday, when they also conducted a second interview with Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer. The Titans had also contemplated waiting to interview Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Dan Quinn, but because the Seahawks are still in the playoffs there could have been a significant wait to talk to him.
With the Lions ready to send their private plane to San Diego to pick up Whisenhunt -- who was free to take another job after the Chargers lost to the Denver Broncos in the playoffs on Sunday – the Titans made their move. They negotiated a contract with Whisenhunt's agent, Jimmy Sexton, and sealed the deal.
PHOTOS: NFL head coaching candidates
The hope is that Whisenhunt can improve the Titans almost as quickly. They finished 7-9 last season, are 36-44 over the past five seasons and haven't won a playoff game since the 2003 season. Munchak was 22-26 in his three seasons as head coach.
"The Titans did a really good job here," Sports Illustrated NFL writer Peter King said. "I am with so many other people who thought that Ken Whisenhunt was signed, sealed and delivered to the Detroit Lions. So for the Titans to step in like this and land him, it's big. …
"In the wake of the sort of messed-up firing and negotiations with Mike Munchak, you wondered 'does this team really know what it's doing?' Well, this team wanted Ken Whisenhunt and they went out and got him. … My hat is off to Ruston Webster."

Whisenhunt is scheduled to be introduced at a press conference at Saint Thomas Sports Park on Tuesday. Webster and Smith are also expected to be on hand following a nine-day coaching search that included interviews with Bengals offensive coordinator Jay Gruden and Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Jim Caldwell. The Washington Redskins hired Gruden last week.
Whisenhunt spent six seasons as head coach of the Cardinals, who fired him after the 2012 season.
"This is a big day for this franchise," Smith said in a statement. "Ken is a well-respected coach in this league and I am looking forward to seeing his vision become reality for this team. He has a history of building successful offenses and took Arizona to a Super Bowl as a head coach. We all share a common goal for this team and that is to build a consistent winner."
Webster told Smith how impressed he was with Whisenhunt and the vision they shared.
"I have a lot of respect for Ken as a coach and as an offensive mind," Webster said in a statement. "The traits that stand out to me when identifying him as our next coach – he is intelligent, has a track record with quality offenses and head coaching success. I really enjoyed our meeting on Friday night in San Diego and we share similar philosophies about the game.
"Additionally, we have several mutual colleagues that have spoken highly to me about Ken both as a coach and as a person. I am excited about Ken joining us and the future of the Titans."
Whisenhunt is charged with jumpstarting a team and a fan base that's been dragging of late. Interest in the Titans has dwindled the past two seasons, with swaths of empty seats becoming the norm at LP Field.
Under Munchak the Titans were 3-20 against teams that finished with winning records. They won just six of 18 games against AFC South opponents.
The Titans believe Whisenhunt's experience and offensive imagination will result in a turnaround.
He has 17 seasons of NFL coaching experience, including the six years (2007-12) as head coach of the Cardinals. He posted a 45-51 record in six seasons, taking them to Super Bowl XLIII after a 12-win season in 2008.
He led them to back-to-back NFC West titles in 2008 (9-7 record) and 2009 (10-6), but was fired after the Cardinals failed to make the playoffs from 2010-12.
He landed with the Chargers, whose offense jumped from 31st to 5th in the NFL.
Whisenhunt has a Nashville connection: he was a special team and tight ends coach at Vanderbilt in 1995-96.
"Players will love him. He's a great head coach," said former Tennessee State star Dominique Rodgers-Cromaritie, who played under Whisenhunt with the Cardinals from 2008-10. "He's a guy that played the game, and understands the game. Any time you have a coach who has played the game it tends to work out better for the players.
"He goes off cool and calm, but at the end of the day he lets us go about our business as men. That's the thing I like about him. He's not a coach that's going to yell at you a whole lot. He knows what to do to get the job done. If you ask me, he's a great leader. The Titans are lucky to get him."
One of Whisenhunt's biggest projects will be quarterbacked Jake Locker, who is headed into the final year of his contract. The 2011 first-round pick has missed 14 of 32 potential starts over the past two seasons because of injuries.
Whisenhunt has experience with younger quarterbacks, however. As offensive coordinator with the Pittsburgh Steelers, he helped with the development of Ben Roethlisberger during his first two NFL seasons. He's also worked with veteran quarterbacks Kurt Warner and Philip Rivers.
"I've heard a lot of good things about him as far as the offense. I know he had some good results in Pittsburgh and also with the Cardinals," Titans center Brian Schwenke said. "Just watching the Chargers offensively this year, they really did a good job. So it's an interesting time and I'm excited."

The Syria Question: It's stolen the headlines and public debate this summer as Congress and Parliament come to loggerheads. But how can you have an answer if you don't know what the Question is? Here's a simple explanation from one K N Al-Sabah in a letter to the FT:
Sir, Iran is backing Assad. Gulf states are against Assad!
Assad is against Muslim Brotherhood. Muslim Brotherhood and Obama are against General Sisi.
But Gulf states are pro Sisi! Which means they are against Muslim Brotherhood!
Iran is pro Hamas, but Hamas is backing Muslim Brotherhood!
Obama is backing Muslim Brotherhood, yet Hamas is against the US!
Gulf states are pro US. But Turkey is with Gulf states against Assad; yet Turkey is pro Muslim Brotherhood against General Sisi. And General Sisi is being backed by the Gulf states!
Welcome to the Middle East and have a nice day.
K N Al-Sabah, London EC4, UK
Comprende? If not, don't worry, the letter's recent trending on Twitter inspired some uncomplicated visual graphics, most notably @TheBigPharaoh's "The Complete Idiot's Chart to Understanding The Middle East", as picked up by the Washington Post. One glance at the chart and its blue, red and green arrows depicting who "supports", "hates" and "has no clue" of whom, and you will probably also have "no clue" about what is really going on in the fast changing region.
Perhaps this is overcomplicating things, especially for the American public, half of whom could not find Syria on a map, as surveyed by the Pew Research Centre "only 50 per cent of respondents correctly identified the shaded country as Syria. Almost one in five (19 per cent) thought it was Turkey, 11 per cent said it was Saudi Arabia, and 5 per cent said it was Egypt".
This inspired the New York Times columnist Nick Kristof to Tweet "Now members of Congress will have to consult maps and figure out where Syria is".
Perhaps this was meant as a joke, but then on Tuesday, General Jack Keane, a former vice chief of staff of the US Army told the BBC "many of our politicians are not educated on what is really going on in Syria". Just as well, then, the UK has renounced intervening alongside the US.
The public – who have no say in the Syria Question – might not need to know who "supports" or "has no clue", who is "pro" or "backing", or who "hates" or is "against" who, or even, for that matter, know where Syria is. But if the Syria Question is so complicated that it confuddles the politicians, then a longer debate and strategy is surely needed. Perhaps Commons or Congress should invite Mr K N Al-Sabah to read out his letter to them, complete with the updated allegiances of the UK and US. Welcome to the Middle East and have a nice day.
Poster boards, markers and paint are doing more than sending a message to the White House in 2017: they're fueling the local economy.
San Francisco's arts and crafts merchants told us they've seen a noticeable increase in sales of art supplies, as protesters stock up for marches and other events.
Last week, the New York Times reported that anti-Trump protesters across the country increased sales of poster board by 33 percent and foam board by 42 percent in the week leading up to the January 21st Women's March, compared to the same period in 2016. In January alone, more than 6.5 million poster boards were sold.
In a similar vein, a report by the consumer research group NPD found that a combined $6 million was spent on art supplies in the week leading up to January 21st.
Poster and foam board sales alone totaled $4.1 million, but supplies across the board saw an increase. Easel pads and flip chart sales grew by 28 percent, specialty markers sales jumped by 24 percent, glue sales increased by 27 percent, permanent markers went up by 12 percent and scissor sales rose by 6 percent.

Closer to home, neighborhood shops have reported both strong sales and shortages.
“We ran out of poster board,” an employee at the Castro's Cliff's Variety told us. “During a lot of the marches, we were selling 'For Sale' signs so that people could turn them backwards and write on the back."
The same was true at The Hobby Co. of San Francisco in the Richmond District, where an employee told us there was a surge in poster and foam board sales leading up Trump's inauguration.
“We weren't prepared,” she said. “We didn't know people would come and get them.”
The Financial District's Artist & Craftsman Supply prepared for the rush, an employee said, but still sold out of certain items.
“It was super unusual,” she said. ”We usually don't sell a lot of poster board, but we sold out.”
Many customers also came in to buy yarn to make DIY pussy hats, she added.

At SCRAP, an employee said that the store experienced two significant upticks in sales: when the election results were announced, and then in January, in the weeks leading up to the inauguration and the Women's March.
“These are the sorts of supplies we have on a regular basis,” he said. “But this was a much larger turnout, and the first time we had people buying supplies to take with them to Washington, D.C.”

Flax Art & Design, which relocated from Market Street to downtown Oakland last year, reported a similar situation.
“During that weekend, we sold out of things like large markers and paint pens and poster boards," said a store manager.
The manager said that Flax saw the demand coming, but couldn't keep up with inventory. “The amount of people that came into our store and the numbers of items we sold were pretty staggering,” he said.
He compared the inauguration demonstrations and Women's March sales to the upswings the store used to see in San Francisco leading up to Burning Man and Pride weekend. But he noted that 2017's political demonstrations were hard to gauge against other demonstrations in the past.
“It was exceptional,” he told us.
But the skyrocketing art supply sales seem to have cooled off—at least for now.
"Things are pretty much back to normal, and the store is stocked up," our source at Cliff's Variety told us. “There's not a march every weekend like there was before."

After publishing 20 non-fiction books with mainstream publishers, Sharazade (her pen name) decided to try her hand at erotica, and over the past year has published two sex- and fantasy-themed ebooks, both of which are available on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Smashwords (Warning: Linked pages may contain explicit content.) Her stories often
involve travel–a passion of hers–and are set in exotic locales. Recently she
began publishing other authors through 1001 Nights Press, a small house she founded, and last month she learned that Amazon was
letting indie publishers and self-published authors into its Kindle Select
program. Sharazade, who requested anonymity because she also works as a
freelance writer, editor, and teacher and doesn't want clients or students
to know about her erotica exploits, recognized several benefits to working with
Amazon. She could offer a title free for up to five days, and that's great
publicity since her book would inevitably shoot up in the rankings. If
any Kindle Select members borrowed her book–they are entitled to one
title per month–she would receive a proportional sliver of the $500,000
Amazon set aside in December to pay publishers and authors. Then, once her book wasn't free anymore, it would be tied to things like “Customers
who bought X also bought Y,” plus readers might post glowing reviews
and buy backlist books. She decided to test drive the service with
Erotic Stories of Domination and Submission: Taking Jennifer, a book by one
of her authors, then watched it climb the rankings in “gratifying
leaps.” But Sharazade was dismayed that a number of books, a few with
nonsensical titles, were beating hers, even though they were hamstrung by
twisted grammar and perverse punctuation. Some sported covers comprised of low-resolution images with no lettering. One author managed
to misspell her own name. “Even in
porn, customers come down on books that are totally incompetent,”
Sharazade says, “but this wasn't happening with these.” After checking the author page for Maria Cruz, who that day had the top-selling erotica book in Amazon's U.K. Kindle
store, she counted 40 erotica ebook titles, including Sister Pretty Little
Mouth, My Step Mom and Me, Wicked Desires Steamy Stories and Domenating
[sic] Her, plus one called Dracula's Amazing Adventure. Most erotica authors stay within the genre, so Sharazade was surprised Cruz had ventured into horror. Amazon lets customers click
inside a book for a sample of text and Sharazade was impressed with how literate it
was. She extracted a sentence fragment, googled it, and found that Cruz
had copy and pasted the text from Bram Stoker's Dracula. Curious,
Sharazade keyed in phrases from other Cruz ebooks and discovered that every book she checked was stolen. Here's Maria Cruz on Amazon…
advertisement
Compare with the earlier story, published on Literotica… It turns out Cruz isn't the only self-published plagiarist. Amazon is rife with fake authors selling erotica ripped word-for-word from stories posted on Literotica, a popular and free erotic fiction site that according to Quantcast attracts more than 4.5 million users a month, as well as from other free online story troves. As recently as early January, Robin Scott had 31 books in the Kindle store, and a down-and-dirty textual analysis revealed that each one was plagiarized. Rachel M.
Haven, a purveyor of incest, group sex, and cheating bride stories, was selling
11 pilfered tales from a variety of story sites. Eve Welliver had eight titles
in the Kindle store copied from Literotica and elsewhere, and she had even
thought to plagiarize some five-star reviews. Luke Ethan's author page listed four
works with titles like My Step Mom Loves Me and OMG My
Step-Brother in Bisexual, and it doesn't appear he wrote any of them.
Maria Cruz had 19 ebooks and two paperbacks, all of which were created by other
authors and republished without their consent, while her typo-addled alter
ego Mariz Cruz was hawking Wicked Desire: Steamy bondage picture
volume 1. Writers I contacted through Literotica, who
do not profit from the stories they post, expressed different reactions to
being plagiarized, ranging from abject anger to flattery that someone thought
their work worth stealing to fear I might reveal their real identity. A highly prolific scribe with the pen name
Boston Fiction Writer, whose story, “Boston Halloween Massacre” had
been transposed into an ebook titled Massacre on Halloween and sold under Robin
Scott's name, threatened to hurt the person who stole her work, “even
more than they hurt me, so that they'd think twice about stealing another story
from me. I dare say, she'd have no more fingers left to steal anyone's
stories, ever again.” David Springer, a security guard whose “nom de
naughty” is Oediplex, recently learned that his story, “I
Remember Mother” was repackaged for the Kindle as My Step
Mom Loves Me by Luke Ethan, and wondered how well the book was
selling. “I never did expect to get wealthy from writing,” he
says, “though I wish I had a penny for every orgasm my stories have
produced.” Luke Ethan's story on Amazon…
advertisement
And now here's the original, by Oediplex, on Literotica… David Weaver, a 52-year-old math teacher whose story “Galactic Slave” was being sold for Kindle as Slave of the
Galaxies, also by Robin Scott, doesn't have the resources to engage
in a spat over copyright. “What makes this kind of theft so insidious is
how easy it is to get away with and avoid getting caught,” he
says. Naturally erotica isn't the only category ebook pirates have set their sights on. Manuel Ortiz Braschi has
published thousands of ebooks on Amazon, often claiming as his own works
in the public domain, including Alice in Wonderland. Amazon has pulled
most of them, but Braschi continues to peddle an advice book for senior
citizens and a plagiarized cookbook Amazon previously removed when it
was sold under a different author's name. Mike Essex, a search specialist at U.K. digital marketing agency Koozai,
identified several how-to books on procuring health insurance that were
plagiarized, sometimes sold under three or more different author's names
with slightly different titles but identical content (like
this one). Fan fiction abounds with plagiarized
titles, as does fantasy. Last year Canadian novelist S.K.S. Perry
learned that an imposter was selling his novel Darkside for
$2.99 as a Kindle ebook without his knowledge. He wrote on his blog: “All
I can assume is that someone convinced Amazon that they were S.K.S. Perry,
and submitted my book for
sale.” The
same happened to Steve Karmazenuk, whose fantasy novel, The
Unearthing, was co-opted by another Amazon
seller. Amazon's policy is to remove offending content
when it receives complaints of plagiarism. Erotica author
Elizabeth Summers had at least 65 titles expunged when plagiarism
allegations surfaced. Recently Robin Scott's books also disappeared from Amazon when writers
complained. (Scott, which is almost assuredly not her–his?–real name, did not respond to requests for an interview over Twitter.) But this reactive approach isn't entirely effective. After users in a Kindle forum griped about Maria
Cruz, her entire cache of ebooks–all 51 of them–were deleted, but in the days
that followed she posted a whole new set of material, mostly collections
of porn pictures although there were a few traditional text-based works, too.
And it usually takes Amazon time to act. “Galactic Slave” writer David Weaver
told me he contacted Amazon weeks ago to request the stolen work be removed
from the site and all proceeds forwarded to him, but Amazon has not yet
complied.

To be fair, Amazon isn't the only ebook store
grappling with plagiarism. In addition to her collection of Kindle ebooks, Eve
Welliver offers five plagiarized works through Apple's iBookstore.
“Supposedly Apple hand-checks all the erotica, which is why it takes
forever for your books to show up there, but somehow she got
through,” Sharazade says. This penchant for plagiarism shouldn't surprise
us. Self-publishing has become the latest vehicle for spammers and content
farms, with the sheer volume of self-published books making it difficult, if
not impossible, for e-stores like Amazon to vet works before they go on sale.
In 2006, 51,000 self-published titles were released; last year there were
133,036 self-published books, and that number is destined to
climb. Writing a book is hard. All those torturous hours an author has
to spend creating, crafting, culling until nonsensical words are
transformed into engaging prose. It's a whole lot easier to copy and paste
someone else's work, slap your name on top, and wait for the money to roll
in. This creates a strong economic incentive, with fake authors–Sharazade thinks it's possible they are organized gangs based in Asia–earning 70% royalty rates on every sale, earning far more than a spammer could with
click fraud. The new self-publishing platforms are easy to use and make it possible
to publish a title in as little as 24 hours. There's no vetting, editing, or oversight, and if your work is taken down you can always throw up more
titles or simply concoct a new pen name and start over. There's even
a viral ebook generator that comes packed with 149,000 articles that makes it
possible to create an ebook in minutes. Legislation has been proposed that would give
content holders more leverage in dealing with etailers: the Stop Online Piracy
Act (SOPA). It would award copyright holders wide-ranging powers to run
websites that host infringing material off the Internet without needing to acquire
a court orders. If it becomes law credit card companies could be forced to suspend
financial transactions, search engines required to de-link ecommerce sites,
and DNS providers made to hobble access. It's the kind of law,
well-intentioned as it might be, that could have serious negative repercussions, opponents say.
No wonder Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo! have reportedly been considering a
coordinated protest against it in the form of a blackout day. There is, I believe, a simpler solution. Why
not require an author to submit a valid credit card before she can self-publish
her works on the Kindle? If an author, who could still publish under a pen name, were found to have violated someone else's
copyright Amazon could charge that card $2,000 and ban her from selling again.
Amazon could also run content through one of the many plagiarism detectors that
are available–such as Turnitin or iThenticate–before an ebook is put on sale. Perhaps, though, Amazon doesn't care if it sells
plagiarized works; it benefits from the sale whether it holds back an author's royalties
or not. A company spokesperson responded to my requests for comment with the following statement:

[Ed note: typed out links were converted to hyperlinks] Sharazade, for her part, says, “I have no problem competing against
legitimate writers and publishers. That's all part of the deal. But I am irritated by competing with cheaters. That kills the
fun of it.” And she adds: “It's lying, cheating, money,

But he largely skipped over the late 1990s — the most tumultuous period of his White House tenure and a time that put his relationship with his wife to the test.
He recalled 1997, when his daughter, Chelsea, went off to college. And he spoke about how his wife worked with Republican leaders in Congress to pass a child healthcare proposal.
But he did not mention his affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky and his subsequent impeachment, which made headlines in 1998 and 1999.
The ex-president's decision to gloss over those years could have been an effort to place the focus on his wife instead of his own presidency.
After all, dredging up the darkest time of their marriage could have humiliated Hillary Clinton on the same day she became the first woman to become a major party presidential nominee.
But Bill Clinton's omission caught the attention of reporters and political junkies on Twitter, who noted it took the focus off the scandals that rocked his presidency and his marriage.
Bill Clinton just went from 1997 to 2000. Moving right along... — Karen Travers (@karentravers) July 27, 2016
We've now covered every year in Hillary Clinton's adult life except, um, 1998 and 2003. — Nicholas Thompson (@nxthompson) July 27, 2016

Hillary Clinton was deeply hurt by her husband's affair with Lewinsky, whom she called a "loony toon" to her longtime friend Diane Blair, according to papers released in 2014.
She also told Blair why she decided to forgive her husband.
“It was a lapse, but she says to his credit, he tried to break it off, tried to pull away, tried to manage someone who was clearly a 'narcissistic loony toon' but it was beyond control," Blair wrote in her notes about a September 1998 conversation with Hillary Clinton.
From press secretary Sean Spicer's comments about the show to the president angrily tweeting about Alec Baldwin, here is Donald Trump's history with SNL. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)
Part of being the president of the United States is having some portion of the arts and entertainment community satirize you, ridicule you or dump on you.
President Ronald Reagan is arguably the reason a brand of punk rock, called hard-core, existed in America. Bands such as DOA, Government Issue, the Minutemen, the Dead Kennedys and the appropriately named Reagan Youth tossed furious barbs at the Republican president through songs like “F—-d Up Ronnie” and “If Reagan Played Disco.”
Even punk bands that did not speak specifically to the president, such as Washington's famed Fugazi, came of age during his tenure.
That is not particularly surprising — pop culture often responds to whoever is in office, especially Republicans.
The rise of shows featuring political humor that skewer the current landscape, such as “The Daily Show” and its progeny “The Colbert Report,” arguably gained popularity as a response to the Bush administration. As Quartz wrote of Jon Stewart's “Daily Show,” “For most viewers, the show's must-watch period started with George W. Bush in the White House and particularly after 9/11.”
From Vaughn Meader's President Kennedy to Jay Pharoah's President Obama, the history of presidential impersonations is long and not all were success stories. (Nicki DeMarco,William Wan/The Washington Post)
Pop culture and the presidency have a long and storied history. More often than not, entertainers, artists and critics use their microphones (both literally and metaphorically) to mock, protest or disagree with the president.
One big exception was President Harry Truman. But there were mitigating circumstances: The criticism was of his daughter, Margaret, specifically her singing performance in a Washington Post review by Paul Hume in 1950.
“Mr. Hume,” Truman wrote to the critic, “It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful. … Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below!”
But most presidents do not respond, even when the words sting.
Take one of the more famous examples — in 2005, Kanye West said in a live telethon to help victims of Hurricane Katrina that “George Bush doesn't care about black people.”
In response, President Bush said . . . nothing.
Presumably, he was working on more pressing matters, such as the drowning of a major U.S. city. It was not until years later, when he was years out of office, that Bush addressed the moment, saying that he resented the claim that he was racist, calling the episode “one of the most disgusting moments of my presidency.”
And then there is Sarah Palin. After months of skewering from Tina Fey, she appeared on the show with Fey and played into the humor.
It's difficult to imagine that President-elect Donald Trump would respond in either of these ways.
This past weekend alone, Trump has insulted and attacked two popular shows that dared oppose or ridicule him in some way. The first is the now-famous “Hamilton” stunt Friday, when one of the actors, on behalf of the cast, read a prepared statement to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who attended the show.
In response, Trump called the musical “overrated” and its cast “rude.”
The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016
The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016
This led to social media reaction across the country, on both sides of our divided America. In Chicago, it led to an incident in which a drunk Trump supporter allegedly disrupted a performance with profanities and with promises to “kill” Democrats. The man was quickly detained, and no one was hurt — but who is to say what would happen next time?
The next day, “Saturday Night Live” does what “Saturday Night Live” does — it put the president-elect in its crosshairs. After all, it's known for what Time magazine called the “ritual mocking” of presidents and candidates, from Dana Carvey's George H.W. Bush impersonation to its lampooning of Al Gore's usage of the word “lockbox” to protect Medicare.
This is a show that once mocked President Gerald Ford. He responded by saying nothing.
In the show's cold open, Alec Baldwin reprised his Trump impersonation, portraying the president-elect as overwhelmed by the responsibilities of the job.
Trump must have taken a moment from his actual preparation for the presidency to catch the late-night show, which he hosted last year. He did not like what he saw.
I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show – nothing funny at all. Equal time for us? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016
The president-elect has long been considered “thin-skinned,” especially considering his own readiness to mercilessly insult and belittle opponents — making him one of those people who can dish it out but can't take it.
And his past behavior suggests a particular issue with pop culture poking fun at him.
And make no mistake — the pop culture community will keep going after him.
They already have in droves. Take rapper YG, who penned a song not-so-subtly titled “F— Donald Trump” and who, during one performance of this song, asked audience members to come onstage and take wild swings at a piñata shaped like the president-elect.
Just Sunday night at the American Music Awards, pop-punk legends Green Day began chanting, “No KKK / No fascist USA / No Trump.”
Green Day chanted “No Trump/ No KKK/ No fascist USA!” during their 'Bang Bang Bang' performance at the #AMAs pic.twitter.com/FmNX2cQ9M1. — Pop Crave (@PopCravePolls) November 21, 2016
The constant stream of insults would probably be difficult for anyone to stomach. Perhaps that is one reason past presidents have let them go. That and the fact that responding to a pop-culture jab can admittedly be seen as childish rather than presidential.
As one user pointed out in a tweet aimed at Trump, “Your brand is now USA, not Trump. Get off the 3rd grade Twitter bully pulpit. LEAVE ARTISTS ALONE. Where are we, China?”
Although Trump has spent a large part of his career as a pop-culture figure, he has long seemed unable to handle any of the negative attention that it brings.
Most famous, perhaps, is his ongoing feud with comedian Rosie O'Donnell. After all, he insulted her during a presidential debate.
The feud began in 2006, when O'Donnell offered her (extremely) negative opinion of Trump on “The View,” a rant that ended with an impersonation of the then-businessman. As she tweeted after the second debate, it's the “5 mins [Trump] can't seem to get over.”
Ten years later, it appears he still hasn't.
https://t.co/EvxYa7A4bL — the 5 mins orange anus can't seem to get over — tell the truth – shame the donald #ImWithHer — Rosie (@Rosie) September 27, 2016
Then there's Seth Meyers. Hard feelings have existed between the two since 2011, when Meyers (along with President Obama and others) made jokes about Trump during the White House correspondents' dinner.
“I saw him a couple of nights afterward at an event in New York, and I walked over to thank him for being a good sport, and he really impressed on me then that I had taken it too far,” Meyers told the Hollywood Reporter. “He did not accept my offer of good sport.”
Five years later, Meyers “banned” Trump from appearing on “Late Night” in reaction to Trump pulling The Washington Post's press credentials. Instead of simply ignoring this, the then-presidential candidate released a statement to Variety claiming Meyers's show had poor ratings.
“He has begged me to do the show for the last two years. I have told him emphatically ‘no,'” Trump said. “I only like doing shows with good ratings, which as everybody knows, I only make better [by a lot.]”
He's said this before:
Wow! Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time–and guess who was his guest? DJT — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2012
In fact, ratings are something he clearly cares deeply about, and he has used them to attack everyone from Arsenio Hall and Jay Leno to . . . the U.S. Open. By his metric, it's amazing anything is still on television.

It isn't only specific entertainers or even shows that Trump has complained about.
It's entire institutions, such as the Emmys and the Oscars. After not receiving an Emmy for his reality show “The Apprentice,” Trump tweeted the following:
Which is worse and which is more dishonest – the #Oscars or the Emmys? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2014
In a 2011 YouTube video titled “From the Desk of Donald Trump,” he offered a tirade against the Emmys.
“Fewer and fewer people watch the Emmys each year and for good reason,” he began. “Their ratings are way down. They're just not doing a good job.”
Trump continued, “Certain shows — and I can name them and maybe at some point I will — just don't get the acclaim that they should, and other shows year after year keep being nominated. And whether people watch them or not, they shouldn't be nominated, and everyone knows it.”
He has attacked the awards program over the years via Twitter as well, calling it such things as “boring,” a “con game” and “politics.”
The Emmys were horrendous…the absolute worst show! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2012
The Emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, The Apprentice never won–even though it should have many times over. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2012
But if the general response to his angry tweets this weekend is any indication, it remains a little odd and, for some, frightening to consider a U.S. president who feels the need to address every perceived slight — particularly when they are coming from the arts and entertainment world, which has a long history of mocking those in power, especially Republicans.
“Please stop making a mockery out of America. Presidential elects shouldn't Twitter rant,” tweeted one user. “Oh my God!! Stop. Are you 11?” asked another. “Grow up — you're meant to lead by example,” tweeted another.

Meet the Mitsuoka Himiko, it's a Japanese car based on the venerable Mazda Miata but instead of the relatively plain Miata body it has a shell clearly inspired by post-WW2 Jaguars. The Japanese company TGMY have decided to use the Himiko as the base of their new production electric car and get this, it has a range of 550kms (324 miles).
It achieves this range with a large lithium-polymer battery system, reduced running resistance and regenerative braking. The company will begin taking orders in the second half of this year, hopefully by then we'll have more information on pricing and other specifications. No word yet on whether the car will be available outside of Japan although it is considered highly likely, though not till 2012 at the earliest.
“One of these cases contains 21 cells. Usually, there are 7 or 8 cells per pack, but we've saved space by stacking them. When we considered how to make battery packs safe, light, and strong, this was the form we came up with.”
“We've spent a long time reducing the running resistance of the car, and improving its performance per unit energy. So now, we're using those advances to fine-tune the car itself. We've reached the stage where a range of 500 km is definitely realistic.” - TGMY Spokesperson

With the Tenga sex toys no longer on display at Japanese discount store Don Don Donki, you can still find sex toys in the most innocuous and publicly-accessible places — and we're not talking about sex shops — in Singapore.
The airport, for instance:
These products were found at a duty-free shop in Changi Airport's Terminal 3 transit area.
As you can clearly see from the photo, shared with us by a contributor, the vibrators and clitoral massagers from Swedish brand Lelo occupied an entire display shelf, where shoppers — and, well, honestly anyone — can actually test the products out.
Available at Watsons
And believe it or not, vibrators and oral sex simulators are also freely available and openly displayed at personal health and lifestyle chain Watsons.
A range of sex toys called Smilemakers are on an exclusive sale arrangement with Watsons. Ranging in price from S$29.95 to S$64.95, the vibrators are brightly coloured and had peculiar names like “The Fireman” and “The Frenchman”.
Here's what they look like:
As you can see, they could be touched and played with, and helpful price labels described exactly what each was designed for.
We understand that these products from Ramblin' Pte Ltd, a local company, have been on sale at Watsons for at least two years.
But what's curious is the fact that the toys are located on the second-lowest shelf at the family planning section, where items like condoms and pregnancy test kits can be found.
In other words, they would be at eye-level for shorter shoppers — children who might be accompanying their parents, for instance.
Full display shelf, beside children's health section
Smilemakers wasn't the only brand of adult toys we found at Watsons — we also came across an American brand of sex toys on sale there, which we understand went on sale earlier this year.
Watsons also stocks a wider variety of products from the brand, VēDO, including combination sets for couples.
Here's the entire shelf we found at the same store:
Prices for these, in case you're wondering, range from S$19.20 to S$64.99.
And by the way, we thought we'd just point out the fact that they were positioned right beside the children's health section:
Is it legal to sell sex toys in stores in Singapore?
The answer to that is, unfortunately, still vague.
According to Section 292 of the Penal Code, anyone who sells, rent or distribute anything deemed to be “obscene” can be sentenced to jail for three months, a fine, or both.
The term “obscene” in this case refers to anything that can “deprave and corrupt persons” who are likely to see or use the items.
“The word ‘obscene', in relation to any thing or matter, means any thing or matter the effect of which is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.”
However, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has set boundaries for sex shops, barring businesses whose primary purpose is to sell products related to sexual activity from situating themselves within or near residential areas, including private residential estates, HDB housing estates and town centres/ neighbourhoods.
But at the very least, you now know where to go to get gifts for the people on your naughty list this Christmas.

Joel Salatin is a genius farmer, but his interpretation of the views on economics does not hold up. Jesus lived in the Roman Empire (“Jesus was about voluntary, not state, philanthropy,” Jan. 12 letter). Roman spent money on infrastructure and military. The people at the top took all they could from the population and gave them as little as possible. There was no spending to make the lives of ordinary people better. What Jesus would have thought of government spending on medical care or social security is impossible to determine.
Salatin is a libertarian, and I would be, too, if it did not reliably produce massive poverty. There about 196 countries. Not one has low-tax, laissez-faire capitalism without also producing a substantial portion of the population living in utter poverty. Not one. So, if you want small government and unregulated capitalism, you have to be willing to tolerate concentrations of wealth at the top, huge inequalities of income and wealth, a weak middle class, and a large poverty class. I wish Salatin was right. He isn't. But I love his hams.

NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct 24 – A second grenade attack hit downtown Nairobi on Monday night killing one person in less than 24 hours after another grenade was hurled inside a pub on Mfangano Street, leaving scores wounded.
ADVERTISEMENT
At least 15 other people were hurt in the second attack and admitted to the Kenyatta National Hospital with various injuries sustained in the attack that occurred at the bustling OTC bus terminus.
“The information we have at this moment is that one person has been killed and several others have been taken to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH),” Nairobi Provincial Commissioner Njoroge Ndirangu told journalists at the scene.
KNH Chief Executive Officer Richard Leresian later told Capital News that they had received 15 patients from the scene of Monday night's blast.
“Of these 15, two are in a serious condition,” he told us on telephone from the hospital.
Police and witnesses told Capital News that the explosion occurred shortly after 8pm, as passengers were scrambling for public transport at the congested bus terminus located near the Salvation Army headquarters.
Guards and matatu drivers who witnessed the incident described the grenade attack as having caused “a loud blast which we easily thought was a tyre burst.”
“At first I thought it was a tyre burst but when I saw people running away and others screaming that is when I realised there was a serious problem. I saw many people screaming for help and they were taken to hospital by good Samaritans, but two were left at the scene,” James Mwaura, told Capital News at the scene.
Another witness Mary Wangare who runs a food kiosk nearby said: “I closed my shop when I heard the explosion and when everything went quite I peeped through the window and saw people being assisted. I hear one person has died.”
Earlier, in the early hours of Monday morning, the first explosion occurred on a dingy lane off Mfangano Street at a pub known as Mwaura's that is mostly frequented by night clubbers from the public transport sector.
Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere told a press conference Monday afternoon that 12 people had been wounded in the attack.
Iteere said investigators were following crucial leads in search of a man who hurled a grenade inside the downtown pub in Nairobi early Monday morning.
Iteere told journalists that so far no arrests had been made in connection with the attack but investigators had been able to identify the type of explosion used.
“Our investigators have been able to identify the explosive as an F1 type grenade which is Russian made. These are things which are not used by our security forces here and it means it must have been brought in [the country],” Iteere said.
The police chief said no suspect had been arrested “but we are following crucial leads to get the attacker and the motive behind this.”
A hand grenade was hurled inside Mwaura's pub located on Mfangano Lane in downtown Nairobi at about 2am, wounding 12 people.
The victims were rushed to the Kenyatta National Hospital where they were admitted with injuries inflicted by shrapnel. Some of them had been discharged from the hospital by midday Monday.
Asked what the security forces thought the motive of the attack was, the police chief said: “You all know that the Al Shabaab have their sympathisers here and probably may be these are the people we are dealing with.”
He was also categorical that the attack was a repercussion of the military offensive Kenya is undertaking in Somalia targeted at the Al Shabaab insurgents who have been blamed for high profile kidnappings of four European women seized from the Lamu island and Dadaab refugee camp, including that of Frenchwoman Marie Dedieu who died in the hands of kidnappers last week.
“We all know what is taking place. This is our second week in our engagement across the border and these are some of the things as a way of repercussions which we anticipated, it should not dampen our mode I think more than ever before this is the time to stand to be counted as Kenyans, all of us I think we are going to succeed,” the police chief said.
Al Shabaab insurgents have lately warned of reprisal attacks inside the capital Nairobi to protest the military operation targeting them in Somalia.
The US embassy in Nairobi warned on Saturday of an “imminent threat” of attacks possibly targeting foreigners, one week after Kenyan forces crossed into Somalia to hunt down the Al Shabaab fighters.
The embassy cited “credible information of an imminent threat of terrorist attacks directed at prominent Kenyan facilities and areas where foreigners are known to congregate, such as malls and night clubs.”
Last week, Kenya sent troops across its border with Somalia to hunt Al Shabaab insurgents it blames for the abduction of a British tourist, a disabled Frenchwoman – who has since died in captivity – and two Spanish aid workers.
The radical Islamist Al Shabaab, which denies kidnapping foreigners, has repeatedly warned of bloody retaliation.
On Monday, the police chief announced that security had been enhanced at vital installations in the capital, particularly at fuel storage facilities, malls and foot bridges which are likely targets for the insurgents.
Iteere said tight security measures had also been enhanced at the border areas, including at the Dadaab refugee camp where he revealed security forces had seized several AK 47 assault rifles.
“We are trying our best to secure our country as security forces but we also urge Kenyans to assist us the much they can,” he said.

We are all unknowingly addicts. Addicts of bad news. Twenty-four hours per day, seven days a week, the news media is constantly feeding us negative stories on every digital device in their arsenal - our mobile phones, tablets, computers, radio, television and newsfeeds. Every murder, terrorist plot, economic downturn, no matter how remote, is brought to us live, instantly, over and over again.
The reason for this is simple. Our brains are hardwired to pay far more attention to negative news, than positive stories. Millions of years ago as our brains were evolving, if we missed a piece of good news, that was an inconvenience, but missing a piece of bad news could mean the end of your life and your germ-line. For that reason, we've developed portions of our brain that are constantly scanning for bad news and thereafter putting us on high alert. The old newspaper adage, ‘if it bleeds, it leads' is as true today as it was a century ago.
So it's no wonder that people think the world is falling apart, and many are in a very dark contemporary mood. But what is curious about this situation is that in nearly every measurable way, the world is much better off than it has ever been.
I'll start with poverty, which has declined more the in the past 50 years than the previous 500. In fact, during the last 50 years, while the population on Earth has doubled, the average per capita income around th world (adjusted for inflation) has tripled.
We're not just richer than ever before, we're healthier as well. During the last century, maternal mortality has decreased by 90 percent and child mortality by 99 percent, while the length of the average human lifespan has more than doubled.
As Steven Pinker has made clear, since the middle ages, violence on Earth has been in constant decline. Homicide rates are a hundred-fold less than they were when they peaked 500 years ago. So we're not only healthier, we're safer as well.
If your measure of prosperity is tilted towards the availability of goods and services, consider that even the poorest American's today (those below the poverty line) have access to phones, toilets, running water, air conditioning and even a car. Go back 150 years and the wealthiest robber barons couldn't have hoped for such wealth.
Right now, a Maasai Warrior on mobile phone has better mobile communications than President Reagan did 25 years ago; And, if he were on Google, he would have access to more information than President Clinton did just 15 years ago. We are effectively living in a world of communications and information abundance.
Even more impressive are the vast array of tools and services now disguised as free mobile apps that this same Maasai Warrior can access: a GPS locator, video teleconferencing hardware and software, an HD video camera, a camera, stereo system, vast library of books, films, games and music. Go back 20 years and add the cost of these goods and services together—and you'll get a total well in excess of a million dollars. Today, all these devices come standard with a smart phone.
During the last two decades, we have witnessed a technological acceleration unlike anything the world has ever seen. Exponential progress in artificial intelligence, robotics, infinite computing, ubiquitous broadband networks, digital manufacturing, nano-materials, synthetic biology, to name a few, put us on track to make greater gains in the next two decades than we have had in the previous 200 years. We will soon have the ability to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman, and child on the planet. Abundance for all is within our grasp.
But it won't happen without your help. While accelerating technology is an awesome force, in itself it is not enough to bring on this golden age. However, there are three additional forces emerging—and this is exactly where you come in.
The second of these forces is the rise of the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) innovator. No longer content with hot-rods and homebrew computers, in the past decade, DIY'ers (working both in small teams or collectively, via crowdsourcing) have made major contributions to fields like healthcare, energy, education, water, freedom—areas that were once the sole province of large corporations and governments. This means that whatever challenges we face in the world—climate change, AIDS in Africa, energy poverty—more than ever before, we are now empowered to individually help solve these problems. And it's our ability to do so, this newfound power of the maverick DIY'er, that is the second of our four forces.
The same technologies that enabled the rise of the DIY Innovator have also created wealth much faster than ever before. Tech entrepreneurs like Jeff Skoll (eBay), Elon Musk (PayPal), Bill Gates (Microsoft), etc., became billionaires by reinventing industries before the age of 35. Maintaining their appetite for the big and bold, they are now turning their attention and considerable resources towards global betterment, becoming a new breed of philanthropist—technophilanthropists—and, as such, yet another force for abundance.
Perhaps the most significant change of the next decade will be the dramatic increase in worldwide connectivity via the internet. The online community is projected to grow from two billion users in 2010 to five billion by 2020. Three billion new minds are about to join the global brain trust. What will they dream? What will they discover? What will they invent? These are minds that the rest of society has never had access to before and their collective economic and creative boost becomes our final force: the power of “the rising billion.”
We are living in a time of unprecedented opportunity.
So while I can't tell you to ignore all the negative news coming your way, I can say that the future, much like the present, is going to be a whole lot better than you think.

“Economics is not a scientific discipline like the natural sciences, and that no cumulative advance describes its changeful form over the years… The chapter we call modern economics, compared with earlier chapters of our discipline, is shallow and poor rather than deep and rich, and the intellectual puzzle of some future time will be to account for the failure rather than the success of the period in which we have lived… The prestige accorded to mathematics in economics has given it rigor, but, alas, also mortis.” (Heilbroner 1979: 193, 196)
Robert L. Heilbroner (1919 – 2005) was an notable American economist and historian of economic thought. The author of some twenty books, Heilbroner is best known for The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers (1953), which is one of the most widely read economics books of all time.
This quote taken from “Modern Economics As a Chapter in the History of Economic Thought” – his short and sharp critique of economics, published in 1979. Back then, Heilbroner keenly observed and pointed out the fundamental flaws of neoclassical economics, including a superficial mathematical trend which hinders to understand the socio-economic reality and problems of a society.

The World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) has ratified a 13-round World Rally Championship (WRC) calendar for the 2018 season, with Turkey returning for the first time since 2010. At a recent meeting, the WMSC confirmed that the Marmaris-based Rally Turkey will replace Rally Poland on next year's schedule, but will be held in September to close up the current five-week gap between rounds 10 and 11. Poland's departure had been connected to the course's troubled record with spectator safety.
Rally Turkey's inclusion, however, comes with the caveat of an acceptable candidate event, which will be held next month.
The only other change in next year's schedule involves a switch for the rounds in Britain and Spain, with Rally GB running ahead of Rally Spain in 2018.
The first and second rounds of the season in Monte Carlo and Sweden are both scheduled a week later than this year, in an effort to offer a longer winter break.
Meanwhile, Mexico, Argentina, Portugal, Italy, and Australia all have to finalize their agreements with the WRC Promoter, but none of the events anticipate any problems.
There remains speculation of Italy's round moving back to the mainland and a northern Italian base.
The Paris meeting of WMSC also confirmed that there would be no paddle shift on R5 cars and more help to events which receive a "yellow card" on safety grounds.
The communication stated, "The 'Rally Safety Task Force' will now be responsible for helping the concerned organizer and/or ASN to reach a satisfactory level of safety for the future."

Why is the libertarian movement so small? Freedom is popular! Freedom is ingrained in the roots of our culture. Free spirits are everywhere. Why aren't they in the Libertarian Party? OK, maybe the last question was a bad one. Libertarians can have many reasons for not joining the LP: the party is too radical, not radical enough, too ineffective, too bureaucratic, etc. But why aren't these free spirits libertarians in the broader sense of the word? Why are so many of them liberals, advocates of bureaucracy and the nanny state? Why do some free spirits wear Capitalism Kills T-shirts?
Answer: capitalism does kill…the spirit, for many. If you work on an assembly line or in some other repetitive job, capitalism means regimentation, boredom, and a stifling of the spirit. Study the works of Fredrick Taylor. Yevgeny Zamyatin based his dystopian novel We on the management theories of Fredrick Taylor – who developed said theories for capitalists. When we libertarians think of young adults put in uniforms and under orders, we think of the military. But guess who else is putting thousands of young people into uniform? McDonald's! I leave it to the reader to decide which uniformed service is more regimented.
Libertarians call for liberty, or, in particular: freedom from the initiation of force by government. This is a freedom, and very important freedom at that. But freedom is a bigger concept. Some years ago I wrote several chapters on “What is Freedom?” and came up with three broad categories of freedom: freedom from the government, freedom from the boss, and freedom from everyone else. Most libertarians focus on the first and downplay the other two, and lose the hearts of most freedom lovers in the process.
Freedom is about having options in life – good options. Who is more free: the single mom in a capitalist country who has to work double shifts at the barbecue restaurant in order to pay her childrens' medical bills, or her well-cared-for counterpart in a European welfare state?
When young free spirits see libertarians celebrating capitalism, they see authoritarians celebrating wage serfdom. When they see libertarians call for selling off federal lands, they see more No Tresspassing signs and the Disneyfication of the nicer national parks. They see their world shrinking.
The Ron Paul Revolution attracted many more free spirited young adults than the explicit libertarian movement ever did. In part this is because Ron Paul was a proven anti-war politician at a time of unpopular war. But the other part is just as important: Ron Paul is part of the old conspiracy-oriented anti-capitalist Right. This Old Right looks back to smaller government and smaller private enterprises: family farms, locally owned businesses, smaller scale manufacturers where brand name equals the company producing the product. The Old Right's conspiracy theories revolve around international bankers, robber barons, and super rich families weaving a web of wealth and power to centralize all.
I don't buy these Bircher style conspiracy theories. Sure, some robber barons and their old money scions may conspire from time to time for special priviledges, as do all other societal factions. But the idea of a secret unified New World Order plot hatched behind closed doors by a hierarchical elite defies the data. Second generation money is not that disciplined! The Paris Hiltons of the world are not behind the growth of big government.
Government is secretly subsidizing the super rich , however. But it's an open secret, a purloined letter . Keynesian economics is the economics of ensuring that investors have enough return on their investments so they don't store extra money in the cookie jar. Keynesian economics is about subsidizing the rich! We who like our government small need to shout this from the rooftops. There is no need for a conspiracy backstory; in this enlightened age, such backstories dilute credibility and associate liberty with racism and anti-Semitism. Not good.
Once upon a time, freedom and liberty were tied together politically. The classical liberals worked for smaller government and a smaller wealth gap. Adam Smith called for higher wages and lower profits. If we want government small with democracy at the same time, we need to recreate the old alliance. Otherwise, the young free spirits will worship Obama and turn the U.S. into a European style welfare state.
Anne-Marie Losique said herrecently resurfaced 2004 interview with Ben Affleck, which appears to show the actor groping her and making gross comments about her breasts, was “an on-camera game,” which was “actually very respectful.”
After actressHilarie Burton spoke out about Affleck grabbing her breast in 2003 on “TRL,” prompting an apology from the actor for his inappropriate behavior, another video clip from around the same time made the rounds online. The video (watch above) shows Affleck getting very handsy with Losique, a French-Canadian TV host from Montreal, Quebec, during a press junket interview for the movie “Jersey Girl.” At the time, Losique was the host of the show “Box Office,” which, she told HuffPost, she produced herself. She also said that she and Affleck did dozens of interviews that all had this same, flirtatious, on-camera dynamic.
“It was a game,” said Losique, “an on-camera game, if you will, that was actually very respectful. Because before and after there was very courteous conversation.”
In the 2004 clip, Affleck spends the entire interview nuzzling Losique, holding her and turning her around on his lap.
“They would like it better if you did the interview topless at the station, wouldn't they?” he remarks, asking her why she's covering up her cleavage. When she giggles, responding that it's Sunday morning, Affleck says: “It's Sunday morning? That never stopped you before from getting those titties out. Who are you trying to fool?”
Affleck asks Losique if she has a boyfriend back in Montreal and suggests that she work at Fox in L.A. “They would love you,” he says to her. “Fox L.A., they have a pole they dance on.”
At one point, he appears to graze Losique's breast with his hand, and then suggests that they “do a Janet Jackson stunt.” (Jackson had a nip slip during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004.)
Toward the end of the interview, he makes a joke about cerebral palsy, telling Losique, “Don't make me look retarded,” in a French accent before making a mocking hand motion. The interview wraps up with Affleck joking about how all Losique wants to do “is have sex all the time.”
“I feel used and exploited,” Affleck jokes. “I feel undervalued and objectified by you.” (HuffPost reached out to Affleck's publicist for comment on the interview, but did not hear back.)
Losique agreed to speak to HuffPost by phone about the interview and how she sees it today.
HuffPost: Your 2004 interview with Ben Affleck recently resurfaced. From your perspective, what was that experience like at the time and how do you feel about it now?
Anne-Marie Losique: I have to put some things into context because we did dozens of interviews like that and they were always of the same nature, and it was always done within junkets, film releases, red carpets. And so it was a game ― an on-camera game, if you will, that was actually very respectful. Because before and after there was very courteous conversation. It's just when the camera starts rolling that we would do this game that we both agreed to and it was, to tell you very honestly, it was a hit in Quebec. When I had a Ben Affleck interview, the network would promote it, the media would talk about it and I had amazing ratings.[Laughs]They were very popular because they were seen for what they were, like, fun and games.
As far as his comments [about my breasts], I think he was doing more a parody of the French culture in a way. More because...in North America the French are more at ease with our bodies than maybe the English people.
Did you ever feel as though he was acting in a way that was inappropriate or crossed a line for you?
Very honestly, if I had felt that, I would have stopped it. And I don't think there would have been any issue. And I would have said, “Well, I would like a serious interview,” or whatever. If I had felt that's what I wanted ― you know, I produced my own show, so there are no victims here or nothing. Those interviews, I never edited out anything. I really put it out there. So now it's brought back out of context a little bit. But every time those interviews have resurfaced [before], it's always been in a positive and fun light. Just now, people are trying to put it in a context of this whole situation [with Harvey Weinstein]. And we have to make a distinction. You know? People try to put everything together and this is completely a different situation.
It was bound to happen one of these days, but we here at the prospect podcast have finally created our War and Peace. It's only fitting that the Atlanta Braves minor league system would be the subject of such a saga. To cover all of these prospects I reached out to a friend of the show in Jason Woodell (ProspectStorm.com, Prospects1500.com, and @Jasonatthegame), a man who's seen more of these Braves prospects than just about anybody. So you'll get some first-hand accounts from a really knowledgeable baseball mind. We also dig into the Shohei Ohatni injury, have a detailed discussion of Platelet-Rich Plasma injections, and the success rate. You might need to listen across a few sessions (we go an hour and forty minutes). It's all the Braves Prospects from Ronald Acuna to Austin Riley to Mike Soroka, Kyle Wright, Kolby Allard, Luiz Gohara, and the rest. See what I mean? There's so much to talk about.

Greg Lake, who fronted both King Crimson and Emerson, Lake and Palmer, has died aged 69.
One of the founding fathers of progressive rock, the British musician is known for songs including In the Court of the Crimson King and his solo hit I Believe in Father Christmas.
He died on Wednesday after "a long and stubborn battle with cancer", said his manager.
The news comes nine months after Lake's band-mate Keith Emerson died.
Keyboardist Emerson died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, coroners in the US said.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lake (right) with Carl Palmer in 1971 as ELP were recording their album Trilogy
Lake's manager Stewart Young wrote on Facebook: "Yesterday, December 7th, I lost my best friend to a long and stubborn battle with cancer.
"Greg Lake will stay in my heart forever, as he has always been."
Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett paid tribute on Twitter, writing: "Music bows its head to acknowledge the passing of a great musician and singer, Greg Lake."
"Another sad loss with the passing of Greg Lake," wrote Rick Wakeman, keyboardist in prog rock band Yes.
"You left some great music with us my friend & so like Keith, you will live on."
'Greatest music made for love'
Born in Bournemouth, Lake was given his first guitar at the age of 12 and took lessons from a local tutor called Don Strike.
He formed a close friendship with fellow student Robert Fripp, with whom he created King Crimson in 1969.
Their debut album In the Court of the Crimson King featured such songs as 21st Century Schizoid Man.
It set a standard for progressive rock and received a glowing, well-publicised testimonial from The Who's Pete Townshend, who called it "an uncanny masterpiece".
But within a year, founding member Mike Giles quit and Lake refused to work with the band - although he stuck around long enough to sing on their second album, In the Wake of Poseidon, which was criticised for treading old ground.
'Love not money'
The singer and bassist was then approached by Emerson, who had supported King Crimson on a North American tour and needed a singer for his new band.
Joined by Atomic Rooster drummer Carl Palmer, ELP made their live debut at the Guildhall in Plymouth in 1970 before giving a career-making performance at the Isle of Wight Festival.
Unusually, the band combined heavy rock riffs with a classical influence. They scored hit albums with Pictures at an Exhibition, Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery - many of them produced by Lake himself.
Tarkus, released in 1971, featured an opening track inspired by the fictional Tarkus character - a half-tank, half-armadillo creature that would appear on stage at gigs - that lasted more than 20 minutes.
The band went on to enjoy chart success in 1977 with their version of Aaron Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man.
ELP's ambitious light shows and on-stage theatrics were the epitome of '70s rock excess, and several punk acts cited ELP as one of the bands they were reacting against.
But the band sold more than 48 million records, and Lake continued to be an influential and popular touring musician even after the band wound down in the late 1970s.
In 2010, Kanye West repopularised the King Crimson song 21st Century Schizoid Man when he sampled it in his hit song, Power.
"The greatest music is made for love, not for money," Lake is quoted as saying on his official website.
"The early ELP albums were pioneering because there is no standing still; time is always moving forward."

With little fanfare and almost no news media attention, some of the same radical groups involved in shutting down Donald Trump's Chicago rally last week are plotting a mass civil disobedience movement to begin next month.
George Soros has just declared war on America. With the Soros millions behind them, a brand new far Left anarchist group named after the Arab Spring hoax of a few years back, has vowed to set America on fire both figuratively and literally. These are the exact same people that caused mass disruptions at Donald Trump's rally in Chicago last week. They are vowing to not quit until thousands of them are in jail for crimes against the government. Though they don't mention Trump by name, they are obviously aiming to stop his run for the presidency as they just attempted to do in Chicago.
The operation, calling itself Democracy Spring, is threatening “drama in Washington” with the “largest civil disobedience action of the century.” The radicals believe this will result in the arrest of thousands of their own activists. They intend to march across the East Coast in order to spark a “fire that transforms the political climate in America.”
Chaos, Protests at Cancelled Donald Trump Rally in Chicago:
This is what it looked like when they launched their attack at the Trump rally in Chicago last week, and it is what you can expect Democracy Spring to do on a nationwide level come April. (Sound for this video starts around the 11:30 mark.)
“We will demand that Congress listen to the People and take immediate action to save our democracy. And we won't leave until they do — or until they send thousands of us to jail,” the website for Democracy Spring declares, channeling rhetoric from the Occupy movement.
The group is backed by numerous organizations, including the George Soros-funded groups MoveOn.org, the Institute for Policy Studies, and Demos. Next month's Democracy Spring chaos is set to begin with a meetup on April 2 at the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia.
The good news is, however, that after they attacked Trump at the rally in Chicago which led to him winning all of Illinois yesterday, this new movement virtually guarantees a Trump presidency in November.
To which we say…game on!
Moody was in the desert observing a meteor shower at about 1:15 A.M. when he saw a glowing, metallic, disk-shaped object falling toward the ground about 300 feet away.
The UFO was about fifty feet long and eighteen to twenty feet wide. As it descended to an altitude of fifteen to twenty feet, it wobbled on its own axis.
Then it began moving slowly and steadily toward Moody. He jumped into his car but was unable to start it. The UFO came to a stop about seventy feet away. Moody could hear a high-pitched humming sound. He noticed a rectangular window in the craft through which he could see shadows resembling human forms. The noise stopped and he felt a numbness crawling over his body.
The next thing he would remember was seeing the object rising up into the sky and disappearing into the distance.
Moody turned the ignition key and his car started immediately. Terrified, he drove off quickly. When he arrived home, he noticed, to his surprise, that the time was 3:00 A. M. He felt that he had somehow lost about one and a half hours. The following day Moody experienced a pain in his lower back.
Within a few days, a rash broke out over his lower body. Upon the recommendation of a physician, he began to practice self-hypnosis in an effort to recall what had occurred during the lost time period.
Over the next few weeks, he was able to piece together an almost complete picture of the events. According to Moody's subsequent recollection, after being overcome by numbness on August 13, 1975, he had observed two beings approaching his car.
About six feet tall, the creatures wore skintight black clothing. After a brief scuffle with them, he was rendered unconscious. He awoke on a slab inside the craft. His limbs felt leaden and immovable. Next to him stood the alien leader.
The latter was distinguishable from Moody's two captors by his short stature of about five feet, and the silvery white color of his suit. However, like the others he had a large hairless head, a protruding brow, roundish eyes, small ears and nose, and very thin lips. His skin was whitish-gray.
The leader asked Moody telepathically if he was prepared to behave peacefully. When Moody agreed to do so, the leader applied a rodlike device to his back which relieved the paralysis.
Moody was taken to another part of the ship where he was shown the drive unit, a device consisting of a large rod surrounded by three glass-canopied holes. Each hole contained a central crystalline object with one rod on each side of it. One rod had a spherical head, while the other was topped by a T-bar.
As he moved about the craft, Moody noticed a sweet, stifling odor. He was told that the alien mother ship was situated miles away above Earth. He was promised a future meeting with the occupants but warned that closer contact with Earth men would not be attempted for another twenty years.
The aliens told Moody that he would have no recollection of the incident until about two weeks later. The leader placed his hands on the sides of Moody's head, rendering him unconscious once more.
An analysis of Moody's claims by Charles McQuiston, co-inventor of the Psychological Stress Evaluator, indicated that he was telling the truth. Investigator Jim Lorenzen, however, questions a couple of contradictions in Moody's accounts of the incident. In an early telling, Moody related that the alien mother ship was located 400 miles above Earth.
Later, however, he said it was 6,000 miles away. Another point which Lorenzen notes is that Moody at one time referred to his two captors as frail creatures, yet later described them as being six feet tall.

PAX Media, the minds behind PAX East, South, and West, are launching a new convention focusing on traditional games.
It's no secret that Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik, creators of Penny Arcade and PAX Media, are huge D&D players. From games with Wil Wheaton to major story arcs in the comic featuring their game antics, the world of tabletop gaming has been a huge part of their experiences.
Since the launch of the original PAX in 2004, its various iterations have been well-attended and highly praised for their celebration of gamer culture. PAX is known for having panels and exhibitors centered around both independent and major developers, giving a voice to the indie development community.
This year, PAX media is stepping into the world of gaming conventions with PAX Unplugged, a convention in their usual style but focusing on tabletop gaming. This move is utterly unsurprising from the people who regularly play D&D with staff from Wizards of the Coast.
Their exhibitor list is looking to be massive, with names like White Wolf, Privateer Press, Monte Cook, Steve Jackson games and WotC on their list. It is looking to be a major, major event and one that tabletop gamers will probably show massive crowds for. The full list of Exhibitors is available here.
PAX Unplugged is scheduled for November 17-19 at in Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. Get more information at the official site.

Even if there's a spot on the ballot to write in a candidate for president, your vote might not count.
SHOW TRANSCRIPT
If you don't like who's on your ballot this election, there's an easy solution: Write in your own candidate.

"I think I might write in Lindsey Graham. He's an old good friend of mine, and a lot of people like him," Arizona Sen. John McCain said recently during a debate.
But before you write in Lindsey Graham, red sweater aficionado Ken Bone or even Mickey Mouse, you should probably figure out if that's something you can even do.
Yep. Not every state allows write-in candidates for the office of the president, and many that do allow it to have specific rules about it.
Nine states don't allow voters to write in a candidate. Period.
Thirty-three states allow write-in candidates but require a candidate to file a declaration of intent to run for office — or, at a bare minimum, provide elector information.
So in McCain's case, a vote for Graham won't be counted. Like many states that require filings for write-in candidates, Arizona's deadline has already passed. And Graham didn't file.
So that leaves only eight states that count the votes of any name written in. But even then, the candidates need to meet the eligibility requirements for office. And fictional characters aren't usually counted, either. Sorry, Mickey.
So you're best off checking on the specific rules with your state to make sure your write-in vote will actually be counted.

How did Jane Sanders funnel more than 500k to her daughter's for-profit woodworking business during her tenure as President of Burlington College and get away with it?
Much has been written about Jane Sanders tenure as President of Burlington College (2004 to 2011). Criticism has been especially pointed regarding the $10 million land purchase for a campus expansion she spearheaded in 2010 that ultimately lead to Sanders removal a year later (albeit with a $200k golden parachute) and the College's bankruptcy and ultimate closure last spring. In a letter to The Chronicle of Higher Education entitled,“What Really Happened at Burlington College,” President Carol Moore wrote that an investigation should be conducted into how a loan of such magnitude was ever approved for a college with such limited operating funds. But what hasn't been discussed in all the noise about Burlington College's closure is how Jane Sanders (supported by the same Board of Trustees who approved the land sale) openly funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars from Burlington College's operating funds to VT Woodworking School?—?a for-profit business started by her daughter Carina Driscoll in 2007.
More than $500k from 2009 to 2012
Last year, Politico described Burlington College as catering to “nontraditional students, such as veterans and adults. It grew from its original 14 students to about 200 in recent years, finding appeal with its small student-to-faculty ratio and degrees in unusual fields including woodworking.” Yet, when Jane Sanders first arrived at Burlington College in 2004 no degree program in woodworking existed. It isn't until 2009 that public tax records show Burlington College paying Vermont Woodworking School $56,474 for materials, charges and lease of bench space based on student enrollment reflecting what appears to be the beginning of the College's woodworking program. The college was forced to report this expenditure as it related to a relationship between an interested party (Jane Sander's daughter, Carina Driscoll) and Burlington College. Over the next four years, funds to VT Woodworking School increased considerably from this original amount to $133,134 in 2010; $138,571 in 2011; and, $182,741 in 2012 (the last year program expenses are reported in the tax filings).

United States Senate election in Vermont, 2018
The 2018 United States Senate election in Vermont will be held on November 6, 2018, alongside a gubernatorial election, U.S. House election, and other state and local elections. Incumbent independent Senator Bernie Sanders has indicated that he plans to run for re-election to a third term.[1]
Background [ edit ]
Two-term independent Senator Bernie Sanders was re-elected with 71% of the vote in 2012. Sanders, a former candidate for president in the 2016 election and one of two independent members of Congress, is a self-described democratic socialist.[2][3] Sanders has caucused with the Democratic Party since taking office in 2007, and he is the Ranking Member of the Budget Committee. He will be 77 years old in 2018. Sanders ran for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. In November 2015, Sanders said that he would run as a Democrat in future elections.[4] On July 28, 2016, Sanders announced he would return to the Senate as an independent and two days later in an interview on Real Time with Bill Maher that he would run for re-election.
Activist and journalist, Al Giordano, considered challenging Sanders for the Democratic nomination to protest Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, which he felt divided the Democratic Party,[5][6][7] but decided against doing so for health reasons.[8]

If you've ever worked with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) then you're probably familiar, in some way, with the steps required for deploying that package onto the server. In the past this could be somewhat of a tedious endeavor with numerous deployment options but ever since the release of SQL Server 2012, Microsoft has provided a streamlined approach to deploying SSIS packages.
The SQL Server Integration Services Catalog (SSIS Catalog) is a one-stop shop for managing and deploying SSIS projects on the server. If you're reading this post I will assume you already have an SSIS package you are wanting to deploy to a server. However, if that is not the case, you can always create an empty SSIS project in Visual Studio and populate it with several packages in order to see how those individual packages will be imported and deployed into the SSIS catalog.
The first step to creating a catalog is to locate the Integration Services Catalogs option in Management Studio. Once you are connected to the server you should see it towards the bottom of the drop-down as shown below.
Right-click Integration Services Catalogs and select Create Catalog. The Create Catalog window will be displayed as shown below. There is very little that you need to do from here aside from entering a password that will be used to encrypt the catalog. The default name for the catalog database will always be SSIDB. This can not be changed and at this time only a single catalog is supported, though you can have multiple projects deployed within the catalog database so it's really not a big deal.
You will also see a checkbox, which should already be checked, to Enable automatic execution of Integration Services stored procedures at SQL Server startup. It is good practice to leave this option checked if you are intending to create a catalog that will be used routinely. This option can always be turned off at a later time.
Once you click OK, expand the Integration Services Catalogs drop-down and you should now see the newly created SSIDB catalog database.
Now that the SSISDB catalog database has been created the next step is to create a folder that will be used to store the catalog of the specific SSIS project that you will be importing. To create the folder, simply right-click SSISDB and select Create Folder.
The Create Folder window will appear, as shown below. Here you will provide a name for the folder. The name of the folder should be descriptive of the SSIS project you will be importing as the SSISDB catalog database can have multiple catalogs contained within it.
In the example above I am creating a catalog for an SSIS project that supports my company's BI 360 Data Warehouse. I have named the folder BI360DW to reflect this.
Once the folder has been created you will notice that there are two additional drop-downs, Projects and Environments, contained within the folder. For the purposes of this guide, the Projects drop-down is all we need to be concerned with as this is where the individual packages from an SSIS project will be imported.
Now that the project folder has been created it is time to import and deploy the SSIS project into the folder. There are two possible steps for doing this. By right-clicking on the Projects drop-down you will see the options to Deploy Project or Import Packages.
If your project is already created you can skip the Import Packages step and go straight to Deploy Project. However, for the purposes of this guide I will start by importing the packages, though technically this is not necessary as my project already exists.
Once you select Import Packages you will see a generic splash screen that will outline the steps the wizard will take to in order to convert the Integration Services packages. Click Next> to get started.
On the first step you will need to select the location of the package you want to import. It is important that the package be available on the actual server that you are importing it to. If it is not, simply copy it to the server.
In the example above, the path to the SSIS project has been specified. Once this has been done, click Next >
The next screen is probably the most important step. Here you will select the individual packages from the SSIS project that you want to import into the catalog. In the screenshot below you can see a list of 11 individual packages that are part of the overall project.
Notice that not all packages are checked. Two of the packages are older versions of existing packages. Ideally these should be removed from the project but as I am pulling these from an actual project I am working on, these remain in the project until I have fully tested the newer version.
Check the box next to all the packages that you want to import into the catalog. You can also apply an additional password to each package being imported, though this is not required and not always necessary.
Once all applicable packages have been selected click Next >. The packages will now be loaded into the project.
The next window will require you to enter a project name. If you plan on having multiple projects within the same catalog folder then it's good to give some thought into how you would like to name them. Generally a name based on the description of the project will suffice. In this case I only plan on having a single project within the catalog so I am going to give it the same name as the catalog folder, BI360DW.
Once you have provided a project name click Next >
In the event that you use the same project name, as mentioned above, you may receive a prompt indicating this and asking if you want to overwrite the existing project. In this case just select Yes. If you selected to Deploy Project earlier on this will not be a concern.
Depending on the project you are importing or deploying the next series of window may or may not be applicable. The following windows contain options for selecting Execute Packages Tasks, Configurations, Creating Parameters and Configuration Parameters. In many cases these windows will simply show no available options, as shown below.
Configure these options as needed if applicable and click Next > until you reach the Review window.
Review the individual packages that you are importing and all available options and configurations. Once you have confirmed that everything is set up correctly click Convert
Once the wizard has converted all the packages you should see a green check mark next to each step.
If you encounter any errors you will need to review the error and resolve before moving on. If all items show green click Close.
It is now time to Deploy the Integration Services project. Another splash screen will be displayed outlining the steps that will be taken by the wizard. Once you are ready to deploy the project click Next >
The first screen, shown below, will specify the server name and path to the project. If you previously went through the steps to import the packages this screen should have the server and project path predefined. If not, specify both and click Next >
The following screen allows you to review the deployment setup. Review the options and once you are ready to deploy the project click Deploy.
The deployment process can take anywhere form a few seconds to several minutes depending on the size of the project and the speed of the server. Once the project has been deployed you should see a green check next to each step as shown below. Click Close to exit out of the wizard.
You can now view the catalog and confirm that the SSIS packages were successfully imported. Navigate back to the Integration Services Catalog and select the drop-down next to SSISDB, then to your project folder, then Projects and finally Packages.
As you can see all eight SSIS packages that I selected have been added to the BI360DW catalog.
From here you can now utilize the catalog to execute the SSIS packages through an automated SQL Server Agent Job. If you would like to know more about configuring an Agent Job to reference a SQL Server Integration Services package review my post on Creating A SQL Server Agent Job To Call A Deployed SSIS Package.

It should not be surprising that aBlogtoWatch not only favors being able to purchase watches online, but is attempting to actively be part of the force that helps the traditional watch industry transition to more modern ways of doing business – many of which involve internet shopping. Part of the context of this conversation is the fact that traditional watch retailers are mostly suffering in terms of perceived low consumer demand, but at the same time, the data seems to indicate that we are experiencing a time when demand for watches is higher than it has been in the last 30 years. So what's the deal?
The often unspoken reality of 2016 is that people are buying mostly gray-market and pre-owned watches, and they are doing so mostly via internet means. Of course, there are people buying new watches in traditional brick and mortar stores, but few of them are paying retail prices. Simple capitalism mixed with a globalized economy has laid utter ruin to the traditional watch industry's core way of doing business that tends to be about selling wholesale directly to a retailer or using various distributors. I've been talking about this since 2010 when I first asked if there is a “doomsday coming for third party watch retailers.” That is all happening now.
Thick margins designed to pad the actually difficult task of traditional watch stores have made it possible for a massive discount economy to take place just outside the walls of the narrow system of “authorized dealer” sales. Many if not all people reading this who have purchased a watch in the last five years have likely either used a gray market dealer or negotiated a discount. The old way of doing business can't exist anymore.
Please do not feel that I am somehow talking down to consumers for their buying preferences. The consumer is not to be blamed for seeking the most efficient (economical) solution to getting the item that they want. This is basic consumer behavior and it would be odd if consumers did not follow the path of the least resistance. What is a problem, however, is how consumer behavior clashes with the expectations of the watch industry itself. Things need to change, things will change, and I think the consumer should have a voice in how the industry adapts. This “ask the audience question” seeks to understand how your online buying preferences meet those of fellow watch buyers.
The point of this article isn't to talk about the background of the watch industry's current tough situation more, but I say all this to explain why we are asking the question about how you as consumers prefer to shop for watches. It will be interesting not just for one another, but also for the industry itself to see how the timepiece buying community self-reports on how they prefer to buy watches in this day and age. Also, in the comments below please feel free to clarify, or offer your own suggestions on how the traditional watch industry can best adapt to the fact that consumers want quick, efficient, and easy ways to buy watches.
Last, if the conversation gets interesting, then we can proceed to also talk about people's retail store shopping preferences in a different article.
Contest Directions: Show what other "half-rat" or "half-squirrel" animal species may be discovered. Your animal has to be partially rat OR partially squirrel, and partially some other animal. Original rat/squirrel combination is also welcome.
This contest is fueled by the following news:Scientists have discovered a new creature in central Laos that has the face of rat and the tail of a thin squirrel. It is believed to be a species that has been thought to have been extinct for 11 million years. The rodent with long whiskers made headlines around the world when biologists declared a new species that has been nicknamed the Laotian rock rat. In the end, it turned out that the little fellow was not new after all. In fact, it is a rare kind of survivor -- a member of a family thought long gone and present only in fossil remains. In addition, it is not a rat. The species is called Diatomyidae and looks more like small squirrels or tree shrews, according to paleontologist Mary Dawson of Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Locals in Laos call the rodent kha-nyou. Scientists haven't yet a bagged a breathing one, only the bodies of those recently caught by hunters or for sale at meat markets. The challenge has become to trap some live ones. After that, scientists will be able to calculate how many still exist to tell whether the species is endangered, according to Dawson.
In the week after WWE hall of fame member Donald Trump was elected to the highest office in the land, more than 100 Angelenos filed paperwork to run for mayor or City Council, a veritable of stampede of candidates for an election that only a fraction of L.A. residents will vote in.
One of those who signed up is William Washington James Haynes, a 23-year-old online entertainer.
"I really do everything," says Haynes, whose YouTube videos get hundreds of thousands of hits. "I'm an artist, an entertainer. I'm a studier of the world. I'm a comedian, a musician. Even a journalist at times."
Continue Reading
Add one more profession to that rather dizzying list – mayoral candidate. His number one platform? Improve L.A.'s tap water.
"The tap water here is not good," he says. "I cannot ask the people to drink something I wouldn't."
Haynes decided to run last week, in the wake of Trump's improbable ascendancy.
"I saw what the world came to after the election," Haynes says. "Everything was flooded with negativity. I realized if you don't take action, nothing will happen. I want to run a campaign of love."
Haynes is just one of 23 people who have filed paperwork to run against incumbent Mayor Eric Garcetti, while 80 others have filed to run in the eight City Council races. Candidates now have until Dec. 7 to gather the 500 signatures necessary to qualify for the citywide ballot.
Next year will be the last odd-numbered election year in the foreseeable future, thanks to the passage of Amendment 1 by L.A. voters in 2015. (The amendment aims to increase voter turnout by having local elections take place during a gubernatorial or presidential election year.) Some political consultants say it's cheaper and easier to run for office in an odd-numbered year election, when there are fewer races vying for attention — hence the glut of candidates.
"A lot of folks who ... have local base of support realize that to win even-year elections, it's going to take a lot more money to get votes," says political consultant Mac Zilber, who's running the campaign for Jesse Creed, a particularly well-funded challenger to City Councilman Paul Koretz.
No less than 30 candidates have declared their intentions to replace City Councilman Felipe Fuentes of District 7, who abruptly (and somewhat mysteriously) stepped down from his office in August. Would-be candidates include school board member Monica Ratliff; Board of Public Works commissioner Monica Rodriguez; Sunland-Tujunga Neighborhood Council president Krystee Clark; Karo Torossian, a staffer for City Councilman Paul Krekorian; and Dale Gibson, a self-described "Rancher/Stuntman."
The willingness of random citizens to challenge city hall incumbents may indicate a general distrust of sitting politicians, according to some candidates.
"There's a loss of trust," says Venice Beach resident David Ewing, who's declared his intent to run against City Councilman Mike Bonin. "If the councilman gives the community assurances that something is going to be done on a temporary basis, there's no faith that the city is going to keep its word."
Ewing says the recent L.A. Times expose about the Sea Breeze developer whose associates gave more than $40,000 to local politicians was a factor in his decision to run.
Mayoral candidate Mitchell Schwartz cites a general antipathy towards City Hall's pro-development stance as a reason for the glut of office-seekers.
"The number one reason for dissatisfaction is the development policies," Schwartz says. "They've made it hard for regular people to live. They're skewed toward luxury development."
It is a rare occurrence for an incumbent city councilperson to be defeated in Los Angeles. The last time it happened was in 2003, when Antonio Villaraigosa, a former speaker of the state assembly, defeated City Councilman Nick Pacheco.
"I don't know if that's gonna change," Ewing says. "It's very difficult for an insurgent candidate to achieve the kind of public presence that's required to beat an incumbent. We'll see."
We are living in a revolutionary age. In the last number of years, every region of the globe has witnessed significant unrest, most recently evident in Ukraine, Venezuela, Thailand, South Africa, Bosnia, and Iceland, to name a few.
Unrest is typically presented in mainstream media as stemming from specific political concerns. The ongoing protests in Thailand are often described as “monarchist”; protests in Ukraine are said to be about integration with the EU; protests in Venezuela are described as supporting right-wing political parties in opposition to the left-leaning government. But while these specific political issues may be the spark that ignites protests, they are not necessarily the cause.
Unrest, including the associated riots, revolts, and revolutions, is better understood as a symptom brought on by pre-existing social conditions. Periods of unrest in Newfoundland history are useful examples for understanding the way specific social conditions create an environment in which revolts are likely to occur – most notably the early 1930s, culminating in the famous riot at Colonial Building in St. John's that brought down the government of Sir Richard Squires.

Memorial University historian Sean Cadigan, in his latest book Death on Two Fronts, describes the stark social condition that existed in the country at the time. Poverty, unemployment, and corruption were widespread, and “the inability of the [Squires] government to calm social unrest arising from the acute public relief and debt crisis was the last straw in the collapse of responsible government.”
Runaway inflation, compounded by the onset of the Great Depression, made it increasingly difficult for people to keep up with the cost of living, and allegations of corruption against the Squires government became a catalyst for large numbers of people to take to the streets. The rioting, in this case, was not specifically caused by political issues or in support of one party over another, but was rather symptomatic of the underlying social conditions and general feeling of disaffection among the population.
Social context of present-day unrest
Recent research conducted by the New England Complex Systems Institute demonstrates that social unrest occurs because of specific conditions to do with the everyday lives of people, with a basic premise being that the cost of food can be used as metric for making predictions. Spikes in food prices, such as in 2011, can be seen to line up with the Arab Spring, and in 2013 and early 2014, global food prices have remained near the threshold identified in the report as precipitating unrest. The report notes:
We can understand the appearance of social unrest in 2011 based upon a hypothesis that widespread unrest does not arise from long-standing political failings of the system, but rather from its sudden perceived failure to provide essential security to the population. … Failure to provide security undermines the very reason for existence of the political system. Once this occurs, the resulting protests can reflect the wide range of reasons for dissatisfaction, broadening the scope of the protest, and masking the immediate trigger of the unrest.
An article by Nafeez Ahmed in the Guardian draws similar conclusions, expanding the analysis to include shifts in food prices and the cost of living due to instability in fossil fuel economies and the impact of climate change. Ahmed points out that in Ukraine, “food price shocks have impacted negatively on the country's grain exports, contributing to intensifying urban poverty,” something that is further intensified by “accelerated levels of inflation.” He goes on to point out that the situation is similar in Venezuela, which is suffering “ongoing food shortages driven by policy mismanagement along with 17 year record-high inflation due mostly to rising food prices.” In this way, the analysis, as with the one presented by the Complex Systems Institute, understands the current wave of global unrest as symptomatic of basic conditions to do with people's everyday lives.
Outcomes of Newfoundland 1930s unrest
Following significant unrest in the early 1930s, Newfoundland's democratic government collapsed and was replaced with an authoritarian regime, the Commission of Government. The belief of many powerful people of the day, including William Coaker, was that an authoritarian government modeled on Mussolini's Italy was best served to deal with the many social and political issues plaguing the country.
However, the commission was unable to effect any significant improvement in the lives of the people, even though it did try various economic and social policies. As Cadigan notes in Newfoundland and Labrador: A History, “the commission's social and administrative experiments did not improve the colonial economy,” and the government overlooked the wellbeing of workers and their families.
Although the commission was unable to solve the social issues that created the context for unrest, it was quite successful in containing protests and revolts through various authoritarian means. The Dept. of Justice files, held at the provincial archives, show evidence of a system of surveillance and subversion of dissident political organizations on a shocking scale (ask for GN 13, Box 155 if you're interested). At the same time, the police force and local militia was upgraded and expanded, and any public displays of dissent were met with harsh crackdowns. So even though the social context did not markedly change, the state was able to employ these authoritarian means to maintain public order.
Outcomes of present-day unrest
The structural failings of a globalized world present seemingly impossible problems for states to solve. What is needed is a paradigm shift, and this shift will have to entail movement away from fossil fuel economies and transnational food networks. However, many states are (arguably) beholden to corporate interests, and so it may seem like political suicide for parties and individual politicians to reign in big oil and agribusiness.
Looking at present-day examples of unrest and revolution, one does not see the underlying social conditions being addressed. A good example of this is Ukraine, which had a revolution in 2005 but is once again experiencing the same kind of social unrest in 2014. Likewise, Iceland had a revolution in 2009, but in early 2014 unrest re-emerged. Egypt, which has also had two revolutionary moments in quick succession, has nonetheless experienced ongoing turmoil since 2011. This recurrent (perhaps constant) unrest is indicative of a global system in entropy, a system that is unable to address the underlying social context of unrest.
Unfortunately, if governments are unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes, there are few tools in the kit other than authoritarian means, such as those employed in historical Newfoundland. While it is certainly the prerogative of angry and disaffected people to rise up against their governments, it is somewhat disconcerting how often this leads to more repressive forms of government. However, without taking real steps to address the social conditions that create the context for unrest, repression can only ever be a temporary “fix.”
Admittedly, this may sound somewhat alarmist, and in fact it is because I am genuinely alarmed. It is not that life today is necessarily so bad for people in Newfoundland, and it does not seem as though we are likely to see significant unrest any time soon. But what is alarming is the level of skepticism and denial that fundamental problems even exist, specifically in terms of the “business as usual” mentality of government and the moneyed class. What I see are vested interests that will fight against proactive steps to address the underlying conditions of crisis, and this leads down a path we have walked before. And so perhaps the sooner everyone gets a little bit alarmed the sooner we can have a discussion about how to avoid repeating the history of 1932.
Adelaide Archbishop Philip Wilson charged with concealing child sex abuse
Updated
Adelaide Catholic Archbishop Philip Wilson has been charged with concealing child sexual abuse.
The charges relate to Hunter region paedophile priest Jim Fletcher, who worked with the Archbishop in NSW in the 1970s.
Wilson announced in a statement he would take leave from his position after being notified of the charges filed against him by NSW Police.
NSW Police said its operation, Strike Force Lantle, launched in 2010, investigated allegations of concealment of serious offences related to child abuse by clergy "formerly and currently attached to the Maitland-Newcastle Diocese of the Catholic Church".
They alleged that Wilson, 64, concealed a serious offence.
He is due to appear in the Newcastle Local Court on April 30.
Wilson is a former Bishop of Wollongong, where he was known as a "healing bishop" for his handling of child-abuse scandals.
Wilson to 'vigorously defend innocence'
Wilson issued a statement acknowledging the charges filed against him by police.
"The suggestion appears to be that I failed to bring to the attention of police a conversation I am alleged to have had in 1976, when I was a junior priest, that a now deceased priest had abused a child," he said.
The statement said that the allegation was first brought to his attention last year and he "completely denied" it.
"I intend to vigorously defend my innocence through the judicial system and I have retained senior counsel, Mr Ian Temby AO, who will represent me in respect of it," Wilson said in a statement.
In the statement he referred to his participation at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in NSW and SA and said his evidence at the hearings was indicative of his efforts to "best-practice child protection measures".
"I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my commitment to dealing proactively with the issue of child sexual abuse and the implementation of best-practice child protection measures which I have pioneered since becoming a bishop," he said.
Important day for Australia: child abuse victim
A victim of Fletcher, Peter Gogarty, said he felt overwhelming relief that a police investigation had resulted in charges against the Catholic Archbishop.
"I think it's a very, very important day for Australia, that we've now had someone in such a high position charged," Mr Gogarty said.
"I hasten to add, everyone in this country is entitled to the presumption of innocence, but...the fact that our legal system has decided to charge someone this senior is enormously significant."
Pat Feenan's son Daniel was abused by Fletcher and said it had been a "long and hard journey" for him.
"I'm just very proud of my son and I'm proud of all the victims who have had the courage to stand up," Ms Feenan said.
"The fight's not over, the journey's not over, I'll keep working to support victims."

TORONTO -- The Kansas City Royals and Toronto Blue Jays have moved on: After an exchange of hit batters, they're now trading barbs on Twitter.
First, Blue Jays slugger Jose Bautista posted a message Sunday night saying he had "lost a lot of respect" for Ned Yost after hearing the Royals manager praise plate umpire Jim Wolf's handling of Sunday's game.
Just heard #NedYost comments about the game. Lost a lot of respect for that man today. — Jose Bautista (@JoeyBats19) August 2, 2015
Two Blue Jays batters were hit by pitches and reliever Aaron Sanchez was ejected for retaliating by hitting Kansas City infielder Alcides Escobar.
That prompted Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura to post tweets calling Bautista a "nobody" and accusing him of stealing signs. Ventura later deleted the messages.
Bautista took the high road when asked to respond to Ventura's comments Monday.
"He's a young player that could use some maturing," Bautista said. "Hopefully he focuses on playing the game and allowing his ability to create a name for himself."
Ventura apologized later Monday in a tweet to Bautista that was written in Spanish.
"At this moment I am realizing that rage sometimes takes over us as humans and that is what happened to me with the comment that I made about Jose whom is a great human being," he wrote. "I ask him and the fans for their forgiveness. They find themselves shocked with my actions and I am very regretful.
"We all make mistakes and we learn from them. We all know how my temperament can be and I am getting much better as a person. Because of that and this incident which by me apologizing does not make me less of a man for something that I did while being a hot head, I want to once again apologize and I would like to thank God whom gives me the capability to recognize my mistakes."
Bautista didn't back down from his remarks about Yost, calling the manager's praise of Wolf "ridiculous."
Wolf warned both benches after Royals pitcher Edinson Volquez hit Toronto's Josh Donaldson in the first inning of Sunday's game, a 5-2 Blue Jays win.
"I thought Jim Wolf did a tremendous job understanding the game, understanding what's intentional," Yost said Sunday, according to the Kansas City Star. "Was it intentional on their part to hit Esky? Absolutely."
Donaldson complained to Wolf after Volquez and reliever Ryan Madson missed high and inside later in the game. Madson also hit Toronto's Troy Tulowitzki. Neither pitcher was ejected.
Volquez responded after the game by calling Donaldson "a little baby."
"He got mad at everybody like he's Barry Bonds," Volquez said Sunday, according to the Star. "He's not Barry Bonds. He's got three years in the league. We've been around longer than he has."
Wolf ejected Sanchez after Escobar was hit on the thigh in the eighth, causing both benches and both bullpens to empty. Blue Jays manager John Gibbons, who had been ejected earlier for arguing with Wolf, returned to the field for the melee. No punches were thrown.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.
I freaking love greens. Collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens. I love them all. I've had some damn good greens in my life, but I've had some damn awful ones too. Good greens are hard to come by and the truth is it has taken me a loooonnnnggg time to get my recipe right. But in the end, I did it.
My wife even likes them too, actually begs for them and she's not a greens eater. Had too many bad ones I guess, but this is a winner.
I do use “cheater greens” in the bag, already chopped and bagged. Don't judge me.
So feel free to use whatever greens you can come across and if you're one of those people who are not sure about greens because you've had some bad ones, do give these a try. They're healthy, they're easy, and they're delicious.
I'm gonna give this to you in two ways, stove top and pressure cooker. To be honest, I can't really tell the difference taste-wise between the two. When I make them I do it on the stove. When the wife makes them she does it in the pressure cooker. Same thing except one takes more time.
SOUTHERN COLLARD GREENS
INGREDIENTS STOVETOP
1 bunch/bag of greens, rinsed trimmed and chopped
2 ham hocks or left over ham or you can leave it out if you want
2 – 10.5 ounce cans chicken broth
21 fluid ounces of water
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon cajun seasoning
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon salt
1.5 teaspoons black pepper
2.5 teaspoons sugar
DIRECTIONS
Place the greens and the ham hocks or ham pieces in a LARGE POT. Don't worry, it'll be fine. Mix in everything else. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for at least one hour. If after an hour they're tender, you're done. Depending on the greens, you may have to go longer. When done, taste and see if you need more honey.
INGREDIENTS PRESSURE COOKER [IP]
1 bunch/bag of greens, rinsed, trimmed and chopped
2 ham hocks or left over ham or you can leave it out if you want
2 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon cajun seasoning
2 teaspoons salt
1.5 teaspoons black pepper
2.5 teaspoons sugar
DIRECTIONS
Set your pot to sauté mode to get the pot warming up. Add the whole bag of greens. Yes, don't worry, it'll fit. I have a 6 quart and it fits. Fit what you can, shove it down, add more until it's all in there. In a measuring cup or bowl, put your chicken broth and all the other ingredients except the ham and stir. Pour it over the greens. Sit the ham pieces on top and press a little just to nestle them in there.
Pressure on high for 30 minutes with natural pressure release.
**NOTE: I like to freeze my left over sweet Christmas ham in portions to use in these greens. A sweet ham gives off a slight sweetness which I love. You can use ham steaks, smoked turkey legs, or bacon pieces if you want. I've made them without meat and they were great too.
Don't limit yourself on how you eat these, the possibilities are endless. I like them in a large bowl with tons of pot liquor so I can dip my cornbread in it. Or over rice. Or over rice or grits with a fried egg for breakfast. Make hash out of it. They are very versatile and they freeze really well!
Not sure how to make cornbread? I got you!

Nine separate Privacy Shield complaints against Facebook
Paul-Olivier Dehaye Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 18, 2017
I have just filed nine separate (US-CH) Privacy Shield complaints against Facebook with the Swiss data protection authority.
The requests are:
The links above point to my original exchange with Facebook. You can see the date of each post there.
These then became complaints with the Safe Harbor arbitrator/Privacy Shield mediator, TRUSTe, which has refused to act on these.
My TRUSTe dashboards. Those that I have not filed a complaint for, I have essentially won, except the request with TRUSTe itself for opening up of its API (I wonder why!)
These TRUSTe complaints were met, after exchanges over several months on the substance of the request, by a two-sided decision that Safe Harbor or Privacy Shield protections should not apply to the requested data.
TRUSTe stock refusal to initiate proceedings related to my complaints.
Note that my opinion on jurisdiction or relevance of Privacy Shield/Safe Harbor was never asked, that TRUSTe is supposed to be an independent mediator/arbitrator, and that it consulted privately with Facebook prior to dismissing my complaint, in violation of its own rules of procedure (this is itself a basis for a FTC complaint against the arbitrator, for deceptive commercial practices…).

There is no other way to put it: Former F.B.I. Director James Comey tragically botched the investigation into Hillary Clinton, no doubt playing a part in her losing and Donald Trump's being elected.
But it is also true that Comey may be a linchpin in undoing the mistake he made.
Trump was completely out of bounds when he fired Comey — the man who was leading an investigation into connections between Russia and the Trump campaign — and then bragged to the Russians about the firing.
Last month, The New York Times reported that Trump asked Comey “to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting.”
“ ‘I hope you can let this go,' the president told Mr. Comey, according to the memo.”
The question of whether Trump's ask, Comey's continuance and Trump's subsequent firing of Comey constitutes obstruction of justice looms large.
Dan Wallace shot to fame with his "for freedom" celebration after winning the 400m at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014
Olympic swimmer Dan Wallace has been suspended from the British and Scottish swimming programmes for three months after admitting to drink-driving.
British and Scottish Swimming called it "clearly unacceptable behaviour".
"It is with much regret that I was found to be driving under the influence of alcohol," said the 24-year-old, who trains at Stirling University.
"Not only have I let myself, my family and team-mates down, I have put others at risk and I am profoundly sorry."
In May 2014, the former Warrender Baths Club swimmer was arrested in Florida - where he was attending the state university - for urinating on a police car.
Later that year, Edinburgh-born Wallace became widely known for his yell of "for freedom" when he set a British record to win the 400m individual medley for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
Dan Wallace (second from the right) poses with (l to r) Stephen Milne, Duncan Scott and James Guy after winning Olympic silver for GB in the 4x200m freestyle relay final in Rio
He said at the time it was a "spur-of-the-moment thing", inspired by the film Braveheart, and nothing to do with the vote on Scottish independence that was soon to follow.
Wallace was part of the GB men's 4x200m silver medal-winning relay team at last year's Olympics in Rio.
In a statement, the Scot said: "I recognise that I am in a position of influence and this type of behaviour is not acceptable in any way, shape or form.
"I am now looking to rebuild trust in everyone who has supported me and put their faith in me, and will do whatever it takes to come through this a better, stronger person.
"I am deeply sorry."
Dan Wallace's achievements in the pool 2014 Commonwealth Games, Glasgow: 400m individual medley, gold; 200m individual medley, silver; 4x200m freestyle relay, silver 2015 World Championships, Kazan: 4x200m freestyle relay, gold 2016 Olympics, Rio: 4x200m freestyle relay, silver
A promise of support
British Swimming and Scottish Swimming say Wallace is banned from all national programmes until 12 September.
The organisations say he has also signed "a letter of intent outlining his commitment to work with the necessary support systems provided and reaffirming his responsibility to British Swimming, Scottish Swimming and the University of Stirling as an athlete".
British Swimming national performance director Chris Spice and Scottish Swimming director of performance Ally Whike said: "We can confirm that Dan Wallace has been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. This is clearly unacceptable behaviour from Dan and we are disappointed by his actions.
"Dan has publicly acknowledged the seriousness of his mistake and is accepting of the consequences that must follow. Together, we will now support him through this difficult period to try to get this young and talented man back on track."
Change sucks! Right? We know that's going through the heads of many people who just downloaded iTunes 11. The reality is that change is often great, but there is one thing we immediately missed in the new version of iTunes, and that's the sidebar. Fortunately, turning it back on is easy peasy.
First, let's look at iTunes 11 without the sidebar:

Note that our test system may show more or different columns than yours, but what you see in this screenshot is our iTunes 11 music library in "Songs" view, sorted by artist. The major difference from prior versions of iTunes is the lack of the sidebar that gave you quick access to all of your content.
Don't worry, it's still available! We just have to turn it on. To do so, go to the View menu and choose "Show Sidebar," as shown in the image below:

And there you go! Restoring some handy-dandy usability in iTunes 11 with a couple of clicks makes for a good day.
Chance Vought F7U Cutlass Carrier Jetfighter
In 1945, the German aircraft industry had built up a remarkable technical background of extremely advanced aerodynamic concepts during World War II.
With the fall of Germany this research material became available to
American designers toward the end of 1945.
Among the material was data on tailless aircraft from the German
Arado and Messerschmitt Company.
Guided by the German data, former Messerschmitt senior designer
W. Voigt, helped Chance Vought Company led to construct the highly
unconventional F7U Cutlass.
This unorthodox twin jet carrier fighter was proposed to the Navy
during a design competition in 1946.
The first flight was made on September 29, 1948,
Limited success and service, and a very bad safety record:
The main problem with the new fighter was the badly
underpowered engines.
If the F7U had had reliable and stronger engines the
history would have been quite different.
The full length leading edge slats made the Cutlass
almost stall proof and it could pull as many G's as the
pilot could stand — it would have been an interceptor
without peer, especially with an armament of 4 x 20mm
cannon and 4 x Sparrow air-to-air missiles
But solving the Cutlass problems were not the Change
Vought the greatest moments.
The placement of the cockpit was a massive obstacle
for pilot visibility during carrier launches and recoveries.
The unusually long nose gear put the pilot 15ft above
the ground was prone to folding and collapsing under
stress. The ejection seats were very unreliable
Aircraft parts, including the landing gear doors, were
known to fall off in-flight, and engine fires were also
common occurrences.
Use of the afterburners drained the central tank so fast
that it was possible to flame-out the engines just after
take-off even though the wing tanks of the F7U were full.
Nevertheless, the Cutlass made it aboard six carriers
for a total of seven cruises between 1955 and 1957
The Cutlass soon gained a number of nicknames, the
majority of which were very unsavoury, and for good
reason. The “Praying Mantis”, the “Gutless Cutlass” and the “Ensign Eliminator” were among the most popular ones, the latter owing to the high accident rate.
Unfortunately, its loss rate was very bad. More than 25% of all Cutlasses were lost in accidents in three years of service
In the end, the F7U was deemed to be unsatisfactory for fleet use and was stricken from Naval Air inventory in 1957.
Overall, 288 Cutlasses were finally procured by the Navy.

Digital security researchers say malware attack that spread from Ukraine appeared to be focused on damaging IT systems
A ransomware attack that affected at least 2,000 individuals and organisations worldwide on Tuesday appears to have been deliberately engineered to damage IT systems rather than extort funds, according to security researchers.
The attack began in Ukraine, and spread through a hacked Ukrainian accountancy software developer to companies in Russia, western Europe and the US. The software demanded payment of $300 (£230) to restore the user's files and settings.
The malware's advanced intrusion techniques were in stark contrast with its rudimentary payment infrastructure, according to a pseudonymous security researcher known as “the grugq”.
Is it safer to use an app or a browser for banking? Read more
The researcher said the software was “definitely not designed to make money” but “to spread fast and cause damage, [using the] plausibly deniable cover of ‘ransomware'”.
This analysis was supported by UC Berkley academic Nicholas Weaver, who told the infosec blog Krebs on Security: “I'm willing to say with at least moderate confidence that this was a deliberate, malicious, destructive attack or perhaps a test disguised as ransomware.”
The NotPetya malware is so-called because while it shares code with an earlier ransomware strain called Petya, it is “a new ransomware that has not been seen before”, according to security researchers at Kaspersky Lab. It requires infected users to send $300 in the cryptocurrency bitcoin to a payment address that appears hardcoded into the software.
The address for sending the payment and a 60-character, case-sensitive “personal installation key”, are only presented in text on the ransom screen, and require a confirmation email to be sent to an address hosted by the German email provider Posteo.
Posteo quickly closed the email account, meaning that even if victims paid, they would not be able to decrypt their computers.
“If this well-engineered and highly crafted worm was meant to generate revenue, this payment pipeline was possibly the worst of all options (short of ‘send a personal cheque to: Petya Payments, PO Box …'),” the grugq said.
In contrast to the payment infrastructure, the malware's infection techniques were described as “well-written”, using a number of different methods to ensure maximum damage to the networks it penetrates.
NotPetya, which uses the NSA hacking tool EternalBlue to enterWindows-operated machines with unpatched security, steals passwords in an attempt to gain administrator access over the entire network. It then begins spreading itself as a forced update to all machines on the network, before encrypting their hard drives.
But unlike WannaCry, the malware that powered a global ransomware attack last month, NotPetya does not contain code that enables it to leave a network once it has spread.
The majority of the infections – 60%, according to Kaspersky – are within Ukraine, where the accounting software which appears to have introduced the malware is one of two legally mandated software suites used to file taxes.
At least one of the major non-Ukrainian organisations affected, the Danish shipping firm Maersk, also appeared to use the software, according to a job posting shared on Twitter.
Ukraine has suggested Russia may have been behind the attack, which struck on the eve of Ukraine's constitution day, which celebrates the country's split from the Soviet Union. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2015 and pro-Russia separatists continue to fight government troops in the east of the country.
Kiev has previously blamed Russia for a series of cyber-attacks, which Russia denies. Russian companies were also hit by NotPetya, including the Rosneft oil company which said cash registers at some petrol stations were affected without offering further details.
Ukraine said on Wednesday it had contained the attack and “all strategic assets, including those involved in protecting state security, are working normally”.
Finding the perpetrator of the attack is difficult, said Mark McArdle, chief technical officer at cybersecurity firm eSentire. “Finding irrefutable evidence that links an attacker to an attack is virtually unattainable, so everything boils down to assumptions and judgment.”
The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “[The attack] again proves the Russian thesis that such a threat requires cooperation on the global level.”
”No absolute openness on ACTA,” says Commissioner Neelie Kroes in an article in Dutch. If this is indeed the official position of the Commission, it is very alarming.
Article 218 of the Lisbon Treaty (TFEU) says that when it comes to international negotiations,
10. The European Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure.
What part of that sentence does the Commission find hard to understand?
The Commission needs to clarify if it really intends to completely disregard the resolution adopted by a nearly unanimous Parliament last week.
Together with eight other members of the Green Group in the European Parliament, I have co-signed a written question to the Commission (pdf):
Statements by vice-President Neelie Kroes of the Commission concerning the negotiations on the ACTA agreement
In a Dutch newspaper interview the vice-President of the Commission and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda Neelie Kroes stated that the European Commission should not give response to the demand of Parliament for full transparency and openness concerning the negotiations on the ACTA agreement. Does the Commission concur with the statement, rendered by her vice-President, not to give response to Parliament's demand of full transparency and openness concerning the negotiations on the ACTA agreement?
Does the Commission concur with the view, of her vice-President, that certain information should remain undisclosed for Parliament?
Is the Commission aware of the fact that the aforementioned statement de facto implies that the Commission has to set aside its statutory obligation to inform Parliament fully, immediately and at all times, as promulgated in article 218 paragraph 10 TFEU?
Is the Commission furthermore aware that the aforementioned statement is in clear contradiction with the joint resolution ”on the transparency and state of play of the ACTA negotiations” adopted almost unanimously by Parliament.
Will the Commission issue a statement indicating its stance on transparency and openness relating to its (future) conduct in regard to the negotiations on the ACTA agreement? And if so, will this imply that the earlier differing opinions and statements rendered by her Commissioners should be considered as revoked?
These are very sharp questions, and they are meant to be. It will be very interesting to see what the Commission answers.

John Kerry advanced what he called a "clear and compelling" case that Syria was responsible for a chemical attack that killed nearly 1,500 people, in a statement on Friday that made clear the US was on the verge of military strikes against the Assad regime.
Speaking in a blunt term, the US secretary of state branded the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, a "thug and a murderer", and said the United States could not stand by and let a dictator get away with such serious crimes.
"History will judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turn a blind eye to a dictator's wanton use of weapons of mass destruction," Kerry said in a briefing to reporters at the state department in Washington.
Signals of an impending attack continued to build on Saturday. UN weapons inspectors left their Damascus hotel and their convoy headed via the Masnaa border crossing to neighbouring Lebanon, where they were seen arriving at Beirut international airport to take flights out of the region, according to Reuters and the Associated Press.
Speaking soon after Kerry, Barack Obama said that he was considering "limited, narrow action" against Syria. "We can not accept a world where women and children and innocent civilians are gassed on a terrible scale," he said.
Pointedly, Kerry made no mention of the decision by the British government to pull out of the coalition, after prime minister David Cameron lost a crucial vote in the House of Commons on Thursday. Instead, Kerry referred to France as the "oldest ally" of the US, after President François Hollande pledged support for military action against Syria.
As Kerry spoke, the White House released an unclassified four-page dossier. The assessment said the US intelligence community had "high confidence" that Assad's forces were behind the attack, which it said killed at least 1,429 Syrians, including at least 426 children.
Obama said the US did not intend to be dragged into Syria's civil war. "We're not considering any open-ended commitment," he said at a photo opportunity with Baltic leaders. "We're not considering any boots-on-the-ground approach."
The president conceded that many people, himself included, were "war-weary" after a decade of US military interventions, but added: "A lot of people think something should be done – but nobody wants to do it."
An attack could happen as soon as Saturday when UN weapons inspectors are due to leave Syria after their mission in the country was apparently cut short amid expectations of an attack. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, told security council members on Friday evening that it could be two weeks before the final results of their analysis is ready.
Late on Friday a sixth US warship joined five US cruise missile destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean. Officials said the USS San Antonio, an amphibious ship with several hundred US Marines on board, had arrived in the region for a different reason but given the current situation it was being kept near the destroyers "as a precaution", the Reuters news agency reported.
On Thursday the White House said any strikes would be "discrete and limited".
Kerry said there would be no boots on the ground and the attack would not be open-ended, "and it will not assume responsibility for a civil war that is already under way". He described a "limited and tailored response that a despot's flagrant use of chemical weapons will be held responsible".
He insisted the impending military action would not be a similar to conflicts in Libya, Afghanistan or Iraq, saying of the 2003 invasion of the last named: "We will not repeat that moment."
However, in a line reminiscent of George W Bush's "axis of evil", Kerry specifically mentioned a host of US enemies, saying Iran could be "emboldened" if the US did not act.
"It is about Hezbollah and North Korea and every other terrorist group that might ever again contemplate the use of weapons of mass destruction. Will they remember the Assad regime was stopped from those weapons' current or future use? Or will they remember that the world stood aside and created impunity?"
Kerry portrayed taking tough action as a matter of US credibility, saying other countries that might use chemical weapons were watching. "They want to see whether the United States and our friends mean what we say," he said. "It matters deeply to the credibility and the future of the United States of America and our allies."
The secretary of state, who along with Obama has been involved in an intense diplomatic offensive to garner support for the administration's Syria policy, sought to cast the planned action as having broad support. He mentioned an Arab League statement and quoted statements from the leaders of Australia and France.
In his statement Kerry gave the most detailed assessment yet of what happened on 21 August. He said Assad's forces had the largest stockpile of chemical weapons in the Middle East and had used them several times this year. The regime wanted to clear problematic Damascus suburbs of opposition forces and had grown "frustrated", he said.
"We know that three days before the attack the Syrian regime's chemical weapons personnel were on the ground in the area making preparations," Kerry said.
He claimed Syrian forces took precautions such as putting on gas masks before the attacks.
"We know that these were specific instructions. We know where the rockets were launched from and at what time; we know where they landed and when. We know rockets came only from regime-controlled areas and went only to opposition-controlled or contested neighbourhoods." Thirty minutes later "all hell broke loose" on social media, Kerry said.
Kerry chose highly emotive language to describe the aftermath of the attacks, painting a vivid scene of "twitching bodies" and victims "foaming at the mouth", all captured in video posted online. "Instead of being tucked safely in their beds at home we saw rows of children, lying side by side, sprawled on a hospital floor – all of them dead from Assad's gas, and surrounded by parents and grandparents who had suffered the same fate."
The secretary of state sought to reassure the public that the intelligence, which has come under growing scrutiny in recent days, was reliable. "This is common sense," he said. "This is evidence. These are facts."
Kerry added that it was in the interests of the world to punish Assad but repeatedly cast the impending action as a matter of US credibility. "If we choose to live in a world where a thug and a murderer like Bashar al-Assad can gas thousands of his own people with impunity, even after the United States and our allies said no, and then the world does nothing about it, there will be no end to the test of our resolve, and the dangers that will flow from those others who believe they can do what they will."
Meanwhile, senior administration officials pressed the case against Syria in a telephone briefing for journalists. "I don't think there's any doubt to the world that a chemical weapons attack took place given the thousands of sources," one said on the call.
The senior officials were authorised by the White House to speak on condition of anonymity. On Thursday White House deputy spokesman Josh Earnest had discouraged reporters from trusting anonymous administration sources, saying they should "place more credibility in on-the-record statements".
One of the officials said: "We feel like our case is strong, our case is clear: the Assad regime is responsible for this mass casualty chemical weapons attack."
Kerry's remarks came five days after he first signalled the US was planning to take tough action against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons in Damascus. Kerry and Obama have been involved in an intense round of diplomacy over the last week, seeking to conjure international backing for a tough response against Syria. However they are faced with launching a military assault with less support than George W Bush received for the 2003 war in Iraq.
Three out of the five permanent members of the UN security council, the only international authority that can sanction military action that is not in a nation state's self-defence, now oppose action.
Russian and Chinese opposition was widely expected. But the vote in the British parliament on Thursday came as a deep surprise to Washington, which appears to have taken for granted that London, which has spent months lobbying for tough action on Syria, would support strikes.
The White House has indicated it does not believe it needs the backing of Congress, nor the support of traditional allies, before taking action against Assad.
France is the only major power that has indicated it would support force against Syria. Hollande told Le Monde on Friday that France wants "proportional and firm action", adding that the chemical weapons attack in Syria "cannot and must not remain unpunished".
Germany has ruled out backing military action against Syria and it was not clear whether the US had significant support from the region, although the Arab League strongly condemned the Syrian regime.
Late on Thursday the administration held a conference call with congressional leaders and the chairs and ranking members of relevant committees. The White House said the call was to "to brief them on the administration's thinking and seek their input" on what to do about Syria.
Reports said senior administration officials assured members of Congress that there was "no doubt" Assad's forces were responsible for the chemical attack. Sixteen members of Congress asked questions during the 90-minute call; 11 apparently did not.
Administration officials, while pledging to work with Congress, were non-committal about whether a strike requires legislative approval, a longstanding tension between the congressional and executive branches of the US government.
There were few signs of a consensus emerging from the meeting. Democratic Senator Carl Levin, the chairman of the armed services committee, was notably more cautious than the administration's position. "I have previously called for the United States to work with our friends and allies to increase the military pressure on the Assad regime by providing lethal aid to vetted elements of the Syrian opposition," Levin said after the call.
"Tonight I suggested that we should do so while UN inspectors complete their work and while we seek international support for limited, targeted strikes in response to the Assad regime's large-scale use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people."
Eliot Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, said after the call that Obama was "still weighing his options and will continue to consult with Congress". Engel said he was persuaded that Assad's forces used chemical weapons "intentionally" against Syrian civilians on 21 August.
Politico reported that Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress and a former House speaker, pressed Obama on the phone call to "do something" in response to the chemical attack.
Yet even some typically hawkish Republicans are balking at intervening in Syria. Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate armed services committee, issued a statement ahead of the call rejecting a Syria strike, partly on the grounds that Obama's Pentagon budget cannot afford it, and questioning the utility of a limited attack.
"It is vital we avoid shortsighted military action that would have little impact on the long-term trajectory of the conflict," Inhofe said. "We can't simply launch a few missiles and hope for the best."
More than 200 members of Congress, mostly Republicans, have signed a letter rejecting military action without the explicit permission of Congress.
Update from Detroit police chief
DETROIT, MI - Two Detroit police officers have been suspended after failing to report that they were in a high-speed chase that ended with the death of a 19-year-old man.
Detroit Police Department Chief James Craig tells the Detroit News that he doesn't have the power to suspend without pay but, "I can request it -- and because of the egregious nature of this case, I'm going to request it."
The chief told the newspaper that he only found out about the high-speed chase after he "pressed" - after he was left in the dark about the details behind Jerry Bradford Jr.'s death. The incident happened after 10:30 p.m. Monday night, when the 19-year-old is said to have sped away after officers attempted to pull him over and eventually fatally crashed into a tree.
The first reports of the crash directly mention that "police did not give chase" before the car crashed into a tree.
Craig said neither of the special operations officers disclosed the chase as recently as Tuesday morning and even said there doesn't seem to be a reason that the car was pulled over in the first place.
The department has launched a criminal investigation into the matter.
Love Jihad: How Kerala's gift to India was lapped up by the ISIS
India
oi-Vicky
By Vicky
The menace of Love Jihad is back. In Kerala where the problem is immense has prompted several organisations to set up helplines to save women falling prey to love jihad. Not just Hindus, but even Christians have been complaining of girls falling prey to love jihad.
In Kerala, the CPI(M) has termed this concept as a Sangh propaganda in a bid to expand their vote bank. The issue of Love Jihad is however not new to Kerala. It has been rampant since 2012. In that year itself there were an estimated 2,268 cases reported.
On May 24th, the Kerala High Court annulled a wedding between Shefin Jahan, a Muslim man, and Hadiya, a formerly Hindu woman who converted to Islam. The court said that Hadiya (previously called Akhila) could not be married without the "active involvement" of her parents. It also ordered the police to conduct a probe into suspected conversions of Hindu women by groups linked to the Islamic State.
Rewind 2012:
It was in the year 2012 that for the first time cases of love jihad came to the forefront. An Intelligence Bureau official during one of my visits to Kerala back in 2011 had warned that such a concept was getting rampant. None in the Indian media took the warning seriously and felt that it was some sort of propaganda.
A year later a lady and her husband were questioned by the police. It was learnt that she was forcibly converted to Islam and married off. It is this case which became the basis of a full-fledged investigation. It was learnt that there were at least 2,268 cases of love jihad across the country with a majority of them being reported from Kerala itself.
WikiLeaks had published a report by United States diplomats that stated, 'Both Hindu and Christian groups have expressed fear and outrage at the plot, while Muslim groups have felt the need to defend their co-religionists against the conspiracy theorists'.
The report said, 'The Commission for Social Harmony and Vigilance of the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council had reported that there had been 2,868 female victims of love jihad in Kerala between 2006 and 2009. The panel had made several recommendations to parents through its newsletter, including a recommendation to monitor children's cell-phones and computers, so that they can be better prepared to fight the phenomenon and resist charming young Muslim men involved in the scheme'.
The Kerala high court had also taken note of the matter and asked the police to investigate the cases of two college-going girls, who were allegedly forced to convert to Islam after marrying Muslim men. Some police officials, political leaders and prominent members of both Hindu and Christian communities continue to suspect that 'forced conversions', backed by foreign funds, was rampant in the state.
According to the police in Kerala, in most cases of 'love jihad', the victims are merely used as pawns in criminal activities. Many of the victims have no idea what they are getting into and often get into lured by the young men. But the police also point out that only some -- not all -- of the nearly 2,000 recorded cases of conversion are a result of 'love jihad'.

From Chronicles:
Benjamin Franklin's American Dream
Steve Sailer – DECEMBER 12, 2014
Today's preferred way to think about immigration and the nation-state is exemplified in the title of a 1964 pamphlet that the Anti-Defamation League published posthumously under the name of John F. Kennedy: A Nation of Immigrants. The next year, the martyred President's brother Teddy had his name put on the 1965 immigration act of such large and unforeseen consequence.
The pages of JFK's little book are seldom read anymore, but its mantra of a title has proved wildly successful at sacralizing mass immigration as some kind of hereditary national onus. “My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. . . . That's the tradition we must uphold. That's the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come,” orated President Barack Obama as justification for his November 2014 demand that, when it comes to immigration, America must have a government of men and not of laws.
While the Preamble states that the Constitution is ordained so that “We the People of the United States” can “secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,” the concept of posterity has vanished from respectable immigration discourse. The Obama amnesty invokes a civil right to be here that illegal aliens inherit, but not from their ancestors: Like insanity, amnesty is hereditary; you get it from your children. After all, we live in an age of globalism and minoritarianism: The 300 million American citizens are the majority, while the 7 billion foreigners are the minority.
This slogan of a Nation of Immigrants has not proved terribly productive intellectually, fostering not unsentimental scholarship but schmaltzy ancestor worship. For example, when it was revealed in the press last year that Dr. Jason Richwine had earned his Harvard Ph.D. by quantitatively analyzing the achievements of Hispanics over multiple generations, finding that today's illegal-alien “Dreamers” and their children were unlikely to live up to the fond hopes so casually invested in them, he was immediately shoved out of his job at a conservative think tank.
In sharp contrast to this dead end for scholarship, Benjamin Franklin's arguments in favor of immigration restrictions were influential on the central avenue of Anglo-American thought in the human sciences.
Franklin's 1751 pamphlet Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind offered a workable strategy for America's future. These 24 numbered paragraphs were the cogent cornerstone of Franklin's audacious scientific-strategic theory for the peopling of America, an interlocking series of arguments about how the world would work. Sociologist Dennis Hodgson observes that, in Observations, “Policy did not flow from theory[;] theory flowed from policy.” But the policy Franklin advocated was so fruitful over the next two centuries that the theory deserves respect.
Hodgson explains Ben Franklin's American Dream:
Living in the mid-eighteenth century, [Franklin] had a vision of a middle-class society that was necessarily one in which the majority owned and worked their own lands. . . . His dream was of a prosperous and middle-class America, peopled largely by the English, that spanned a continent and confidently assumed a preeminent place among nations.
In 1964, four decades after mass immigration had been shut down, the country looked rather like Franklin's vision. But the mechanisms Franklin had identified as crucial to American happiness have been increasingly forgotten during the ensuing Nation of Immigrants nostalgiafest.
This Founding Father's insights on population and immigration are so out of fashion as to make his entire perspective almost incomprehensible to mainstream minds. For example, in his bestselling 2003 biography Benjamin Franklin: An American Life, the intelligent establishmentarian Walter Isaacson (the authorized biographer of Steve Jobs) issues a few baffled apologies for this epoch-making essay, then quickly moves on to more congenial matters.
"Put all your Internets together into one big Internet!" - Engadget
"I backed Dispatch and can't wait to use it" - Palmer Luckey, Founder, Oculus
“Connectify has already had some incredible success…the same type of success is only sure to follow with Dispatch.” - TechCrunch
"Dispatch is especially useful for [BitTorrent users]" - BitTorrent Inc.
"Connectify combines Wi-Fi, 4G into a superfast wireless pipe." - GigaOM
"10 Internet connections at the same time!?" - Slashdot
"This has the potential of disrupting the entire telecommunications industry" - PandoDaily
The Problem
We all need faster Internet connections — to get our work done quicker, our game on sooner, and access to our downloads as soon as possible, no matter where we are.
Since Wi-Fi networks are popping up just about everywhere, and many of us also carry around mobile broadband devices that offer 3G/4G access on-the-go, we started to wonder: with so much bandwidth available across our networks and devices, why are we still left choosing only one Internet connection at a time?
The Solution
Connectify Dispatch is groundbreaking PC software that lets you connect to all available Internet connections simultaneously.
For the first time, you can connect to the coffee shop Wi-Fi and your 4G mobile device, using both Internet connections for their combined speed, and increased reliability. With Connectify Dispatch, you can even use two different Wi-Fi networks at the same time. Just connect a secondary USB Wi-Fi card (complimentary for $100+ backers), in addition to your laptop's on-board Wi-Fi card, and Dispatch does the rest. At the click-of-a-button, you'll be cruising the web at warp speed, using the combined throughput of both wireless networks. Even if you lose connectivity on one of those networks, Dispatch keeps you online, seamlessly moving all of your traffic onto the working connection until both networks become available again.
Connectify Dispatch is especially handy for the millions of BitTorrent users out there. With each Internet connection you add, Dispatch can double, or even triple the speed of your BitTorrent transfers. In fact, the more Internet connections you have, the faster you'll go!

Why Kickstarter?
Knowing a little bit about us will go a long way in explaining why we're hoping to “kickstart” this project. Back in 2009, our small team of developers came up with the idea for Connectify Hotspot, an easy-to-use app that would let anyone transform their laptop into a Wi-Fi Hotspot at the click-of-a-button. Back then, there was no big product launch when we released Connectify Hotspot 1.0; we just quietly made the software available on our little corner of the Internet. But, when Slashdot caught wind of our product, then Lifehacker, GigaOM, and virtually every other tech blog, we went from being a small group of software developers and designers, to a real-deal “company” overnight.
The do-it-yourself ethic is still a huge part of our company DNA, here at Connectify. So, when lightning struck with the idea for Connectify Dispatch, we immediately jumped into action, coding up a bare-bones “alpha” version of the application, just to prove that it could work. Sure, there are hardware solutions for “load-balancing” multiple Internet connections, but those devices can cost upwards of $10,000. With Connectify Dispatch, we want to, once again, take gee-whiz technology out of the hands of IT folks, and make it available to everyone, wrapped in an elegant, easy-to-use interface, and affordably priced at $59.99. And since we're trying to bring the Connectify Dispatch technology to you, we think it makes perfect sense to develop Dispatch with your help.
What If We Meet (or Beat) Our Goal?
We've already met our $50,000 project goal, so all of our backers can look forward to a sleek, user-friendly version of Connectify Dispatch for Windows 7/XP/Vista. However, there's even more in store if we beat our goal. We're still a very small team (as far as startups go, anyway), but with some added resources and a few extra hands on deck, we'll be able to go above-and-beyond with Connectify Dispatch.
$65,000 Stretch Goal: Dispatch Analytics Dashboard - SUCCESS!
You've unlocked the powerful Dispatch Analytics Dashboard. Connectify Dispatch will now include a sleek dashboard, offering users detailed statistics and graphs with metrics on each available Internet connection.

$75,000 Stretch Goal: Avoid Common Problems with Internet Connections - SUCCESS!
Our Kickstarter backers really are a part of the Connectify Dispatch development process! Yesterday, we asked backers what features they'd like to see implemented into the software, and they overwhelmingly responded to a new feature that automatically avoids slow DNS servers to keep things moving super-fast! And, as soon as the $75,000 stretch goal is unlocked, we'll be able to make this power-feature a reality.
$85,000 Stretch Goal: Metered Connections - SUCCESS!
The second-most requested feature from our backer survey has arrived. Now Dispatch users will have the ability to set data caps on individual connections. For example, you will be able to easily set Dispatch to only use 3 gigabytes per month through that expensive 4G modem.
$100,000 Stretch Goal: Application-Aware Connection Selection - SUCCESS!
Dispatch will now be packing even more punch, letting users control which individual programs utilize each Internet connection. With 'Application-Aware Connection Selection,' you can tell Dispatch to never use the office Internet for your BitTorrent downloads, or always use your home's Ethernet connection for your video game's traffic. We've got you covered!

Sometimes, the men are so excited they come dressed as their favourite pony, trotting around the shop before buying the newest volume of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic , based on the children's television show.
Every weekend, a group of men eagerly climb the narrow stairs leading to Silver Snail comics in Toronto, where the latest adventure of cute ponies can be found.
The show, produced by Hasbro and originally targeted toward young girls, has many fans, the oddest to outsiders being Bronies, the adult, male fan base that feels misunderstood.
Reaction to their love of the show usually ranges from disbelief to outright criticism and judgment, suspicion even that there's a sexual nature to their obsession. Not so, they say — they're just, in one word, nerds.
Of late, Bronies have been invading the show's newest spinoff, a movie being screened before its summer release.
Bronies, 18 or older, live and breathe My Little Pony — they buy merchandise, discuss the show's animation, plot and characters online, and attend conventions, similar to ComicCon conventions or the FanExpo.
“We filled most of the theatre,” says Alexander Blake, 18, who joined a group of about 40 Bronies recently for a screening of My Little Pony: Equestria Girls in AMC theatres at Yonge St. and Dundas St. W.
Blake says a startled mother in the theatre with her young daughter curiously asked if he was lost, so he explained the Brony fandom to her.
“She was surprised,” says Blake, who is studying computer engineering at Sheridan College and has spent at least $400 on toys, shirts and comics. “But it's not like any other kids show.”
The show dates back to the 1980s, but only gained its Brony following after being revamped in 2010 by animator Lauren Faust, known for her refusal to propagate stereotypical gender roles (think Barbie).
Faust (who wasn't part of the movie team and has left the show) injected her unique animation into the series — adored by Brony artists in online forums — and wrote a gender neutral show that teaches lessons of friendship, a concept both children and Bronies relate to.
Marsha Redden, a psychologist in Louisiana, has been conducting a study of Bronies, through interviews, and a survey now with 30,000 respondents.
She's found Bronies, usually single, computer-savvy men struggling socially, get three uses out of the show: Socializing, escape/avoidance and conflict resolution.
Shy men credit the show with helping them break out of their shells, especially through meet-ups with other Bronies; others escape through the show's fantasy and some apply its lessons in life, like how to deal with being bullied, says Redden.
“Each episode teaches a lesson,” says Redden. “It comes down to What Would a Pony Do.”
Calvin Horne, 25, moved to Halifax three years ago from Calgary to study computer and information systems and credits the show with allowing him to build a group of new friends.
“I don't think people should find it weird because the show is as much for kids as it is for adults,” he says. “There's a little bit of something in there for everyone.”
Hasbro knows how diverse the show's audience is — men's swim trunks are the hottest product at Hot Topic in the Eaton Centre — so the movie has subtleties only an older audience would grasp, as does the television show.
Some parents including Jennifer Gilbert, whose 7-year-old daughter watches the show, believe it's sometimes too mature for young children.
“It goes over her head, but she likes all the colours,” she says. “I wouldn't say it's inappropriate, but it's kind of a teenage kids kind of thing.”
Gilbert, who had never heard of Bronies, says the show is still better than other “preteen” shows that simply push female stereotypes, but she won't be taking her daughter to see the movie.
In the movie, the main pony Twilight turns into a teenage girl, much to the chagrin of some Bronies and an attempt by Hasbro to market a new line of toys to tween girls.
Gilbert worries the human version of Twilight will be stereotypical, and feels uncomfortable in a theatre full of men watching a children's show.
But Horne, who has attended the BronyCon convention in the U.S., says Bronies aren't a threat, they're just fanatic fans like any comic nerds, part of a fandom quickly growing.
The January 2012 BronyCon had 800 attendees, which rose to 4,000 that summer and is expected to rise to 6,000 this summer, says Horne.
Plans to bring a large scale convention to Toronto are in the works by a group of fans following news that the first-ever BronyCon will hit Canada this summer in Vancouver.
Mike Brookhoff recently helped produce a documentary about the Brony phenomenon and says My Little Pony helps fill a gap for some men.
“They're getting a message from it they're not getting anywhere else,” he says, adding the new movie is “a pretty big departure” from the original show and clearly an attempt to broaden the franchise and audience.
“There's always a divide between animators and marketers,” he says.
Bronies, who feared the movie wouldn't stay true to the morals of the show, say the core values remain despite the main pony turning into a human.
“I thought it was a strange direction to take,” says Horne, who went with a group of Bronies to watch it in Nova Scotia. “But the stories still had all the points that drew the people into show to begin with.”
Stories of inclusion, friendship and tolerance — some traits Bronies wish would be applied to them when people react to their love of My Little Pony by calling it “weird” and “bizarre,” says Horne.
“It'd definitely be nice if people had a more open attitude toward us,” he says.
Since the Crimea crisis of February 2014, the Obama administration has tried to use sanctions to persuade Russia to change its course on foreign policy. But for reasons that would seem irrational by Western standards, the Kremlin is increasingly impervious to business or economic considerations. In describing the difference between American and Russians, Putin recently referenced a quote in "Gone with the Wind" where the American heroine states that she cannot imagine starving. Putin went on to say that, "in the concept of a Russian person there are objectives [other than starvation]." In a similar vein, reflecting on international sanctions Russia's deputy prime minister recently told the World Economic Forum that the Russian people will go through any misery -- "tighten our belt, eat less food, suffer any privations" -- in order to defend their president and country against aggression by the West. Economic sticks and carrots have had and will continue to have a limited impact on Russia. For Putin and his advisers politics matters above all else.
Moscow's current approach runs counter to Washington's focus on the economy. Former U.S. President Calvin Coolidge famously stated that "the chief business of the American people is business." In more recent times, when then-governor Bill Clinton ran for president, his campaign advisor James Carville famously coined the phrase "It's the economy, stupid" to divert the electorate's attention from his candidate's perceived weakness in other areas, such as national security and foreign policy; the strategy worked. In every presidential election we rediscover that in the vast majority of instances, the issue that above all else (including national security) dominates the thinking of the American electorate is the economy.
Under Putin, the business of Russia has completely become politics. International politics is all about power and influence, even if the Russian economy suffers as a result. In fact, while Putin's regime has weathered the economic storm that came about as a result of sanctions, the only ones that have suffered have been the Russian people: their income declined by roughly 12 percent between 2013 and 2014; it then declined an astounding 34 percent between 2014 and 2015. The Kremlin, meanwhile, has remained steadfast in its general approach to Ukraine.
Moscow's approach to the Middle East reflects the same mentality. In July 2015 the Public Investment Fund - the sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia -- announced that it had agreed to invest $10 billion in Russia. This was the largest ever foreign direct investment deal in Russia's history. This money was to be spent on agricultural projects, medicine, logistics, and the retail and real estate sectors. Riyadh's intention to invest in Russia was above all strategic: Before the deal Saudi King Salman talked with Putin over the phone about ways to bridge their differences over the Syrian civil war and the regime of President Bashar Assad. Since the start of the war, Riyadh has supported the mainly Sunni opposition to Assad, while Moscow has come out on the opposite end -- in support of Assad's regime, thus allied with Iran, also a Saudi opponent. Saudi Arabia's historic investment in Russia was an attempt to bring the Kremlin closer to Riyadh's side.
In June 2015, Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud, Saudi deputy crown prince and defense minister, visited Russia during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, where the investment was initiated with a memorandum of understanding, and took part in a meeting between Putin and global investment head funds. This was not the first time that Riyadh tried to use economic diplomacy toward strategic ends. In a 2013 meeting between Putin and Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia offered to buy $15 billion worth of Russian arms and pledged not to challenge Russian gas sales in Europe. In return, the Kremlin was to ease its support of Assad and agreed not to block any U.N. Security Council Resolutions on Syria.
However, recent evidence shows that Riyadh's economic diplomacy has failed. Just a few months after Riyadh's historic investment, the Kremlin doubled down on its strategy in Syria and announced that it will be conducting airstrikes in support of the Assad regime. Given Russia's current economic difficulties, Saudi Arabia's historic investment should have budged the Kremlin at least a bit on Syria - and would have in any other country on earth. But in Russia it did not.
What the financial dealings between Riyadh and Moscow also indicate is the resilience of Putin's geopolitical moves and countermoves that serve to check both Western and Saudi ambitions. With Riyadh deeply involved in the Yemen crisis -- where it is backing forces fighting the Iranian-allied Houthi movement -- Moscow appears to have enough breadth in its foreign policy to negotiate arms deals with Gulf states while openly supporting a regime in Syria that they deem undesirable. Putin also demonstrated that he can hedge his bets simultaneously against the West in Ukraine and against a group of Arab nations.
Such actions are reinforced by the currently trending desire in Washington to stay away from any direct involvement in the Middle East, where "leading form behind" places greater burden on Washington's regional allies and forces them to find greater wiggle room amid less-than-perfect choices. In the hope of getting the Kremlin's support on geopolitical issues, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries have in recent years increased their investments in Russia. Again, despite the infusion of foreign investment, Moscow has not made any real political concessions in return.
Washington should reconsider its approach to Russia. Obama's strategy has been to put economic pressure on Putin in the hope that his regime will change course on Ukraine. The Saudi strategy was essentially the flip side of the same coin, focused on providing economic incentives in the hope of bringing about a favorable political outcome in Syria. Such moves have not worked: Russia has not budged on Ukraine, while in Syria the promise that Moscow will join the global coalition to counter the Islamic State has turned out to be an illusory one. If the United States hopes to deter Moscow from pursuing policies that clash with Western interests and persuade it to truly join the global fight against ISIS, it should first recognize that the Kremlin's center of gravity is politics, not economics. Policies that address Putin's political calculus will succeed; those that provide economic incentives or disincentives will not.

Nearly 45 per cent of all eligible ballots have been cast and screened by Elections B.C. as of Wednesday.
The Village of Belcarra is the municipality with the highest ballot returns for the upcoming transit plebiscite at 57.5 per cent.
Meanwhile, the City of Surrey and Metro Vancouver Electoral Area A AGE trailing the pack at 39.5 per cent and 38.9 per cent respectively.
A majority of 50 per cent plus one will be considered decisive for the question: "Do you support a new 0.5 per cent Metro Vancouver Congestion Improvement Tax, to be dedicated to the Mayors' Transportation and Transit Plan? Yes or No."
CBC will update this map weekly to show how many ballots have been mailed into Elections B.C., as well as map the results by voting municipalities when they are released this summer. The map below shows the latest voting information for May 27.
While the results will be posted by municipality, it is the total number of votes that will ultimately determine the outcome of the plebiscite.
Note: This data from Elections B.C. shows the number of ballot packages received and processed by Elections B.C. as of May 20. It does not include ballot packages in the mail or those that have been received but not processed.
Metro Vancouver mayors have said the annual revenue of the tax — estimated at $250 million — would be used to fund part of a 10-year transit plan including the following projects:

Florida Center for Investigative Reporting
The Florida Department of Environmental Protection is not enforcing laws against companies responsible for hazardous materials pollution or collecting the fines it could from polluters, according to a study released Thursday by an environmental group.
The report, by the Florida chapter of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, examined several years of public records and found that DEP enforcement efforts have been significantly scaled back. Enforcement cases filed by the agency have declined 82 percent since 2011. Hazardous waste assessments, in which the department has found a violation against a perpetrator, have declined 80 percent since 2010.
Some hazardous waste permit holders “have never been inspected before, ever,” said Jerry Phillips, director of Florida PEER and a former enforcement attorney for DEP.
The PEER report states that under Gov. Rick Scott the department's policy has been to work with polluters to bring them into compliance rather than punish them. DEP claimed in 2012 that this “compliance assistance strategy” had resulted in hazardous waste non-compliance rates dropping from 10 percent to 2 percent. The PEER report states that the public records substantiating this statement were requested and that the DEP provided a spreadsheet that did not have enough details to support the claim.
A DEP spokesperson told the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting that the agency would not respond until state officials had reviewed the report. (This item will be updated with DEP's response when available.)
The laws regulating hazardous material handling and their disposal were established in the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for enforcing the law. The PEER report states that the EPA delegated permitting and enforcement powers to DEP in a 2014 agreement. In exchange, DEP received $2.8 million in 2015 for enforcement.
“It's taxpayer money that's not being spent very well,” Phillips said.
PEER's report includes 10 case studies of companies that were caught violating the law and the lax enforcement they faced.

Marko Grujic has confessed a conversation with Jurgen Klopp helped him realise what his 'shortcomings' as a player are.
The Reds signed Grujic from Red Star Belgrade in January, but the midfielder was then sent back to his native Serbia where he spent the rest of the season on loan.
He rejoined the squad for the new Premier League season but has been afforded just 29 minutes of top flight action thus far.
The youngster has been on the subs bench for six of Liverpool's seven games so far, but did make an impressive debut in their victory over Derby County in the EFL Cup.
The Serbian spoke to Zurnal and said: “Coach Jurgen Klopp has a clear plan for me. I'm constantly talking with him and his assistant Zeljko Buvac, I am aware that I need to improve my game on the defensive side. Shortcomings in this part of my game originated from Red Star since last summer, when I played in the position behind the striker.”
Grujic made 41 appearances for Red Star Belgrade and enjoyed a breakthrough year last term. Klopp paid a reported £5.1m for the youngster to make him his first signing at Anfield back in the New Year.
He also has three caps for Serbia after progressing through the various younger age groups.
Liverpool have emerged as serious title contenders this year and wins on the road over Arsenal and Chelsea have led to increased optimism around Anfield. Jurgen Klopp is in his first full season in charge of Liverpool and his high energy style already appears to be embedded in the team's DNA.

On September 17, FaZe Clan won ESL One New York with the most brutal display of power in modern CS:GO history. The championship followed a sequence of events which set the stage for the team behind Karrigan and brewed such a perfect storm, that anything but gold for FaZe would've been a disappointment.
* * *
The blank stares at the monitors and the hesitant handshakes with the adversary are unmistakable gestures. They are the heralds of defeat. If for most people in Krakow July 18 was just another Tuesday, to FaZe Clan it brought nothing but anguish and disappointment. As the players and fans watched FlipSid3 Tactics's electronic frag FaZe's IGL karrigan as he approached Bombsite A on Mirage, they knew it was all over. The frag spelled a final score of 16-10 and the elimination of FaZe from the Major. The arguable second best team in the world at the time had finished second to last after a run few could fathom.
It really made no sense, considering the extent of FaZe's metamorphosis in 2017. After the acquisition of the G2 Esports roster brought them zero results for the majority of 2016, the org needed to make a change and looked to the upper echelons of CS:GO to see who they can acquire. In October, Karrigan was brought in as IGL from Astralis and the difference could be immediately felt. The team that was failing everywhere and everything, qualifiers included, was now making deep runs. Four semi-final finishes were taken in the span of a month, including ELEAGUE Season 2 and IEM Oakland, stacked tournaments both.

In February 2017, FaZe rescued Bosnian star NiKo from a bitter life in mousesports, where the outstanding rifler was caught in the bad dream of outfragging everyone in the server, but still losing maps more often than not. As with the acquisition of Karrigan, another spike in performance happened. With NiKo on the frontline, FaZe made the finals of every tournament they entered, bar ESL Pro League Season 5, which is where they hit a new ceiling. With the exception of StarSeries Season 3, FaZe lost every one of those finals. Although these losses came from reigning Major champions Astralis and the steam-rolling SK Gaming, who then were already considered the best team in the game, one out of four was not a record Karrigan and co would have liked to see.
A loss to SK Gaming at ESL One Cologne -- the last big tournament before the Major -- stopped FaZe from making it to their sixth grand final this season but that was but a small setback and didn't shake the team's authority that much, even though it was their only “weak” event since NiKo's acquisition. Krakow was still in sights, FaZe were comfortably a top 3 team in the world (arguably second behind SK Gaming) and all those lost grand finals would not matter should the org conquer the pinnacle of CS:GO.
Therefore, when FaZe recorded their biggest flop the whole year and placed 15th between Vega Squadron and PENTA Sports, the aftertaste of the silver became that much more bitter.
FaZe needed another shuffle. Fans and pundits looked for reasons to explain FaZe's tragic showing in Krakow and they didn't have to search very far. kioShiMa easily stood out as a subpar team-mate with a catastrophic 0.61 rating in the Major, the second worst in the entire tournament. Karrigan also struggled to make a difference and finished with an equally bad 0.62, and although that placed him third worst, part of the blame he endured was absolved due to his role within the team.
FaZe's solution to the string of silver and subsequent Major flop was at the same time logical and every CS:GO's fan's wet dream. Finnish AWPer allu was released as veteran GuardiaN was acquired from Natus Vincere. KioShiMa was gone, too, as many predicted, and was replaced by the living legend olofmeister, a veteran playmaker and an emblem of the Fnatic era. This was a line-up engineered to win tournaments in dominant fashion, a tour de force of Counter-Strike.

* * *
When such a line-up is compiled, things can go one of few ways. First: there are no changes in performance, FaZe remain an always-the-bridesmaid team and the tendency of missing on championship remains. Unlikely scenario, considering the scope of the change. Then, the team could either skyrocket, propelled by its unparalleled firepower and be an absolute terror on the server; or fall apart completely, poisoned by clash of personalities and egos. The latter was a real possibility and something many fans feared but a turn for the better was still more likely -- after all, FaZe were about to enter a new honeymoon.
Olofmeister and GuardiaN arrived reinvigorated to the clan. GuardiaN had been struggling with motivation in Natus Vincere and had spoken out in regards to internal problems within the former powerhouse. GuardiaN was also competing for the same position with s1mple -- Natus Vincere's young hope and the future of the team -- and with every passing day it became clearer that the Ukrainian had to find another team. In fact, according to NaVi CEO Yevhen Zolotarov, it had been GuardiaN's intention to leave for some time now, and only stayed due to failed negotiations regarding his buyout price.
The form of Olofmeister's Fnatic had also been poor. Before DreamHack Summer in June, it had been one year since the team made it to a grand final and the last time they hoisted a trophy was at IEM Katowice 2016, the event that essentially marked the end of the Fnatic era. Like GuardiaN, Olofmeister was struggling with his own motivation and believed turning a new page was the solution.
“I have not felt this sense of excitement and positive nervousness in a long time. Today is the start of something new.” -- Olofmeister on joining FaZe.
For GuardiaN and Olofmeister, FaZe represented a way out of the seemingly dead-end street of underwhelming performances, individually and team-wise alike. The org had shown it has championship potential and even though the two legends might never return to their prime form and forever play the catch-up to young rising stars like s1mple and Stewie2k, they could still win championships in the proper environment.
* * *
Yet FaZe's new roster, while monstrous and now championship-winning, told only half the story leading up to the recent ESL One New York, as inconsistency arrived in Brazil and Denmark.
FaZe's old rivals -- Astralis and especially SK Gaming -- had been cooling off. After conquering Cologne, SK never made it past the semi-finals of another tournament. Top 8 finishes in Krakow and DreamHack Malmö and bronze at ESG Mykonos showed the Brazilian gods can bleed and even though coldzera is still considered the best player in the world and FalleN's AWPing and IGLing remained world class, something was off with the highest ranked team. Teams which would've been easily bested by SK during their summer streak were now giving them a hard time. North bested them in a best-of-3 in Sweden; mousesports took the champions to overtime in ESG Mykonos groups before falling; and Team Liquid's Twistzz and jdm64 dismantled them in ESG's semis.
Astralis were doing even worse. Not only did the Danes never made it to another final after StarSeries Season 3, they couldn't even make it out of the Malmö and later New York group stages. These were the only two teams in the world that would test FaZe and were now in a slump of their own. FaZe were even set to play a struggling Virtus.pro in their opening New York match, another roster fighting internal issues as it would seem.
This combination of circumstances left no other option for FaZe. The scene was ripe for conquering, with the old kings of CS:GO on the decline and their new roster blooming with newfound ambition (not to mention the outstanding cost for its maintenance). FaZe had to win gold in New York and win it big: anything else could raise questions the old would not feel comfortable answering.
Photo by: ESL
To FaZe's relief, everything went smoother than they could have imagined. The numbers alone speak volume. The team averaged a 16-5.5 record across seven games. Four of FaZe's players finished in the top 8 of the tournament, with NiKo and rain fielding 1.70 and 1.61 ratings, respectively. The only time they let someone score double digit rounds against them was when Team Liquid took 14 on Overpass in the grand final. The team weren't tested against SK Gaming, but obliterated Astralis 16-6 and 3-0'd SK's newly-emerged arch-enemy Team Liquid, including a crushing almost-16-0 sweep on Inferno. At the same time, over in ELEAGUE, FaZe are putting up an equally dominant showing and are a lock for the playoffs after 16-9 vs. Renegades and 16-6 vs. the Na`Vi of Major champion Zeus.
* * *
For now, FaZe are living up to all expectations -- those of their fans, their management, their captain -- but sport greatness has never been about just being on the top, rather how long one can stay there. As Lurppis pointed out, the honeymoon period will at one point be over. How will the team handle itself if and when an unsatisfying tournament performance is recorded? Where will it stand midway through the season, should their old rivals recover form and should teams on the rise such as Team Liquid figure out a way to best their firepower? CS:GO's scene is in its most competitive state and the long eras of NiP and Fnatic will likely never be repeated and the pressure is mounting on FaZe's shoulders as we speak.
Ravishing ESL One New York in this fashion was FaZe's only option, but it's by no means a free pass for the rest of the season. The star-studded line-up will be watched more closely than any other. This is where it truly begins for Karrigan's gunmen.
For many Apple users, October's credit card statement will be the first that has a line on it for Apple Music. With the ninety-day free trial rolling over to a paid subscription, this is the key moment for Apple Music. Will people continue to stay subscribed to Apple's model of a subscription music service? Has the service delivered enough value? Does it compare favourably to the current leading streaming players?
Personally, the answer is no.
Close to four months have passed since launch, and the Apple Music experience has not been improved in any substantial way. The package that Apple delivered out of the box was horribly mainstream, with a huge focus on popular artists. In my time exploring the playlists and radio it has been hard to find niche music in the package. Having seen countless people set up their Apple Music profile when they were forced to move to the updated Music app in iOS 8.4, I'd be confident that every single Apple Music user was offered Taylor Swift as a musical recommendation. Those bubbles forced mainstream pop music recommendation into everyone's system, so is it any wonder I'm offered Katy Perry, One Direction, and Miley Cyrus, when a quick glance through my music collection would show that a focus on more Progressive Rock and East European Dance music would be more appropriate?
Apple Music still hasn't worked this out. Why is it not using the data it can collect to better effect?
Just as the Apple Music recommendations have not been updated, the actual application itself has not seen any major changes. Beyond fighting the huge firestorm of bugs that caused Apple Music, iTunes, and the iCloud Music Library to clash in the cloud-sync process with little clear information on what was going on, the application has maintained a steady state since launch.
There is no app in the world that is perfect, but the new iOS Music app is a sprawling mess, it can easily hang on opening if it can't find a solid internet connection, and it makes it harder to search and locate your own music on a handset. Album and Artist lists are compressed into a single drop down box, while Apple's attempt at a global radio station is given a tab all on its own. Prioritising Zane Lowe's vanity project over easy access to my own music collection is a courageous call for Apple to make.
And that's before I look at the bloated bolt-on nature of Apple Music in the iTunes desktop app. It's just painful to navigate.
Who sat down and thought this was the way to make a subscription music 'just work?'
Next Page: The lack of social and why Apple is a poor follower...
And then there's social. Apple provides a bulletin board for artists to post news to listeners following them, but with very few options to track these posts or to use then to start users down a social funnel, there is very little value for the artists in using the service.
It also completely ignores the connected experience of music online. Sharing tracks, playlists, and curating from multiple sources and networks is part of listening to music now, and Apple as yet does not have an easy route to work with countless musical moments.
It's not just getting music out of my handset and into my social network (with a flurry of 'I really love this', it's bringing music discovery in from outside the iTunes silo. Take 'Talia's New Obsession', a monthly newsletter of some of the biggest unknown ear worms of pop music. Everything runs through Spotify and shared playlists, there is no easy way to get this in to iTunes or Apple Music. Just one example of countless missed opportunities for Apple online.
I would have expected some indication that Apple Music is evolving by now. I would have expected the experience to be iterated by now. I would have expected some polish, care and attention to be visible. Instead Apple Music has simply stalled.
Apple is incredibly late to this game. It's been in this situation before with hardware, and typically it comes in with a much better offering that takes the best elements from the competition to create an irresistible chimera. Not with Apple Music. It feels like Apple's subscription music ambition is not be a leader, but a follower. It's just not very good at being a follower, missing all the reasons why the competition can produce a better product.
That's not to say that Apple Music can turn itself around. A brutal focus on improving the user interface, an acceptance of the connected social world that music lives, and opening up the service to be more open would by a good place to start a pivot. Perhaps all of that is planned but I see no evidence of it. When the competition is doing it faster, better, stronger, with more fidelity, openness, and accountability, it's very hard to justify the monthly subscription to Apple Music.

Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang sent the email below to all Yahoo'ers at 2:20 pm PST, after earnings were announced. Besides being all lowercase, as usual, he lets everyone know that the company will be letting 10% of employees go to help save $400 million in annual costs. Jerry Yang, of course, will not be among the layoffs.
The full email:
From: Jerry Yang [mailto:jerry@yahoo-inc.com]

Subject: update
yahoos,
i feel it's important for me to reach out to you after our earnings announcement, and before our all hands meeting tomorrow.
we as a company have been through a tremendously challenging year; and managing the increasingly turbulent global advertising climate has been an important focus for the last three months.
throughout the first three quarters of 2008, we have been balancing between investing in our top priorities, and managing our cost structure. beginning in september, with the help of Bain & Co., we initiated a series of steps to determine how we can become more efficient and productive as an organization.
we heard from you through the YEES survey, and through your suggestions on backyard, and we've identified many areas that we all feel we can improve upon. our productivity efforts, based in part on what we heard from you, will involve initiatives such as streamlining our organizational structure through reducing layers and increasing spans of control, and eliminating redundancies. longer term structural efficiencies include consolidating facilities, improving procurement, and standardizing our global technology platforms.
today as part of our q3 earnings release, we said that our goal is to reduce our current annualized cost run rate of roughly $3.9 billion by more than $400 million before the end of 2008. we are targeting non-headcount expenses wherever possible, such as facilities and outside services. however, because compensation expenses are the single largest part of our costs, we anticipate a reduction of at least 10% of our global workforce by year-end.
affected employees will be notified of layoffs in the next several weeks. we understand that hearing this news now creates uncertainty, but we are moving ahead in a way that balances speed with a clear focus on accomplishing what is necessary to set the organization up for long term success. going forward it will continue to be important for us to make the right decisions to keep our business efficient and strong.
having layoffs is very difficult, particularly in light of all we've experienced this year. but we don't take these decisions lightly, and are committed to treating affected employees fairly, offering severance and outplacement services.
the steps we are taking are not easy for us as a company, but as we become more fit as an organization, decision-making will be faster and it will be easier for us all to get more done and stay focused on our strategy. these changes will also prepare us to better deal with the macroeconomic downturn. as with previous downturns, yahoo! continues to be a place where consumers turn for information and communications, and is an integral part of their internet day. as the global economy improves in the future, i certainly believe that we will be stronger and benefit from the actions we are taking now.
as always, i thank you for all you do as yahoos.
best,
jerry
Time to wake up
This senator has given 150 pleas for climate action. Now, he has a few words for Trump.
All of these Senate floor speeches have urged the same thing since 2012: Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island keeps warning his political peers of the perils of ignoring climate science.
In his 150th speech delivered Tuesday, Whitehouse says:
While the president-elect mocked Republican politicians groveling before the Koch brothers at their “beg-a-thon,” as he called it, he is busy filling his staff with Koch operatives. Donald Trump may have won the presidency. But with operatives like Myron Ebell, the Koch brothers are moving in to run it. The new president will hear from our military, our national labs, and NASA (who, with a rover driving around on Mars, may actually know a little science) that this is deadly serious. I encourage President-elect Trump to listen to these voices of reason and expertise, not to the Swamp Things. Don't be taken in by industry lobbyists and front groups, scratching and clawing to protect a $700 billion conflict of interest.
Trump isn't keen on listening to scientists, but he does seem to care what his family members think. Whitehouse adds, “Consider listening to your children, who joined you just seven years ago in saying climate science was ‘irrefutable,' and portends ‘catastrophic and irreversible' consequences.”
Trump and co. really did say that. They signed a letter arguing for global climate action, which Grist uncovered this summer.
Hillary Clinton deceived the public and thinks of herself as “above the law!” That's the shocking claim from a CIA interrogation expert who recently studied an interview with Clinton in the hopes of uncovering her hidden motivations and beliefs.
Phil Houston is a 25 year CIA vet who has “conducted thousands of interviews and interrogations for the CIA and other federal agencies,” according to lawnewz.com.
He reviewed a recent interview between Clinton and CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer regarding her email scandal, and shared his analysis with the website.

In the clip, Blitzer asked Clinton “Will you cooperate with this new State Department investigation?” He was referring to the State Department's decision to reopen an internal investigation into Clinton's use of her email server.
Clinton could not answer the question directly. “Well, I assume they will pursue whatever process they think is appropriate, and I also assume that they will pay very close attention to what the findings were of the Justice Department investigation,” Clinton said.
Blitzer tried again. “Will you cooperate with this new State Department investigation?” Clinton dodged again, saying “Well, there was a Justice Department investigation going on at the time. And of course I fully cooperated with that.”

Houston said Clinton's resistance to answering the question suggests that she “sees herself as being above the law — that the decision as to which rules she will follow is hers alone.” He then went on to say that her response, or lack thereof, shows her to be “willfully engaging in deception by giving the impression that she will cooperate with the State Department's review, while likely having no intention of doing so.”
The CIA veteran concluded that, based on his experience granting classified information to various individuals over the years, anybody who “was found to have demonstrated the exceedingly poor judgment that Secretary Clinton demonstrated in the use of her private email would likely not be granted a security clearance, the basis for denial being the risk associated with her unwillingness to follow the rules.”

How to Add Google Authorship Markup on Your Website
The "standard" way of adding Google's authorship markup is as follows:
1. Create an author page on your website/blog and provide detailed information about the author on this page. If your blog has multiple authors, you should create separate pages for each author, rather than adding all the author bios on a single page. While it won't hurt to have all the author bios listed in your site's official “about” page, you should create separate author pages for each author.
2. Every author should have a Google Plus account. On the author page, add a link to the author's Google profile (or Google Plus profile) using the rel=”me” attribute.
To be more clear, you should use the following HTML code on the source of an author page: <a rel="me" href="http://plus.google.com/YourGooglePlusAccountNumber/">Anchor Text to your Google Plus profile</a>
The anchor text used above, is not a very important factor but it makes sense to use something relevant (e.g “Connect with me on Google Plus” or “My Google Plus profile”).
Note: Do not use the rel=”nofollow” attribute in this link. You must allow Googlebot to crawl this link.
3. Now you have to link your article pages to their respective author pages on your website. On every article page on your domain, add a link to the corresponding author page using the rel=”author” attribute.
Here is the HTML code: <a rel="author" href="http://yoursite.com/authorpage.html/">Author's Name</a>
4. This is important. Have the authors upload a good, recognizable headshot as profile photo on his/her Google Plus profile. Next, they should edit their profile and add a back link to the author page on your domain.
Here is how you add the link from your Google Plus profile to the author page on your domain:
Former French Leader Sarkozy Is Cleared In Corruption Case

Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been cleared in a scandal over the finances of his 2007 presidential campaign. The examining magistrates' decision to dismiss the case may clear the way for a return to politics for Sarkozy.
"I am delighted about this decision, which I expected," said Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, after the announcement, the AP reports. The news agency adds, "After leaving a private meeting on Monday at the main Paris mosque, Sarkozy nodded to cameras but did not speak to journalists."
The case revolves around charges "that L'Oréal cosmetics heiress Liliane Bettencourt provided the Sarkozy campaign with illegal campaign funds," as the Two-Way reported last year. That alleged connection has yielded the scandal's name in France: the Bettencourt Affair.
The former president was formally accused with a breach of trust this past March. As Agence France-Presse reported, investigators believed that the party backing Sarkozy received as much as $5.2 million from the heiress.
But on Monday, Sarkozy's name was cleared, nearly 18 months after he lost the presidency to Socialist Francois Hollande. As Sarkozy has fought allegations of wrongdoing, he has also been the subject of a rumored comeback attempt.
"With President Francois Hollande's approval ratings at record lows, analysts say Sarkozy may have his eye on running again in 2017," reports NPR's Eleanor Beardsley from Paris.
While the charges against Sarkozy were dismissed Monday, others named in the case remain under a legal threat, as 10 people who were indicted — including a former Labor minister who was also Sarkozy's campaign treasurer — could go on trial next year, Le Monde reports.
Director James Cameron said Tuesday that humanity could prevent climate change by eliminating meat from its diet.
“Nutritionally, we don't need to eat animals and animal products,” he wrote in an op-ed for Newsweek.

“We're actually much healthier if we don't,” Cameron continued. "This has been proven; there's a depth and breadth of scientific analysis behind that statement.
“So, cutting down on animal agriculture makes sense,” he added. "It's the thermostat we can grab the quickest and change the fastest.
“The single biggest thing an individual can do is shift to a more plant-based diet. It's a win-win. It's a win for your health [and] it's a win for the environment.”
Cameron argued that animal agriculture is a major cause of the greenhouse gases creating dangerous climate change.
“Animal agriculture is a huge contributor to greenhouse gas emissions through its production of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides,” he said.
“If you look at the forcing effect of animal agriculture – and this is just animal agriculture – it's actually larger than the entire transportation sector,” the “Avatar” director wrote.
“We can all reduce the impact of climate change immediately by changing what we buy at supermarkets, what we order at restaurants and by changing what we eat,” he added. "Our diet is unhealthy for us and unhealthy for the planet."
Cameron additionally said that climate change inaction could produce harmful extreme weather and other negative consequences.
“Climate change isn't some hypothetical thing that our children are going to face in the future,” he said.
“It's happening now, with worsening droughts, agriculture crashes, and rising sea levels that will prompt the mass displacement of millions of people,” Cameron wrote.
"It's insidious and a lot like rabies, as I always say. By the time you're symptomatic, it's too late for a cure. I hope I'm wrong about that; we're already symptomatic.”
Cameron's op-ed representatives from 195 nations gather in Paris for the COP21 climate conference there.
COP21 negotiators announced last weekend that they had reached a tentative deal for reducing global carbon emissions.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is working on the pact's details for a final version due later this week. The forum's participants are working towards a definitive target for reduced carbon emissions by 2050.
Obama administration officials assured lawmakers earlier this year that environmental concerns would not factor into new dieteraty guidelines for everyday Americans due this month.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in October that the upcoming rules should focus only on dietary information rather than also considering environmental sustainability as well.
The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee - a federally appointed panel of nutritionists created in 1983 for help crafting the guidelines - decided for the first time earlier this year that it would include environmental analysis in its recommendations.
Critics - primarily from the meat industry - argued that the advisory panel had neither the authority nor the expertise for such a judgement call.
Vilsack then admitted on Oct. 7 that the committee merely advises final decisions from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture.
"The [Dietary Guidelines] Advisory Committee's report is not the guidelines and sometimes there's confusion about that," he said on the House floor. "The report informs our work, but it certainly does not and should not dictate it."
De Gea is unlikely to have similar problems with Mourinho and is now likely to remain at Old Trafford. So Mendes has United's soon-to-be appointed manager as well as their star player among his clientele although those who now speculate that he will soon be firmly ensconced at the club perhaps forget that he had a strong working relationship with Ferguson and David Gill, two men who were naturally suspicious of agents.
Ferguson attended Mendes's wedding to Sandra Barbosa in Oporto last year and has described him as “the best agent I dealt with, without a doubt”. Anderson, Nani, Bebe, De Gea and, of course, Ronaldo were all Mendes clients whom Ferguson signed.
There is nothing new in Woodward working closely with the man who has negotiated transfer deals totalling in excess of £1 billion. Those who know Mendes say he is loyal, charming and committed to pastoral care. They talk about him being in it for the long haul, not out to make a quick buck. His clients tend to stay with him for a long time, although that must be born in part from a knowledge that few can extract as good a deal. Those who do not know Mendes, or who tuned into the documentaries Jorge Mendes: Super Agent and Ronaldo and witnessed the patter, will wonder if he represents an uglier side to the game, one whose common denominator is money.
But whether admired or reviled, Mendes's rise from nightclub owner to football kingmaker has been a remarkable success story all the same and it is little surprise that the Portuguese has been pulling the strings behind the recent explosion of activity in Chinese football. He is omnipresent, and Woodward and United might be seeing even more of him in the next few years to come.
This is my OC Drawing after a proper scanning and a black outline from MS Paint. I used this shirt as a reference/inspiration: [link] My OC's quick background: Looks are supposed to be slightly based off of me; he has red hair and so do I. *Notice:* His cutie mark is a subwoofer, and not a target. ;_; He is supposed to be a DJ who is almost as popular as Vinyl Scratch. They sometimes host concerts and shows and create the most insane wubs at such unique venues that all of Equestria simply must see. It's quite funny, because I only have mediocre musical knowledge (playing the saxophone in my HS band). Anyways, I figured the "Swag" pose was a good way to show off my OC's looks as well as keep a humorous twist. Oh, yes, his iris' are also outlined with green but the insides of them are actually white.Thoughts? Leave them in the comments below!I plan on taking this picture and completely editing it, coloring it, and possibly removing the paper background. I just have to download that.. what was it agian? Ah.. yes, GIMP. I must also learn how to use it. Oh well, I guess that's what YouTube is for, lol.

The recent 20th anniversary of the Million-Man March celebration in Washington, D.C. was themed "Justice or Else" and aimed at continuing to raise awareness around injustice and the economic, political, and social forces that impact people of color in America. One of the common refrains was from Kendrick Lamar's "Alright", a song that's become a de facto black national anthem since its release this spring.
"Alls my life I have to fight, nigga
All my life I…
Hard times like God
Bad trips like God
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us we then gon' be alright"
The words of the Compton rapper push black people to question our position in the world, yet quickly offers the Lord as the answer we need. It's a means of praise but also a question, asking: how could we bear this if not for faith? For most black American Christians, these two threads—of civil and human rights and religious salvation—are inextricably tied. From 200 miles away, watching the D.C. gathering online, I wished to be there, though the videos flooded me with a feeling I have known since my back first knew a church pew.
I craved sleep too much to believe in God. Early morning church services never matched my circadian rhythms. I sang along with the choir, gave tiding, and admired sun-soaked stained glass, but I was passed out by the time the pastor cracked the Old Testament. Church spoke to me, but I never got the message.
Christian faith and the sinful words of rap music might appear contradictory. Still, it's rare for any rapper to denounce the role of faith in their life. Kanye West can declare himself a god, but even then he'd never claim to be God or stand where he does without God's grace. While some MCs will rap that they've fallen far from big-G God or are beyond saving, they maintain a tether to faith and religiosity. The Long Beach, Calif. rapper Vince Staples, whose rhymes all but reject the presence and power of a Lord above, glibly said in an interview earlier this year: "I know I'm going to hell... I don't believe in any of that stuff. That stuff's not real, man."
On "Turn", he raps:
When it's judgment time I doubt that God can look me in my eyes
'Fore He sends me down to hell cause Imma ask a nigga why?
Never played it by the book, because the book was full of lies
And the preacher full of shit, and the teacher full of shit
There is a joy to be found in the brazenness of Staples asking the nigga that made the entire universe, "the fuck?" He's no longer accepting the standard Sunday school lessons—even with a black Christ—or that all of the two centuries of atrocities committed against black lives in America are part of His Great Plan. Staples is saying that if this is His plan, he'd like to ask for a vote on the next destination.
On Staples' Summertime '06, he dives into the type of life lived by kids a decade ago, when they were leaving childhood innocence and starting to run with the grimier, grimmer aspects of life in Southern California. The conceit isn't dissimilar to Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d city, where Lamar finds himself navigating the seeming inevitabilities of gang life, death, prison, and other obliterations.
Lamar opens his album meekly praying to the Lord that he's a "sinner"; Staples plainly states he's a "nigga" and that is all the world wants to see in him. He speaks to blackness without religion, without teasing earned hope or trading temporal pain with eternal salvation. This is blackness at its darkest, where no light of faith can reach. Still, for those like myself there was warmth, a comfort in addressing that bleakness, of merely admitting that the world does not care about all of its creations equally and that there is no reason to act otherwise.
That ain't Kendrick. To Pimp a Butterfly, Lamar's follow-up to good kid, m.A.A.d city, needs a higher power. The album burrows deep within Lamar and the spiritual complexities he embodies. He stresses over whether his message is getting through to the people and if he's even communicating the right words at this moment. That is what drives "These Walls", "u", and "i"—that Lamar's greatest fear is that he is exactly the kind of rapper who speaks a big talk but is not there for those who need him and cannot connect to those who need the good word the most. Lamar's rap fame-fear has shades of a youth pastor—one who realizes his power to lead lost souls to salvation, but stresses each day if he himself is truly walking on the righteous path.
Rap is inherently a nihilistic art form. What else could one expect of music from the disenfranchised that primarily concerns itself with examining a world that doesn't care about them? Yet the nihilism is curtailed when an artist offers a way out of the pain. To its credit, Staples' Summertime '06 ends in a fog of what is expected of black kids who are never given a chance to succeed. The second disc's penultimate song, "Like It Is", strives for a redemptive arc, but as the last track starts with a TV-like voiceover saying "Next time on Poppy Street", Staples reassumes the gangster role he was just shedding and cuts the track mid-verse to the sound of static fuzz. He does not placate or even allow for a false of sense of emotional progress that redemptive narrative arcs establish.
While not so much it's opposite, To Pimp a Butterfly seeks spiritual closure and finds spiritual possibility. Lamar can no longer turn inward to answer such questions and instead seeks the spirit of 2Pac to answer the questions he's been struggling with throughout the album. "What you think is the future for me and my generation today?" he asks. In letting 2Pac speak, Lamar suggests that perhaps this political and very public role is one he isn't ready to assume. The title of the final track is "Mortal Man"; even with all of the ambition Lamar puts on display throughout the album, he cops to not having the answers, or the keys to heaven, suggesting that we should ask these questions of God, not him.
Before the surprise release of To Pimp a Butterfly, BuzzFeed's Reggie Uguwu wrote "The Radical Christianity of Kendrick Lamar", which centered around the role of that Christian faith to the rapper's music. In prescient closing lines, Uguwu wrote:
...A righteous awakening may not make Lamar more popular in any of the spheres that would seek to contain him. Instead, it could serve to complicate and deepen his output in fascinating and unexpected ways.
Lamar is the rapper that both the Christian and secular world desires. He raps with the bravado of a black man given national spotlight—soft-spoken with black skin is an American oxymoron; he turns towards God whenever asked; and he's the correct level of politically conscious, but is not leading any revolutionary marches. He knows the weight, he knows the price. Thus Lamar's outlook on the world can only be so bleak, as his baptism in the Lord's water places him right in line with America's founding ideals. It's the reason that his words can be chanted. Lamar can fight so much within and still raps with the conviction of a preacher, because he knows there is a receptive black audience to his message. There might be a separation between church and rap, but there is no division between black people and the cries from a Sunday pulpit. Lamar's audience knows what to do with his gospel, how to act, how to react, and what should be taken away from each scriptural reading.
Staples is not so blessed. There is no biblical backing to his thoughts on the world. No Old or New Testament texts means there is no historical black American backing to his thoughts. His lyrics are waged to stand on their own, without a nation to shout back at him "Amen". He is rapping to an America full of ghosts of black boys just like him. Both rappers wrestle with wanting to reach their local communities, their blocks, but where Lamar reaches for familiar foundational texts, Staples only counts on the world that is in front of his eyes. Staples' words are not hopeful or malleable enough to fit into a scripture quote or a rally slogan. Therein lies what makes Staples' music so rewarding: he's not seeking grace.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton was a guest on the Uninterrupted‘s Open Run podcast recently, along with Cavaliers vet Richard Jefferson. Toward the end, Jesse Williams, who's one of the podcast hosts, asked Walton if he had a good Kobe Bryant story to share, since everyone who played with Kobe has a legendary story to tell.
Walton delivered. He recalled the one time he showed up to a Lakers practice as a rookie smelling like alcohol, and how Kobe ruthlessly went at him (h/t Silver Screen & Roll).
Walton said:
“I remember one time my rookie year, I came in a little, uh him (Kobe Bryant) and Shaq like to do this as, I think it was just rookies, but any young guy, I probably had too much to drink the night before, so I came in, I was a rookie, I felt good, and they could smell some alcohol on me. And Kobe informed the rest of the team that no one was allowed to help me on defense, and that I had to guard him the entire practice. “I was laughing at first like, ‘Oh, this is funny,' but in Kobe's mind, in his eyes, it was like, ‘No, I see and smell weakness, I'm going to destroy you today.' He taught me that lesson. He probably scored 70-something in practice that day, and I was begging for help, none of the teammates would help. But yeah, his killer instinct and his work ethic, they'll stick with me forever.”
Then, Walton added that Shaq did the exact same thing to him.
“Shaq did it to me too one day. Yeah, Shaq made me guard him, and then I just started trying to foul him, and he told me that if I kept fouling him, he was gonna punch me, so then I stopped fouling him. It wasn't fair. I felt like I was a child trying to play a grown man's game.”
This tells us that Walton had a grand old time partying it up in Los Angeles as a player, and it reminds us how great Kobe and Shaq were as a duo. Good times.
Wild boars are going nuclear in Japan.
The animals are running amok in abandoned towns in Japan's Fukushima prefecture, evacuated following the tsunami-triggered disaster at a nuclear plant there in 2011.
But now that exiled residents will soon be allowed to move back to at least two of the affected towns, hunters have been contracted to clear the animals out, the BBC reported.
“They began coming down from the mountains and now they're not going back,” hunter Shoichi Sakamoto told the network. “They found a place that's comfortable, there's plenty of food, and no one will come after them. This is their new home now and this where they have children.”
It's unlikely the boars will be used for their bacon, since they've been gobbling plants contaminated with radiation, which the government banned humans from consuming.
And the animals pose other risks.
“They come down from the mountains to the residential areas and attack people or collide with cars,” University of Tokyo Professor Takahisa Murata told the BBC.
Evacuation orders will be lifted on the outskirts of the prefecture on March 31 or April 1, according to Reuters.
Will the real European Union please stand up? For that matter will the real Great Britain please stand up? Because I got a bit confused last week with all that talk of "Independence Day."
Had I missed the moment when the U.K. lost its status as a sovereign nation? Was the Queen no longer on the pound? What happened to the Commonwealth? And exactly when did the EU morph into something beyond a supra-national body its members had willingly shaped and signed up to, still ultimately controlled by the nations that had created it?
The Leave campaign employed an ultimately successful strategy of implying that the EU's institutions had become far more powerful than the national governments that created them, sort of like Frankenstein's monster turning on its creator.
Or to borrow another sci-fi image, machines taking over the world. Just imagine a congress of shiny cylons sitting around the boardrooms of the European Commission or filling the semi-circle at the European Parliament, coming up with all sorts of nefarious plots involving regulations about shoelaces, clean beaches and molasses.

It tells us a couple of things. First, that many Britons went to the polls remarkably ill-informed about the workings of the Union. But it also shows what an abject failure the EU's main institutions — the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers, have been at transmitting their relevance … not just to Brits, but to the vast majority of European Union citizens.
And so come the calls for reform.
"We have to make sure that the people can feel how much the European Union contributes in improving their own personal lives," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said early Friday, after news that Britain had decided to opt out. "This is a task for the European institutions as well as the member states."
Europe's longtime scapegoat
She's not kidding about the need for member states to back their own creature. Brussels has been a convenient scapegoat for national governments for decades, leaders voting in favour of proposals at the European Council or rubber-stamping them and then blaming the Eurocrats if there is criticism or push-back at home.
But the Brexit has reminded government leaders that they could be faced with the rise of the clones if they don't act soon. Other anti-EU parties, usually right-wing, populist and xenophobic, are demanding their own referendums.
Marine Le Pen, who leads the party founded by her Holocaust-denying father, is already campaigning hard for a Frexit.
"The risk of [contagion] is such that we need to send a strong and clear message [that we are] revamping the European project," Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on the weekend.
But what does that mean in a Union where the main protest party of Spain, for example, criticizes the EU for failing it in terms of social policy, imposed austerity and the abandonment of refugees, while in Slovakia, the populists are demanding to leave in part because of the refugee crisis.
EU of today didn't come without compromise
Last week I revisited the Dutch border town of Maastricht, where the Treaty of the same name was signed by 12 member states in 1992, creating the European Union as we know it today, complete with the British opt-out of European Monetary Union.
The notion that Britain was the only one making difficult demands back then is revisionist. Everyone had to compromise. And they did — for an idea that's been a reality for more than three decades.
"It was a very complex negotiation situation where also the Germans and the French were not always of the same mind, and also the Dutch Presidency came up with a different treaty structure that wasn't really meeting a lot of support from other countries," says Kiran Klaus Patel, a political science professor at the University of Maastricht. "There was a lot of compromise."

That's what makes last week's decision so inexorably sad for many who've followed the Union's tortured progress over the years. To get to that point seemed a miracle of political will and vision and mutual understanding.
Even more troubling is the fact that so many Britons now are suffering from voter's remorse, describing their Leave ballots as a protest vote they didn't really believe would "take."
The vote seems to have brought that faceless mask that is "Brussels" into some kind of focus at long last. All of a sudden, Brits heard their EU partners expressing genuine sadness that they wanted to leave.
Let us not set an example
Many people on the continent this past week said they agreed with the United Kingdom that the EU needs reform. But few saw it as a reason to quit, as continental Europeans have a greater sense of ownership of the EU than most Brits.
"It's sad because we are a union and it's based on peace and trade and economics," said a young Dutch woman in Brussels who was hoping to be hired by the European Commission. "So it's a sad day that they move out. Hopefully [it] won't be an example for other countries now to try and vote out of the European Union."
Thursday's divisive vote came after months of campaigning and is expected to shape both the U.K. and EU for years to come. (Marc-André Cossette/CBC)
Both Boris Johnson, the former London mayor tipped as a successor to David Cameron, and Trevor Kavanagh, a newspaper columnist, have told me that one reason the Brits should vote to leave was they had no idea who their members of the European Parliament were. No idea.
In the midst of all these calls for EU reform, which might take 20 or 30 years to push through, who is going to fix that?
It's not as though the British people are being asked to vote for Spaniards or Portuguese or Finnish representatives who've never put a foot on British soil.
The representatives they elect are British. They're not cylons, or Syrian refugees or grey-suited Eurocrats. They're Brits. Exit campaigner Nigel Farage, for example, managed to get himself elected to the European Parliament, all the better to destroy from within.
When was it decided that democracy had to be delivered on a plate for people to consume? When was it decided people didn't have to inform themselves about their own elections and the candidates running to represent them?
It's all very well to call for the reform of the European Union. But relying on bureaucratic institutions or national governments isn't enough. People have a responsibility too to inform themselves.
Cougar has launched an aluminum keyboard, the 700K. Cougar 700K Gaming Keyboard is a premium mechanical gaming keyboard aimed at professional level PC gamers, especially those who engage in Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOs).
t comes with COUGAR's UIX System, a powerful software with a simple interface that combines your COUGAR peripherals (for example the new gaming mouse 700M) into a single application interface and allows you to conveniently configure all their functions. This way a single software can control all the peripherals, instead of needing, as most products on the market, an app for each device.
The design of the Cougar 700K was inspired by stealth warship technology, and it is based on carefully selected geometrical shapes: mechanical key modules are mounted on an exposed aluminum structure with premium anodized surface treatments, and a plastic frame wraps its ends to create a stylish, sturdy and durable device. This, together with the wrist support points, makes possible a faster, more precise and comfortable keyboard experience.
The 700k features German Cherry MX mechanical key switches that last up to 50 million keystrokes. The mechanical keys deliver gaming-grade responsiveness and a distinctive tactile feedback. The COUGAR 700K keyboard is not just attractive on the outside, but also brings an impressive set of features for gaming and serious work, with a 32bit ARM processor in charge and on-board memory storage for up to 3 full configuration profiles. This allows you to bring your setup to other PCs without needing to re-configure the keyboard.
With form & function come results. Looking pretty is one thing but actually being a good and usable device is another. The 700k has features that allow you to focus on speed or productivity such as full led backlights, giving individual keys a backlight setting which can be customized by choosing any single key to set the backlight on or off.
In USB mode, the N-key rollover allows for use of any number of keys without needing a USB to PS/2 adapter. Normally, it is difficult to reach N-key rollover in USB mode but the 700k allows for unlimited simultaneous key presses, without missing any function. Also the user can choose the repeat rate of his preference: 1X, 2X, 4X or 8X. The keys are always ready for action, with the 1000HZ polling rate giving a 1ms response time.
There are also 6 programmable G-keys, one for thumb use in an ergonomical position near the space bar and 5 silver buttons on the left side. Lastly, there is the FPS magnetic soft touch palm rest that provides great ergonomic support for WASD keys control. The union of a stylish and sturdy design, a wide range of well thought functions and the precision coming from its high quality components qualifies the 700K as the best gaming keyboard currently on the market.

Out of four open Pasadena Unified School District Boards of Education seats up for election on March 7, the one that is uncontested has received the most campaign donations, campaign finance records show.
According to campaign finance statements that candidates filed with the city of Pasadena, Scott Phelps, who faces no competition in the race to keep his seat representing District 7, has raised $7,650 from 12 donors. That's both the highest amount of money and the highest number of donors for any of the board seats that are up for grabs this term.
Phelps' donors include GKK Works, an architecture firm that is currently taking the lead on Blair Middle and High School's remodel, as well as Mayor Terry Tornek and City Council member Tyron Hampton.
The district's contract with GKK Works is worth $1.6 million. The company donated $250 to Phelps, whose District 7 includes most of the west side of Pasadena, which includes the Blair campuses.
The second-highest fundraiser in the election is incumbent Adrienne Ann Mullen, who's vying to keep her seat representing District 3. Mullen has raised $6,400 from five donors. District 3 includes the area directly east of the Rose Bowl including Muir High School.
The incumbents are clearly winning the race for campaign donations, mostly due to the California Teamsters Public Affairs Council, which donated $5,000 to each of the incumbents, except for Kimberly Kenne, who represents District 1.
Teamsters is one of the largest labor unions in the world, comprising 1.4 million members, according to the organization's website. The California Teamsters did not respond to requests for comment.
None of the candidates responded to requests for comment about their campaign fundraising efforts.
Kenne, whose District 1 covers the northwestern portion of the city, appears to be completely self-financing her campaign. The only money she has reported is one donation from herself for $2,032.53, and one $20,000 loan from herself.
Neither Rita Miller, who is challenging Kenne for her seat, nor Matthew Baron, who is challenging Elizabeth Pomeroy for her District 5 seat, have reported any donations or expenditures. District 5 includes McKinley School and Marshall Fundamental and sits in the middle of the city in the area surrounding Pasadena City College.
Kenne was first elected to the board in 2011 and re-elected in 2013 to District 1. Her challenger, Miller, is a teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District.
Mullen was appointed to the District 3 seat in 2015 after Hampton resigned to serve on the City Council. Her challenger, Michelle Richardson-Bailey, is a secretary for the district.
Pomeroy was elected in 2009 and re-elected in 2013. Her challenger, Baron, teaches agriculture at Muir High School.
Phelps was first elected in 2005 and re-elected in 2009 and 2013.
The district comprises 31 schools and enrolls about 18,000 students.

Trump joined a number of critics lambasting the news site for publishing a privately produced intelligence dossier Tuesday that contained unverified claims about the president-elect's connections to Russia.

Trump said at a Wednesday press conference in New York that the site is a “failing pile of garbage.” The president-elect added that BuzzFeed would “suffer the consequences” for publishing the document.

In response, the outlet unveiled a “Failing Pile of Garbage” store just hours after Trump's remarks.
Among the items for sale is a $49 limited edition BuzzFeed garbage can. A description for the receptacle appears to poke fun of Trump's fondness for superlatives and campaign promises to fight outsourcing: “This garbage can is phenomenal. Absolutely fantastic trashcan. Made of steel—sourced internationally, but will be domestically sourced within the next 4 years.”
Other merchandise includes $5 “I proudly get my news from a failing pile of garbage” and “My bae works at a failing pile of garbage” bumper stickers, along with $30 “failing pile of garbage” t-shirts.
BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith had defended the publication of the dossier, writing in a memo that although “there is serious reason to doubt the allegations,” the site aims to be “transparent in our journalism and to share what we have with our readers.”
The outlet's CEO, Jonah Peretti, wrote in an email to staff following Trump's press conference, telling them that "we are not going to respond to these divisive comments,” and “We are going to keep doing what we do best, which is delivered impactful journalism."
BuzzFeed isn't the first media outlet targeted by Trump to brand itself with his attacks. In December, an incensed Trump criticized Vanity Fair after the magazine ran a negative review of a Trump restaurant, inspiring Vanity Fair to describe itself as "the magazine Trump doesn't want you to read."
On Thursday, the chief cited that legal advice when he again refused to answer questions about any Ford involvement in the investigation, or whether any videos have been recovered as part of a sweep targeting a sophisticated guns and drugs trafficking operation, a year-long effort dubbed Project Traveller.
Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair says he sought legal advice about what he could disclose about a gang raid and any connection to Mayor Rob Ford and he's not veering from it.
Three legal experts have told the Star the chief could discuss the mayor's involvement without breaking the law. He could also disclose, even release, a video apparently showing Ford smoking crack cocaine, if police had obtained it.
“I have no idea where you're getting your legal advice, but I know where I'm getting mine and I've consulted with the Ministry of the Attorney General, people who actually know the law with respect to the disclosure of that information,” Blair told reporters after a Toronto Police Services Board meeting.
The chief refused to comment on whether he could disclose or exonerate the mayor of any involvement, even if Ford gave him permission to do so.
“We've now put all of our evidence before the courts. Any inquiries now about that evidence should rightfully be directed to the Crown attorney.”
“I'm not going to comment on the specifics of that,” Blair said. “If you look in the Criminal Code and the Police Services Act, there are very specific sections in there that define exactly what the responsibilities and the authorities of the police are to disclose information and I am following that law to the letter.”
When asked if any videos had been recovered as part of Project Traveller, Blair said he could not say one way or the other.
“I don't know specifically about all of the evidence in its totality which may have been collected,” he said. “But I'm not prepared to comment on that or to confirm or deny that.”
Police spokesman Mark Pugash later explained that the magnitude of the investigation means an enormous amount of evidence was likely recovered.
“That property has to be examined with the greatest care using skilled experts,” he said. “That takes time.”
Blair also refused to say whether there is a criminal investigation in the mayor's office.
The chief said he has not been in contact with the mayor recently and does not recall the last time they spoke, adding he is in touch with city hall and elected officials as required to maintain public safety.
When asked if he thought the chief had the ability to clear the mayor of any involvement, police board chair Alok Mukherjee said: “I'm not answering that question.”
Ford's office did not respond to several requests for comment about whether he had given the chief permission to clear him of any involvement or if he planned to do so.
The mayor did not take questions from reporters at two public addresses made Thursday.
Ford has previously denied the video exists and has said he does not smoke crack.
Last week, police announced the arrest of 44 people from Toronto, Windsor, Edmonton and Detroit, and have laid more than 200 charges in an alleged guns and drug trafficking ring run by the Dixon City Bloods gang.
On Thursday, police announced the arrest of a Barrie man in connection with the investigation.
Several links have been made between the mayor and Project Traveller since two-Star reporters watched the video in the back seat of a car outside a Dixon Rd. complex in Etobicoke.
Sources have told the Star that police became aware of the video during surveillance for Project Traveller.
The Dixon Rd. complex was the focus of raids last week. According to sources, one of the apartments searched is a unit the mayor blurted out at a meeting with staff saying the video could be located there.
A home on Windsor Rd. was also subject to a search warrant and was the setting of a photograph given to the Star of Ford and three men. One of them was shot and killed in March and two others were arrested in the raid.

One of the most upsetting things about the recent revelations about the NSA's shenanigans is that it has apparently devoted US$250M to suborning international standards. (One of the very upsetting things about these revelations is that there are several most upsetting things.) Over the last few weeks, just about everyone in the standards and crypto business has been looking over the crypto with an eye towards seeing what the NSA might have subverted.
There hasn't been much definitive to say. There is the much-discussed elliptic curve random number generator in NIST's documents. There is also the concern that the elliptic curves that are part of NSA Suite B aren't as strong as they could be. There are also discussions about interference in various standards from IPsec to TLS to whatever.
There have been no smoking guns. The DUAL_EC_DRBG discussion has been comic. The major discussion has been whether this was evil or merely stupid, and arguing the side of evil has even meant admitting it is technologically a stupid algorithm, which sends the discussion into an amusing spiral of meta-commentary. Matt Green has an excellent blog post on its multi-dimensional stupidity. Was the NSA so stupid they think we wouldn't notice the flaws (we did notice nearly immediately)? Was the NSA so stupid that this is the best they can do? And can we even believe the claim that they've been trying to subvert standards? They're liars. They've lied to Congress, lied to the technical community, and lied to everyone. Should we believe them when they say they punked us, or believe that we saw the ball under the wrong cup all along?
Arguing the side of evil and avoiding the stupid leads to non-falsifiabilty — there must be something that is so clever we haven't seen it yet. I keep thinking of Cabell's quip that a pessimist fears that the optimist is right.
The issue of the Suite B curves is more interesting. Cryptographers Dan Bernstein and Tanja Lange have been arguing that the Suite B curves are weak since before we ever heard of Ed Snowden. I've been public and pointed; I've always thought that the DUAL_EC_DRBG random number generator is patently stupid. But I've always believed that the Suite B curves were designed secure. All crypto has a lifespan of utility. Even if there are issues with the Suite B curves, I think they were designed well at the time.
The NSA has argued intellectually that elliptic curve cryptography is a good idea for a decade. They have actively stumped for it as a technology, and even buying patent licenses (there have been controversies, but those are not at all about the integrity of the technology). If the Suite B curves are intentionally bad, this would be a major breach of trust and credibility. Even in a passive case — where the curves were thought to be good, but NSA cryptanalysts found weaknesses they have since exploited — it would create a credibility gap of the highest order, and would be the smoking gun that confirms the Guardian articles.
At Silent Circle, we've been deciding what to do about the whole grand issue of whether the NSA has been subverting security. Despite all the fun that blogging about this has been, actions speak louder than words. Phil, Mike, and I have discussed this and we feel we must do something. That something is that in the relatively near future, we will implement a non-NIST cipher suite.
Not everything is in place, yet. We have been discussing elliptic curves with Dan and Tanja and they are designing some for us (and the rest of the world, too). Dan's 25519 curve is very nice, but smaller than we want. We've been using the P–384 curve and want a replacement for it, which they're working on. We are going to replace our use of P–384 with that new curve, or perhaps two curves. We are going to replace our use of the AES cipher with the Twofish cipher, as it is a drop-in replacement. We are going to replace our use of the SHA–2 hash functions with the Skein hash function. We are also examining using the Threefish cipher where that makes sense. (Full disclosure: I'm a co-author of Skein and Threefish.) Threefish is the heart of Skein, and is a tweakable, wide-block cipher. There are a lot of cool things you can do with it, but that requires some rethinking of protocols.
The old cipher suites will remain in our systems. We're not going to get rid of them, but the new ones will be the default in our services. We understand there are gentlepersons who will disagree with our decision, so we're not completely getting rid of the existing crypto.
This doesn't mean we think that AES is insecure, or SHA–2 is insecure, or even that P–384 is insecure. It doesn't mean we think less of our friends at NIST, whom we have the utmost respect for; they are victims of the NSA's perfidy, along with the rest of the free world. For us, the spell is broken. We're just moving on. No kiss, no tears, no farewell souvenirs.

The Broncos scored the first points of Sunday's 23-16 win over the Steelers on a Brandon McManus field goal that was set up by a big punt return by Omar Bolden.
Bolden returned Jordan Berry's punt following Pittsburgh's first possession 42 yards into Steelers territory, which allowed Denver to pick up three points even though their offense didn't do much to move the ball. A repeat of that play may not be in the cards against the Patriots in the AFC championship game.
Bolden later left the game with a knee injury and said in the locker room, via the Denver Post, that doctors told him they believe it is a ligament issue because his knee was “loose” during their evaluation. Bolden is set for an MRI Monday on what coach Gary Kubiak termed the only “big injury” suffered by a member of the team in the victory.
Bolden returned a punt 83 yards for a touchdown during the regular season, but only returned five punts overall during a season plagued by injuries. Bolden missed seven games over the course of the year and the initial word on Sunday's injury makes it sound likely that he'll be adding to that total.
The official website for the Majocco Shimai no Yoyo to Nene (Magical Girl Sisters Yoyo and Nene) anime film has announced the film's main staff and cast.
Sumire Morohoshi (Oda Nobuna no Yabō's Himiko, OniAi's Arisa, Princess Jellyfish's Kurara) will voice Yoyo and Ai Kakuma (Campione's Hikari Mariya) will voice Nene.
Takayuki Hirao (Gyo, Futakoi Alternative) is directing the film, and Yuka Shibata (Kimi ni Todoke, Hiyokoi) is handling the character designs and serving as chief animation director. Takuro Takahashi (The Garden of Sinners, Gyo) is serving as assistant director, and Mikako Komatsu (Bodacious Space Pirates, K) will perform the film's theme song.
Morohoshi, Kakuma, and Komatsu will host a staged event at Anime Contents Expo in Japan on March 30.
The "traditional magical fantasy" from the anime studio ufotable (Fate/Zero, Kara no Kyoukai The Garden of Sinners, Tales of Symphonia the Animation) and King Records' Starchild label (Penguindrum, Bodacious Space Pirates) follows sisters who are magical girls: the great Picture Book Level witch Yoyo and the best Practice Book Level witch Nene. Yoyo and Nene live in a forest where they run a famous store for magic spells, and the two are quite skilled despite being young, but for some reason they always cause an uproar.
The studio ufotable announced the project, tentatively known as Majocco Classical at the time, at the Machi Asobi event last October.
Tokuma Shoten is releasing the second compiled volume of Hirarin's Noroiya Shimai Yoyo to Nene sequel manga series on March 13. Tokuma Shoten published the original one-volume Noroiya Shimai manga series in 2008. Both series ran in the publisher's Monthly Comic Ryu magazine, and another sequel series, Noroiya Secret , will premiere in Monthly Comic Ryu's June issue on April 19.

The San Diego Gulls announced forward Brian McGrattan was "conscious, alert, and has full movement" after a scary incident that saw the 34-year-old stretchered off the ice during Tuesday's game against the San Antonio Rampage.
McGrattan was in a fight with Rampage forward Daniel Maggio when he was knocked out by a punch and fell hard to the ice, face first. Gulls teammates quickly signaled to the bench as McGrattan lay motionless on the ice.
McGrattan had eight points and 94 penalty minutes entering Monday's action. He has spent parts of 10 seasons in the NHL with the Ottawa Senators, Phoenix Coyotes, Calgary Flames, and Nashville Predators.
He was assigned to the Gulls after signing a one-year deal with their parent club, the Anaheim Ducks, during the offseason.

Toronto — 30 October 2016.
China has been the fastest growing major economy in the world for three decades. It is also home to some of the largest, most incendiary, and most underreported labor struggles of our time. But under China's labor management system, independent unionism is severely restricted, and the ACFTU official trade union body monopolizes worker representation for more than 800 million workers. Independent organizations are barred from agitating for their interests, despite growing wealth inequalities, and where long hours, safety hazards, and authoritarian management define life in the factories.
But this has not prevented the emergence of workers' resistance and fightbacks across almost all sectors of work. The China Labour Bulletin reports that the number of strikes has been increasing over the past two decades. At any given time, numerous strikes are taking place, and walkouts and slowdowns over work conditions and pay are a regular and growing occurrence. Workers' rights NGOs, while operating from a distinct disadvantage, have become increasingly involved and visible.
Lu Zhang and Eli Friedman have each interviewed dozens of Chinese workers, from the auto sector to the factories producing computers and footwear, documenting the processes of migration, changing employment relations, and worker culture underpinning the new Chinese working class and their forms of resistance today.

When I heard Descender spoken about at the Image event at San Diego Comic-Con 2014, there was a perceptible but very limited 3/4 of a second of silence from the audience as they tried to grapple with the idea that Jeff Lemire and Dustin Nguyen were teaming up on a book. It was one of those moments when you realize that two largely separate aspects of your own fandom have just come together to create the comics version of a superweapon. The magnitude of it got nearly a full second of silence before the enthusiasm cut loose. Revealing the promo imagery nearly prompted a silence again. It was just something that had to be seen to be believed. There was something so strangely perfect yet unpredictable about the feel that Nguyen had already so clearly established for the book that it definitely made a firm impression on the audience even amid all the announcements made that day.
Now, we're into Descender territory. The book is coming in a 30 page opening issue to stores in March, but I feel I ought to warn you that this book is so much more expansive than anything readers might be expecting. We knew it was about a cute kid robot in some way from the promo images, but what's now becoming clear is that Lemire and Nguyen have exuberantly created an entire science fiction universe and are prepared to casually pile up the details to thoroughly convince you that you're visiting foreign worlds. They are worlds oddly familiar, however, based in many ways on extensions of our own technological bent in the 21st century and the problems of industry that we currently face.
Two more teasers for what's going to surprise you about the first issue of Descender: the absolute love of architecture and machinery that Nguyen throws into every panel of the book in trademark watercolor style to capture your imagination, and the unrushed but steady centrifugal force by which Lemire introduces and makes you care about the characters so far. In the end, the kickback on the first issue, no matter what you may be imagining, is going to be bigger than you expect.
Jeff Lemire and Dustin Nguyen are kind enough to join us on Bleeding Cool today for a Q&A session about their new book.
Hannah Means-Shannon: Jeff, what made you decide you wanted to write a story that centered so much around technology, or at least the ways in which technology affects life in big ways?
Jeff Lemire: I think it's just a projection of the world we live in. The difference between humanity's reliance on technology from when I was a kid in the early 80's to the world my own son, now 6, will grow up in is so immense.
Robotics, especially advanced robotics like what we have in the world of Descender, are sort of the ultimate example of this. Machines so complex that they are mirrors of us and become autonomous.
Having said that, I will say that the “humanity” of TIM-21 is at the core of the book, not so much an exploration of technology.
HMS: There are so many details and interesting contrasts in the first issue of Descender alone, like noting population levels at different locations at different points in time. Was it overwhelming creating the detail level for an entire planetary system, their history, and interrelationships?
JL: It was extremely FUN. I spend months building an entire universe. I have a big bible of the galaxy TIM-21 will be traversing. I know each planet, each alien species in great detail, and Dustin and I have worked really hard to give each world a very distinct look and feel. Even if all of this doesn't make it onto the page, I think it will make the world feel more authentic in the end.
We also wanted a very diverse cast, not just robots, but aliens and humans of all kinds.
HMS: People are afraid of what they don't understand and stereotyping or generalizing is certainly one of our most impulse-driven reflexes. Is that kind of knee-jerk reaction partly what this story is about?
JL: Yes, it's not hard to look at our own world, the way we treat each other, the way we react to other cultures and races, and not see this fear and ignorance. So of course, that is a big part of the book. Using science-fiction to comment on that. But, the book isn't “preachy” either. The metaphors aren't that ham-fisted (I hope). There is a lot going on in Descender. A lot of theses running through it. Fear and ignorance being one.
HMS: Can you tell us a little bit about how you developed the character traits and personalities of Doctor Quon and TIM? And why are those traits important to this story?
JL: That's a tough one to answer without tipping my hat about what's to come. A lot of the way Quon and Tim are presented in the opening of the story is informed by where they will be when the story ends.
Quon, in particular, is a pretty complex character. He seems like one thing at the beginning of the book, but there is a lot going on, and a lot that will happen, that will force the reader to constantly reframe how they view him. Likewise for Telsa, our other major supporting character.
HMS: How does Descender fit into your wider creative goals right now? Is working on a sci-fi story, for instance, something you try to return to from time to time?
JL: For me, Descender is the culmination of everything I've done. It takes a lot of the themes from Sweet Tooth and Trillium and, hopefully, takes those to a whole new level.
What I'm enjoying most is the sheer freedom. Being able to live in this huge world we've built and do whatever we want. We only have to answer to each other at Image. That freedom is exhilarating and really has me fired up, creatively.
[Variant cover by Jeff Lemire for Issue #1]
HMS: Dustin, here you are on a creator-owned book from Image. I know you've loved working on known characters and re-inventing them in some ways, but what is it like to be composing whole new worlds and characters of a sci-fi variety?
Dustin Nguyen: Its extremely, insanely, FUN. Plus being its a whole new property that we start from the ground up, there are no restrictions or limitations, we can truly cut loose and do whatever the hell we want – which is the best part when it comes to making up new characters and worlds.
HMS: What has your process been like on a book that requires so much design and no doubt consistency? Do you have to do endless personal reference sketches for locations and characters?
DN: It's actually been pretty freaking relaxing. Being Jeff and I are the only ones to answer to each other, it just makes it a TON easier, fewer cooks in the kitchen! We throw sketches and notes back and forth, it's easy to reference your own work as well, and if anything needs changing or to be made up on the fly, I do it right there on the page. I trust Jeff to write amazing stories, and he trusts me to tell that story the way I see works. It's how comics should be done, I think.
HMS: Can you tell us a little bit about what elements influenced your design of spaceships and city-scapes and space-stations in the first issue?
DN: I grew up on mostly Transformers G1 material, and endless Macross/ Robotech mecha. I think you'll see a lot of that…that clunky, very old-school style of machinery. I admit, its a bit dated in design, but damn I love it. Of course, in a setting as big as the one we're creating, I also draw influences from plenty of other things so that we can vary different civilizations and cultures, relating to the anthropology of their inhabitants.
Stylistically, A lot of my actual interior and space station designs are call backs to the earlier years before comics, when I was doing 3D mechanical design and HVAC for different architectural firms. Again, probably dated in design, but I have a ton of fun drawing it.
[Sketch by Dustin Nguyen of TIM 21]
HMS: How did you devise the “look” of TIM's unfolding of robot capabilities in the full-page spread in issue #1? Were there other iterations before you settled on this version?
DN: That was based off Jeff's description of how TIM 21 reacts when threatened- kinda freaky. I did a few takes on it, but it was mostly to get TIM's human aspects the way I wanted and not so much the robot parts. I sort of imagined it the way a Siamese fighting fish male flares out its gills when it sees another, or its own reflection.
HMS: What sorts of things are you most looking forward to illustrating as Descender continues?
DN: There's a flashback sequence Jeff just wrote and the storytelling elements in it is fantastic. Besides that- the most exciting thing will be us trying out different ways to tell this gigantic story based around TIM, and having as much fun as we can. Oh, and some sweet aliens and robots :)
Descender #1 arrives from Image Comics on March 4th in a 30 page opening issue for $2.99. It is currently listed in PreviewsWorld with item code: JAN150567
*Side note: You really have to check out Dustin Nguyen's Tumblr for teaser images in process for Descender and other cool stuff. Jeff Lemire's blogspot will also keep you up to date on his approximately one million equally interesting comics projects.

There have always been those few apps that insist on looking like their physical, real world, equivalent. Calculator apps, date books, calendars, note taking apps, “stickies” — you know what I am talking about. Despite there being better options out there, better ways of displaying the data, designers stick with the known representation of the tool.
Now, though, Apple is taking it too far.
If you have seen any of the screenshots linked across the web about the new iCal interface you know what I am talking about. If you haven't seen those, iCal is looking a lot like it does on the iPad right now in Lion's developer preview. It's ugly, and we should be way past this style by now.
I have proposed a better calendaring solution and Marco Arment has talked about what he would like to see as well. The problem right now is that we have the graphics processing power and the design acumen to make realistic looking interfaces, and designers think they should make them look realistic.
Who wants that?
In theory, and perhaps in movies, this is a great look — in fact from an eye candy perspective it looks amazing. The problem is that these apps that mimic a real world interface make for pretty terrible computing interfaces. Real interfaces, those printed on paper for calendars, or molded out of plastic for calculators are static — computing interfaces are dynamic. The difference is that to make a sheet of paper show 7 days worth of appointments means that you have to print all seven days. Once it is past the first day it would be impossible to dynamically shift the content so that it keeps the seven forward looking days view. On the computer though this is easily done, yet no one does it — why?
I guess it is because that is not how paper calendars work, and that is just a silly convention to stick with.
In the early days of computing modeling interfaces, such as a calculator, after an actual calculator was very user friendly because users had a base understanding of how to work a calculator already. This lowered the bar for the prerequisite knowledge to use early applications. Ditto apps like calendars, datebooks and address books.
Now, I would guess that most “new” computer users actually don't know that these things are mimicking their physical counterparts — well they know in the sense that it looks like a physical good, but I doubt they every think: “I used to have a calculator just like this one”.
How many teenagers today are likely to have ever owned or used a DayRunner? Mimicking these interfaces is not about creating a more usable interface, or about giving the consumer what they know — it is about creating eye candy, while the usability and productivity of the app suffers. Eye candy can aid a design and the usability — as it did with the first computer applications — more often though is forces the app to look and behave in a manner that is not very helpful to the user.
Ask any person who has used Soulver for Mac or iOS if they think Soulver was difficult to figure out — it is leaps and bounds better than any other calculator app, yet it doesn't look like any other calculator app. It took me all of two minutes to figure out how to work the app and to realize just how much better it is. What Soulver did was not try to replicate the beloved HP 12c, instead they rethought what a calculator app was to be — and how it should be designed if it is only made for use on a computer, from day one.
It is what calculators would have been if they were invented at the same time computers were, instead of what we have with most calculator apps.
Little Bits of Paper
Brent Simmons calls it Torn Paper Derangement Syndrome (TPDS) and I most certainly have it:
If this rumored new UI for iCal is real and not just a mockup by a misanthropic Photoshop sadist, then I'm going to be distracted forever by the bits of torn paper under the toolbar.
When I used paper notepads in school I would take an Exacto knife to remove those bits of paper weekly — can't stand it. It is a sign of a flawed product — one that is designed to tear with ease and perfection at the top, but that never lives up to its expectation, much like checks (remember tearing those out). Why remind everyone of the imperfect days of yore by bring that bit of imperfection across. That is akin to Microsoft deciding that Excel should stop calculating pi after 3.14 — stupid and pointless given the tools at hand today.
Nobody misses those bits of paper. Nobody wants iCal to look like their Franklin Covey — people want it to work like that, but not look like that. That is: people love the feel of pen and paper and scratching stuff off, but that feeling is not best replicated through showing static, arbitrary, bits of torn paper. People love how organized they became with these old school paper tools, yet instead of taking that organization to the next level with computing we just get the same thing we had in paper form (less the paper cuts and waste).
The way to get people to love a calendar app is not to make it look like what they used 10 years ago, but to make it better than what they used 10 years ago. So far the only feature we have that consistently works is alarms that sound 15 minutes prior to meetings. Not even invites work on a regular, consistent basis across all devices.
Feels Nice
The best part about how these interfaces work is how they feel — can't you feel the texture of the paper grain as you move your mouse pointer over it? Wait, all I feel is the glass desk below my mouse and subtle twinge of annoyance as I pass by the intended resting spot for my mouse pointer. We can't feel the textures drawn on the screen.
Real life interfaces are made to be pressed with the wide human finger, to be grasped in your hand and held in your briefcase. That's why buttons can never be too small and why writing zones are large and the physical size is critically important. That's also why a lot of these interfaces transfer nicely to touch based devices like the iPad or iPhone. That's also why they suck so much on a ‘regular' computer — a mouse pointer is tiny and doesn't need huge click zones. Fonts are legible at small sizes and don't need huge areas to fill. Screen sizes are anything but static and the interface needs to work well on all of them.
There is a separation between the needs of the real world and the needs of the computer world. Making direct porting of interfaces a poor decision.
Looks Great, Sucks to Use
I can't tell you how many apps there are that I could say the above about. Then there's the small subset of apps that seem to really get how people actually want to, and do use, their apps — those are the apps that just leave you saying: wow.
These are the apps we need and crave.
It's great that you spent 16 hours making that wood grain and stainless steel look exactly like the real thing — looks nice — but does your app work? Does your app make sense?
Calvetica isn't good because it works like a DayRunner — it's good because it works well with my fat fingers tapping at a slick, backlit, glass screen. It works because when I turn in to landscape the information changes, it works because they thought about how people use the product (yet, they have not solved Marco's complaint, nor most of mine.) The subtle texture of the Reeder background doesn't make me love the app more, the navigation and presentation of only what is important makes me love the app. I don't think OmniFocus on the iPad is better than it is on the Mac because it looks more like a paper check list — I know it is better because it shows me only what I really need to see at any given time.
Some of the apps that are coming out for mixing boards and DJ scratching — they all look really cool, but they suck to use. You can't physically turn a knob on the iPad screen — so why make knobs an essential part of your interface?
Why haven't people figured this out yet?
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- When New England Patriots director of player personnel Nick Caserio met with reporters before last year's draft, he said, "If we had to go out there and play today, we could play. But the season doesn't start today, so we'll continue to build the team and try to do what we think is best for the organization."
One year later, it's a similar picture.
Through a flurry of roster additions via trades and free agency, the club already has 76 players under contract (or will once all deals become official). That's a bit more than the norm at this time. Many of the most pressing needs have been filled, but there's still work to be done from both a short- and long-term perspective.

Here's one viewpoint of the positions that look most likely for the Patriots to target early in the draft:
1. Running back. From initial research, if a player like Utah's Devontae Booker is there late in the second round, he'd be an ideal fit for what the Patriots do offensively. I view him as a prospect who plays faster than his timed speed and who catches the ball well, which makes him a three-down option. Adding youth and playmaking skill at running back would be one of the final pieces to complement the team's other moves at the skill positions this offseason.
2. Cornerback. The top three players on the depth chart return in 2016 -- Malcolm Butler, Logan Ryan and Justin Coleman -- and there's also 2015 seventh-round pick Darryl Roberts, who flashed quality ball skills before landing on season-ending injured reserve in the preseason. So any addition would be with the future in mind (Butler and Ryan enter the final year of their contracts) and a physical press corner like Maryland's Sean Davis stands out in initial draft research as a Patriots-type fit with one of their early picks.
3. Offensive tackle. With starting right tackle Sebastian Vollmer and swing tackle Marcus Cannon entering the final year of their contracts, feeding the developmental pipeline should be on the radar. Initial draft research leads to Texas Tech's Le'Raven Clark as a prospect who might pique the team's interest with an early pick based on his unique physical traits and system fit.
4. Defensive tackle. The projected No. 2 (Alan Branch) and No. 3 (Terrance Knighton) players at the position are closer to the end of their careers than the beginning, and have contracts that expire after the 2016 season. If Alabama's Jarran Reed ever slipped to the bottom of the second round, he'd be hard to pass up, while Texas' Hassan Ridgeway has some uncommon traits that could entice the Patriots to take a closer look with the future in mind.
5. Wide receiver. One of the older positions on the roster, the Patriots could benefit from adding a younger pass-catcher to the developmental pipeline. Pittsburgh's Tyler Boyd, who some scouts view as one of the better route-runners in the draft, looks like a possible fit based on initial draft research, while Will Fuller of Notre Dame brings an element of speed that could intrigue.
"He's getting close," Roberts said after Kershaw threw 55 pitches to test the strained lower back that put him on the disabled list July 24. "There's zero chance [of Kershaw starting for the Dodgers on Saturday instead]. There's a level of intensity that continues to heighten, from bullpen to simulated game to Triple-A where you're competing. You continue to ramp up as far as intensity, and crossing that marker makes everyone feel better."
PITTSBURGH -- Clayton Kershaw will make a rehab start for Triple-A Oklahoma City on Saturday before returning to the Dodgers' starting rotation, manager Dave Roberts said after Kershaw's successful four-inning simulated game on Monday.

An impatient Kershaw believes the rehab start is unnecessary.
"Health-wise, I could have pitched in the big leagues 10 days ago. But that's not the plan, obviously," Kershaw said. "I don't feel I missed much time. I kept throwing all the way through. I guess it's the luxury we have as a team.
"You can't simulate a Major League game. You've just got to do it. Sim games are really hard. You try to create intensity, but you can't and it's really not a good recipe, but I guess it's what you have to do."
Roberts said he understands Kershaw's desire for a fast return, but he's sticking with the original plan.
"For us, I think that's the way it should be as far as his potential to pitch for us," said Roberts, "but taking all the information from the medical staff, that's the prudent decision and we think the right thing to do."

Kershaw faced Enrique Hernandez, Chase Utley and batting coach Turner Ward in the sim game that was observed by Roberts, in addition to pitching coach Rick Honeycutt and a handful of teammates, who split time staring at the solar eclipse with protective glasses.
Austin Barnes caught the sim game, and he said Kershaw threw all of his pitches and there was "no tail-off" as the session progressed. Kershaw appeared typically overpowering, although he seemed annoyed with a lack of command at the end of the third inning.
"It's just Kershaw being the perfectionist he always is," said Barnes. "When the ball doesn't go exactly where he wants it, that's what makes him so good. From the bullpen, looks like the same Kershaw to me."
Honeycutt said Kershaw's Monday session was changed from three innings to four to work in an extra up and down with rest in between innings, which Honeycutt believes is more critical to coming back from an injury than merely a pitch count.

A cyclist who narrowly escaped being mugged by a gang of balaclava-clad teenagers is warning others to avoid Hackney Marshes after dark.

Chris Noyes, 36, was on his way home from work at 9pm on Thursday when he noticed a group of boys blocking the path ahead of him.
As he approached the pack he tried to swerve past but almost veered into the River Lea when one of the teenagers, the only one showing his face, tried to grab his arm.
“The one guy, he looked about 17, got hold of my arm and was saying ‘alright mate' to me quite threateningly while trying to stop me,” explained Chris.
“I managed to get rid of his grip but I'm really worried now. I know people who go down there and I've told everyone not to now, especially all the girls I know. I think something has got to be done.”
Barclays worker Chris said the attempted assault took place between Hackney Wick and the Lea Bridge, near the Princess of Wales pub in Lea Bridge Road.
After stopping further down the path he spoke to another cyclist who had also encountered the gang.
He phoned police, who had also received two other calls, at about the same time, about similar incidents in the area.
Officers arrived at the scene and arrested two 14-year-old boys on suspicion of handling stolen goods. Both have since been bailed until early April pending further enquiries.
Hackney officers continue to investigate the incident and inquiries continue.
A police spokesman said: “We received three separate calls by members of the public at around 9.20pm on Thursday to reports of a group of youths acting in an intimidating manner in the vicinity of the towpath by the River Lea.
“Anyone who has concerns or wishes to report an incident to police can do so via 101 or in an emergency dial 999.”

This plush is a commission for and is not for sale. My commissions are currently full.OOohhhhh man am I excited about this one :] I already love this character so when the opportunity to make her in her rank outfit presented itself I didn't hesitate to take on the project. As with Soarin her outfit is not removable to keep it looking nice and fitted. I was originally going to make her aviator glasses but I got the idea to check Build-A-Bear's accessories section and I found the PERFECT pair - they even fit her face without needing any string to secure them. The insignia on her outfit is embroidered as well. The commissioner created a custom-made audio unit for Spitfire - she has 6 unique phrases from the episode "Wonderbolt Academy." I'm going to take some footage tomorrow before she is shipped so you guys can seeThanks for looking!
WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE:
Abundant clinical data now confirm that ketamine produces a remarkable rapid-onset antidepressant effect - hours or days - in contrast to the delayed onset (typically weeks) of current antidepressant drugs. This surprising and revolutionary finding may lead to the development of life-saving pharmacotherapy for depressive illness by reducing the high suicide risk associated with the delayed onset of effect of current drugs. As ketamine has serious self-limiting drawbacks that restrict its widespread use for this purpose, a safer alternative is needed. Our objective is to review the proposed mechanism(s) of ketamine's rapid-onset antidepressant action for new insights into the physiological basis of depressive illness that may lead to new and novel targets for antidepressant drug discovery.
METHODS:
A search was conducted on published literature (e.g. PubMed) and Internet sources to identify information relevant to ketamine's rapid-acting antidepressant action and, specifically, to the possible mechanism(s) of this action. Key search words included 'ketamine', 'antidepressant', 'mechanism of action', 'depression' and 'rapid acting', either individually or in combination. Information was sought that would include less well-known, as well as well-known, basic pharmacologic properties of ketamine and that identified and evaluated the several hypotheses about ketamine's mechanism of antidepressant action.
RESULTS:
Whether the mechanistic explanation for ketamine's rapid-onset antidepressant action is related to its well-known antagonism of the NMDA (N-Methyl-d-aspartate) subtype of glutamate receptor or to something else has not yet been fully elucidated. The evidence from pharmacologic, medicinal chemistry, animal model and drug-discovery sources reveals a wide variety of postulated mechanisms.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION:
The surprising discovery of ketamine's rapid-onset antidepressant effect is a game-changer for the understanding and treatment of depressive illness. There is some convergence on NMDA receptor antagonism as a likely, but to date unproven, common mechanism. The surprising number of other mechanisms, and the several novel biochemical aetiologies of depression proposed, suggests exciting new drug-discovery targets.

BAKERSFIELD, Calif. -- A police Medal of Valor winner is under investigation after allegations that he improperly handled the corpse of a man shot by officers - and even joked about tickling his feet.
Senior Officer Aaron Stringer was placed on paid administrative last November, two days after 22-year-old Ramiro Villegas was killed after a car chase, according to a police statement issued Monday. Stringer was under internal investigation over an allegation that he manipulated the body, the statement said, but did not provide details.
Police declined to release additional information Monday.
Villegas' family is described by CBS Bakersfield affiliate KBAK-TV as outraged over the allegations.
Villegas was in his mother's car on Nov. 13 when he fled police, got off a highway and crashed into a signal light pole. Ordered out of the car, he was shot after officers said he approached them and reached toward his waistband. No gun was found.
A claim filed against the city by his mother said Villegas was shot by four officers even though he was nonviolent and had his hands up. The Police Department ruled the shooting was justified.
Stringer wasn't involved in the shooting, but he and a probationary officer he was training went to the scene and then to a hospital to view the body, according to police reports cited by the Bakersfield Californian.
The trainee, Lindy DeGeare, said Villegas's body was covered with a sheet and lying on a gurney. Another officer who was assigned to watch the body described it as having gunshots to the head, eye, arm and genital area, DeGeare told investigators, according to the reports.
Stringer put on gloves, pulled down the sheet to expose Villegas's head and upper body and looked at the wounds. He touched the bottom of Villegas's uncovered feet and said "tickle, tickle," then pulled on the toes of the right foot and said rigor mortis hadn't set in, DeGeare stated.
He also moved Villegas' head and, finding it difficult, said he believed rigor mortis had set in, then told DeGeare he "loves playing with dead bodies" and laughed, according to the reports.
The other officer in the room said he witnessed Stringer touch Villegas' foot and grasp his jaw, according to the reports.
Police Chief Greg Williamson told the Californian on Friday that Stringer's alleged comments were disturbing and that while it is part of an officer's field training to view bodies, touching them is not allowed.
In February, police submitted a criminal report on Stringer's actions to the Kern County district attorney's office but the case was rejected, District Attorney Lisa Green said Monday.
"That isn't a crime, while it may be disgusting," Green said, referring to his alleged manipulation of the body.
"Certainly I think anybody would recognize that's an inappropriate thing to do," Bakersfield Police Sgt. Joe Grubbs told KBAK-TV Monday.
"It is disturbing," Villegas' sister, Sarina Gobzalez, told the station. "And the citizens should be concerned about this, because these are our public offices who are here and sworn to protect us."
Joe Arambulo, who says he's Villegas' brother, told KBAK he wants Bakersfield police to take action.
"If there's not going to be criminal charges, if the D.A. doesn't want to step up and prosecute these officers, then at least take his job," Arambulo said. "Get him off our streets. Don't let him serve the public no more. It's more of a hazard than anything."
Sgt. Grubbs says if the internal investigation finds wrongdoing by Stringer, that process could recommend anything from written reprimand to dismissal from the department.
Villegas' sister asks the police chief to take action.
"It's not OK (Chief) Greg Williamson," she said. "Your community is crying out for justice."
There are laws against desecrating corpses physically and against moving corpses from the place of death without coroner's permission but "he did neither of those," D.A. Green said.
However, Mark Geragos, an attorney for Villegas's mother, said that if Stringer did touch the body before it had been autopsied, that could have consequences for the investigation of the shooting. "Besides it being ghoulish behavior...it's tampering with evidence, obviously," Geragos said.
Geragos said he intends to sue over the killing and will include the allegations of body manipulation.
The Associated Press was unable to find a working telephone number for Stringer. A message seeking comment from him or his attorney was left with the Bakersfield Police Officers Association but not immediately returned.
A message also was left with H. A. Sala, an attorney who represented Stringer after he was arrested on suspicion of hit-and-run and driving under the influence of a prescription sleeping pill in 2010. He pleaded no contest to a "wet and reckless" charge and was fined and ordered to attend a Department of Motor Vehicles class.
Last year, Stringer shot and killed a man who charged at him with a metal bicycle lock. Stringer also holds a 2009 Medal of Valor for saving his partner during a shootout in which both were wounded.
Both shootings were ruled justified by the department.

Steffen Gillom is a student at the School for International Training in Brattleboro and is helping to start an NAACP chapter in Windham County.
For more information, or to join the Windham County NAACP unit, send an email to windhamsocialjustice@gmail.com .
BRATTLEBORO—Windham County may soon get its first National Association for the Advancement of Colored People chapter.
Founded in 1909, the NAACP is the nation's oldest civil rights organization. They describe their mission as being “to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate race-based discrimination.”
There are more than 2,000 NAACP units across the country, and more than 500,000 members. A staff member at the national headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland, said that since the presidential elections, the organization has seen an “enormous increase” in memberships, interest, and donations, and units are getting established in long-underserved areas, such as Grosse Pointe, Michigan.
Vermont is another long-underserved area.
Until February 2015, with the founding of the Burlington unit, there were no Vermont NAACP chapters specifically for adult members. (Norwich University started a youth chapter in 2013, and Rutland is in the process of getting an adult chapter.)
But Southern Vermont has none.
That may change.
Two School for International Training students, Steffen Gillom and Jesse Roaza, are leading the effort to set up the Windham County NAACP unit.
Gillom serves as SIT's Diversity Fellow in the Department of Student Affairs. Roaza is the Project Coordinator for Wilmington Works and formerly worked with the Windham County Sheriff's Department.
Although Gillom and Roaza only began collecting the required 100 signatures to form the unit at the end of November, they are more than halfway to their goal.
The requirements to join are simple. “You must be affiliated with the community in some way — you live or work in Windham County,” Roaza said.
Membership is open to all races, Roaza said, noting the organization was founded by African-Americans and Caucasians. The NAACP website's membership page says, “If you care about fighting the racial disparities that are still too prevalent in America, the NAACP is the place where you can make a difference."
“As a young person of color, it's exciting for me to have [the NAACP] here,” Gillom said, noting, “it's important to have representation."
“Steffen will likely become president,” of the chapter once it gets its charter, Roaza said. After elections, the president forms an executive committee and chooses representatives from various towns in the county.
The members will form additional committees focusing on relevant issues in the county, such as awareness, needs assessment, education, and organizational diversity, Roaza said.
Roaza, who is part Korean-Filipino and part Irish, expressed the need for more knowledge about different races and ethnicities in Windham County.
“I've had instances of going into delis and people think I'm homeless,” Roaza said. He mentioned another incident: he brought some fellow SIT students to a former food establishment in the area. The other students were Muslim. They were denied service.
“I didn't debate my own self-identity until I got here,” Roaza said. “I stick out here. I'm half-Asian and half-White. I've always been proud of being bi-racial."
“But here, I'm often asked what country I'm from,” Roaza said.
Roaza is from Florida.
“In the South we talk about racism, because the new generation doesn't want to be racist like their grandparents,” Roaza said, “But here in the Northeast, we don't really talk about racism until something horrible happens. Then, the conversation starts."
“I love living here,” he said, “but I can't believe the South does [racial] things better! We're supposed to be so liberal here."
Roaza attributes this disconnect to too few people of color in the area. But, since moving here a few years ago, he has noticed Brattleboro's diversity increasing.
Starting the NAACP chapter is right on time, he said.
“Steffen and I were talking about forming this [unit] before the elections, but the catalyst was the [Presidential] elections,” Roaza said.
“Within days after the elections, I saw pickup trucks [in the area] with Confederate flags on them,” he said.
For Gillom, the days after the presidential election brought this experience: he was walking on a public road and someone in a passing car yelled a racial slur at him.
“It caught me off-guard because he just so casually said it. It brought it home. It was disheartening,” said Gillom, who is of African-American, Native American, and European-American descent.
“I've never felt so vulnerable,” he said.
“Being a young professional in the working world, I faced discriminatory biases, too, and it's my responsibility to do something about it,” said Gillom, who is originally from the Midwest.
Gillom is undecided whether he will continue living here after his studies are finished, “but I want to make sure the NAACP is here and is running."
“My biggest concerns are for people of color living outside of Brattleboro. The further you get from Brattleboro ... the language changes, the body language changes, I get more people telling me to ‘go back to my country,'” Roaza said.
He wondered what it's like to live in a town with only a few people of color.
“Those people are more vulnerable,” he said, “and that's what scares me."
Gillom and Roaza have reached out to other social and racial justice organizations in the area to collaborate, and have received encouragement from them, from the Windham County Young Professionals group, Wilmington Works, and from the Windham County legislative delegation.
Roaza believes the NAACP's biggest advantage, “other than the power of its name, is keeping a dialogue with other institutions. The NAACP has always emphasized the importance of an open line of communication."
“A lot of people have talked about their fears of the upcoming president,” Roaza said. “Vermont has a lot of issues, but I like that this county in particular has people who care a lot and who want to get involved ... That's what I want to contribute, a place for people to voice their concerns and work for civil rights in the county."
“I'm just here to be chill and get shit done,” Gillom said.

The Obama administration is giving an extra window of opportunity to Americans who begin the Affordable Care Act signup process by the March 31 deadline but don't finish it before the day's over.
Under the new law, most uninsured Americans must either purchase a health insurance plan or pay a penalty. The White House's new grace period for signups does not constitute a delay in the institution of that penalty. Instead, it's being cast as a small window of opportunity for those who begin the process by the deadline day but are unable to finish signing up for technical or other reasons.
“Open enrollment ends March 31,” Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement. “We are experiencing a surge in demand and are making sure that we will be ready to help consumers who may be in line by the deadline to complete enrollment—either online or over the phone.”
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus criticized the Obama administration's new signup window as a “delay.”

“Another day, another Obamacare delay from the same Obama administration that won't work with Republicans to help Americans suffering from the unintended consequences of the Democrats' failed healthcare law,” said Priebus in a statement. “Democrats in leadership may say they are doubling down on Obamacare but you have to wonder how many more unilateral delays their candidates running in 2014 can withstand.”
White House spokesman Jay Carney hinted at a possible Obamacare signup extension late last week.

I was sitting at Stern Dining last night in an attempt to keep myself awake to study. That location is a pretty mixed bag when it comes to people working quietly, laughing with their friends, or just grabbing a bite to eat from The Dish. Last night was one of the particularly noisier times and one subject repeatedly surfaced amongst different groups. I first noticed a rather obnoxious animated group of freshmen boys behind me gather around a laptop, laughing about some “hilarious” email that got leaked at USC. A few minutes later, the girls at a table to my left started talking about a link shared on Facebook about USC's chapter of Kappa Sigma being under investigation. It came full circle when the friend I was sitting with read aloud from one of the most vile and offensive emails I've had the displeasure of seeing.
The intent of the email, reportedly sent by an unidentified member of the fraternity, was to start a “Gullet Report” about which girls are most willing to have sex and which brothers are getting the most action. One of the earliest lines in the email reads:
Note: I will refer to females as “targets”. They aren't actual people like us men. Consequently, giving them a certain name or distinction is pointless.”
And it just gets worse and worse from there. The author runs down a list of key terms, describing different types of “pie” (vaginas) and the various methods to be utilized to “take down” certain targets. One such example is the Loop n' Doop:
Loop n' Doop: A target that is very easy to take down. All she takes is a good amount of liquor (loop) and she will be good to go for you to f*ck her (doop). Be careful with loop n' doops, because too much loop and they will get sick and be useless entities.
The young man becomes increasingly misogynistic as the letter continues. As if it weren't enough to reduce women to sexual targets and describe activities bordering sexual assault, he is sure to include different pie-related (blackberry, lemon meringue, etc.) code words for “targets” of various races. He asks his brothers to avoid having relations with Middle-Eastern girls, telling them to “exhibit some patriotism and have some pride. You want your c*** smelling like falafel? Filth.” I am unable to (and have no desire to) fully articulate the extent of the repulsive and derogatory language used in the email, but you can find it in its entirety on Jezebel.
Commentors have suggested that the email was meant for entertainment, but few are finding its disgusting content funny. As reported by the Daily Trojan, Kappa Sigma's nationals are currently holding an investigation. The same article contains quotes from the chapter president as well as the presidents of USC's Panhellenic council and Interfraternity council. Many are apologizing, calling the email insulting and degrading. It is apparently yet to be determined who actually wrote the document. In fact, there is some speculation amongst the aforementioned officers about whether “such a member exists”, as though the dissemination of the email was an elaborate scheme to slander Kappa Sigma's reputation.
There are still few substantial answers available, but one enraged USC student has gone to Jezebel with her version of events. According to the anonymous student, the email was originally written in January. Its author supposedly meant for it to be taken quite seriously and actually did receive gullet reports from his frat brothers. The student expressed her anger at the author, the Daily Trojan, and university officials for the handling of the events in three main points.
1. the email is real, NOT SATIRE/A JOKE, and 100% originated from USC's Kappa Sig. I even heard the author actually received “gullet reports.” 2. The author has been expelled from the frat – but only now that this has come to light. The original email was sent in January. 3. IFC, Kappa Sig, and the Daily Trojan are obfuscating the facts to try and put the blame outside USC and save the image of the Greek system/the university.
Here is her full explanation of the events leading up to the leak, the name of the frat brother who authored it, and details on his expulsion from the fraternity. Seeing how fast the email spread around Stern Dining, you can imagine how fast it spread on the web. In addition to Jezebel, The Huffington Post and various other news outlets have covered the story. To my surprise, Total Frat Move does not appear to have made any comment.
On April 19, The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York inaugurates the 2016 Roof Garden commission, a large-scale work by celebrated British artists Cornelia Parker.
The work, entitled Transitional Object (PsychoBarn) is installed on top of the museum, in the Roof Garden space which, in the past years, has accommodated site-specific works by Pierre Huyghe (2015), Dan Graham & Günther Vogt (2014), and Imran Qureshi (2013).

This year's commission went to the British artist Cornelia Parker (1956) best-known for her large scale sculptural works and installations, which have been widely covered through solo exhibitions at the Venice Biennale, the Serpentine Gallery in London, and the The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth; along with being included in the permanent collection of several major art museums, including Tate, MET, de Young Museum, MoMA, Centre Pompidou, and Victoria and Albert Museum.

Transitional Object (PsychoBarn), on view from April 19 through October 31, looks like a real house, although reduced in size, but it is actually a sort of cinema set, an illusion composed of two facades attached to a scaffolding.
In conceiving her work, indeed, Cornelia Parker was inspired by some very “cinematographic” archetypes, namely the paintings of Edward Hopper, the traditional American red barns, and the sinister house Alfred Hitchcock imagined as the perfect family abode for the disturbed character of Norman Bates in Psycho (1960), which was clearly inspired by Hopper's painting House by the Railroad (1925).

This new iconic work by Parker combines several elements into one piece, the architectural reference to rural American (and British) architecture embodied by the barn, the visual contrast between the small red house and the Manhattan skyline, the quasi-real building made with pieces recovered from a real barn in the State of New York, the psychoanalytic theory of transitional (or comfort) objects used by children as a means to balance their imaginary and private universe with the fear for the outer reality (such as that epitomized by the security blanket of Linus Van Pelt), and the fascination with cinema, including those cultural cross-references between England and the United States so evident in the work of a successful expat like Alfred Hitchcock.

It was an apparent fact that spread quickly across Reddit and the Web as a whole: Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) had declared Reddit's r/MensRights section a hate group.
It was a stunning condemnation of the 30,000-strong community from an organization whose authoritative reports are widely cited in national media and academia.
The Daily Dot first reported on the news when it broke two weeks ago. However, after I repeated the fact in a recent article, multiple people reached out to me saying it simply wasn't true. They noted that, while the SPLC did write about the subreddit in a so-called “intelligence report” about misogynistic sites, it never formally classified r/MensRights as a hate group.
We reached out to SPLC Intelligence Report Editor Mark Potok. Here's what he told us in an email:
“It's false. We wrote about the subreddit Mens Rights, but we did not list it as a hate group . . . “In almost all cases, we list hate groups at the end of each calendar year when we publish lists. I very much doubt we would ever list the Reddit [r/MensRights] in question—it's a diverse group, which certainly does include some misogynists—but I don't think that's [its basic] purpose.”
So, there you have it: r/MensRights is too diverse for simple classifications. It's not a hate group.

Intro
Team Fortress 2 has seen its fair share of Invitationals, over multiple gamemodes and continents. Recently, however, there haven't been much. That's about to be remedied, however, as the 2015 Highlander Draft is about to begin!
The idea for this invitational was brought up a while back, and went through a few changes under community suggestion to form what it is currently being run today. For now, we'll focus on the part of the tournament that is currently active – the Premier division. As with any draft, a few captains were picked, including among its ranks names such as Satan, sigafoo, Justin Time, and stabby, as well as a few others.
Those captains, eight in total, went through a snake draft to form their teams. The first captain would pick first, second would pick second, and so on until the eighth, who picked the final of the first round and then the first of the second round. The seventh would then pick second, so on and so forth until all the spots were filled out. Of course, the captains themselves were playing, meaning only eight rounds of picking were required to fill out the rosters.
Teams
Obviously, with the draft concluded, the important part is the teams. Luckily enough, some of the captains were willing to give their own predictions - the exceptions being brick and stabby, who for their own reasons declined to give predictions. Sigafoo also couldn't, but noted that his guess at a top three were Satan, stabby, and Justin Time's teams. I've left the the list in the order of best to worst average, take it as you will (or not at all!).
Satan Take The Wheel (Average 1.6) (1-1-2-2-2) (Ranked Self 2) Alec CJ Satan Freestate Kresnik User Mojoe Hydr0 Rolls-Royce
Satan's team for this tournament is the highest ranked among the captains, and it's not that difficult to see why. Most of his team have played at the highest levels before, his Support classes being the only exceptions. There's no reason to believe that they can't play at the skill level required, though. Alec and User stick out as players who haven't started on a team in recent history, although the strong bote/.knd presence in CJ, Freestate, Kresnik, and Satan should mean that any rust on some of their players will be well hidden. Hydr0's perhaps not one of the most celebrated Snipers in this tournament, but he should be able to hold his own. Rolls-Royce is in a similar position, where spies like Deer and feint have an obvious one-up when it comes to history, but perhaps this tournament will give him the attention that some people believe he deserves.
Highlander Players (Average 2) (2-3-1-3-1) (Ranked Self 3) Kev Lunacide Gabiduo Giraffe Tiny Niko Jims Justin Time Anon Feint
In loving recreation of an old team, Highlander Players is a roster where no players can be pointed at and said that they might have issues. Some of these players, the flank especially, subbed last season, but are certainly not debilitated by rust. Tiny, Giraffe, and Justin Time have all played on a team together in the past, and should be able to become a coordinated machine easier than other teams might. Their pick classes have always been silently excellent players, never quite achieving the attention given to some, but deserving of it nonetheless. If and when Giraffe can get everyone on his page and following his calls, expect a team that could probably give most Platinum teams next season a run for their money at the very least, let alone the ones in the draft tournament.
Boxlotl or Riot (Average 3.4) (5-4-4-1-3) (Ranked Self 3) Jewfro Connor Classic Hassasin DavyC Scratchy Nursey Yosh Dimento
Dimento's team, Boxlotl or Riot, has an interesting roster. On one hand, players like Nursey and Dimento are players with experience and reputation. Classic, DavyC and Hassasin, on the other hand, don't really have that, unless you're in a part of the community where those players are active or well-known. Overall, though, those three don't have the name recognition that the the first two do. Then you have players like Jewfro and Connor, who've played in mid-high Platinum before and are overall solid, but don't have the reputation that Nursey or Dimento do. Add in Yosh and Scratchy, and there's the team. The pick classes and flank on this team are fantastic, the question is if the combo, Nursey aside, can play at the level they'd need to go toe to toe with combos such as Satan's or Justin Time's.
brick squad (Average 4.4) (4-6-3-5-4) (N/A) Sissel Bobby Daft kid Muma Brick Jordan Alto Comanglia Scruff McGruff
Despite the fact that half of this team has their own circlejerk, there isn't really a member of this team, outside Alto if you buy into the whispers, that sticks out as weak. Jordan, muma, Comanglia, and brick are all fantastic players, but the rest of the team are no slouches themselves. There are certainly names on this team, such as Sissel and Scruff McGruff, that haven't hit the spotlight quite yet, but are by no means bad. Hopefully the team's Mumble atmosphere will be better than some people have assumed, because if everyone's working together, they should be able to do a lot.
TERRY'S CREW HIGHLANDER (Average 5.2) (3-7-5-4-7) (Rated Self 3) Linkuser TERRY CREWS Geosus Yeremy Vanilla Love Nokk Rusty Bodega Bowswer Deer
Terry Crews, the player not the actor, has assembled a team full of players who all have/can perform at a high level, regardless of the roster history for players like Yeremy and Rusty Bodega. Their pick classes and flank should be able to hold themselves against the other teams in the tournament, and even the combo, despite no roster history in upper Plat recently, aren't pushovers in their own right. If their combo can hold themselves against other teams and give their pick classes room to work, they could prove themselves better than a few of the captains seem to imagine. Time will tell if the team can hold their own against the rest of the tournament, but they certainly won't get walked over.
Street Force (Average 6) (8-2-7-8-5) (N/A) Skag Route Melon Rev Karl Ender Metawe Fox stabby
While this team obviously has some fantastic players, it's interesting to see overall such low scores, either indicating a really strong team composition in the tournament overall, or just that everyone loves to troll Route. While Melon and Fox both haven't played much recently, Karl, Ender, and Metawe are all fantastic players, as well as stabby, and should form a strong backbone for the team to work off of. Given that stabby's team faces Satan's first, if the captain estimates are indicative of success, stabby may find himself in the loser's bracket pretty early, which is something that practically nobody on his team is used to. However, with some of the names on this team, it's hard to imagine them being eliminated so early, so expect a good fight regardless.
Route from TG is High Plat (Average 6.2) (7-5-6-7-6) (Rated Self 5) Slemnish Aim Lazy DC Eeriee Person Jackster Valkeri Feroaffer Pomf
While this team's roster is probably the most difficult to pinpoint unless you're well in touch with the UGC community, everyone on this team is an excellent player in their own right, and while even the more attuned may not recognize names such as Lazy or Pomf, there's always the chance for the lesser known like them to step up and give a reason for their name to be known. Some of these players, like Eerie Person and Feroaffer, have already made names for themselves recently, so despite the lack of huge names that other teams may have, overall the team should be fairly solid, with nothing overall sticking out as a potential carry, but nobody really looking like they'd hold the team back.
Sigacrew (Average 7.2) (6-8-8-6-8) (N/A) Angryofficer Etney Spyro Xan Friskily Sigafoo Indust Hng Boredy
With a team full of names like Etney, Indust, Hng and Xan, and the leader rankings so low, it indicates what should be overall an excellent and close tournament. Each part of the team, from combo to pick classes to the flank, all have strong and weak points. If the three or four weak points on the team are taken advantage of, Sigacrew will have a hard time doing much of anything, but if those are protected by the stronger players on the team, they shouldn't be a pushover and could probably give any team in the tournament a close game.
The matches start tonight at 8 EST, so tune in to EXTV to see some top level Highlander while the season has yet to begin!

The BBC is considering a permanent memorial to Sir Bruce Forsyth, who died on Friday at the age of 89.
Amid the tributes to the entertainer, some fans have called for a statue of the entertainer to be erected outside a BBC building.
A spokesperson for the BBC said it would look into the idea of a memorial to mark his 75-year career.
"We are more than happy to look at what would be the most fitting tribute to a BBC showbiz legend."
Councillors in Edmonton, north London - where he was born - are also said to be considering plans to commemorate the Strictly star with a permanent memorial.
Independent Edmonton councillor Nesimi Erbil told The Telegraph he would hope a statue or plaque would be agreed upon in the borough.
The former host of The Generation Game, Play Your Cards Right and The Price is Right started his career at the age of 14 and already has a number of permanent tributes.
Image copyright PA Image caption A bust of Sir Bruce Forsyth already resides at the London Palladium
In 2005, a bronze bust of the entertainer was unveiled at London's Palladium theatre, where he hosted TV's Sunday Night at the London Palladium in the 1950s and 60s.
There is also a special plaque celebrating his record-breaking number of appearances at The Hippodrome in London.
Funeral details for the star have not yet been announced.
On Sunday, his manager Ian Wilson said: "The family have barely discussed let alone finalised arrangements. An announcement will be made in the coming days."
The game show host had not been seen in public for a while before he died.
He stopped hosting Strictly in 2014, and in 2015 he had keyhole surgery after suffering two aneurysms. His health had deteriorated recently after he contracted bronchial pneumonia.

Ah—it's road season again. At least in Australia. This year's TdU made a good effort to include pretty much every aspect of racing—breaks, big sprints, climbs, crashes I didn't talk about, even echelons. Just don't cross-reference it to my picks for the race earlier in the week.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Wall Street should be using your savings account in risky investments.
The Massachusetts Democrat is part of a bipartisan team of senators who introduced new legislation late on Thursday to regulate Wall Street.
“Banking should be boring,” Warren said on Friday's Morning Joe. It's why she, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, Washington Democrat Sen. Maria Cantwell, and Maine Independent Angus King introduced a modernized Glass-Steagall bill, a new version of the 1933 regulation bill. At its core, the bill stops the “too big to fail” banks from using federally-insured money in high-risk investments.
“In 1933, after the Great Depression, we separated what's called commercial banking–that's your checking account, the savings account, the part that has FDIC insurance—from the risk-taking activities, you know the gambling that takes place on Wall Street,” Warren explained. “It took away the boom and bust cycle of the financial industry.”
Wall Street lobbying pushed legislators to get rid of that separation over time; the bill was gutted in 1999.
If her bill passed, nothing would look different for the average consumer, Warren said. But big banks are already putting up a fight.
“The only difference is when they take those risks, they don't get access to your savings account,” she noted.
Warren was quick to note that both sides of the banking industry are important parts to the financial system, but stressed that the two sides shouldn't be connected.
“If you wanna take risks, do it on Wall Street,” Warren said. “But don't do it with deposit money that's federally insured.”
Though Washington gridlock could stop the bipartisan bill, the senator said she is optimistic about her work in Washington.
“My alternative is to throw a shoe at the television set,” she said. “At least when I come here I can work on legislation, I can work on trying to make a difference.”
Does a bureaucrat shit in the woods?
No, he does it in the office hallway.
Environmental Protection Agency managers in the agency's Denver office wrote an email earlier this year begging employees to stop pooping in the hallway, Government Executive reports, after “several incidents” including “an individual placing feces in the hallway.”
Workplace violence expert John Nicoletti consulted EPA management on the issue, warning that the serial pooper(s) would “probably escalate” their “very dangerous” actions.
“Management is taking this situation very seriously and will take whatever actions are necessary to identify and prosecute these individuals,” Deputy Regional Administrator Howard Cantor wrote in the email to employees.
The chaos in Denver isn't limited to the hallway. Toilets have been intentionally clogged with paper towels as well, possibly leaving other employees wondering if the hallway is the best alternative.
Then, in the 21st-century equivalent of a Wild West wanted poster, Cantor asked that anyone who knows anything about the outlaw poopers to come forward. Sadly, no reward has yet been offered.

The 39th Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach may be more than a month away, but some famous folks got the green flag Thursday when they were announced as drivers for "Revved Up to Race," the 37th annual pro/celebrity race that serves as a warm-up for the main event.
Jackson Rathbone of "Twilight," Jesse Metcalfe of "Dallas" and "Desperate Housewives," and funny lady Wanda Sykes are only a few of the those who'll be getting behind the wheel of identical new 210-horsepower Scion FR-S race vehicles and burning through 10 laps in downtown Long Beach on April 20.
The event not only benefits Racing for Kids, a national fundraising program supporting U.S. children's hospitals, but, according to Toyota national motorsports manager Les Unger, allows the celebs to "feel the rush behind the wheel on the famous Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach track."
One tough guy to watch on the curvy 1.97-mile course: former Marine and Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer, who served in Afghanistan and has partnered with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for the Hiring Our Heroes program. And one tough girl: multiple world-record holder and 2012 Olympic medalist in swimming Jessica Hardy, a Long Beach native.
Country artist Lee Greenwood, best known for his patriotic hit “God Bless the U.S.A.,” is scheduled to perform for President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration during the “Make America Great Again!” Welcome Celebration on Jan. 19, the day before he is sworn in.
Additionally, Greenwood's fellow country artist Toby Keith, as well as singer Jennifer Holliday and Southern rock band 3 Doors Down, have been added to the lineup for the pre-inauguration concert, the Inaugural Committee said Friday.

Prior to Friday's unveiling, Cowboy Troy, country band Big & Rich and America's Got Talent singer Jackie Evancho were among the entertainers who were listed as performing at Trump celebrations.
This will mark Greenwood's fourth presidential inauguration ceremony. Previously, he sang during ceremonies for Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush.
“I'm honored to be part of history again and sing for President-elect Donald Trump,” Greenwood said in a statement. “This is a time to overcome challenges in our country and band together. My wife Kim and I are looking forward to the inauguration ceremonies.”
Greenwood, who won a Grammy in 1985 for his hit “I.O.U.” and holds multiple country music-related awards, has a discography that includes 22 studio albums over his career. The song “God Bless the U.S.A.” has been in the top five on the country singles charts three times (in 1991, 2001, and 2003), giving it the distinction of being the only song in any genre of music to achieve that feat. It was also No. 1 on the pop charts following the events of 9/11.

1. Introduction
Through posters, the United States government attempted to capture the public's attention during World Wars I and II.
What did these urgent war messages about food look like? What changed in the posters from two time periods?
Read More >>
Voluntary rationing seemed like the best and only realistic approach for a government hesitant to expand its powers
and for a public believed to be comprised of rational, cooperative individuals.
Read More >>
World War I posters encouraged farmers, like other citizens on the homefront, to link their individual efforts directly to the nation's interests.
Many posters suggested that farm work constituted a form of military service.

Practical information did not overwhelm all posters created during WWI.
Nationally distributed posters were often colorful and highly illustrative.

In between the wars businessmen and politicians recognized the importance of the citizen-consumer and sought to influence the behavior of this large population.
Advertisers developed their profession and invented marketing research. FDR used popular media to publicize his New Deal programs.

By 1941, newspapers, newsreels and magazines regularly exposed the American public to photographic images and a new visual environment.
Some posters showed a desire to convey messages that were simultaneously supportive of the war and friendly to private businesses.

Both wars challenged the government to elevate the importance of food production and seemingly mundane daily food habits.
Canning posters depicted reassuring images of abundance (instead of sacrifice) and comforting images of women in the role of homemaker and caretaker.

June 25 (Reuters) - Walt Disney's “presentation map,” which the late animation entrepreneur drew in the 1950s to attract investors to the idea for his legendary theme park “Disneyland,” sold for $708,000 at an auction of Disney memorabilia on Sunday.
The price set a record for a Disney map and was among the highest ever paid for a piece of Disney ephemera at auction, organizers said. Still, it fell short of the predicted $900,000.
“After some pretty exciting bidding, the map sold for $708,000, making it the most expensive Disneyland map ever sold,” said Mike Van Eaton, co-owner of Van Eaton Galleries.
“We are beyond thrilled that the map will continue to be appreciated and cherished just like it has been for all these years,” he said.
The buyer was not revealed.
The map was one of the highlights of some 700 lots at the “Collecting Disney” auction, held by Van Eaton Galleries in Los Angeles. The sale of items drawn mostly from private collections was expected take in between $2 million and $3 million.
Disney co-founded an animation studio in 1923, which eventually grew into a feature film production studio with films such as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” “Bambi” and “Cinderella.” He died in 1966 aged 65.
The Walt Disney Company is now one of Hollywood's top players, producing live action and animated feature fare. (Editing by Chris Michaud; Editing by Paul Tait)
Color us (not) surprised: after releasing FFIV and FFV on iOS and Android, Square Enix will follow up its mobile gaming efforts with Final Fantasy VI this winter. Veteran fans might miss the game's old school looks, as it'll come with sharper sprites and enhanced graphics similar to the FFV version for these platforms. Those who found the game rather grindy, however, will be glad to know that the game's battle system has been tweaked to make leveling up easier. The next FF port that's slated to come out is Final Fantasy VI: The After Years, but Square Enix's Takashi Tokita says the company might also work on fan favorite FFVII. That depends on whether the previously released games do well, though, so heed our advice: Don't count your chocobos before they hatch.

— Plumes of steam filled a Midtown block just a block from Central Park on Monday, prompting road closures and alarming many.
As CBS2's Hazel Sanchez reported, witnesses said it was a haunting sight as the intimidating white cloud rolled down 58th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues with people running for cover.
“It was pretty scary because I didn't know what was going on,” said witness Alejandra Lopez. “So I started recording, then they started to tell people to leave the area. Then they blocked it off. Yeah, it was a bit scary.”
“When I got here, I saw a little steam coming out already,” added witness Jimmy Morales. “It was a very small amount, but it started around seven, and then it got bigger.”
The Department of Environmental Protection said a water main leaked in front of 106 W. 58th St. around 9:30 a.m., setting off a reaction with an underground steam pipe.
(video credit: Twitter.com/Eteran84)
Towering plumes of blinding steam shot into the air.
The steam also shot right into Joel Reed's Midtown apartment.
“The bedroom was full of steam,” Read said. “When I went down to the lobby, the lobby was full of steam and it was condensing on the walls.”
Officials emphasized that there was no explosion involved in the incident.
“There was no steam pipe explosion. As you can see, it would be a lot worse if there was an actual explosion,” said FDNY Deputy Chief Nicholas Corrado. “But again, we're dealing with high-pressure steam that's in the street here in Manhattan and just some water that might surround the pipe, and to compromise it would create a small steam condition, which it did.”
The steam was later shut down, Con Edison said.
Witnesses said the steam leak was terrifying and messy.
“There was like so much white smoke, and then I started like getting a lot of like wax – this wax substance – on my glasses and on my clothing,” Lopez said.
Hazmat crews tested the substance and the air for any contaminants including asbestos. Their gear was carefully removed and bagged.
The DEP said it has not determined the exact location of the leak, what caused it, and if the age of the infrastructure was a factor.
According to a report by the Center for an Urban Future, about 1,000 miles of the city's 6,785 miles of water mains are over 100 years old, which makes it no surprise that there have been at least 400 water main breaks in all but one year since 1998.
There were 562 water main breaks in 2015 alone.
Some workers were out of their businesses for hours and some motorists couldn't their cars out of a garage, but no one was hurt, 1010 WINS' Juliet Papa reported.
The leak caused the street to buckle, and it remained closed to traffic while repairs were made. Crews were still hard at work on repairs as late at 9:30 p.m.

A 61-year-old man found himself getting drunk without ever drinking alcohol because he had brewer's yeast in his gut. Basically, whenever he ate any carbs, the man's intestinal tract would start turning that into beer and make him drunk. He had a brewery in his belly. The man had been recorded with a 0.37 BAC level without drinking at all, or almost five times the legal limit for driving in Texas.The patient had an infection with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cordell says. So when he ate or drank a bunch of starch — a bagel, pasta or even a soda — the yeast fermented the sugars into ethanol, and he would get drunk. Essentially, he was brewing beer in his own gut. Cordell and McCarthy reported the case of "auto-brewery syndrome" a few months ago in the International Journal of Clinical Medicine.
Why Justin Bieber is an underrated antihero
When it comes to retaliation against rulers one opposes I prefer the kill their sons and rape their daughters approach outlined in the Völundarkviða, but calling for extrajudicial imprisonment is a pretty good instinct for a 16 year old. I came to expect great things from Bieber. I was not disappointed.
He mocked Orlando Bloom after fucking his supermodel wife Miranda Kerr, then
Bieber displays the characteristics of a great hero of skaldic poetry. He treats the establishment and its rules with the contempt they deserve, leaving a trail of furious onlookers and currently outstanding South American arrest warrants. I can't decide whether he's the Donald Trump or John McAfee of pop. If the lulzy parts of the Internet were not stuck in a mode of reactionary anti-Bieber hatred they would realize that he is, as they say, "based as fuck". If he did anything other than produce pop music most everyone I know would heap praise upon him. The bottomless irreverence of his relentless assault on life is an admirable trait which more of you should emulate.
Because I have always enjoyed Bieber as an individual, I give his music a listen now and then to see if there's anything I enjoy. I never really found him to my taste, but some of the songs from Purpose are actually sounding really good. He has made significant improvement as a musician.
I've added some Bieber tracks to my library for the first time ever, and look forward to adding more. I have a lot of hope for the Biebs in the future. Maybe he'll
Update: After this post was written, it was revealed that Justin Bieber was making America Great Again:
After this revelation, he also got in a street fight with a huge nigger:
Bieber is down for the road war.
It was 2011 when I first became a Belieber. The Commercial Felony Streaming Act was being argued in the Senate, sponsored by Amy Klobuchar. It was a nightmare of a bill that would have made it a felony for you to make performances of copyrighted works. This, incidentally, was how Justin Bieber's career began: singing songs on YouTube. A radio announcer told him about the bill and his thoughts on Senator Klobuchar were that " she should be locked up ... she needs to know that I'm saying she needs to be locked up, put away in cuffs. When it comes to retaliation against rulers one opposes I prefer the kill their sons and rape their daughters approach outlined in the, but calling for extrajudicial imprisonment is a pretty good instinct for a 16 year old. I came to expect great things from Bieber. I was not disappointed.He mocked Orlando Bloom after fucking his supermodel wife Miranda Kerr, then ducked the guy's punch and laughed at him . He told nigger jokes . Just last year he was sued over an anti-semitic incident where he egged a Jew's house . When he was deposed in 2014 on an assault investigation, he displayed Shkreli-tier contempt for legal process:Bieber displays the characteristics of a great hero of skaldic poetry. He treats the establishment and its rules with the contempt they deserve, leaving a trail of furious onlookers and currently outstanding South American arrest warrants. I can't decide whether he's the Donald Trump or John McAfee of pop. If the lulzy parts of the Internet were not stuck in a mode of reactionary anti-Bieber hatred they would realize that he is, as they say, "based as fuck". If he did anything other than produce pop music most everyone I know would heap praise upon him. The bottomless irreverence of his relentless assault on life is an admirable trait which more of you should emulate.Because I have always enjoyed Bieber as an individual, I give his music a listen now and then to see if there's anything I enjoy. I never really found him to my taste, but some of the songs from Purpose are actually sounding really good. He has made significant improvement as a musician.I've added some Bieber tracks to my library for the first time ever, and look forward to adding more. I have a lot of hope for the Biebs in the future. Maybe he'll pull a Clapton on us. You can signal faux superiority if you want by hating on pop music, but I will remain a Belieber.After this post was written, it was revealed that Justin Bieber was making America Great Again:After this revelation, he also got in a street fight with a huge nigger:Bieber is down for the road war.
On Monday afternoon, Jay-Z relaunched his recently purchased music streaming platform Tidal with a huge press conference. It was a really big to-do for the launch of a streaming service, and it was easy to get lost, so here are the main takeaways:
It was cool, but mostly contrived. Alicia Keys delivered a long, ornate speech about the new platform, but actually gave up little to no details about what it actually is, other than that it's the first global music platform owned by artists, and that the program will offer curated playlists and higher quality audio than its competitors. She mostly explained music to us as though we'd never heard it before and claimed that this will be the silver bullet to fix the music industry. She name-dropped Nietzsche. It was really something.
Also, everyone you could possibly think of was there. In addition to Keys, Rihanna, Jason Aldean, Kanye West, Chris Martin, J. Cole, Daft Punk, Calvin Harris, Madonna, Nicki Minaj, Deadmau5, Beyoncé, Usher, Win Butler and Régine Chassagne​, and Jack White were there, and they're all co-owners. They all stepped up to sign this declaration of changing the music industry. It looked like the signing of the Bill of Rights.
The service is also available at two plans: a $9.99 per month option which gets you the standard quality, or $19.99 per month HiFi plan that gets you the highest quality, which is lossless audio.
Here's why all of this is stupid.
1. This whole ‘high quality audio' thing overestimates the average listener
For one thing, the average person that listens to music in the car on their commute or in their stock Apple earbuds cannot hear and does not care about the difference between 256 Kpbs (standard iTunes quality), 320 Kpbs (high quality) and 1411 Kpbs lossless or FLAC audio files (astronomically high quality).
The bulk of the target audience here buys vinyl albums to frame and hang on their walls, not to actually listen to on a record player.
2. The Tidal model doesn't seem scalable
Spotify pretty much stiffs its artists and they still don't make any money. Tidal's business plan is different, but it's hard to see how it'll hold water.
In addition to partnerships with most major record labels, Tidal has so many co-owners because they were all offered a 3% stake in the company to secure exclusives. That's all well and good, but it kind of ignores how things really work in the Internet era.
If you yank an artist's music from one streaming service and make it exclusively available on a rival and more expensive streaming service, some people might pay for it, but others might decide it's not worth the trouble, and others will probably find another and less expensive (read: free) way to get their hands on it.
Do you get it? I'm talking about piracy.
3. Why would anybody pay $20 for this?
We can make our own playlists. The only draw to Tidal is the higher quality audio, and it's not even really that big of a draw.
That higher quality audio is only available at the $20 price point which is just ridiculous. That's what a lot of us pay for Spotify and Netflix combined each month.
The only selling point outside of that is the bill of goods that this will somehow save music. And that's really funny, because none of us really care about the streaming service we listen to the music on, so long as we can hear what we want, when we want, with the fewest number of interruptions possible.
So obviously I have my doubts. Tidal is supposed “evolve over time” which is code for “we're still figuring this out” so maybe it'll eventually find its feet. But it's hard to understand why all of this money is going into what we listen to the music on, rather than actually using the money to make music, which is all we really wanted from jump street. Considering that, this all just seems…stupid.
Following Tuesday morning's deadly blasts in Brussels, all fingers are pointing toward the Islamic State group, aka ISIS. The attacks, which left at least 26 dead, came just days after the arrest of alleged ISIS affiliate Salah Abdeslam, who is a prime suspect in last November's terrorist attacks in Paris. But was Abdeslam's arrest a trigger for Tuesday's violence? And was ISIS responsible?
Brussels has long been a prime city of concern for intelligence officials regarding terrorist threat. The Paris attacks, which left 130 people dead, were believed to be organized in Brussels. And hundreds of ISIS recruits have returned to a number of European countries, including Belgium, stoking concerns that a terror attack there was ultimately inevitable.
It is too early to ascertain with certainty that Tuesday's bombings were part of a coordinated ISIS attack, but it had all the markings of one. Two explosions occured at the Brussels airport and one at a downtown subway station. At least 130 people were reportedly wounded in addition to the 26 people killed. Members of ISIS have reportedly taken responsibility online. Belgian federal prosecutor Frédéric Van Leeuw has called it a "terrorist attack," and at least one of the attacks seemed to be the result of a suicide bomber.
It's possible that, following Abdeslam's arrest, extremists wanted to act before authorities acted on any information they were able to get out of Abdeslam. It's also possible they wanted to cover up recent losses — like Abdeslam's arrest — by refocusing media headlines on the group's threat to the West. It's unclear how much coordination sleeper cells in Europe have with ISIS' command in Syria. It's also unclear whether the blasts in Brussels could have been pulled together in the time since Abdeslam's arrest, or whether it was planned earlier.
Abdeslam, 26, is believed to have helped carry out the Paris attacks but may have backed out at the last minute from becoming a suicide bomber himself. In the months that followed, a regional manhunt was launched to track down his whereabouts. Based on the time Abdeslam was able to remain on the run, analysts believe he likely had scores of contacts and supporters in Europe. Some believe he may have built up a new network of extremists to carry out an attack.
“It is not about so-called lone wolves or solitary actors but about a small but significant number people who are deeply embedded in broader communities or neighborhoods,” the Guardian wrote Tuesday. “These people either share the attackers' extremist views, or are at the very least prepared to support them out of friendship or family ties, or both.”
Authorities continue to search for several suspects from last year's attacks in France. Given the latest violence, their list is likely only to grow.
Only Colin Harvey and Joe Royle won their first Merseyside derbies as Everton manager and Roberto Martínez's team must improve significantly on recent displays for the Spaniard to join that company. Everton disappointed against Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur, lacking inspiration from either Romelu Lukaku or Kevin Mirallas, but are unbeaten at Goodison Park in 2013. Liverpool are 11 points better off than at the same stage of last season – Everton have the same points total as they did this time last year – and Brendan Rodgers will hope there is no international toll on Luis Suárez, Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard as he seeks a first win over the Goodison Park club.

REUTERS/Tony Gentile The papal conclave — the election by which a new Catholic pope is chosen — is by design of the most secretive events in the world.
The cardinals are locked inside the Sistine Chapel for a series of votes, supposedly cut off from the outside world (texts and tweets are completely banned). Before they go inside, the chapel is swept for bugs and jamming devices are set up to knock out phone signals. The idea is to preserve the ancient mystery of the event by preventing leaks, and it seems to work — most of the time.
According to a new report in Italian magazine Panorama, however, that didn't stop the NSA.
The report states that the American agency, recently embroiled in a number of scandals, is believed to have been intercepting calls within the Vatican before and during the Conclave. There are also suspicions that Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who would later be chosen as Pope Francis, was under surveillance for a number of years.
Panorama reports that the intercepted calls were put under four categories; Leadership intentions, threats to financial system, foreign policy objectives, and human rights.
The secretive world of the Vatican has come under scrutiny before, with leaked documents and tapped phone-calls causing a number of scandals. However, the Catholic Church seems to be taking this latest allegation in its stride.
"We don't know anything about this matter and in any case, we have no worries about it," Jesuit Father Federico Lombardi, director of the Holy See Press Office, said in a statement today.
First in the Eastern Conference. First in MLS in goal differential. First in MLS in goals allowed. And now first in the MLS power rankings.
The last two months has been kind to Sporting Kansas City as Peter Vermes' squad has lost only once in its last 10 League matches with a 7-1-2 record over that span. Sporting KC's form has not only seen them leap to the top of the Eastern Conference - with a share of the MLS Supporters' Shield - but it has drawn praise from the around the League including a No. 1 spot in this week's MLSsoccer.com power rankings. Here is what the editors at MLSsoccer.com had to say following Sporting KC's 4-1 win over Toronto FC.
Toronto put up more of a fight than 4-1 would indicate, but SKC swept them aside just the same with that textbook relentlessness. They're now 7-1-2 since the start of June and top the Supporters' Shield race.
ESPNFC.com also ranked Sporting KC number one, following last weekend's convincing performance, which included a Save of the Week nominee from homegrown goalkeeper Jon Kempin.
The defending champs were back to their physical, high-pressing ways against Toronto, and solidified their spot at the top of the Eastern Conference standings with a 4-1 win. That said, Jon Kempin's second-half save with the game in the balance proved critical.
During the last 10 matches, Sporting KC has outscored opponents 17-9 with two shutouts. Vermes has also continued his streak of using a different lineup in each match this season
SI.com's Liviu Bird moved Sporting KC up two spots in his weekly rankings, but still has them No. 2 behind 2013 MLS Cup runners-up Real Salt Lake.
It may play in a generally weaker conference, but Sporting KC continues to keep pace with the Western teams while dominating in the East. Perhaps its sternest test yet from an Eastern Conference team is up next, with a visit from D.C. United following a trip to Nicaragua to play Real Estelí in the CONCACAF Champions League (D.C. also plays in midweek, but at home against a weaker Waterhouse FC).
After a midweek draw against Real Esteli, Sporting KC will host D.C. United Saturday evening. United are coming off a 4-2 win last weekend against the Colorado Rapids and a 1-0 CCL win over Waterhouse FC. Limited tickets are available for the match and can be purchased at Ticketmaster.com or by calling 888-4KC-GOAL. Saturday's match will kick off at 7:30 p.m. CT on KMCI's 38 the Spot and across the Midwest on SKCTV.

A specialist has warned of a number of cases in which doctors cited their religious beliefs as a reason to not treat transgender patients.
Dr James Barrett, the lead consultant psychiatrist at Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic and president of the British Association of Gender Identity Specialists, warned about the issues facing trans people in the British Medical Journal.
The doctor warned: “In the experience of those of us who work at gender identity clinics as many as one in five GPs won't prescribe for people with gender dysphoria, even after expert advice from an NHS clinic.
“Reasons that GPs have given me for this refusal include concerns about it being dangerous (it isn't), difficult (it isn't), expensive (it's not, particularly), and I've also heard disturbingly frank admissions that it was against ‘deeply held Christian beliefs' or that ‘we are trained to treat illnesses, not to change nature'.
“NHS England's guidance on specialised commissioning makes it clear that GPs are expected to care for people with gender dysphoria just as for any other group with an uncommon condition easily managed with a joint care model.
“The General Medical Council has made it clear that ethical or ‘principled' objections are not acceptable in gender dysphoria and that ‘inexperience in the field' should be remedied by prompt cooperation with a gender identity clinic.”
He added: “NHS care for transgender people can improve in other ways, too. Such patients are still often, offensively, referred to by their old title or legal sex, sometimes years after hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery.
“They may be admitted to the wrong ward, checked in as the wrong sex, and instructed to use the wrong toilet or a disabled access toilet despite not having a disability.”
The gender specialist continued: “People with gender dysphoria aren't freaks.
“They are teachers and accountants, police officers and doctors, parents and taxpayers, and—importantly—patients as deserving of respect and decent, routine NHS care as anyone else. It's about time they started getting exactly that.”
The fresh warning comes two months after MPs found the NHS to be in breach of the law due to poor treatment of transgender people.
Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee found “serious deficiencies” within the NHS on gender issues, where backlogs have led to waits of several years for gender surgery.
The committee found that the current system is in breach of the law, adding it is “in clear breach of the legal obligation under the NHS Constitution to provide treatment within 18 weeks”
BEIJING – Elon Musk, the U.S.-based entrepreneur, has said the next decade would see a “dramatic increase” in artificial intelligence (AI), most forms of cancer cured and, possibly, the first human mission to Mars.
Musk, CEO of private rocket firm SpaceX and electric car producer Tesla Motors, hopes the next ten years will also see more electric vehicles on the road, and a surge in the production and consumption of sustainable energy, he told Xinhua.
An advocate of space exploration and electric transportation, Musk has attained recognition for his unprecedented achievements in both industries.
SpaceX was the first private company to successfully send a spacecraft to the International Space Station and has contracts with U.S. space agency NASA, while Tesla Motors produces electric vehicles that boast the performance of sports cars.
PRIVATE MANNED SPACE FLIGHT
Musk explained that SpaceX aims to send its first manned craft into space in the next two years, adding that this year would see “a lot of interesting tests” with Version 2 of the Dragon spacecraft, which would help it with the precision of a helicopter.
Technology, he said, is important to extend life beyond Earth to avoid extinction. He predicted a human mission to Mars could be as early as 2025.
“My guess is that [it will probably take] 10 years to send the first manned mission,” he said.
SpaceX is close to achieving a precise soft landing with rocket boosters, he said. If successful, this would be a significant step toward making rockets reusable, thus, reducing the cost of space travel and making settlement on Mars more attainable.
Currently, rockets are just detached and allowed to fall back to Earth. A reusable rocket system could slash the cost of space transportation by a factor of 100.
The company's Falcon 9 rocket landed on a floating ocean platform earlier this year but the rocket landed hard and exploded.
However, a number of separate short takeoff-and-landing tests have been successful, according to Musk.
“We just need to fit the pieces of the puzzle together […] I'm hopeful that we'll achieve that later this year.” he said.
POTENTIAL THREAT OF AI
Musk believes AI will have a profound effect on the future, however, he is realistic that intelligent machines may also pose risk.
“We will see dramatic increases in the manifestations of AI [in the next decade],” Musk said.
His car company Tesla Motors is working on a full autopilot system that could be developed in three years, while highway autopilot is coming in a few weeks.
Within the next decade, fully autonomous cars will become safer than human driving by far, Musk said.
However, he drew a distinction between self-driving cars and deep-thinking AI.
“I think we should be quite concerned that [deep AI] has the potential to be an existential threat,” Musk said, but dismissed the possibility of himself developing such AI.
More attention must be given to AI safety, he said, comparing it to nuclear power safety.
“That's why in nuclear power, the overwhelming amount of engineering and research is into safety. That should also be true with AI,” Musk said.
CANCER CURED, MORE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
In another bold prediction, Musk said humanity would see huge breakthroughs in curing diseases, even without rewriting genetics.
“In the next 10 years, I actually expect most forms of cancer to be completely cured […] based on the companies that I know that are developing extremely good cancer cures and that are in late stage of human trials.”
Humanity will also probably substantially address, if not eliminate, Alzheimer's in 10 years, predicted Musk, who is not involved in medical business.
However, he believes curing cancer will only increase the average human life span by two-three years as our fundamental life cycle is genetically wired. Whether humanity should or not rewrite genetics is a difficult question, he said.
Musk said he hoped the future would see more sustainable energy used, with solar panels and batteries powering the world. He forecast “high double-digit” growth in U.S. solar power demand.
Musk is chairman of U.S. solar company Solar [sic], which provides design, financing and installing of solar power systems.
The company is one of the biggest solar panel buyers from China, Musk said.
He also expects a surge in electric car production and use, noting that Tesla was founded to accelerate the advent of electric vehicles, forcing other carmakers to follow suit.
Musk's China trip comes after Tesla sales in the country reportedly fell below expectations last year. He attributed the situation to speculators canceling orders and pledged strong commitment to the Chinese market.

Occupy Wall Street might seem like a movement that would resonate with black Americans. After all, unemployment among African Americans is at 15 percent, vs. almost 8 percent for whites. And between 2005 and 2009, black households lost just over half of their median net worth compared with white families, who lost 16 percent, according to the Pew Research Center.
However, these numbers have not translated into action. A few prominent African Americans, such as Cornel West, Russell Simmons, Kanye West and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), have made appearances at Occupy protests. “Occupy the Hood,” a recent offshoot, has tried to get more people of color involved. But the main movement remains overwhelmingly white: A Fast Company survey last month found that African Americans, who are 12.6 percent of the U.S. population, make up only 1.6 percent of Occupy Wall Street.
African Americans share white Americans' anger about corporate greed and corruption, and blacks have a rich history of protesting injustice in the United States. So why aren't they Occupying?
“Occupy Wall Street was started by whites and is about their concern with their plight,” Nathalie Thandiwe, a radio host and producer for WBAI in New York, said in an interview. “Now that capitalism isn't working for ‘everybody,' some are protesting.”
From America's birthing pains to the civil rights protests of the 1960s, blacks have never been afraid to fight for economic or social justice. Crispus Attucks, a former slave and the first person killed by British soldiers in the Boston Massacre of 1770, is considered the first martyr of the American Revolution. Frederick Douglass, a slave turned abolitionist, stressed in the 19th century that black and white laborers' fortunes and freedom were intertwined, saying that white labor “was robbed” of fair wages so long as it competed with unpaid black slaves.
In 1969, James Forman, former executive secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a civil rights organization, called on blacks to not perpetuate capitalism or contribute to the exploitation of blacks in the United States and elsewhere. He urged black workers to take over America by sabotaging U.S. factories and ports “while the brothers fight guerrilla warfare in the street.” And Huey Newton and the Black Panther Party renounced the American Dream as defective and called for the destruction of the capitalist system.
Blacks have historically suffered the income inequality and job scarcity that the Wall Street protesters are now railing against. Perhaps black America's absence is sending a message to the Occupiers: “We told you so! Nothing will change. We've been here already. It's hopeless.”
While the black press and civil rights groups such as the NAACP and the National Urban League were critical to past protest movements, black churches were the organizational force behind the rhetoric. Church leaders mobilized famous names and unsung heroes to end segregation through meetings, marches, demonstrations, boycotts and sit-ins. But where is the church now?
Some argue that the black church is losing its relevance, especially among young people who have been turned off by the religious theater of celebrity preachers. Even after lenders were accused of targeting black churches and communities as fertile markets for subprime mortgages, these churches are not joining Occupy protests en masse.
And despite their inclusive mission statements, major civil rights organizations and leaders appear to be selling out black America for corporate money. Beginning in the 1980s, for example, the tobacco and alcohol industries meticulously cultivated relationships with leaders of black communities. Institutions such as the NAACP, the United Negro College Fund and the Congressional Black Caucus have counted those industries as major donors — at the expense of the health of the black community.
More recently, the Congressional Black Caucus and other civil rights groups have received strong financial backing from telecommunications companies such as AT&T and Comcast. These firms support regulations that would be barriers to the goal of universal Internet access, stifling economic opportunity for black communities. We can't expect our civil rights organizations and political leaders to help blacks rage against the corporate machine when they are part of it.
And what about Jay-Z and other hip-hop stars? For all their influence on American culture, they haven't tackled big challenges such as poverty, police brutality, voting disenfranchisement and the racist prison complex. Jay-Z hasn't shown up at any Occupy gatherings, but his clothing company appears to be trying to capitalize on the protest wave. Rocawear is peddling “Occupy All Streets” T-shirts for $22 a pop — with no plans to donate profits to the movement.
Beyond a lack of leaders to inspire them to join the Occupy fold, blacks are not seeing anything new for themselves in the movement. Why should they ally with whites who are just now experiencing the hardships that blacks have known for generations? Perhaps white Americans are now paying the psychic price for not answering the basic questions that blacks have long raised about income inequality.
New Jersey comedian John “Alter Negro” Minus says he won't participate in the Occupy protests because black people are being besieged by so many social injustices, he can't get behind targeting just the 1 percent.
Banks' bad behavior “just gets lost in the sauce, so to speak,” Minus said. “High joblessness and social disenfranchisement is new to most of the Wall Street protesters. It's been a fact of life for African Americans since the beginning. I actually think black people are better served by staying out of the protests. Civil disobedience will only further the public perception that black people like to cause trouble.”
Is there a chance that the movement can become more diverse? Leslie Wilson, a professor of African American history at Montclair State University, is not optimistic.
“Occupy Wall Street cannot produce enough change to encourage certain types of black participation,” Wilson said in an interview. “The church cannot get enough blacks out on the streets. Some students will go, but not the masses. Black folks, particularly older ones, do not think that this is going to lead to change. . . . This generation has already been beaten down and is hurting. They are not willing to risk what little they have for change. Those who are wealthier are not willing to risk and lose.”
Black America's fight for income equality is not on Wall Street, but is a matter of day-to-day survival. The more pressing battles are against tenant evictions, police brutality and street crime. This group doesn't see a reason to join the amorphous Occupiers.
But if the Occupy movement does not grow in solidarity with other constituencies of exploited and oppressed people, and if black America does not devise new leadership strategies to deal with today's problems, the truth of Frederick Douglass's wisdom will hold — the powerful undertow of race and class in America will keep both blacks and whites from being free.

The pathway to social change is paved with an unwavering commitment to forging ahead in the face of adversity, and above all, loyalty to your community. This Friday, we celebrate the legacy of Harvey Milk on what would have been his 85th birthday, had his life not been cut short by assassination. When we talk about social movements, we often point to a specific event as a catalyst for change, and oftentimes, that event is a tragedy. I, however, believe that it is people like Harvey Milk who bring about and create change through their dedication to justice, no matter what barriers may present themselves.
“If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.” — Harvey Milk
Harvey Milk was one of the first openly gay politicians ever to be elected and serve in a United States public office. Upon arriving in San Francisco in 1972, Milk opened his iconic camera store in the famed Castro district, and became increasingly involved in promoting local businesses in the area. A longtime proponent of equal rights for all and an unapologetic advocate for the LGBTQ community, Milk became the unofficial spokesperson for the gay rights movement, and campaigned for a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Upon losing both his first and second election for the Board of Supervisors, in 1975 he was appointed to the San Francisco Board of Permit Appeals by his ally and friend, Mayor George Moscone.
In 1977, Milk's luck eventually turned and he was elected as the San Francisco city-county supervisor, a huge victory for the LGBTQ community worldwide. As supervisor, Milk sponsored an anti-discrimination bill, fought to establish daycare centers for working mothers, helped to increase low-cost housing options, and consistently advocated for the rights of all marginalized communities. During his term of service, Milk played a role in defeating Proposition 6, which would have permitted the firing of gay teachers in California public schools. As both a community organizer and public official, Milk made an impact on not only his community, but on future leaders to follow.
It is because of people like Harvey Milk, his predecessors, and the leaders of today that we are able to come together and defeat discriminatory practices and legislation that affect our communities. His leadership style relied heavily on prioritizing diversity, and empowering marginalized communities to make the changes they wanted for their neighborhoods. A trailblazer who refused to falter despite lost elections and a constant barrage of death threats, we celebrate him on his 85th birthday for all he did to promote equal rights and opportunity for all.
A new study in the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that life and health insurance companies in the U.S., Canada and Great Britain invest heavily in tobacco companies. Tobacco use is a major cause of fatal lung diseases and cancer, and is known to elevate the risk for heart attack and stroke. The study found that the American insurance company Prudential Financial, Inc. has $264.3 million invested in U.S. cigarette makers, including Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. The Canadian company Sun Life Financial, Inc., which sells life, health and disability insurance, owns over $1 billion worth of stock in tobacco interests, including $890 million in Philip Morris. Prudential Plc, which sells health and disability coverage, has $1.38 billion invested in two tobacco companies, including British American Tobacco. Wesley Boyd, the study's lead author and a faculty member of Harvard Medical School, says that while it may seem self-defeating for companies to sell insurance while also owning tobacco stocks, insurers have found ways to profit from both. "Insurers exclude smokers from coverage or, more commonly, charge them higher premiums. Insurers profit -- and smokers lose -- twice over." Study co-author David Himmelstien explains, "It's the combined taxidermist-and-veterinarian approach: either way, you get your dog back." Boyd adds that the main objective for insurance companies is not to safeguard customers' well-being, but to generate profits. The authors also point to this study as a reason why health insurance coverage should not be left in the hands of private insurers.
Ohmygoodness, this is special. Small Worlds by David Shute is a proper, genuine exploration game, where you really do only explore. A tiny pixel man moves around an ever-growing area, finding… almost nothing. I want to say nothing more, as the joy comes from just seeing the area fill in as you explore. It's short, but it's absolutely beautiful, enhanced enormously by gorgeous music from Kevin MacLeod. It was created for one of the Jayisgames Casual Gameplay Competition, where it deservedly won first place, and also gathered trophies in the other two categories. Big thanks to Mr Bakke for pointing it out.
EDIT: Yes, yes, it's old. So what?! Eh? What are you going to do about it? Fight me? I'll fight you. I'll fight all of you!
1. Setting up
We're going to use Express in this tutorial, because that's what most people are currently using, but you should be able to follow along even if you're using hapi or Koa, because the GraphQL part of this tutorial is largely identical.
For starters, let's clone the tutorial GitHub repo, which has a few resources we'll need later. If you've already done that in Part 1, you can skip this step.
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tutorial.git
cd graphql-tutorial
Since this tutorial has lots of sections, we have to check out the right branch to make sure the repo is in the state we want it to be for the start of this one:
git fetch
git checkout t2-start
You should now see a server folder with package.json , .babelrc and server.js in it. package.json contains the most basic dependencies we need to get a server running, namely Express and Babel. server.js contains the minimal “Hello World” example of an Express server, which we're going to build into a GraphQL server in the rest of this tutorial.
To get up and running, install the dependencies and start the server:
cd server
npm install
npm start
If you point your browser at localhost:4000 you should now see the following:
If you see this, your Express server is now up and running…
With the server up and running, we're ready to dive into the GraphQL part of this tutorial!
2. Writing your GraphQL schema
When building an app from scratch, I always like to start by thinking about the underlying data model. Maybe it's an old habit from my Rails days, where step one was always to define a relational database schema, but I've found it to be a really great way to begin. In GraphQL, we actually have a name for this approach: schema-first development.
Note: If you've already written a schema in the first tutorial, you can just copy over that file from the client and skip ahead to the next step.
To write our schema, let's create a directory called src and add a file called schema.js in it:
mkdir src
cd src
touch schema.js
The schema file, written in the GraphQL schema language, specifies what object types exist in our app, and what fields they have. In addition, it defines the allowed entry points into our API.
// src/schema.js
import {
makeExecutableSchema,
addMockFunctionsToSchema, # we'll use this later
} from 'graphql-tools';
const typeDefs = `
type Channel {
id: ID! # "!" denotes a required field
name: String
}
# This type specifies the entry points into our API. In this case
# there is only one - "channels" - which returns a list of channels.
type Query {
channels: [Channel] # "[]" means this is a list of channels
}
`;
const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs });
export { schema };
We'll add more types to our messaging app in future tutorials, but for now the Channel type and one entry point is all we need.
The last line takes our type definition string and turns it into an executable schema for our server to use. makeExecutableSchema is a function from graphql-tools , which we now need to install
npm install --save graphql-tools
3. Wiring up the schema to the server
Now that we have our schema, we need to wire it up to our Express server. In this tutorial, we'll use graphql-server-express and graphql-tools for that. graphql-server-express also needs body-parser , so let's go ahead and install all of that:
npm install --save graphql-server-express body-parser
Next, we'll import the functions we're going to use at the top of our server.js file:
import {
graphqlExpress,
graphiqlExpress,
} from 'graphql-server-express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
We'll also need to import the schema we just wrote in the schema.js file:
import { schema } from './src/schema';
We have to do this because the type definitions only describe what types exist in our schema, and they don't tell the server how to execute queries against it. makeExecutableSchema turns our type definitions into an executable schema, to which we can add custom resolve functions later. Resolve functions are the core piece of GraphQL that tell the server how to resolve each part of a query. But more on that later, let's finish wiring up our server first!
In order to make our server respond to GraphQL requests, we need to tell Express to pass requests to our graphqlExpress middleware, which executes the queries against the schema. We do this by replacing the current server.get lines with the following:
server.use('/graphql', bodyParser.json(), graphqlExpress({
schema
}));
To test whether your server is working, open the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:4000/graphql?query={__schema{types{name}}}
This is what it should look like if it's working
The query we just executed makes use of GraphQL's built-in introspection capability. Introspection allows querying the server for information about itself: what types exist, what fields they have, how they are related to each other, what interfaces they implement etc. This lets you build some pretty powerful tools, like the amazing interactive query editor called GraphiQL (pronounced “graphical”), which we're going to set up right now.
4. Setting up GraphiQL
Setting up GraphiQL is super easy. All you have to do is add the graphiqlExpress middleware from graphql-server and point it to the GraphQL endpoint we just set up:
server.use('/graphiql', graphiqlExpress({
endpointURL: '/graphql'
}));
If you now go to http://localhost:4000/graphiql?query={__schema{types{name}}} , you should see the following after pressing the play button and expanding the docs:
This is GraphiQL. It's pretty amazing.
GraphiQL is going to be an incredibly useful tool to you as a GraphQL developer, so go ahead and play around to familiarize yourself with it. It offers a documentation explorer, syntax highlighting, autocompletion and many more things.
As you've probably noticed, running a query like:
{
channels {
id
name
}
}
Doesn't actually do anything yet. That's because we haven't hooked our GraphQL schema up to any data. So let's go ahead and do that.
5. Connecting your GraphQL schema to real data
As with the client, the fastest way to get some data into your app is to use mocking. Thanks to GraphQL's type system, this is incredibly easy. All you have to do is to add this one line to your schema.js file just after the line with makeExecutableSchema and before the export :
addMockFunctionsToSchema({ schema });
If you run the same query again, you should now get some data with random IDs and “Hello World”. Curious about how it works or how to customize it? You can read about it in one of my posts from last year.
Mocking can be very useful if you want start building your frontend before the backend is done, but since we want to learn how to build a real server, let's delete the addMockFunctionsToSchema line and write some actual resolve functions!
Let's go ahead and create another file called resolvers.js in the src folder. In that file we'll define how the schema should handle a channels query. Rather than connecting to a real persistent backend, which we'll cover in Part 5 of this tutorial series, we're just going to define some channels right in our resolvers file:
// src/resolvers.js
const channels = [{
id: 1,
name: 'soccer',
}, {
id: 2,
name: 'baseball',
}];
export const resolvers = {
Query: {
channels: () => {
return channels;
},
},
};
As you probably noticed, resolvers has roughly the same shape as our schema. That's no accident: Query is the type and channels is one of its fields.
For now, our channels resolve function takes no arguments and simply returns the channels we defined above, but we'll see some more complex resolve functions that return promises in the next part of this series.
To make our server use the resolve function we just defined, all we have to do is import it in schema.js and pass it to makeExecutableSchema like so:
// schema.js
// ...
import { resolvers } from './resolvers';
// ...
const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });
export { schema };
Make sure to remove the call to addMockFunctionsToSchema , otherwise your resolve function won't get applied.
If everything is working, here's what you should see when you run the query again:
Success!
If something isn't quite working, you can always browse the solution and compare it against what you ended up with.

Our Story:
We – Andy (a mechanic) and Dan (a computer tech) began this project 2 years ago, testing and retesting every aspect over 2 winters. The first covers were made in Andys dining room until we were able to find a good manufacturer that could produce them in the same high quality we expected.
As two busy fathers we were disappointed and frustrated by the lack of quality and functional options available on the market – so we decided to put our mechanical and technical skills together and ended up with this practical and user-friendly product.
When neighbors, friends and family all started requesting one too, we knew we were on to something that would be useful to others as well. Thus, the iceScreen™ magnetic ice shield was born and we now want to share it with the world.
We Need Your Help:
We're looking to raise funds via Kickstarter to complete the manufacturing of the Deluxe Edition and Limited Edition of the iceScreen™ magnetic ice shield.
We want to make something really special – the finest, most kick-ass winter cover you could ever imagine. We need your backing to make sure we can make this available to the masses in time for this winter. Help us make it happen!
Delivery Schedule:
Dec - Standard Edition, Deluxe Edition, Mirror Mittz
Jan - Limited Edition (UPDATE: We can make it for Dec delivery!)

These are the 100 Greatest Stand Up Comics of All Time as ranked by Comedy Central and discussed by comedians Greg Giraldo, Dom Irerra, Judy Gold, and Mario Joyner and rotating guests Phyllis Diller, Richard Jeni, Pat Cooper, David Brenner, and Richard Lewis. They aired the list over the course of the week of April 12th-16th on Comedy Central
The show itself was severely lacking, particularly because the four main panelists rarely knew anything noteworthy to distinguish any of these comics from one another. There was an everpresent variation of "he/she really opened the door for other african-american / latino / female / satirical / improvisational / prop comics everywhere" to be said for everybody on the list, along with other token phrases like "he/she really knows how to own his/her material" and "he/she really puts his/her audience at ease and just enjoys himself/herself".
All in all, while the list does have enough merit to be of use (At the least it's a comedian metanode) I determine the whole gimmick as just a way for Comedy Central to sell DVDs. I mean, they'll put on Wanda Sykes (Who has a Comedy Central DVD available), but not Whoopi Goldberg? Is Kevin James, David Alan Grier and Jim Breuer (all of whom have Comedy Central DVDs) all really more impactual, important and funny than Sarah Silverman (Who did not make the list)? Not even mentioning the severe lack of comedians overseas (While Bob Hope was born in England, it's Eddie Izzard who represents here). Maybe I'm just a Conspiracy Theorist. That being said, they at least left out Carrot Top.
Here's the list.
The Huntaway hero Louie, of Alexandra, saved his rabbit-chasing girlfriend Maddy, leading her owner to where she was trapped in a hole.
﻿A heroic huntaway decrepit from old age and riddled with arthritis has proven old dogs can learn new tricks.
Louie, a retired Central Otago farm dog, is being hailed a hero after saving his rabbit-chasing "girlfriend", Maddy, who got stuck in a hole under a large pile of brush pile on Saturday.
His heroic actions were brought to his family's attention on Saturday evening, as the elderly canine limped up his Alexandra driveway, puffing, sore, collapsing with exhaustion at the house. Around his neck was a cardboard note that read: "Louie is the hero of the day. He leads (sic) me to Maddy in distress stuck under a brush pile."
MAROLYN DUDFIELD The note describing Louie's heroic actions leading Robert Kvick, of Alexandra, to his trapped dog Maddy.
Louie's owner, Francie Diver, said her "very old dog" who was full of arthritis, had a circle of young girlfriends – one of whom was the neighbour's "little midget" Maddy. They hunt rabbits together across the rural properties on the outskirts of the township.
"Maddy comes over every day about 4.30pm to collect him and they head off down the driveway into the distance. On Saturday, he went missing. About 6pm he arrived home so exhausted and had a tag attached to his collar. I thought, 'where has he been? What has he done?' I immediately thought the worst."
Their neighbour Robert Kvick, who wrote the note, said Louie had outdone himself given his age and physical state.
MAROLYN DUDFIELD Alexandra pooch Maddy was trapped and distressed under a brush pile but her canine companion Louie came to the rescue.
"He is so old and decrepit he can hardly walk."
His dog, Maddy, had "free range" of the property when her owners were home and she often visited Louie, he said.
"After lunch, I had not seen her. I had to go into Alexandra for an appointment. She didn't come when I called. When I got back about 5.30pm there was still no sign of her."
He went to move his flood irrigation system at the back of the property and Louie was there, he said.
"I am familiar with animals and sensitive to how they think. It was very obvious what Louie was trying to do. He came to me huffing and puffing like a steam train. He followed me around until we got to the other side of the property. He led me to a brush pile – prunings from firewood trees and he started barking. I said, 'what's the matter Louie?' Then I heard a yelp from inside. He was very energetic trying to show me where Maddy was in the pile. She had got into a hole and couldn't get out again."
It was a bit of "neighbourly fun" attaching a note to Louie's collar, he said.
Diver said the family was extremely proud of their dog's heroic actions. Louie, aged about 12 and now retired from keeping the water rats out of crayfish ponds and stoats away from chickens, had once been full of energy, she said.
"We have had Louie since he was a pup. He spent the first two years of his life running us ragged. He had the longest legs. We thought it was never going to come right. If he got off his chain, he just ran. He dragged us everywhere. You could hear my husband screaming chasing after that dog."
The experience had left Louie "pooped" and the pair's rabbiting adventures had stopped – for now.
The world's largest miniature airport is now open to the public in Hamburg, Germany. This $5 million masterpiece, six years in the making, captures every detail of the real thing. You have to watch this video to believe it.
In what must be the world's most intricate and detailed gadget, the model includes realistically crafted and painted airplanes that appear to be landing and taking off, cars, trucks and buses parking and driving around, and lit-up runways that look almost real.
It's part of the Miniatur Wunderland, an astonishing model and tourist attraction that replicates a variety of landscapes and landmarks around the world, and it's the world's largest model of its kind.
Construction of the Lilliputian world began in 2000, and before this airport was added, the original model took up 16,146 square feet of space with more than 10,000 train cars running around its 6.8 miles of HO-scale track. The original construction cost $10 million, and plans are in the works to double the size of the layout by 2014.
This video will give you an overview of this spectacular tourist attraction:
Co-opting Radical Feminism for Corporate Interests
While preeminent American feminist Gloria Steinem's CIA background receives wide attention on the Internet, it's a totally taboo topic in either the corporate or the so-called “alternative” media. Steinem's work for the CIA front group Independent Research Service first entered the public domain in 1967 when Ramparts magazine exposed both the Independent Research Service and the National Student Association as CIA front organizations.
Fearing unflattering publicity, Steinem gave interviews to both the New York Times and the Washington Post defending her CIA work (see video below). In both articles, she claims to have taken the initiative in contacting Cord Meyers, who headed the CIA's International Organization Division and their top secret Operation Mockingbird.* Her goal, allegedly, was to seek CIA financing to encourage American participation in the seventh postwar (Soviet-sponsored) World Youth Festival in Vienna in 1959.
The article quotes her: “Far from being shocked by this involvement, I was happy to find some liberals in government who were farsighted and cared enough to get Americans of all political views to attend.”
Steinem served as director of the CIA-funded Independent Research Service from 1958-62. It was her responsibility to organize US students, scholars and writers to attend the yearly World Youth Festival, to observe and takes notes on foreign participants, to distribute pamphlets, flyers and books and to edit a daily propaganda newspaper.
Steinem Threatens to Sue Random House
Steinem's CIA links came to mainstream media attention a second time in 1979, when the Village Voice ran an article about a chapter Random House had censored from Redstockings Collective's 1979 book Feminist Revolution. Random House spiked the chapter, which describes Steinem's earlier CIA work, after Steinem threatened to sue them. This deleted chapter (which you can get free by ordering an out-of-print copy of Feminist Revolution from Redstockings Collective) also suggests her CIA involvement may not have ended in 1969 when she left the International Research Associates. It details the right wing corporate funding which helped Steinem inaugurate Ms Magazine, as well as the magazine's pivotal role in transforming American feminism from a broad multi-class, multiracial movement to one devoted to divisive male bashing and advancing career opportunities for white upper middle class women.
The original feminists of the sixties and seventies didn't hate men (at least not the ones I worked with). What they hated was patriarchy and the use of male privilege to deny women and children full equality as human beings.
Operation Mockingbird in Action
In 1960 Clay Felker, a CIA-linked Independent Research Service staffer who accompanied Steinem to the Helsinki World Youth Festival in 1962, became the editor of Esquire magazine, where he published many of Steinem's early feminist articles. In 1968 Felker started New York magazine, and in 1971 he hired Steinem as contributing editor. It was Felker who published the first edition of Ms Magazine as a New York magazine insert.
As the feminist magazine Off Our Backs states in a 1975 article about the Redstockings scandal, their discovery of Steinem's earlier CIA employment raised a host of concerns about her sudden installation (mainly by corporate media) as the official leader of the US women's movement without any previous involvement in feminist groups or campaigns.
Interestingly Ms Magazine‘s first publisher was Elizabeth Forsling Harris, a CIA-connected PR executive who planned John Kennedy's Dallas motorcade route.
The Turmoil At NOW
In 1966, Steinem was still on the board of directors of International Research Service, when she co-founded National Organization for Women (NOW) with Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique. A 2001 article in The American Prospect describes (quoting from The World Split Open by Ruth Rosen) how in 1975 prominent NOW members Carol Hanisch and Kathie Sarachild openly accused Steinem of working for the CIA and “directing the movement toward moderation and capitulation.” Ultimately Friedan herself became concerned “a paralysis of leadership” in the movement “could be due to the CIA” and demanded that Steinem respond.
After three months, Steinem wrote a six-page letter to various feminist publications describing her work on two student festivals in 1959 and 1962 that were funded by the CIA. Aiming to deflect the charge she was or had been a government operative, it stated, “I naively thought then that the ultimate money source didn't matter, since in my own experience, no control or orders came with it.”
The Off Our Backs article also raises questions about a parallel organization Steinem started (in competition with NOW – starting parallel groups is a common strategy employed by US intelligence to sabotage grassroots organizations) in 1971 called Women's Action Alliance. Located in the same building as Ms. Despite its name, the WAA wasn't involved in “action,” as its name suggests. It engaged mainly in information gathering. It had a $20,000 grant from Rockefeller Family Fund for the establishment of a “national clearinghouse information and referral service” on the women's movement. WAA collected information on key women leaders and their groups and activities, presumably facilitation FBI/CIA efforts to monitor them.
Steinem's Fascination with Fascist Men
Despite her so-called liberal feminist credentials, Steinem has had a clear preference for right wing men, often with CIA and/or FBI links. She had a nine-year relationship with Stanley Pottinger, a Nixon-Ford assistant attorney general, who played a prominent role in undermining civil rights enforcement under Nixon and Ford. He also obstructed FBI investigations into the assassinations of Martin Luther King, and the ex-Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Latelier.
In 1984 Pottinger was investigated for participating in Irangate, a CIA scheme to illegally smuggle arms to Iran .**
In the 1980's, Steinem dated Henry Kissinger.
The Use of Black Feminists to Sabotage Civil Rights Organizing
In the late seventies and early seventies, African American organizers became concerned about a pattern in which agents posing as black feminists infiltrated their community groups in an effort to split off women members into separate organizations. They traced this phenomenon back to 1978 when Steinem put a book called Black Macho and the Myth of the Superwoman on the cover of Ms Magazine.
The book was allegedly “written” by a Black “feminist” and “activist” named Michele Wallace. In her early twenties Wallace, who like Steinem came out of nowhere (she was a Newsweek book review researcher), was suddenly being touted as the “leader” of Black feminism. In the book, Wallace called abolitionists like Harriet Tubman and Sojouner Truth “ugly” and “stupid” for supporting Black men. She called Black Revolutionaries “chauvinist macho pigs” and advised Black women to “go it alone.”
Gloria Steinem maintained that Wallace's book would “define the future of Black relationships” and she pushed hard to make sure the book received massive publicity. Gloria Steinem's efforts triggered a flood of “Hate Black Men” books and films that continues to this day.
*Operation Mockingbird was a secret CIA campaign to influence the media by placing CIA assets on the staff and editorial board of major publishers and media outlets and by paying reporters a small stipend to publish articles favorable to CIA interests. It allegedly ended in 1976 but many researchers believes it continues under a different name to the present day.
**Irangate was a CIA effort to illegally smuggle arms to Iran to obtain funding for the illegal CIA war against Nicaragua.
ESPN.com NFC North blogger Kevin Seifert checked in from the NFL Owners' meetings today, and the topic he was taking a look at was whether or not there was a serious market for the Minnesota Vikings' selection at #3 in the 2012 NFL Draft. As we've mentioned previously, the object of the affection of anyone that wants to move up to that spot will likely be Texas A&M quarterback Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill will have his pro day on Wednesday in College Station, so that will probably go quite a way towards solving this riddle. That will be something for Viking fans to keep an eye on.
But it appears that there are, basically, two teams that could be in the market for Tannehill if he kills it on his pro day, and they are the Cleveland Browns and the Miami Dolphins. Now, the Browns are in a pretty good position, selecting fourth behind the Vikings. They know that the Vikings aren't taking a quarterback, so they might feel that they're in a pretty good position to have him fall into their laps.
The Dolphins, however, might be in a position where they're feeling a bit desperate. They've been looking all over for a quarterback this off-season, and they missed on both Peyton Manning and Matt Flynn, the latter of whom I thought was a lock to end up on South Beach. They were rumored to be a part of the Tim Tebow derby, but he wound up with the Dolphins' division rivals in New York. The natives are getting restless in South Florida, folks. . .and, yes, I know that there weren't many natives at that protest, but they were natives, and they looked awfully restless to me.
Would a trade up for a quarterback be the sort of thing that makes the Miami fans happy? And how much would it take for them to move up?
Well, according to "the chart". . .and, again, the chart is guidance as opposed to gospel, but it's the best thing we've got. . .the Dolphins would have to make up 800 "points" in order to make an even trade with the Vikings to move up from #8 to #3. That means that even if the Dolphins threw in their second pick at #42 overall (480 points) and their third-round choices at #72 and #73 (455 combined points), they would be overpaying slightly. . .maybe Minnesota could throw back a later round pick. . .it could get the job done.
Whatever kind of package the Dolphins offer in this scenario, it would have to blow Rick Spielman away, because moving from the Vikings' current spot at #3 down to #8 would mean that they would certainly miss out on USC offensive tackle Matt Kalil. . .and LSU cornerback Morris Claiborne. . .and Oklahoma State wide receiver Justin Blackmon. That would be a bitter pill to swallow, to be certain, but if the Vikings could get more picks to build with, it could work out for the best.
Conversely, if the Vikings could make the Browns think that the Dolphins are really interested in Tannehill, they could offer the Browns a flip of spots. . .with the Browns throwing in their second-round choice at #40 overall. . .to move up to #3 and ensure that they got him.
I, ultimately, don't think that the Vikings will end up moving the third overall pick and that they'll end up drafting Matt Kalil, but 'tis the season for rumors and innuendo.

According to Vitaly Ruvinsky, the website's chief editor, the station decided to remove the text because of the "large number of personal insults" directed at Russian President Vladimir Putin. As an example, Ruvinsky cites Shenderovich's remark that Putin the son of a cleaning woman and a security guard.
On the show, Shenderovich was discussing famed criminal and professional martial artist Leonid Usvyatsov, who is said to have trained Putin and modern-day oligarch Arkady Rotenberg: “This is Leonid Usvyatsov, who spent 20 years in prison. Between his two terms, he managed to take part in raising the future president of Russia. It was Usvyatsov who trained Vladimir Putin from age 16, and it was Usvyatsov who arranged for him, the son of a cleaning woman and a security guard, to get into Leningrad State University on an athletic scholarship.”
Shenderovich was most likely referring to a popular LiveJournal blog post published on December 21, 2015, where anonymous user “uglich_jj” speculates about the people who surrounded Putin during his life in St. Petersburg. Part of this text addresses Usvyatsov, a criminal said to have trained Putin in judo. According to Usvyatsov's tombstone, he was murdered in 1994.
Viktor Shenderovich writes a column for the opposition magazine The New Times. He also regularly appears on Echo of Moscow.
In early 2014, Shenderovich wrote a scandalous blog post on Echo of Moscow, where he compared the 2014 Sochi Olympics to the 1936 Games held in Nazi Germany. The country's ruling political party, United Russia, accused Shenderovich of fascist speech, and, following a lawsuit, Shenderovich was fined 1 million rubles (more than $14,000, by today's exchange rate).
Honolulu's Sidewalks are Finally Getting Some TLC Thanks to These Volunteers
Service clubs, veterans and citizens are working under the radar to make civic repairs—with City Hall's approval. Now you can, too.

When Jason No hung up his military fatigues for a civilian career after eight-plus years in the Army, the weekends, he says, “were the worst.” The 35-year-old missed the camaraderie of working with a team. Walking his Makakilo neighborhood as part of his fresh start as a financial planner for Edward Jones, the former cavalry scout says he “just happened to knock on the door of the secretary of the Kāne‘ohe Lions Club, J. C. Kalopodes.”
No put his financial skills to use as Kāne‘ohe Lions treasurer. Under a new district governor, Nadine Nishioka, the Lions welcomed his suggestion that they revive an old program—one that fixed up sidewalks. “I said, Hey, let's bring it back,” No says. Although homeowners are responsible for the upkeep of frontage property, “normally we don't recommend that people fix their sidewalks,” says Tyler Sugihara of the city's Department of Facilities Management. “But we'd been working with the city's corporation counsel to enable groups to adopt projects.”
No also brought the idea to a veteran's group, The Mission Continues. “We're a national organization that started to provide an outlet for veterans who wish to continue serving their community,” says director Carlos Santana, 45, of Kalihi. “We'd formed a service platoon when Jason got this thing going with the City & County and the Lions Club.”
And that's how TMC and Lions squads converged on Kawa Street in Kāne‘ohe on the last Saturday in August. “We met at zero-eight hour,” says No. “We cleaned sidewalks and then, anywhere the elevation was off a quarter inch, laid down epoxy, then our cement mix, leveled it, added some grooves so it wouldn't be slick in the rain. We did it all the way down the road, both sides, in two hours.”
Pleased with the results, in September they did a block in Chinatown and “intend to patch sidewalks on a monthly basis with our support,” as part of the city's Mālama O Ka ‘Āina volunteer program, says DFM director Ross Sasamura. “It's a good feeling,” says No, “to be able to work with like-minded individuals. We just hunker down and work through it. Now we are looking at a bunch of other projects across the whole island. We want service platoons to take care of towns, to take care of the Windward and Leeward sides. We have a lot of veterans.”

Gošća Pressinga u ponedjeljak je bila Karolina Leaković, jedna od kandidatkinja za iduću predsjednicu SDP-a. Jedna je od tri žene koje se natječu za ovu titulu.
"Da ne vjerujem u pobjedu ne bih se kandidirala i bilo bi neozbiljno reći da sam u ovo ušla kako bih se samopromovirala. Vjerujem da u SDP-u ima ljudi koji će vidjeti da i moji politički stavovi i ono što znam govore o tome da bih mogla voditi jednu veliku političku stranku", kazala je Leaković Petru Štefaniću.
Vjeruje da će osvojiti neki broj glasova koji će joj kasnije omogućiti da s nekim istomišljenicima oformi neku "lijevu frakciju". Frakcije postoje u Statutu, ali nisu nikad oživjele, kaže. "Prvi korak je da pokažem da imam relevantan stav i da SDP može biti prava lijeva stranka."
Naglasila je da ova kampanja treba zanimati stranačke kolege, ali i građane, odnosno birače. "Nije nevažno tko će biti predsjednica ili predsjednik SDP-a."
Čekaju se prava sučeljavanja ideja među favoritima
Slaže se s tim da nije bilo pravih sučeljavanja ideja među favoritima. "Zapravo su se okružili kapitalcima, i tako pokušali stvoriti dojam da ih podržava 'baza'. Nisam imala toliko prilike sučeliti se sa svojim protukandidatima, ali i to slijedi. Ova dva tjedna će biti, nadam se, razgovor o idejama.
Kaže da je ranije govorila o modelu koji transformira političku scenu u Velikoj Britaniji, ali da je to naišlo na otpor medija i 'kapitalaca' u stranci. "Ono što i ja mislim da bi SDP-u trebalo također nailazi na kritike."
"Ne vrijeđa me ako me nazovu radikalnom ljevičarkom"
Na pitanje bi li joj bila uvreda da je nazovu ekstremnom ili radikalnom ljevičarkom kaže da ne bi, ali da ljudi u stranci možda misle da bi joj to smanjilo šanse. "Svi se natječu tko će biti veći ljevičar, a kad zapravo dođete do razgovora o tome što bi SDP treba promijeniti, onda kažu - pa samo promijenite lidera, mene dovedite. To nije ono što nam treba", kaže Leaković. "Ne želim ovu stranku propustiti onima koji govore da je ne treba mijenjati", rekla je, no ne razmišlja o osnivanju nove stranke.
'Ne treba sve svaljivati na Milanovića'
Upitana je o Narodnoj koaliciji. "Ja sam ista kao tada, ali sam u njoj bila na devetom mjestu liste u I. izbornoj jedinici, relativno nepoznata javnosti. Nisam imala prilike politički se profilirati, ali teško da danas možete reći da nemam politički stav. Možete se zapitati zašto SDP gura samo par ljudi."
Ne želi, ipak, odgovornost svaljivati na Zorana Milanovića. Ne ponosi se time što je 2014. glasovala za Zakon o radu. "Krenimo od toga da priznajem da sam odgovorna za ono što nisam napravila. Nisam se osjećala podržanom od strane kolega. Tada sam mogla kukuriknuti i onda zauvijek zamuknuti."
Croatia Airlines - dobar primjer upravljanja
Kaže da ne želi govoriti o tome da je država loš gospodar, ili da javne usluge treba privatizirati. "Rekla bih da se treba govoriti o efikasnijem upravljanju i da oni koji upravljaju javnim resursima moraju biti kompetentniji i raditi u javnu korist."
Za primjer dobrog upravljanja navodi Croatia Airlines. Kaže da ne želi govoriti o tome da je država loš gospodar, ili da javne usluge treba privatizirati. "Rekla bih da se treba govoriti o efikasnijem upravljanju i da oni koji upravljaju javnim resursima moraju biti kompetentniji i raditi u javnu korist." Za primjer dobrog upravljanja navodi Croatia Airlines.
"Ja sam protiv kapitalizma"
Protiv je kapitalizma. "Danas imate mnoge političare koji kažu da ovaj način upravljanja ne može upravljati. Nemojte misliti da se zalažem za totalitaristički poredak ili razvlaštenje onih koji nešto imaju." Ja sam za socijalizam 21. stoljeća, zaključuje Leaković.
"Ne znam zašto se SDP ne obraća blagajnicama", navodi u primjeru odnosa prema radnicima.
"Ja sam tek sada na neki način i došla u prvi plan, bavila sam se uglavnom međunarodnim pitanjima, politički sam bila nedozrela i nisam uspjela za ove ideje do ove godine okupiti neki potencijal koji bi to mogao promijeniti."

CLEVELAND, Ohio - The Cavs are operating from a few positions of strength.
They won a title. They have LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Kevin Durant stayed in the Western Conference.
Things could be worse.
Durant is an infrequent opponent, at least until the playoffs where - to steal a phrase the Warriors should fully understand now - everything is earned, nothing is given.
Supposedly, one of the selling points for Durant was a thought shared by Warriors' GM Bob Myers, paraphrased by The Vertical's Adrian Wojnarowski.
In meeting, Bob Myers told Durant: Without you, we can another title or two. Without us, you might win too. Together? We'll win a bunch. -- Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) July 4, 2016
If that sounds like a ripoff of LeBron's "not one, not two, not three" pep-rally proclamation, there's good reason. A bunch is a bunch.
Miami went two-for-four in NBA title runs. Ray Allen's jumper kept it from being one-for-three.
Durant makes the Warriors more formidable than James' Miami teams during that stretch. There's no sense denying it.
You can tell yourself -- as some Cavs fans have done in the last 24 hours -- that there's only one basketball. Well, yes. Durant is also joining a team that shares the basketball better than any other.
The one-basketball caveat is not exactly comforting for opponents then. And if you are one who has found yourself using it in the last day or two, you can't also pretend the same wouldn't apply to a Cavs' team with, say, Dwyane Wade (to grab a name out of thin air).
Nobody ever won a NBA title in July, though perhaps one day the marathon postseason will end with a night of fireworks on July 4.
Golden State could do a lot of great things with Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. But the Warriors haven't yet. And if the Cavs caused Golden State some serious issues over two playoff seasons - one while shorthanded - those won't disappear just because of Kevin Durant.
David Griffin's mandate is to try to get better. If you don't do that, you fall behind.
That mandate was the same before Durant made his decision. It's no different now.
I'm just not sure you get better by over-reacting and making major changes that could leave you searching for the kind of cohesion that resulted in a championship less than three weeks ago.
The game of chess with the Warriors comes late next season, if at all. Why start playing now?
Griffin felt the need to change the dynamic last season when it became apparent the Cavs were lagging in efficiency and chemistry. A 30-point loss to the Warriors offered even more evidence. Griffin did it by making a coaching change and later by bringing in Channing Frye.
Warriors' fans no doubt think they lost the series when Green got suspended for Game 5 and Andrew Bogut injured his knee.
The view from Cleveland: the Cavs beat the Warriors twice more with Green in the lineup, once at The Oracle.
Bogut? Was he a bigger loss than Kevin Love and Irving the year before?
The guess is LeBron James and the Cavs will spend the next year being told they have no choice, that they're like all the other teams in the NBA who can't possibly match up with the Warriors now. Even though Kyrie Irving might be scratching the surface. Even though Kevin Love might fit in more than he fits out.
The guess is James will use it as motivation the way he used Curry's unanimous MVP vote and the disrespect he felt the Warriors showed him after Game 4.
And that the Warriors may carry even more pressure into next postseason than they did after winning 73 games.
And, for the Cavs, there are worse things.
Much of the talk, on the street and online, about confronting police officers is just empty boasting, several young men said. Time and again, Mr. Davis said, he has heard people come into his barbershop warning that things will get out of control. But, he said, he has not heard one person say he will actually partake in violence.
For some, the question is not about whether to protest, but how aggressive those protests should be.
When violence broke out over the summer, Richard Clark, 30, said he stayed away because he did not want people to think, “See, that's what we thought they were — animals.”
But he said he felt that blacks continued to be treated as animals, so the more confrontational approach might be necessary. He was willing to die for the cause, he said, if it meant a better life for his two daughters. Still, he said, he was not sure how far he was willing to go.
“You just don't know what the hell you're going to do until you're put in that position,” he said.
Brian Curtis, 24, knows exactly what he thinks should happen if Officer Wilson is not indicted. It would mean that peaceful protests were not working, he said, and that a more assertive, even violent, approach was necessary.
“I'm following the crowd,” Mr. Curtis said. “If we get no justice, we got to start taking matters into our own hands. They want to go loot, we can go do that. They want to break stuff out, we can go do that, too. Something got to be done to make our voices heard.”
Over the summer, Mr. Curtis took time off from his two jobs — at a tire shop and a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant — to protest with his twin brother, Brandon, and friends. It was important, he said, because “me being a young black brother, that could have been me out there.”
Mango Launches First TV Ads of Campaign
Written by Paul Engelkemier, Managing Editor
Republican Gubernatorial candidate Paul Mango's campaign announced its first two ads of the elections, titled ‘Ready to Serve' and ‘Opposites.'
‘Ready to Serve' focuses on Mango's Army service from West Point to the 82nd Airborne division. ‘Opposites' highlights differences between Mango's and Governor Tom Wolf's economic plans.
The ads will run on cable in the Pittsburgh and Johnstown-Altoona media markets and online. The ads will likely move into the eastern media markets in the coming weeks.
These kinds of ads will help Mango build name recognition ahead of the Republican Party's Fall meeting next week, and it's Winter endorsement meeting early next year.
Neither ad makes any mention of any Republicans running in the race for Governor, most notably state Senator Scott Wagner (R-York).
Update: The Pennsylvania Democratic Party responded to ‘Opposites' claiming Mango is a Harrisburg insider.
“There's a lot Paul Mango's not telling you in his new ads. Like the fact that he's proposing to slash education and classroom learning, give special tax breaks to big corporations and the wealthy, and cut Medicaid for seniors in nursing homes. Paul Mango's ads might be new, but he's playing the same tune that Harrisburg's been dancing to for decades, and it's harmful to Pennsylvania families,” Pa. Dems spokesperson Beth Melena said in an email.
You can view the ads below.

The Apple supplier Foxconn is considering building a US-based factory for making large displays in the US, an investment that could cost the Chinese manufacturing giant over $7 billion. But why?
The answer perhaps lies in its relationship with Apple (AAPL). The Nikkei Asian Review reported on Monday that a potential US plant may be a joint investment between Apple and FoxConn, which remains the largest manufacturer of iPhones and iPads.

During an interview this November with The New York Times, President Donald Trump said he had a post-election phone call with Apple CEO Tim Cook in which he told Cook, “Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States.”
“I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it,” Trump added, according to the president's own account.

While it's unclear at this time what those incentives will be, Foxconn's move might have something to do with Trump's repeated pledge to to impose a 45% tariff on imports from China to spur job creation and innovation stateside.
“I think this move is motivated by Trump and his 45% tariff on anything imported into the US,” Ann Lee, an authority on Chinese economic relations and adjunct professor of economics and finance at New York University, told Yahoo Finance. “If that happens, then companies like Apple stand to lose a great deal. That's the only reason why I think the economics might make sense.”
Indeed, when looking at Apple's overall supply chain — one which famously adheres to the motto “Designed in California” but “Assembled in China” — the move doesn't make much sense, Lee contended.
Story continues
“Lots of tech comes from China, and lots of tech comes from Korea,” she added. “To have one factory squared away in Pennsylvania, outside the [Apple] supply chain and to ship all these other parts there, you might not necessarily be saving any export costs.”
Perhaps quite the opposite. While such a factory would be a win for US job creation, the real question is whether consumers would ultimately be fine absorbing the costs associated with moving jobs stateside. Indeed, FoxConn founder and chairman Terry Gou estimated that consumers could end up paying to $500 more for products manufactured in the US, not because they offer more functionality but simply because of where they were made.
While it's hard to believe Apple would stand for increased pricing along those lines, any investment by Apple in Foxconn's expansion into the US would be a political victory for Trump, who has criticized the iPhone maker time and again for outsourcing jobs to China.
“If Trump wants to pull jobs back, we'll have to give a lot of companies tax breaks, maybe free land, free who knows what to make it cross-competitive and keep the jobs here,” Lee said. “I mean, China already does that. So that's something Americans have to consider.”
But will Americans want to pay hundreds more for their brand-new iPhones?

If you have a miserable outlook on the world, then it makes sense that you would also feel miserable. However, there is some more nuance to this notion – that your philosophical outlook is tied to your well-being – than just accepting that pessimism leads to poor mental health outcomes. For instance, mental health aside, which philosophical outlook is more grounded in reality, pessimism or optimism?Moreover, which way does the causality lie – does poor mental health result in pessimism, or do pessimistic tendencies result in poor mental health? And is the causality even one-way? Could pessimism and mental health issues, such as depression, not also interact like a vicious cycle, with downward spiralling effects?
To examine these questions, it will be useful to draw on some examples of philosophers who fit the bill as either pessimistic or optimistic.
Do Depressives See the World More Clearly?
‘Depressive realism' is the hypothesis that depressives have a better idea of how things are than the general population. This notion was developed by psychologists Lauren Alloy and Lyn Yvonne Abramson. Although depression involves beliefs and behaviours which are maladaptive, Alloy and Yvonne argue that the negative thoughts that depressives have an accurate appraisal of the world.
In addition, they add that non-depressives (most people) appraise the world in a positively biased way. This bias is known as the Pollyanna principle: the tendency to remember pleasant events more accurately than unpleasant ones. According to researchers Matlin and Stang, we view the past with rose-tinted glasses. The name of this bias comes from the novel Pollyanna (1913) by Eleanor H. Porter, which describes a girl who plays a ‘glad game' – she tries to find something to be glad about in every situation.
So does the existing body of evidence substantiate the depressive realism hypothesis? Well, a meta-analysis carried out on the subject underscores that averaged across all studies, there is a small depressive realism effect. In addition, authors note that the methodology used influences whether a depressive realism effect is found. Indeed, this could help explain why there is both evidence for and evidence against depressive realism.
Philosophical Pessimism
The most famous philosophical pessimist is the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. Some of his most uplifting essays include On the Sufferings of the World and On the Vanity of Existence. It is difficult to assess whether Schopenhauer himself suffered from actual clinical depression or whether he was just a grumpy and disgruntled kind of person. His personal life doesn't indicate other common symptoms of depression, such as social withdrawal, constant tiredness, a lack of energy and motivation, or anhedonia. Furthermore, it is not clear if Schopenhauer was naturally pessimistic, or whether his pessimism (as well as his misogynistic views) were influenced by his personal life, which involved strained and frustrating relationships with women.
Perhaps some individuals are just inherently more prone towards negativity. Genetics and upbringing are powerful influences, after all. In fact, Schopenhauer's father apparently died by suicide, according to Safranski (1990):
There was in the father's life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in Hamburg.
Scientists believe that up to 40% of people with depression can trace it back to a genetic link. Schopenhauer may have had some underlying vulnerability towards depression – or pessimism – and this could have surfaced or become more intensely expressed and exacerbated by stressful life events.
To get a taster of Schopenhauer's pessimism, take these excerpts from On the Sufferings of the World:
Unless suffering is the direct and immediate object of life, our existence must entirely fail of its aim.
Each separate misfortune, as it comes, seems, no doubt, to be something exceptional; but misfortune in general is the rule.
Again, you may look upon life as an unprofitable episode, disturbing the blessed calm of non-existence. And, in any case, even though things have gone with you tolerably well, the longer you live the more clearly you will feel that, on the whole, life is a disappointment, nay, a cheat.
And from On the Vanity of Existence:
Human life must be some kind of mistake. The truth of this will be sufficiently obvious if we only remember that man is a compound of needs and necessities hard to satisfy; and that even when they are satisfied, all he obtains is a state of painlessness, where nothing remains to him but abandonment to boredom. This is direct proof that existence has no real value in itself; for what is boredom but the feeling of the emptiness of life?
The vanity of existence is revealed in the whole form existence assumes: in the infiniteness of time and space contrasted with the finiteness of the individual in both; in the fleeting present as the sole form in which actuality exists; in the contingency and relativity of all things; in continual becoming without being; in continual desire without satisfaction; in the continual frustration of striving of which life consists.
Anti-Natalism
For Schopenhauer, existence is “vain and worthless”. This perspective also led him to the conclusion that it is better never to have been born. This philosophical position, called anti-natalism, posits that it is immoral for people to have children, since, they argue, birth is – on the whole – a negative outcome, entailing more suffering than joy.
In On the Sufferings of the World, Schopenhauer says:
If you try to imagine, as nearly as you can, what an amount of misery, pain and suffering of every kind the sun shines upon in its course, you will admit that it would be much better if, on the earth as little as on the moon, the sun were able to call forth the phenomena of life; and if, here as there, the surface were still in a crystalline state.
Schopenhauer firmly holds onto the conviction that the world and the human race “is something that had better not have been”. The contemporary philosopher David Benatar echoes this outlook in his book Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming Into Existence. Benatar expands on the arguments made by Schopenhauer on pain and pleasure in human existence. He lays down certain premises in order to justify his anti-natalist position. He argues that while pain is bad (an uncontroversial point), the absence of pain is good, but the absence of pleasure is not bad, so it is always a worse situation to exist than to not exist. Benatar, of course, accepts that pleasure is good, but seems to hold onto the view expressed by Schopenhauer that the nature of pain is negative in a much more intense way than the positivity we ascribe to pleasure. In addition, Schopenhauer sees happiness only as the negation of something positively painful. As he argues in On the Sufferings of the World:
It is the good which is negative; in other words, happiness and satisfaction always imply some desire fulfilled, some state of pain brought to an end.
This explains the fact that we generally find pleasure to be not nearly so pleasant as we expected, and pain very much more painful.
The pleasure in this world, it has been said, outweighs the pain; or, at any rate, there is an even balance between the two. If the reader wishes to see shortly whether this statement is true, let him compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is engaged in eating the other.
Philipp Mainlander, a German philosopher, and lesser-known pessimistic thinker than Schopenhauer, also sheds light on the connection between philosophical outlook and mental health. The philosopher
Theodor Lessing said that Mainlander's central work The Philosophy of Redemption is “perhaps the most radical system of pessimism known to philosophical literature.” In this work, Mainlander – who was highly influenced by Schopenhauer – says that life has absolutely no worth and that “non-being is better than being”.
In terms of Mainlander's mental health, while serving in the military, he wrote to his sister Minna about being “exhausted, worked-out” and “ineffably tired”. (Inexplicable tiredness is a common symptom of depression.) After he completed writing The Philosophy of Redemption he experienced a mental collapse and then committed suicide, at the age of 34. It is hard to find any English translations of his work, but a Spanish article summarises his philosophy as follows:
The entire universe has one goal, which is to reach non-being. It achieves this through the continuous weakening of the sum of its forces. Here is referred the growth of entropy. Each individual must arrive at the exhaustion of his strength to the point that his desire for extermination can be fulfilled. The true liberation of man lies in suicide.
More than 90% of those who die by suicide have a diagnosable mental health condition. Mainlander highlights how philosophical outlook and well-being can become deeply entangled. Indeed, this raises the interesting question of how much of our worldview is influenced by our mental health, and how much is influenced by reasoning, observation, intuition, wisdom, and so forth and so on. This connection between philosophical pessimism and anti-natalism, and mental health, is also illuminated by the fact that people like Schopenhauer, Benatar and Mainlander make similar statements to depressives. While Schopenhauer believed that human existence, in general, is a mistake, a depressive may say that their life is a mistake. Is it so much of a leap to go from thinking you are an error to thinking that humanity as a whole is like some cosmic error?
If philosophical notions – such as pessimism and existential angst and crisis – commonly manifest in depression, might there not be something to be said about viewing depression as a philosophical problem, at least to some degree? As Tom Ruggiero writes:
Both perspectives, pessimism and existentialism, wouldn't necessarily see depression as a malady existing in a person's head. A pessimist and existentialist might, in fact, agree that the world itself is screwed up, that social norms are themselves pathological, that feelings of despair, anxiety, loss, and pointlessness may be typical in people who are exceptionally intelligent and observant. A person who is “depressed” may thus, on this view, see things others don't see, have keen insight into the waywardness of modern culture, have a refined sense of the good and the beautiful. Drugging a person would therefore dim his vision, desensitize his perception, kill the penchant to search for meanings.
It is a controversial statement, especially if it discourages certain people from pharmaceutical interventions and forms of psychotherapy based on changing one's patterns of thinking. Ruggiero does, however, raise the point that the way in which mental illness is perceived culturally can affect how it is recognised and treated. For the sake of balance and wellness, each individual should perhaps draw on those methods (philosophical, spiritual, pharmaceutical, physical and psychotherapeutic) that are most relevant and helpful to them. With something as complex as mental health, it would be unwise – dangerous, even – to make black-and-white, generalised recommendations.
Looking at Life Optimistically
In contrast to this discussion on pessimism, other philosophers do not look at the suffering intrinsic to human nature as something which calls for despair. The first Noble Truth of Buddhism states that life is characterised by suffering and being unsatisfied. Yet a miserable outlook doesn't really seem to be at the heart of Buddhist philosophy like it is for Schopenhauer (who was himself influenced by Buddhism). Moreover, Western spiritual teachers influenced by Eastern philosophy also acknowledge the truism of the first Noble Truth but – due to a natural optimistic tendency, an adoption of an optimistic outlook, or both – spin human suffering in a positive light.
Alan Watts, a philosopher who always exuded cheerfulness and joy in his various talks, said the following about the human condition:
Man suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for fun.
This is the real secret of life — to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.
The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.
There will always be suffering. But we must not suffer over the suffering.
We live in a culture where it has been rubbed into us in every conceivable way that to die is a terrible thing. And that is a tremendous disease from which our culture in particular suffers.
If we live, we live; if we die, we die; if we suffer, we suffer; if we are terrified, we are terrified. There is no problem about it.
The spiritual teacher Ram Dass has written and spoken about the paradox of suffering, that while it seems obvious that suffering is bad, it is also true that suffering is grace. Ram Dass acknowledges, however, that it is far more challenging to hold the view that suffering is grace compared to the view that suffering is bad. But this is the lifelong task of each person – to develop a different and healthier relationship to their suffering. Continually responding to pain from a place of wisdom can lessen the burden of mental suffering, and may end up radically changing your philosophical outlook in the process.
Pelham wrester Hasaan Hawthorne has garnered another award.
The 2016 AHSAA state wrestling champion, a double amputee who overcame this obstacle to become one of Alabama's best wrestlers, is the 2017 Section 3 recipient of the National High School Spirit of Sport Award by the National Federation of State High School Associations. He is now a freshman wrestler at North Idaho College in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.
“I am so excited that Hasaan was selected for this award,” Pelham Athletic Director Kim Kiel said. “As you know, he is a great wrestler, but an even better young man. Pelham is proud.”

The National High School Spirit of Sport Award goes to athletes who “exemplify the ideals of the spirit of sport that represent the core mission of education-based athletics,” according to a news release announcing the award. Hawthorne excelled as a wrestler despite being a double amputee at the knee.
Hawthorne capped his inspirational high school career by winning the AHSAA Class 6A 145-pound state wrestling championship in 2016, finishing with a 38-0 record as a senior. He placed third at the state meet in 2015.
Hawthorne had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 4 months old, but his parents didn't let that stop him. He participated in football, baseball, track and skateboarding before concentrating on wrestling as a high school athlete.
The NFHS divides the nation into eight geographical sections, and Section 3 includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.
State associations, such as the AHSAA, nominate athletes for the awards and winners are selected by the NFHS Spirit of Sport Award Selection Committee.
The national winner will be announced June 29 at the NFHS Summer Meeting in Providence, Rhode Island.
Once Philip Morris Workers, Now They Clamp Down On Uruguay's Smokers

The tiny nation of Uruguay is fighting a big opponent – the tobacco giant Philip Morris. Their legal battle is over tough anti-smoking legislation enacted in Uruguay which Philip Morris is trying to overturn.
But Uruguay has found some unlikely allies – a group of former Philip Morris workers.
Daniel Gomez, a 56-year-old with a salt-and-pepper mustache, recounts the day in 2011 he was fired from the job he'd had for 27 years. It started off the same as any other. He arrived at the Philip Morris factory where he did quality control and went to work. Just before his shift ended, though, everyone was called into the cafeteria.
"They gathered us all, and officially and without any previous warning, tell us that management had decided to close the factory down," he says.
The reason they gave was the excessive regulation of smoking in Uruguay.
Uruguay has some of the toughest anti–smoking legislation in the world.
You can't advertise tobacco products anywhere and at least 80 percent of a package of cigarettes must carry a health warning – often a gruesome picture of someone dying from a smoking-related disease. Also, tobacco companies can't sell different versions of the same brand – Marlboro and Marlboro light for example.
Lister Sena, who worked at Philip Morris for 11 years, says after they lost their jobs, some of the workers banded together to form the 21st of October Cooperative — named after the day they were fired. At first he says it was impossible to find work. They tried for two years.

A New Line Of Work
Finally, they knocked on the door of the Ministry of Health, he says. And it happened that they needed inspectors to enforce the new anti-smoking laws.
The ministry only had about four inspectors to cover the whole country so the men joined the team. So Sena now works against the company that once employed him.
"It's a comfort that what we are doing helps people's health. So now I feel better about my job than before," he says.
That job entails both enforcement and outreach. The men spend a lot of time explaining the anti-smoking legislation and trying to get people to stop smoking.
But they also carry out inspections.
Daniel Gomez walks into a popular Irish bar to examine the premises. He's looking for tobacco advertising or any evidence that someone has been smoking indoors.
The bar is not even allowed to have the colors of a popular brand of cigarettes suggestively placed on the wall. An infraction can carry a hefty fine or risk closure of the establishment.
Gomez says that the new laws wouldn't have teeth without the inspectors.
"The tobacco companies never thought that Uruguay would enforce the laws. What (we) do has been key," he says.
A Pending Lawsuit
Gomez's former employer Philip Morris is suing Uruguay. The issue is being litigated right now in Washington. Essentially Phillip Morris argues that Uruguay's laws infringe on free trade and the companies' profits.
"The question in this case is specific to the combination of the rule that says you can only have one brand at a time and 80 percent warning, which not only further interferes with our competitive position, but also raises serious questions about whether there was the proper legal authority," Marc Firestone, of Philip Morris International, told the BBC earlier this year.
Uruguay argues that it has the right to safeguard public health. The laws have had an effect, say Uruguayan health officials, with smoking going down by at least a third.
Polls also show the anti-tobacco legislation is widely supported among the population.
A ruling on the case isn't expected for several months.
Still, the saga of Philip Morris in Uruguay has had one clear upside. Inspector Ricardo Alvarez tells me that day he was fired four years ago made him quit smoking for good.

[HEMPSTEAD, NY] The hunger relief efforts of a small group of dedicated and caring Long Islanders operating on a near-zero budget is eclipsing that of the relief efforts of many well-funded 501-c3 organizations, both in number of people served and in the volume of food distributed. The group, a Long Island chapter of the decentralized, grassroots, hunger relief group, Food Not Bombs, is serving to both inspire the local community and simultaneously raise questions as to how an autonomous group with a shoestring budget can outmatch non-profits of similar purpose whose operating budget exceeds millions of dollars annually.
Long Island Food Not Bombs (LIFNB), who facilitates community food shares 5 days a week, and organizes distributions of recovered food 7 days a week, distributed nearly 30,000lbs of produce yesterday alone (12/22/2013). These large numbers have become more common for the group in recent years, and is credited in-part to the group's sister non-profit Community Solidarity Inc., whose 501-c3 status has allowed greater access to recovery points such as grocers and local cafes. The exponential increase in attendance at LIFNB's food shares can also be attributed to the radical increase in income inequality and it's creation of a growing constituency of hungry, working, poor families. LIFNB's savvy use of social media, and community-driven organizing model has also contributed to its explosive growth. Moreover, the food served is delicious.
An 8min video published today by The Sparrow Project titled This Is What Solidarity Looks Like: 24hrs With Long Island Food Not Bombs provides a cross-sectional view into the group's daily operations, specifically the 24 hour period surrounding the group's annual Thanksgiving food share which took place this year on November 24th at the Long Island Rail Road Station in Hempstead, NY.
PEOPLE IMPACTED BY THE SHARE »
Between 3pm and 4pm on November 24th, 2013 over 2,500 people visited the share and left with groceries, plates of hot food, or both.
TOTAL WEIGHT OF GROCERIES SHARED »
Between 3pm and 4pm on November 24th, 2013 approximately 50,078.75lbs of food was distributed. This consisted of fresh produce, cereals, soy milks, cooking amenities like oils and flours, as well as non essentials like spices and sweeteners. This abundance, if distributed evenly, could provide a week worth of nutrition for all 2,500 attendees.
VEGAN HOT MEALS »
Between 3pm and 4pm on November 24th, 2013 approximately 1,850 people enjoyed hot vegan meals. Long Island Food Not Bombs extends their foundational message of non-violence to embrace non-human animals and therefore only recovers and distributes vegetarian grocery items and only prepares hot meals that are strictly vegan. The group's plant-based entrées (often celebrated by vegans and carnivores alike) is not only more sustainable and safe for distribution but directly challenges the Turkey fundraisers of other soup kitchens. The Hempstead meal alone spared ~180 turkeys.
SUPPLEMENTING FAMILIES' INCOME »
On average Long Island Food Not Bombs saves a family who attends their food shares ~ $100 every week*. These savings add up for families who regularly attend the shares and can exceed $4,000 in savings per-family annually*. [ calculations based on fair market value of food donated*]
OPERATING ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET »
The creation of the group's sister non-profit Community Solidarity has increased the group's access to food and the groups ability to help an exponentially larger amount of people, all while allowing the autonomy, DIY ethos, and radical politics of Food Not Bombs to remain intact. The two-tier system however has not resulted in an infusion of capital. Unlike 501-c3 organizations with similar purposes, LIFNB and Community Solidarity Inc., have no paid employees and continue to operate on a shoestring. If you want to help change that you can do so by donating to Community Solidarity HERE.
The video published today by The Sparrow Project, is intended to inspire others to pursue similar endeavors in their own communities. LIFNB places emphasis on solidarity over charity and community engagement over hierarchical charitable models that can inadvertently patronize the communities they intend to help. Through the use of social media, a dedicated core of volunteers, and countless community members that make up the foundation of their food share distributions, Long Island Food Not Bombs was able to serve over 1,000,000lbs of food to tens of thousand of Long Islander's in 2013.

To President-elect Donald Trump's assertion that climate change is a hoax “created by and for the Chinese,” China offers this: Wrong!
As Bloomberg reports, China's Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin said Wednesday that it was Republican U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush ― not the Chinese ― who started the conversation about global warming.
“If you look at the history of climate change negotiations, actually it was initiated by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] with the support of the Republicans during the Reagan and senior Bush administration during the late 1980s,” Zhenmin reportedly told reporters gathered at United Nations talks in Morocco.
During a presidential debate in September, Trump snapped at Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton after she criticized him for calling climate change a hoax, saying “I did not say that.”
Like the claim itself, Trump's response to Clinton was nonsense.
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012
We can't destroy the competitiveness of our factories in order to prepare for nonexistent global warming. China is thrilled with us! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 5, 2012
Trump also has dismissed climate change as “bullshit,” and has vowed to withdraw from global actions to combat it.
Trump has also said he would cut all federal spending for climate change research, cleaner technologies and aid for communities already threatened by climate impacts. He has turned to climate change denier Myron Ebell and fossil fuel lobbyist Mike McKenna to help with transition work at the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy.
Zhenmin said he hopes Trump's administration will continue to support U.S. efforts to curb carbon emissions, Bloomberg reported. China, he said, will continue to fight climate change “whatever the circumstances.”
In September, U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping fortified commitments to reduce carbon emissions by formally joining the Paris agreement. The leaders of the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases pledged a “continued bilateral climate cooperation.”
“Of course we're still expecting developed countries, including the United States, will continue to take the lead on mitigating climate change,” Zhenmin said.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also spoke at the U.N. conference Wednesday about the looming Trump presidency.
“While I can't stand here and speculate about what policies our president-elect will pursue, I will tell you this: In the time that I have spent in public life, one of the things I've learned is that some issues look a little bit different when you're actually in office compared to when you're on the campaign trail,” Kerry said, according to Reuters.
“At some point, even the strongest skeptic has to acknowledge that something disturbing is happening.”
Here are a few of the things Trump has said about climate change in recent years:
This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps,and our GW scientists are stuck in ice — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2014
Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee - I'm in Los Angeles and it's freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2013
The weather has been so cold for so long that the global warming HOAXSTERS were forced to change the name to climate change to keep $ flow! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014
With hundreds of thousands of privately-owned drones zipping around the world's airways, it's only a matter of time before a UAV collides with an airplane in flight and causes serious problems. So to figure how bad something like this would actually be, the British government is taking drones, and well, flying them into airplanes.
The tests are being paid for by the United Kingdom's Department for Transport, and will be performed by UK-based defense and aerospace technology company Quinetiq. The British Civil Aviation Authority, the agency that regulates drone usage, said the tests will primarily be used to show how drones could damage an airplane's fuselage, The Verge reports. The trials will reportedly be performed on the ground and with military airplanes instead of commercial jets.
British officials have allocated more than $307, 500 for the tests, the Daily Mail reports. A complete report with the contractor's findings will be released by the end of 2016.
"The testing of potential collision impacts between a drone and a fixed wing aircraft is currently being carried out on behalf of the UK Ministry of Defense," a CAA spokesperson said to The Verge. "The findings of this research is expected to be published when completed."
Currently, it is unclear when or where the tests will be performed, or specifically what type of equipment will be tested. As for location, Qinetiq has a facility with 5,000 square miles of space in Snowdonia, Wales, which sounds like it could do the trick.
As of now, there have been three confirmed crashes drone-airplane crashes in Europe—all of which occurred with small airplanes and resulted in little damage.
In 2015, America's Federal Aviation Authority released a report that showed there were 678 times when pilots saw drones in the sky, some of those being rather close calls—though these numbers were later found to be slightly stretched. As The Verge notes, the Academy of Model Aeronautics reported that only 3.5 percent of the pilot drone spots were close shaves. Also, some of those "drone" sightings were actually originally reported to be a "mini blimp," "a large vulture," and "a UFO."
In a report released earlier in October, the European Aviation Safety Agency said that with drones under 3.3 pounds—which most toy and hobby drones fall under—aircraft damage would likely be relatively slim and fatalities unlikely. Still, it's better to be sure than sorry—so we're glad the Brits are testing this out firsthand.
A new survey says economic policies will be a deciding factor for most young Americans. (Photo11: Getty Images/iStockphoto)
The majority of young voters, ages 18 to 26 years old, surveyed in the latest Bank of America/USA TODAY Better Money Habits poll said they'll vote with their pocketbooks in this upcoming presidential election. In fact, 65% will give more weight to a candidate's stance on economic policies — and the impact that has on their wallets — than they will social issues.
When respondents were asked which financial issues will play the biggest role in who they'll support politically, the young adults named job growth, the national economy, health care costs, and student loan debt as top concerns. More than 75% said they think the outcome of the next presidential election will impact their financial lives for the next four years.
Financial issues and how they'll impact young voters isn't a new topic to the campaign trail. President Obama addressed the cost of college tuition back in the 2008 election (and famously admitted that it took him decades to pay off his own student loans). In the 2012 presidential election, the economy was named the top campaign issue across voter segments in a Gallup poll conducted at that time. But today's young voters, who may be students, new to the workforce, or struggling to achieve financial independence, know they face an uphill financial battle. The White House recently reported that 71% of students who have a bachelor's degree emerge from college with student loan debt; the average owed is $29,400. Nearly 60% of the young adults surveyed who have student loan debt said it is impacting their decision on who to vote for in the presidential election.
Though data reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates that the job market has improved slightly (9.5% of young workers were unemployed in March 2016, compared to 10.6% the year prior), young adults remain concerned. Slightly more than one quarter of the young adult respondents said they'd like to hear more about the candidates' respective positions on job growth, followed closely health care costs, and national security. “As the economy improves and we get farther away from the financial crisis of 2008, hopefully the optimism of this group of young people is matched by opportunities and greater access to the job market becomes real for them,” says Andrew Plepler, Environmental, Social and Governance executive at Bank of America.
He adds that while young adult's financial concerns are understandable, their awareness of how politics may impact their bottom line likely extends deeper than dollars and cents. “There's a trust issue among young people - they are questioning whether the system works for them, whether that's in regards to student debt, health care costs, or the job market. They're wondering if the system will afford them the same opportunity their parents had,” says Plepler.
American University's School of Public Affairs' professor and political behavior expert Jan Leighley, Ph.D agrees that young voters' focus on financial issues probably stems from a few factors, including a keen awareness of the impacts of the economic downturn. Leighley said it makes sense that they are focused on these issues “having the recession of 2008 in mind, and having seen parents and neighbors lose jobs and houses.”
It's not surprising then, that based on their responses to the latest Better Money Habits poll, they want to make sure that economic issues are front and center in the coming weeks: 71% of the respondents said they would like to hear the candidate's stance on issues that will affect their personal financial situations.
It is clear that young adults today are focused on their finances, but they may not have the support they need. That is one reason Bank of America created Better Money Habits®, a free, interactive financial education resource developed in partnership with Khan Academy, a nonprofit with the mission of providing free educational content to anyone, anywhere. On it, young adults can read articles and/or watch short videos on a wide range of topics including how to manage income from a part-time job or freelance gig, and how to take advantage of pretax benefits offered through an employer to offset costs of health care.

A peaceful pro Trump rally was underway in Philly this afternoon, but was soon canceled after ANTIFA anti-democratic, anti-American thugs converged on the scene — clashing with Philly cops, who unlike those in Berkeley, showed no problem cracking heads when deemed appropriate.

Being a pro at Magic: The Gathering isn't simply about enjoying a card game with your friends. Like most professional sports, it involves practice, dedicated study, and participation in what many professionals describe as a "grueling" tournament schedule.[1] However, if you feel like the professional circuit of the Magic playing card game is the place for you, by improving through playing, research, and mental discipline, you could rise through the ranks of players and make a name for yourself in the Pro Tour Hall of Fame.
A fun thing to do would be to break into a hotel and replace all the nightstand-drawer bibles with copies of Joy Williams' new-ish book, Ninety-Nine Stories of God, just to see who notices, and to see what the people who notice do about it. The confusion is intentional: It's sternly hardbound and grimly biblical despite its smallness, with the word God rendered in a font so large and unnerving that it takes a long time to even get around to the illustration below it, of four pink-tongued dogs in a rowboat on a choppy open sea.
Basically, it looks like a devotional or a Bible-study sorta deal; it is very decidedly not that at all, and at least one profoundly unsatisfied Amazon customer, who goes by the username “Mom of 8,” has been duped, and will not stand for it. “This book is terrible!” Mom of 8 writes. “The title is completely misleading. It is a series of very brief stories that are random, and not about God or faith. This is the worst book that I have read in years.” One star.
Williams would probably take that unwelcome surprise and indignation as a compliment. She's in her 70s, wears totally awesome sunglasses 24/7, and loves her dogs, which she shuttles in her Toyota from Arizona to Wyoming to Maine and back, either bringing her typewriter with her to these home bases or stashing one at each location. The New York Times Magazine, in a memorably eerie 2015 profile, described her as a “writer's writer's writer,” with four black-comic novels and a daunting armory of gently nihilistic short fiction to her credit, exemplified by last year's The Visiting Privilege, a huge collection of 46 tales full of dead dogs, teenage-girl besties who hate each other, wayward divorceés, bumper-car accidents, obscene sex acts involving tiramisu, and other such bleak hilarities. Here is Joy Williams' idea of a breakup letter, in full:
My ego is too healthy for real involvement with you. I don't like you. Good-bye.
— Alyce
It's pretty fantastic, though also a lot to deal with, in terms of volume and psychic weight. Ninety-Nine Stories of God, a 2013 e-book in print for the first time via Tin House Books, is far quicker and easier, aiming to unsettle you, but in a weirdly soothing way. The number in the title, at least, is straightforward, with just shy of 100 brief vignettes as short as one sentence and no longer than a few pages. You can easily read the whole thing on a flight of any length, though it's liable to make your flying experience way more anxious, as you ruminate on the tin can with wings you're traveling in and the simple, fallible, pathetic human beings steering it.
The God part of the title is trickier — Mom of 8 certainly has the “random” part right. It's true that “the Lord,” a character just as feeble as all the rest, shows up in quite a few of these jams, or doesn't. (“But the Lord never showed up,” ends no. 60, entitled “PARTY.”) The Lord's concerns here are quite pedestrian: Consecutive stories begin with “The Lord was in line at the pharmacy counter waiting to get His shingles shot” and “The Lord had always wanted to participate in a demolition derby,” respectively. He prefers hanging out with animals as opposed to people, though the bats and the wolves, at least, are quite leery of him, with good reason.
But more often, God doesn't seem to enter into it at all. Other topics: O.J. Simpson, Ted Kaczynski, humiliated elephants who set themselves on fire, a pet rabbit named “Actually,” a child and a lion discussing death and irony, the various foibles of famous artists and philosophers and war reporters and such, etc. A story's title is withheld until the end, often delivering what amounts in this universe to a punchline. Here is no. 61, in its entirety:
We were not interested the way we thought we would be interested.
MUSEUM
The award for Best Closing Line is a tie between “The divorce cost seventeen times what the wedding had, and the children didn't turn out all that well either,” and “Without reflection, he put out his hand and extended the middle finger.” There is no trophy.
It's hard to say what makes all this so calming and consoling. If you could articulate exactly why, it probably wouldn't work. Williams is a fierce environmentalist who, like the Lord, seems to prefer wolves and bats — and especially dogs — to most people. “You have made only brutal contact with Nature,'' she wrote in a 2001 book of angry essays called Ill Nature. ‘‘You cannot comprehend its grace.” The same goes for her writing, as perplexing as it might be. The best approach is to read Ninety-Nine Stories of God all in one shot, and then dip in randomly thereafter, at your darkest and dimmest hour, finding solace in, say, the entry that ends, “There were two funerals but only one trial.” It will make you feel worse, for obvious reasons, but it will also, somehow, make you feel much better, for reasons that aren't obvious at all.
Take a tour of Earth's weirdest natural places, from the roof of the world to the cave of crystals to the home of the dragon's blood tree.
We often let our imaginations run wild, dreaming up some pretty surreal stuff that could surprise even the most well-seasoned of acid trippers. But we can't compete with nature. From pink water to 50-ton crystals to the biggest cave in the world, here are six places around the globe that come by their “could be from a Salvador Dalí painting” vibe completely naturally.
First up: A superhero's lair in Alaska…
Weirdest Natural Places: Mendenhall Ice Cave
Few people actually get to see a glacier in person. Even fewer get to see a cave inside the glacier, which is typically formed by a stream of water or volcanic vents. That is what made the Mendenhall Ice Cave special. Well…that and the fact that it looked like the inside of the Fortress of Solitude.
Why the past tense, you ask? While Mendenhall Glacier still exists (you can't miss it; it's 12 miles long and just outside the Alaskan capital of Juneau), the cave is now virtually inaccessible, after suffering a major roof collapse in 2014. Because getting inside the cave was so dangerous, difficult and time consuming, Mendenhall was, despite its singular, surreal beauty, never had all that many guests.
Next up: A lake that's not even close to blue…
There is a character in Greek mythology named Sisyphus. You may have heard of him. He was king well known for his deceptive, dishonest, and ignoble manner of ruling his kingdom. When it was time for him to die, he even tricked Thanatos and managed to escape death.
As you might suspect, Zeus and the other Gods were not impressed with Sisyphus and decided to teach him a lesson. He was punished with the unending frustration of pushing a rock up a hill. But the rock was enchanted and would slip and roll back down the hill just before making it to the pinnacle. And so we would have to forever begin again, pushing the rock every damn day.
Like any myth, there are a number of ways to interpret this story. The way I see it, the rock represents your embodied human existence. It is destined to fall no matter how hard you push. Trying to outwit death, illness, and old age is committing your self to the maddening task of trying to accomplish the impossible.
#yogaeverydamnday
I started seeing this hashtag on social media a few years ago. At first I thought it was kind of cute. It seems to be all about commitment and dedication to your practice.
But the more I saw it the more I began to get a funny feeling every time I read it. I would say it out loud and it did not elicit the spirit of relaxation and enjoyment that I associate with yoga practice.
For starters I have never seen a photo of somebody mindfully cleaning their kitchen with the hashtag #yogaeverdamnday. Searching the hashtag earlier today, I found 2/500 photos of somebody meditating or doing pranayama with that hashtag attached. I saw inspirational quotes, people twerking, people checking their laptops while in pincha mayurasana (forearm balance), some cool variations of postures I had never seen before, a few impressive backbends, a couple waterfalls, a whole bunch of beaches and, of course, SO MANY BIKINIS.
Don't get me wrong now…I enjoy inversions, backbends, arm balances, and bikinis. But these were all impressive feats of strength and flexibility. There were all kinds of evidence that the subjects of these photos have dedicated themselves to accomplishing very cool looking poses. But then maybe that hashtag should be more like #PerformativeAsanaEveryDamnDay. I suppose that is not as catchy.
Stretching and Balancing
The hashtag brings up an interesting question…one that has been making the rounds a little in the yoga blog world. Is it laudable, inspiring, or advisable to practice hatha yoga every damn day? Judging by my cursory Instagram research, it seems that is what is meant by #yogaeverydamnday. Not meditation every damn day. Not relaxation. Not measured and mindful breathing. Stretching and balancing every damn day.
There is a consensus among all the medieval hatha yoga manuals that yoga should be practiced uninterrupted every day. But these manuals were written by and for renunciates who walked away from their jobs and families to find freedom. In many ways, the renunciate roots of hatha yoga are not really compatible with WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, Democratic) cultures.
Contemporary WEIRD yogis have jobs and families. We have friends and all kinds of social gatherings and obligations to which we must attend. Our attention is called in many directions. Those of us with children all recognize how much our attention they require.
Our yoga practice may meet resistance in many forms, not all of which should be met with force (hatha) such that we can practice every damn day. Sometimes we need to be more yielding and forgiving with ourselves and others. Injuries need time to heal, children need our love and attention, and the laundry needs to be folded.
Practicing yoga every damn day may actually be building resentment into our encounters with yoga. Just look at the language. We don't need more “damn days” in our lives. The impression is that practicing yoga is a responsibility. But yoga is not something we should do because we have some kind of contractual obligation to do so. We should do it when we want, how we want, with whom we want, whenever it seems like a good idea.
Obsessive Yoga Disorder
I want to kiss my wife because it feels good, not because #kissingeverydamnday. I enjoy having a beer while I BBQ, but I don't want to #beereverydamnday. And I want to practice hatha yoga when it feels good, when my body and mind seem to be asking for it, not #everydamnday.
Contemporary yogis who are compulsively practicing hatha yoga postures are like Sisyphus. Pushing our physical practice of these asanas up the hill of our embodied existence, we inevitably find ourselves watching as injuries, aging, or simply the rest of our lives causes our practice to roll back down through all that hard-earned real estate.
So in the spirit of practicing hatha yoga in a way that is not neurotic, compulsive, or otherwise indicative of OBY (Obsessive Yoga Disorder), I humbly propose a number of new hashtags that can replace #yogaeverydamnday:
#YogaEveryNowAndThen
#YogaWhenItOccursToYou
#YogaThatIsAppropriateToMyLifeConditions
#NotAddictedToAsana
#RecoveringFromOYD
#GuiltFreeYoga
#DoItBecauseYouLoveItNotBecauseYouHaveTo
#SometimesYogaIsQuiteNice
#YogaOnASomewhatRegularBasis
3D printed parts have been finding themselves in rockets and spacecraft for a few years now, but typically it was a single, experimental part, usually printed in metal. However, using 3D printed parts in production of spacecraft like the types of rockets that send satellites into orbit hasn't been especially common. But that is starting to change, as United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, has started sending Atlas V rockets into orbit using several 3D printed parts made from advanced thermoplastic materials developed for them by Stratasys. Not only do these 3D printed parts shave critical weight off of the rocket, they often significantly reduce the cost of manufacturing them, which is vital when dealing with non-recoverable spacecraft like the Atlas V.
Spacecraft manufacturers like United Launch Alliance usually do fabricate a lot of the components and parts used in their rockets in-house, though a large number of them are simply purchased from third party manufacturers and brought in. That involves purchasing thousands of parts and verifying that each one has been made with the exacting standards required by the aerospace industry. Additionally, these parts then needs to be assembled, also within the strict standards of the industry. Not only does that take more time, but it can get costly in both parts and manual labor. Recently, ULA partnered with Stratasys to develop 3D printing materials that were strong and durable enough to replace more expensive, traditionally manufactured metal parts.
The recent successful launch of the Atlas V has proven the viability of using lightweight 3D printable thermoplastics for many applications usually made using metals. The rocket has several of these 3D printed parts, primarily for an air ducting system in the rocket's payload fairing that keeps vital electrical components cool during the launch. The parts included brackets, nozzles, panel close-outs and huge printed sections of ducting. Because many of the parts could be printed as large, single parts rather than smaller metal parts that would need to be assembled, 3D printing reduced the number of components in the ducting from 140 parts down to just 16.
ULA used their in-house Stratasys Fortus 900mc FDM 3D printer and their high-performance thermoplastic ULTEM 9085 material to print the rocket's ducting system. ULTEM 9085 is an extremely tough material that was developed specifically for high-stress uses like a rocket and once it has been printed it is extremely hard to damage. And because the Fortus 900mc has a massive 36 x 24 x 36 inch (914 x 610 x 914 mm) build area it could produce extremely large sections of ducting with geometries that would be impossible to manufacture traditionally.
“Stratasys continues to be a great supplier to ULA, supporting our Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicles. Our partnership has enabled Stratasys to bring parts such as tooling and support equipment into ULA's factory in Decatur, Alabama to help us build rockets,” explained the Additive Manufacturing manager at United Launch Alliance, Greg Arend.
The payload fairing on the Atlas V is the large cone at the top of the rocket that houses the satellite or equipment that is being launched into orbit. While anything that is made to operate in the vacuum of space is very durable and able to handle a wide range of temperatures, the heat generated by rockets launched is quite another thing entirely. The fairing needs to be extremely well insulated and cooled in order to prevent any damage from the heat. However, the metal ducting typically used to cool rockets like this can be heavy, which reduces the possible weight of the payload and uses more fuel.
By replacing the ducting with thermoplastic parts, the weight is reduced, which allows larger more complex payloads to be launched. It is also considerably cheaper, especially when it comes to disposable launch vehicles like the Atlas V. ULA is working closely with Stratasys to develop 3D printing material standards so the 3D printing process itself is verified and can be relied on to meet strict flight application guidelines. They also have the ability to trace every spool back to its raw, pellet form so the quality of the material can be verifiable.
“It's been impressive to see how ULA has innovated with industrial 3D printing, and we are excited to continue working with them to push the technology further,” said Stratasys Director of Business Development – Aerospace & Defense, Scott Sevcik.
Here is some video about the role 3D printing plays in modern rocket manufacturing with ULA:
Stratasys will be exhibiting at the 2016 Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, CO on April 11th to the 14th. They will be displaying their additive manufacturing capabilities and discussing how they can be used by the spacecraft manufacturing industry for both tooling and in-flight hardware. You can find them at booth 1132. What do you think of 3D printing becoming so involved in connection with space travel? Discuss in the Rocket Launch & 3D Printing forum over at 3DPB.com.
Seven-episode series to air this year will include footage of newly discovered and never-before filmed creatures
The new series of Blue Planet will feature Sir David Attenborough's familiar narration, as the BBC aims to repeat the success of Planet Earth II.
The voice of the UK's most-loved naturalist will accompany footage filmed over four years when the series airs across seven episodes on BBC1 this year.
The involvement of Attenborough, who turned 90 last May and is regularly rumoured to be on the verge of retirement, is something of a coup for the BBC.
Planet Earth II's most mindblowing moments Read more
Combining his practised insight with stunning footage captured using the latest technology helped Planet Earth II draw the largest audiences for a natural history programme for at least 15 years. More than 13 million people tuned in for the opening episode, and the series averaged an audience of more than 10 million.
Attenborough's reputation should also help international sales of the programme, which is being made in partnership with BBC America, the German broadcaster WDR and France Télévisions.
Although Attenborough was replaced in the US version of the original Blue Planet by the actor Pierce Brosnan, his voice was used on Planet Earth II in the US, and he is seen as an asset in taking the show to overseas markets. At an annual showcase event last year held by BBC commercial arm BBC Worldwide, Attenborough was given a standing ovation by the assembled TV buyers, and Blue Planet II will be unveiled at this year's event, which started on Sunday.
The original Blue Planet sold in more than 50 countries and a 90-minute edit was made for cinemas. Budget cuts mean the BBC is now under even more pressure to sell its shows abroad. Planet Earth II debuted on BBC America on Saturday, with special content produced for Snapchat released the previous day.
In a statement announcing his part in Blue Planet II, Attenborough said: “I am truly thrilled to be joining this new exploration of the underwater worlds which cover most of our planet, yet are still its least known.”
As with both the original Blue Planet, which was broadcast in 2001, and both series of Planet Earth, the BBC's natural history team have developed new camera technology and techniques to capture previously unobtainable footage.
These include ultra high-definition “tow cams” that can film predatory fish and dolphins front-on, and suction cameras recording the view from the backs of large creatures such as whale sharks and orcas.
The team have also used the latest marine technology, including two unmanned submersibles, allowing them to record footage from 1,000 metres under the Antarctic Ocean.
The results include footage of newly discovered and never-before filmed creatures, including hairy-chested Hoff crabs, snub fin dolphins that spit water, and a tool-using tusk fish.
The executive producer James Honeyborne described the oceans as “the most exciting place to be right now”.
He added: “New scientific discoveries have given us a new perspective of life beneath the waves. Blue Planet II is taking its cue from these breakthroughs, unveiling unbelievable new places, extraordinary new behaviours and remarkable new creatures. Showing a contemporary portrait of marine life, it will provide a timely reminder that this is a critical moment for the health of the world's oceans.”
The BBC's head of commissioning for natural history and specialist factual, Tom McDonald, said the programme would “deliver a new benchmark in natural history film-making.
“Blue Planet II promises to combine the exceptional craftsmanship that our audiences have come to expect from BBC Natural History with genuinely new revelations about the creatures and habitats of the world's oceans. I have no doubt it will thrill and delight the audience.”
Attenborough previously described Planet Earth II as a form of “two-way therapy” for viewers and the natural world. He wrote in the Radio Times last year that viewers were “reconnecting with a planet whose beauty is blemished, whose health is failing, because they understand that our own wellbeing is inextricably linked to that of the planet's.”
His involvement with the BBC's latest aquatic series is especially timely following the decision by the UK's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to name its £200m research vessel after the naturalist.
The decision was made after the council rejected the name Boaty McBoatface chosen in an online poll. The council compromised by giving the public's chosen name to the vessel's submersible.
The RSS Sir David Attenborough and Boaty McBoatface are expected to begin their research mission in 2019.
Blue Planet's top moments:
Blue whale
Attenborough accompanies footage of a blue whale with facts and figures about the largest creature on the planet. “Its tongue weighs as much as an elephant; its heart is the size of a car.”
Herring bonanza
Predators from above and below water acting in unison to create a fishy all-you-can-eat buffet off the coast of Vancouver Island.
Sharks visiting an underwater mountain
Attenborough sums up the scene's appeal in four words: “Sharks … hundreds of sharks.”
A cruel moment
One of those scenes from nature that comes with an entirely necessary graphic content warning: killer whales feeding on young sea lions. The narration is no less distressing, as Attenborough describes how “for whatever reason, the seal pup, still alive, is tossed back and forth for over half an hour.”
The dark zone
Some of the most captivating footage in Blue Planet was filmed far below the surface in the darkest regions of the ocean, where a host of weird and wonderful creatures make their own light.

USMNT and Newcastle United right back DeAndre Yedlin is close to a full recovery from the injury that kept in out of March World Cup Qualifiers.
Reports are coming out that DeAndre Yedlin is getting close to a full recovery and should be back playing with Newcastle United for their final push for promotion to the EPL. The American international hasn't played a game since March 4th where Newcastle went five points clear of at the top of the table with a 3-1 win over Huddersfield Town. Since Yedlin's injury, though, the Magpies have fallen down the table a little bit, sitting in second place, three points behind Brighton.
DeAndre Yedlin was the first of many injuries the USMNT had to deal with for their World Cup Qualifying matches against Honduras and Panama. Though the US got four out of the six possible points, Yedlin was definitely missed as Graham Zusi played right back in Panama and was frequently beat.
While Yedlin was recovering from his thigh injury, he made the trip to Los Angeles to be examined by US Soccer team doctors. USMNT head coach Bruce Arena gave a timeline for his recovery:
I would expect him to be back on the field for Newcastle right at the end of this season in April.
This would give Yedlin about a month to get playing time in with Newcastle before being called into training for the June World Cup Qualifiers at home against Trinidad & Tobago and, arguably the hardest match of the Hex, away against Mexico.
Overall, US Soccer fans as well as Newcastle United fans are glad to see the 23-year-old close to getting back on the pitch.
In all of the abstract discussion about Labour values, it's easy to forget that one of Labour's real concrete values is to support and defend the NHS. If you cut the Labour party in half, it would have the letters NHS running through it.
The contrast with the Conservatives could not be greater, especially this Tory government. They are now embarked on their second major reorganisation of the NHS in just six years. Partly this is to clear up the structural mess created by Andrew Lansley's Health and Social Care Act, legislation that Theresa May and all the leading Tories supported. But their deeply damaging drive towards marketisation and privatisation continues, on top of what NHS Providers describes as the “longest and deepest financial squeeze in NHS history”.
Feet first, our NHS is limping towards privatisation | Polly Toynbee Read more
This is leading to the deepest ever crisis in the NHS. Almost every target is being missed and waiting times are lengthening for ambulances, for A&E, for cancer referrals and for elective surgery beyond 18 weeks. Leaks have revealed that the new STPs – sustainability and transformation plans – are really Secret Tory Plans to decimate the NHS. Beds, units, departments, and whole hospitals will be closed, even though the population is both growing and ageing.
No party that put patients first would do any of this. And no party which valued the contribution of NHS workers would treat them the way the Tories have. Their record is real pay cuts, cuts to pensions, an increase in unpaid hours and now the attempt to impose unsafe and unfunded new contracts on the junior doctors. This has culminated in the first ever all-out strikes in the NHS.
The “seven-day NHS” is a chimera. Acute services have always been available in the NHS. It is only under the Tories that ambulances have been queueing around the block because there are no beds to admit patients, and that this has been happening on weekdays. The campaign for a seven-day NHS is a device to impose new, worse contracts on junior doctors. There is no logic in singling them out, and consultants, nurses, paramedics and admin staff could all be in the firing line next.
None of this is necessary. The reorganisations themselves are causing huge waste and disruption as providers and commissioners are first told to compete in the “health economies” and then that they must collaborate geographically. The cost of private finance initiatives (PFI) continues to rise and will be over £2bn this year. Because of staff shortages the agency staffing bill has soared to £3.6bn. And Big Pharma continues to milk the NHS, which now even the government weakly recognises. Above all, the greater involvement of the private sector means that NHS has to pay for private profits with funds that could be used for public service.
Labour will aim to drive the private sector rip-off out of the NHS. We will establish a PFI Monitoring Unit to hold the contractors to account, ending excessive charges and payments for shoddy service.
We will be able to redirect these funds to frontline services. Investment will be directed where it is most effective. So, childhood and adolescent mental health services, where three-quarters of all mental health conditions begin will be a major priority. We will promote public health, which itself is a public good and it will save the NHS money.
I remember the welfare state being built. A divided Labour cannot save it | Harry Leslie Smith Read more
It is time to end the attacks on NHS workers. Staff need discussion and negotiation, not threats of imposed contracts. They also need to be encouraged to work in the NHS. The terrible decision to abolish bursaries for student nurses, midwives and other professionals and burden them with debt risks exacerbating the staff shortages in the NHS in these key areas.
This abolition of bursaries will be reversed by an incoming Labour government. We will end the scandal that these professionals will incur debt just to work in the NHS.
The difference between Labour and Tory values is extremely stark in relation to the NHS. The Tories are dismantling it. The whole of Labour can unite in defending it.
OAKLAND — Kyrie Irving has a broken knee cap, Kevin Love is recovering from shoulder surgery and Anderson Varejao has been out since Christmas. The Cleveland Cavaliers have been decimated by injuries to three of their best players.
But they've still made it this far. They still have a chance to steal home-court advantage in The Finals in Game 2 on Sunday (8 p.m. ET, ABC). And they still have LeBron James, who's been a pretty good one-star show this season.
James has played only 545 (less than 18 percent) of his total minutes (regular season and playoffs) with neither Irving nor Love on the floor. But the Cavs have outscored their opponents by 149 points in those 545 minutes, playing great on both ends of the floor.
Most of those minutes have been played with just one big alongside James. But in the one-star scenario, the Cavs have been good playing either big or small. With two bigs, they've been fantastic defensively. With James at the four, they've been much stronger offensively.
The Cavs' two most-used, no-Irving-or-Love lineups have been both great. The small lineup — with Matthew Dellavedova, Iman Shumpert, J.R. Smith, James and Tristan Thompson — is a plus-53 in 87 minutes. The big lineup (likely to start Game 2) — with Timofey Mozgov in Smith's place — is a plus-59 in 82 minutes.
Both of those lineups have allowed less than 90 points per 100 possessions. But the Cavs' defense has been at its best in those no-Irving-or-Love minutes with Mozgov on the floor.
Of course, the Cavs were a minus-13 in less than 10 minutes with Irving off the floor in Game 1 on Thursday. The Warriors have been the league's best team all season. And Cleveland will need to figure out how to bend the Golden State defense a little, so that James can get more support from his supporting cast.
James has used 37.1 percent of the Cavs' possessions when he's been on the floor in the playoffs, a mark that leads the league by a wide margin. In 224 minutes with Irving off the floor in the playoffs, James' usage rate is an incredible 46.4 percent.
So, how the Warriors defend him and how the Cavs deal with that defense becomes all the more important.
In Game 1, Golden State went one-on-one with James (for the most part), taking away his passing lanes and forcing him into tough shots. The result was a not-so-efficient 44 points from the Cavs' star and not enough help from the guys around him.
But the Cavs were inches away from winning the game. And James made it clear on Friday that his 44 points were more about his ability than the Warriors' defense.
“First of all, you can't let me have 40,” James said when asked about the opponent's game plan. “I go get 40. It's not like they're just getting out of the way. So those guys aren't saying ‘we're okay with letting him have 40.' You don't let me have 40. I'm making those shots.”
He also said that the Warriors' defense wasn't as simple as it may have looked.
“They're not just giving me one steady dosage of ‘we're going to just let him play,'” James said. “That's what they want to get out to you guys, but that's not what's happening. Yeah, I see it all throughout the course of the game. They've given me different matchups, just trying to keep me off balance.
“But I've seen it all, and I've got to do a better job as well getting my other guys involved. I'm okay with getting big numbers and things of that nature, but I feel much better when I'm able to get my guys in rhythm and get them guys some more looks.”
Cavs coach David Blatt wants to see his team look for more opportunities to score before the Golden State defense is set up. Just seven of the Cavs' 94 shots came in the first seconds of the shot clock on Thursday, according to SportVU. And it's also on James' teammates to get the defense to move when he has the ball.
“We can do a little bit of a better job moving without the basketball, attacking more in transition,” Blatt said Friday. “I didn't think there was any particular advantage to playing him one way or the next. But because the result was what it was, you could interpret it that way.”
Most observers will count the Cavs out of this series after losing Game 1 and losing Irving in the process. They may ultimately be right. But there's hope in just how well James has carried his team without its other two stars to this point.

. @mikebarnicle : What would you do, if you were elected, about Aleppo? @GovGaryJohnson : And what is Aleppo? https://t.co/ZbqO5RAEsk
Thursday on MSNBC's “Morning Joe,” Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson was caught dumbfounded when he was asked what he would do about Aleppo, the Syrian city at the heart of nation's civil war.
“What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo?” MSNBC's Mike Barnicle asked Johnson.
“And what is Aleppo?” Johnson replied.
Once Johnson determined what Aleppo was, he offered his thoughts on Syria.
“OK, got it,” he said. “Well, with regard to Syria, I do think that it is a mess. I think the only way that we deal with Syria is to join hands with Russia to diplomatically bring that at an end but when we align ourselves with – when we've supported the opposition, the Free Syrian Army, the Free Syrian Army coupled with the Islamists and the the fact that we're also supporting the Kurds and that is, it's just a mess. And that this is the result of regime change that we end up supporting and inevitably these regime changes have led to a less safe world.”

Before Google's self-driving cars become an everyday reality for consumers, the company not only needs to test the vehicles extensively, but it also has to make sure the public isn't put off over concerns that the technology is unsafe. Amid recent reports that they've already been in minor accidents, Google has now started releasing public reports detailing traffic incidents involving its driverless cars.
The first report [PDF] just came out, with information for the month of May and up through June 3 included, as well as data on all collisions before now.
Google says most of the reported incidents involve other cars rear-ending the driverless vehicles, while other collisions involved cars side-swiping Google vehicles or hitting them after failing to stop at stop signs, the reports says.
None of those prior accidents have been its car's fault, Google says.
“In the six years of our project, we've been involved in 12 minor accidents during more than 1.8 million miles of autonomous and manual driving combined,” Google writes. “Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident.”
There will be more cars to report on soon, as well: Later this summer, Google's newest prototypes will be heading for public roads near the company's offices in Mountain View, CA.
Recent hysterics in the media have centered on crafting a false narrative that Russian authorities hacked the DNC emails, disseminated them through Wikileaks, and are actively trying to help Trump win the election.
This hysteria reached fever pitch as Donald Trump held an impromptu press conference, and in a throwaway line, said it would be great if the Russians had Hillary's emails and shared them. This event inspired journalists to extrapolate from that line the meme that Trump was being treasonous and calling for international espionage and sabotage.
A modern Manchurian Candidate meme was born—just the wrong one.
Lost in this hysteria, which is simply the media protecting itself and its favored candidate, is a deeper truth worth exploring. Looking at the framework of the globe as made up of three sovereigns: International Community (USG Empire), Russia and China, as well as USG being split into Red Empire and Blue Empire, one can come to a better understanding of this Trump-Russia connection. The Red Empire is the empire of bases, our security forces, the Pentagon. The Blue Empire is the empire of consulates aligned with the securely blue vectors of the polygon that rules—e.g. media, academia, State, CIA, etc.
Foreign engagements are proxy wars between these two factions, and each faction seeks clients and more power to eventually beat the other for supremacy.
The view is that these factions Red and Blue interfere globally and seek allies to use as cudgels against the domestic opponent. The Blue Empire twice has worked to secure China to beat at the Pentagon's Red Empire by first handing China over to Mao in the Chinese Civil War, and over forty years later, handing many Red Empire military secrets and trade perks to China to help them catch up. China has been ungrateful to the Blue Empire for never properly aligning with them. This view may be under fire as the USG Empire in totality weakens.
As the USG weakens, and this is demonstrable in multiple ways, suddenly its factions become ripe for partnering. First, the USG is weakening, as its debt-fueled economic Frankenstein is not responding as it once did. USG now relies on hashtags and cannot exert will to stop anyone or anything (#BringBackOurGirls, correct?). USG is also seeing its Blue Empire tentacles cut in nations that expel NGOs and pushback on American subversion.
There were twin events in particular that USG was caught flat-footed on that reveal a change in the international game.
The USG system worked a coup in Ukraine with the Maidan fiasco. This all began out of a simple choice by Ukraine to sign an economic deal with Russia, rather than the EU. Little covered by the American media was the fact that Ukraine had also sold prime agricultural land the equivalent of the size of Massachusetts to Chinese interests to secure reliable food production. USG pulled off its coup with neo-Nazi groups as shock troops, but then Russia responded by funding rebels and successfully beating back Ukrainian forces, as well as annexing the Crimea. Each time Ukrainian forces are routed, and while the Crimea remains in Russian hands, USG is reminded it is mired in the muck in Ukraine for no gain.
On the heels of the Ukraine events, the latest gambit in American democracy-exporting turned Syria into a land of ruin. Russia decided to intervene. President Obama claimed Russia's kinetic intervention was in fact a sign of weakness, while skipping over the fact that America had been supplying arms and non-lethal aid to rebels for years. Russia did something new in multiple ways. First, Russia used air power without USG approval for a non-USG aim. Since the end of the Cold War, America has ruled the skies, and if a country were to use air power, it better have American approval or a no-fly zone would form.
Russia used and continues to use air power to help Assad. Assad is still in power and in a move that would make Red Empire jealous, Russian aid has allowed Assad to defeat Blue Empire-funded and supported elements. The State Department and CIA suffered a loss.
If the USG is slipping, then its two factions become potential partners for the remaining other sovereign states. Goals can overlap just by having a common enemy. Russia was a land empire and has a mindset formed from the steppes. No need for global expansion. The goal is ending the bipartisan neocon drive for confrontation with Russia. Russia wants breathing room, secure sovereignty, and pushing different systems for different nations (paraphrasing Xi Jinping) is appealing. Red Empire is the empire of bases that while completely competent to destroy militaries as evidenced since 2001, grows tired of the never-ending drive for regime change in CIA and State. CIA's current reshuffling might be the only thing holding up more regime change in the Middle East. Red Empire's military industrial interests need to be fed, but need a new target.
Enter Trump.
The first step in destroying the Blue Empire would be in destroying the outer party: the GOP. There's a definite need to destroy that aggressive wing of war hawks. The inner party has competing wings of anti-war peaceniks and Trotskyite democracy-exporters. Neutralizing the hyper-aggressive GOP wrecks the bipartisan war party force in the USG. Killing the false opposition network of power, while building a nationalist, non-progressive approved political power structure is a first step.
To win the presidency is supreme. The takeover of the Democrats by the banks and the Democratic Leadership Council first started as moving within state parties, but junked that approach for the “grab the big chair” drive. It won the presidency in 1992 with Bill Clinton and set up the political arrangement we have today. Trump did not need the big money donors and generated ratings that the media could not resist. But Trump's path became a fight against the media. His daily smears of the media delegitimized it as a source of truth and stressed an already widely held belief that the media is corrupt and rigs the system. The Red Empire's many foot soldiers in the military and veteran network views the media in a negative fashion. A sign of USG slippage is the media's drift to regime press and the emergence of alternative news sources.
The Russians help by providing simple information that Red Empire cannot get due to legal constraints. Do the Russians have access to hacked information? Possibly. America's own security pundits have claimed that China and Russia likely hacked Clinton's private server. Russia may have information. Russia also has channels for dissemination that Red Empire does not have. America's freedom of the press allows for these alternative channels. America's regime press has also forced people to look elsewhere and grant authority to these channels.
The DNC Leak story reveals Trump as absolutely correct that the Democrats' system was rigged against its own supporters. Extrapolating from there, the general will be rigged just as the economy and society is rigged.
If Trump were elected, the payoffs for the Red Empire and Russia would have to be enacted. An easing of relations, formal recognition of Crimea as Russian, removal of sanctions, even a strategic alliance with Russia would be a global game changer. Russian sovereignty could be secured without having to become a vassal of China, and Russia's alliance with a victorious Red Empire would secure it from physical threat and prevent Blue Empire subversion.
The payoff to Red Empire is more difficult. First, the economic interests that gain from Red Empire's foreign adventures and budgets would have to be sated. Trump does have a plan for that, and a reorientation of foreign policy and law and order that would satisfy them. Consider what an armed, fortified border with surveillance would require for operations and budgets from the military industrial complex? If people are returned to Mexico, Mexico will have intense strains placed on its society. Add to that idea the concept that America would go after the cartels (unless making them properly recognized sovereigns of Mexico) that operate on the border and within our nation. The money still would pour into Red Empire coffers.
As the Russians and Red Empire would need to map out spheres of influence, the focus of American foreign policy could return to the old Monroe Doctrine, Western hemisphere centric view. One can look at not just the flow of immigration since '65, but the mess that is Latin America to know that even with deportations and a wall, America will become more Latin if it survives as one entity. Properly rehabilitating South America so that immigration does not become an easy release valve for those nations would damage Blue Empire by removing voters for its legitimacy and potentially removing their NGO and consultant class influence and power. The Red Empire may need a new political system to implement this in South America, and possibly even in the US.
Foreign policy victory is not total victory, though, as Red Empire needs to destroy Blue. Appointments and hiring in the USG can place a young female with a law degree at a desk in Pakistan. In effect, Blue-trained priests in place all over the globe. Trump could appoint veterans with any number of degrees in many spots and staff Red Team-trained warriors all over the USG network. Trump has spoken of ending nation building and regime change. This stabs at the heart of State and CIA.
Blue Empire's foreign policy aims would be blunted, but domestic reign would still be firmly in their hands.
Consider Trump's economic policies. Bankers treat Trump with uncertainty. He has stated he would repeal Dodd-Frank, but what would he replace it with? Trump has made noise about the Fed, but would he give up the reserve currency status? This would provide one boost for his program to bring back jobs. The dollar's loss in worth would make America's labor costs much lower. Any normalization in interest rates is going to choke off significant activity, since our finance-focused economy depends on the marginal borrower. How many Blue Empire domestic programs and state governments need low interest rates? Most, maybe all.
If America reorients away from the FIRE economy and back towards a productive economy based on manufacturing, natural resources and infrastructure, different power nodes aligned with the Blue Empire would suffer. Trump has hinted at doing something to help student debt loads and provide jobs. If Trump were to simultaneously address student debt, while bringing back decent paying jobs that do not require a degree, he would level a strike at academia far greater than anything Russia or Red Empire could. Removing the incentive to attend university strips demand, and American encouragement for the marginal student is well into negative marginal returns.
This is why immigration matters so much. It factors into Trump's economic policy. By removing a pool of labor that suppresses wages, it allows individuals a proper choice of employment. Even just removing the lid that illegals place on construction wages has a huge effect. Suddenly, small and mid-sized construction firms have to pay decent wages. By doing so, other industries facing the same labor pool must compete with elevated construction pay rates. The working class finds employers competing for them in pecuniary fashion, a welcome change.
How many men will add on $50,000-$200,000 in debt if they know they can get a job debt-free that pays $40,000 a year? Do people need to run to an exurb if their community stops taking in Third Worlders? The societal agreement that a ticket to the good life was earned by getting a bachelor's degree is damaged, if not dead.
There are many essays written on Trump's connections to Russia, with Paul Manafort being one of the main points cited. The media even ridiculously pointed out how Trump adviser Gen. Flynn once sat near Vladimir Putin at a dinner. Few consider the footsie being played between the Red Empire and Russia. The U.S. military shared intelligence with Russia and Syria about rebels. Red Empire-Russian cooperation is close to being formalized in complete opposition to Blue Empire regime change goals in Syria. Similar to the Clinton Administration's aiding of China with military secrets in the '90s, the USMil system allowed Snowden to not only abscond to Russia with the NSA and intelligence community's secrets, but has allowed Russia to keep him. The Pentagon does not huff and puff over this, despite the gift to Russia.
Knowing American systems and methods gives the Russians a huge boost in the game. When combined with the potential possession of the 2009-2013 Secretary of State's emails of every bit of unredacted intel that crossed her desk including her analysis and broader, long-term USG goals, one can understand why and how the Ukraine and Syrian push back occurred at all.
What none of the media's conspiracy theorists is considering is that there is an element not just of American society, but of the American elite that supports Donald Trump's run. There must also be an element within the American political system. Old lions like Zbigniew Brzezinski call for stronger relations or even an alliance with Russia since many interests are aligned. Looking at the system as two competing factions within the whole, one can start to see how a faction would use such a figure for its gain. As the USG global empire unravels, the Red Empire faction that formerly was happy with limited to zero domestic power, so long as it was allowed foreign adventures, will want compensation and power back at home. While the USG system may look rickety at times, it is still an immensely powerful entity with powerful factions. Trump owes nothing to the GOP's current configuration, nor the Democrats'. He can be their man.
He can be the Red Empire's Manchurian Candidate.
A new poll Pew poll conducted conducted in light of the recent New York Times piece on the “Libertarian Moment” suggests that there are still large parts of the country that are in the dark about libertarianism.
About 11 percent of Americans self-identify as libertarians and know what the term means, although when broken down based on gender, it turns out that 15 percent of men are libertarians, as opposed to only 7 percent of women.
However, when self-identified libertarians were asked to match up “someone whose political views emphasize individual freedom by limiting the role of government” with libertarianism, only 57 percent of respondents were successful. This means that 43 percent of self-identified libertarians do not understand the basic definition of the term.
The age range of 18-29 is also more likely to be libertarian than older generations at 12 percent, but this represents only a slight lead. Following close behind is the range of 30-49, which clocks in at 11 percent. The next age ranges of 50-64 and 65+ continued the pattern at 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively.
Of libertarian respondents, 41 percent said that the government had a role in regulating business to protect the public interest. Similarly, about 38 percent stated that government assistance to the poor “does more good than harm because people can't get out of poverty until their basic needs are met.” For foreign policy, 43 percent of libertarians believe that the United States should be more active in world affairs, whereas the public is more skeptical, with only 35 percent believing the same proposition.
However, the anti-government streak flared up when the question turned to marijuana. A full 65 percent of libertarians are in support of legalizing marijuana, in comparison to only 54 percent of the public.
The poll results come from a combination of a Pew Research Center polarization survey from earlier this year, and an additional survey from April 29-May 27 with 3,243 adults.

Well, I think we've just seen the first piece of fallout from the stunning $2.15 billion purchase of the Dodgers on Wednesday. With money flowing into MLB at a breakneck pace, the Cincinnati Reds decided to make star first baseman Joey Votto an offer he couldn't refuse. Actually, they made him an offer that no player in baseball could refuse, signing him (per Bob Nightengale of USA Today) to the longest contract in the history of the game — a staggering 12-year, $251.5 million commitment (or, phrased differently, a 10-year extension on top of the 2/26 he had already agreed to) that will keep Votto in Cincinnati through the 2023 season.
For as much as the Albert Pujols and Prince Fielder contracts helped shape the off-season, this is the deal that could have long lasting effects going forward. First baseman have been getting monster contracts in free agency for years, and in both cases, there were some special circumstances that set their particular case apart; Pujols is one of the great players in the history of the game, while Fielder certainly benefited from Victor Martinez's torn ACL, which didn't occur until after most other options were already off the table. Free agents trying to use these deals as yardsticks for future negotiations would not stack up to Pujols resume, nor would they likely reap the rewards of a high-payroll team suddenly needing their services just weeks before spring training begins.
This contract for Votto, though, doesn't come with any of those caveats, and it didn't come through an intense bidding war in free agency. This is the third-largest contract in baseball history being given to a player who was two years away from free agency. This deal just blows up the expected compensation level for premium players negotiating with only their own franchise.
Before this deal, these were the recent comps that teams and agents could point to for power hitters who needed two more full seasons before they reached free agency:
Miguel Cabrera: 8 years, $152 million, covering ages 25-32
Ryan Howard: 5 years, $125 million, covering ages 32-36
Travis Hafner: 4 years, $57 million, covering ages 32-35
Cabrera got a deal that rivaled what you might expect a premium free agent to get, but he got to the majors as a 20-year-old and was much younger than the average player who has 4+ years of service time. Even though the Tigers gave him an eight-year deal, they still weren't locking him up much past his prime, and could expect to get premium production for nearly the entire duration of the contract. Hafner and Howard were both older when they got their deals than Votto is now, but we still see that teams were reluctant to guarantee premium money past the mid-30s.
And, while he's not the same type of player, Ryan Zimmerman added another 4+ service-time extension data point this winter, agreeing to a six-year, $100 million addition to the contract he was already signed to. That deal started with Zimmerman's age-29 season, so in terms of ages, he's a better fit for Votto than the three listed above. Of course, the things Zimmerman does well aren't as highly valued as the things that Votto does well, so Votto should have been expected to clear Zimmerman's bar pretty easily. Which he did, and then some.
Even if we expand the list of comps to cover guys with 5+ years of service time, this deal still blows the doors off anything we've seen before. Here are the contracts that guys have signed just one year before reaching free agency:
Derek Jeter: 10 years, $189 million, covering ages 27-36
Joe Mauer: 8 years, $184 million, covering ages 28-35
Matt Kemp: 8 years, $160 million, covering ages 27-34
Adrian Gonzalez: 7 years, $154 million, covering ages 30-36
Vernon Wells: 7 years, $126 million, covering ages 29-35
Jeter's deal was the closest thing to this extension for Votto, but the Yankees were coming off three consecutive World Series championships, and keeping Jeter in NY was as much a business decision as a baseball decision. Even still, the Yankees only locked Jeter up through age 36. The rest of the deals all vary around the $20 million per year range, but come in with the same basic timeframe, buying out seasons through the player's mid-30s in order to keep him around for his prime years. And remember, these guys were all one service-time year up from Votto, giving them substantially more leverage in negotiations.
Votto's deal guarantees him that same $20ish million AAV, but locks him up through his age-39 season. This is basically unprecedented for a non-free agent, and when you factor in that he was two years away from free agency, it's a staggering guarantee by the Reds. To do this deal now and absorb the extra risk of guaranteeing him 2014-2023 while Votto is still two years away from being able to negotiate a deal on the open market, the Reds are essentially saying that his fair market value is somewhere around $300 million.
A few months ago, that would have sounded absurd. However, since the off-season began, we've seen the Angels flex their financial muscle after agreeing to a television contract that promises to push significant new revenues into their organization. Just a few days ago, we saw the Dodgers get purchased at a valuation that was dramatically higher than expected, and with their own television deal coming up for renegotiation, they also look to be in a position to push a lot of cash into the industry. Put simply, we're seeing some positive shocks to the game's economy, and the result looks to be a significant uptick in willingness by teams to borrow from their own futures to finance talent acquisition in the present.
What we're seeing could be described as inflation, but it's not upward price adjustments in the traditional form. Pujols, Fielder, Reyes, Votto, Kemp, and Zimmerman all landed contracts in excess of $100 million this winter, but in each situation, the surprising number wasn't the AAV but the amount of guaranteed years on the back end. The $24M AAV for Pujols and $23.8M AAV for Fielder don't even rank in the top five in baseball history, but they took slightly lower annual paychecks in order to get deals that would keep the money flowing for essentially the rest of their careers. Now Votto has done the same thing, taking a deal that pays him just slightly more per season than Carl Crawford, but basically ensures that this is the last contract he will ever have to negotiate.
And, perhaps this is exactly what we should expect as a reaction to potential new revenue sources opening up for MLB franchises. These TV deals that are being signed don't come with huge lump sum payments, so teams don't have buckets of cash burning holes in their pockets. What they do have, or may expect to have in the next few years, is a guaranteed revenue source that will allow them to be in a strong financial position for the next couple of decades. And now, with every team looking to see when they can get in on this upwards adjustment in TV money, it's become an arms race to lock in talent at current market prices for as long as possible, and getting these deals done by guaranteeing parts of the future expected revenue pie.
This deal for Votto signifies that this trend is not going away any time soon. The Reds aren't a big market, high payroll franchise and their television contract reportedly is only paying them ~$10 million per year at the moment, but they know a renegotiation of that price is going to come in three to four years, and if current trends persist, they're going to be able to get a significant hike on their next contract. That rate increase will come along just in time to finance the back end of Votto's deal, and I'd imagine that knowledge played a huge role in convincing them to guarantee Votto current market premium dollars for years when he likely won't be earning premium dollars on the field.
So, at this point, we have a couple of options – we can continue to be shocked and amazed at the growing rate of contracts that guarantee big money to players from 2018 and beyond, or we can adjust our expectations for what premium players are going to be able to command going forward. With the promise of new money flowing into many organizations over the next three to five years, I'd imagine we'll see more and more teams being aggressive in trying to lock up their young stars before they get to free agency and have to bid against whichever franchise just happened to renegotiate their television contract a few months prior.
For the Reds, the equation was pretty simple – keep Votto and contend during the run-up to the expiration of their television deal, or trade him away, rebuild, and come to the table asking for more money after a couple of years of going young and probably taking their lumps. Given those options, giving Votto a couple of extra years at the back end to increase their bargaining position doesn't look quite so crazy.
However, that logic could be used to justify nearly any price. Give Tim Lincecum $500 million? Why not, new TV money on the way! Obviously, there's a line where these deals cease to make sense even if we anticipate that this trend of upward spikes in revenues is not going away any time soon. Where does Votto's deal fall in terms of that line?
It's probably pretty close to it, honestly. Votto's been a +7 win player each of the last two years, but a decent chunk of his offensive value is tied up in his career .352 BABIP, which is pretty much the absolute upper limit for a sustainable performance over the long term. Over the last 20 years, the top three on the BABIP leaderboard (min 3000 PA) are Derek Jeter (.355), Matt Kemp (.352, just barely over 3000 PA), and Ichiro Suzuki (.351). You'll probably note that all three of them are pretty fast, and can leg out infield hits when they need to. The best comparison for Votto is Miguel Cabrera, who comes in at .347 – in other words, it's not impossible for Votto to keep getting balls to fall in at this rate, but there's really nowhere for him to go but down in that area. More likely, we should probably project Votto as a +6 win player going forward, which accounts for some overall regression and variability of health.
Given that he's in his prime, we can probably sustain Votto as a +6 win player for three years before we project age-related decline, and then we'd accelerate the decline towards the end of his career when his skills are likely to disappear a bit faster. So, a projection for Votto over the next 12 years might go something like this:
2012: +6 WAR
2013: +6 WAR
2014: +5.5 WAR
2015: +5.0 WAR
2016: +4.5 WAR
2017: +4.0 WAR
2018: +3.5 WAR
2019: +2.8 WAR
2020: +2.1 WAR
2021: +1.4 WAR
2022: +0.7 WAR
2023: +0.0 WAR
Total: +41.5 WAR
If we start at $5 million per win and apply the 5% future inflation to these expected performances, we'd get a total of $249 million over the next 12 years, almost exactly what the Reds just signed Votto for. But, again, that model is for free agents, and Votto was two years away from free agency. In other words, the Reds basically didn't seem to get any kind of discount for taking on additional risk.
A few months ago, this deal would have looked crazy, and we'd have all been in shock at the Reds willingness to mortgage their long term future to chase after near term wins. However, this deal suggests the possibility of inflation going well over 5% down the line, as teams are basically guaranteeing themselves large portions of dead money in the future, and will have to increase their spending to offset the large amount of cash going to players who will probably not be overly productive at the ends of their careers.
A few months ago, I would have expected Votto to have to settle for a contract somewhere between Ryan Howard's $125 million and Miguel Cabrera's $154 million. Now, though, those numbers simply seem obsolete. Votto's deal shows that it's not just the big market teams that are expecting significant revenue growth going forward.
This deal is going to have lasting repercussions on the sport. Not only does it suggest that the Reds are going to remain competitive in the NL Central going forward, but it also resets the price expectations for every pre-free agent player in the sport. Congratulations, players, all of your expected prices just went up. Way up.

The Old Fourth Ward's main thoroughfare is simply known as Boulevard. It used to be known as “one of the most desirable residence streets” in the city, but after the devastating Great Atlanta Fire of 1917 destroyed most of the beautiful homes, Boulevard began transforming into something else. Brick apartment buildings replaced the stately homes, then devolved into crime-ridden section 8 housing. The decline continued when a planned freeway, which eventually became Freedom Parkway, destroyed more homes and businesses.
Although the Old Fourth Ward has undergone a startling transformation over the last decade with new homes and thriving businesses, not to mention the tourism brought by the Martin Luther King Historic District, Boulevard's reputation for crime, drugs and prostitution remained. However, a project launched by Atlanta City Councilmember Kwanza Hall in 2012 has begun to show a turnaround not only in perception but given hope to the residents who call Boulevard home.
The Year of Boulevard program has worked steadily to make its presence felt along Boulevard, Hall said over breakfast at Condesa Coffee, located on the ground floor of the Tribute Lofts. The coffee shop and the lofts are just two of the success stories Hall hopes will continue to spur the renaissance of Boulevard. Hall said tackling the myriad of issues facing the street seemed, in the beginning, almost insurmountable.
“We didn't know what the solutions were, but we knew that addressing poverty and building trust were the keys,” he said. “I knew we at least had to try and do something. You won't make a basket unless you shoot the ball.”
The trust factor has been crucial, especially to the residents who live in the Section 8 housing known as Bedford-Pines. “The folks who live here have been made promises that were never kept, so why would they trust anyone?” Hall said. “The opportunities that were coming this way never happened.”
Year of Boulevard, or YoBoulevard as it's become known, began simply by cleaning up the street of trash and debris. This past spring, more than 200 volunteers turned out for the “MoBoulevard!” cleanup, and another one is planned for Saturday, Oct. 19, from 9 a.m. to noon north of Freedom Parkway.
But the clean-up days were just an opening volley. Reaching out to the youth who live along Boulevard has been one of YoBoulevard's top priorities, Hall said.
Over the summer, more than 600 children (up from 450 last year) attended summer camps sponsored by the project in partnership with Operation Peace, Truly Living Well, Beacon of Hope and the MLK Recreation Center Freedom School. Hall said he was also pleased that more than 100 senior citizens attended their own adult summer camp at Selena Solan Butler Recreation Center.
The summer camp components included Operation Peace Entrepreneurship Saturdays, with visits by celebrity entrepreneurs such as Delia Champion of Delia's Chicken Sausage Stand and Kashi Sehgal of Gigabark. Boulevard teens were awarded $1,300 in prize money for creating the best plan for their own small businesses. There were also teen career day visits to the Hyatt Regency Hotel, Atlanta Hawks, Federal Reserve Bank and successful local restaurant and music venue, The SoundTable.
“Showing the kids on Boulevard that they can be successful and that there are opportunities gives them hope and helps build a stronger community,” Hall said.
Another success was a Back to School Block Party, which shut down Boulevard for an afternoon of fun. Hall said 600 backpacks with supplies were given to Boulevard kids and nine pallets worth of donated clothing and personal care items came from nonprofit Caring for Others. There were also interactive booths, a reading tent, bingo for seniors, a skateboard painting class sponsored by Museum of Design Atlanta, the ZooAtlanta mobile zoo and lunch for 1,000 provided by Panda Express.
So, what's coming for the second Year of Boulevard?
One hurdle that has faced Boulevard for decades is that the owners of the Section 8 housing, a Boston-based company called Wingate, has shown no interest in selling the Bedford-Pines complex to make way for new development or even a redevelopment, such as those that helped clean up notorious Capital Homes and Techwood Homes in the ‘90s. However, Hall said YoBoulevard and neighborhood leaders are now in talks with Wingate about a new building for low-income seniors. “It's something we've wanted to address since we came up with the concept of Year of Boulevard, and now it's happening,” Hall said.
Also in the works is Year Up Atlanta, which will offer house and recruitment for one-year workforce development training, and new engagement with businesses and stakeholders on the northern end of Boulevard to talk about public safety and quality of life issues.
There will also be afterschool and Saturday school offerings at Hope-Hill Elementary School and Big Bethel AME Church, including a Discover Architecture program for kids that will be led by AIA Atlanta. The Old Fourth Ward will also get its first dog park when the Renaissance Park Dog Park opens later this fall. Hall said there will also be a fundraiser to build a playground at Hope-Hill, the only public elementary school in the city without one.
Hall said there is excitement about next year's opening of the Atlanta Streetcar, which will connect the MLK Historic District to Downtown. “There will be an upswing in the economy of the Old Fourth Ward when the streetcar comes online,” Hall said. “We just want to be ready to take advantage of it.”
The councilman concedes there is still a lot of work to be done, but he sees “only blue skies” for the future of Boulevard. “I'm in this for the long haul,” he commented. “We quickly discovered that it wasn't just going to be the Year of Boulevard, but the Years of Boulevard. It's hard work, but it's worth it.”

Independent journalists were not given access to cover the event depicted in this photo. No need to duck and cover just yet. U.S. intelligence officials are pretty sure North Korea can put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental missile that could reach the United States. Experts aren't convinced the bomb could survive the flight to America. (Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP, File)
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. intelligence officials are pretty sure North Korea can put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental missile that could reach the United States. But experts aren't convinced the bomb could make it all that way intact.
They cite lingering questions about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's nuclear know-how.
“I don't think North Korea has a good measure of how accurate the missile is at this point,” said Michael Elleman, an expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “They don't know if the re-entry technologies will really hold up — whether the bomb will survive the trip.”
North Korea has short-range missiles that can hit its neighbors. It has tested an intermediate one that could strike Guam, a U.S. territory, as well as a longer-range missile that could reach Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. West Coast. The intermediate and long-range missiles are still being developed and it's still questionable whether they can reliably strike targets.
The North must conduct more tests to master what is known as “re-entry” in missile parlance, experts believe. The process involves shielding a nuclear warhead from the high temperatures and force it faces when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere at about 15,500 mph (7 kilometers a second).
“In principle, Kim Jong-un could hit the United States with a nuclear weapon,” said Elleman, a former scientist at Lockheed Martin's Research and Development Laboratory who also worked as missile expert for U.N. weapons inspection missions. “In practice, I think they are probably a half-year to a full year away from having something that will work more often than it would fail.”
Joseph Bermudez Jr., an internationally recognized expert on North Korean defense and intelligence affairs and ballistic missile development, agrees.
“Putting these things all together and making them work is extremely challenging, and they haven't yet demonstrated a capability to produce a reliable re-entry vehicle, which is what houses the actual nuclear device,” he said. “Remember, they've only tested these systems very few times.”
Still, Bermudez, said, North Korea is “on track” to figure it out.
U.S. officials also think it's just a matter of time before Kim's program fully matures.
National Intelligence Director Dan Coats told Congress in May that Kim has been photographed beside a nuclear warhead design and missile airframes to show that North Korea has warheads small enough to fit on a missile.
That same month, Lt. Gen Vincent Stewart, the Defense Intelligence Agency director, told lawmakers that while Kim must still work on the technical aspects of re-entry, it's only a “matter of enough trial and error to make that work. They understand the physics, so it's just a matter of design.”
Coats and Stewart testified before North Korea conducted its first test of an intercontinental missile on July 4. On July 28, it conducted a second test of its long-range Hwasong-14 ICBM.
The second test flight was captured by a rooftop camera operated by Japan's NHK television on the northern island of Hokkaido. Elleman, who analyzed the video, concluded that it most likely “disintegrated” before splashdown, suggesting North Korea is still struggling with re-entry.
“I think it probably failed fairly late in the process,” said John Schilling, a consultant with 38 North, a respected website on North Korea at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.
Schilling said the success of North Korean missiles also depend on the weight of the payload. That's the weight of the nuclear weapon plus its heat-shielding re-entry system. North Korea is able to make one that weighs between 1,100 and 1,300 pounds, or between 500 and 600 kilograms. One that size might reach West Coast targets, Schilling said. But North Korea would need to make one lighter to strike farther east.
“It needs to be light in order to achieve range, but it also needs to be built fairly tough to survive, and those two things are at odds with one another,” Schilling said. “Too light is a problem in that the payload would be too fragile and won't survive the trip, particularly atmospheric re-entry at the far end.”
On Tuesday, a news report said North Korea could now wed nuclear warheads with its missiles, including its longest-range ones that might be able to hit the continental United States. The nuclear advances were detailed in an official Japanese assessment and in a story by The Washington Post that cited U.S. intelligence officials and a confidential Defense Intelligence Agency report.
President Donald Trump is warning North Korea not to make any more threats or face “fire and fury like the world has never seen.”
North Korea then announced a detailed plan to launch missiles toward the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, a major military hub and home to U.S. bombers.
On Friday, Trump tweeted: “Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely.”
People living in remote First Nation communities on the James Bay Coast have to spend over half of their income on food in order to meet basic nutritional requirements, according to a new study by Food Secure Canada.
"Paying for Nutrition: A Report on Food Costing in the North" reveals the cost of feeding a family in northern Canada is twice as much as the south with prices staggering from $8.65 for about 1.4 kilograms of apples in Fort Albany, Ont., to $8.99 for a box of Corn Flakes in Moose Factory, Ont.
"It's ridiculous," Mushkegowuk Council Grand Chief, Jonathan Solomon, said. He is the senior representative for seven First Nations in the western James Bay.
"How can people afford this? Because most of the First Nation communities have 80 to 70 per cent of unemployment and they're on social assistance."
People in northern communities are struggling to put basic, quality food on the table, according to NDP MP Charlie Angus. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) In June 2015, the average monthly cost of groceries in Attawapiskat was $1,909 compared to $847 in Toronto, according to the study.
Shopping at one store 'a trap'
"The report confirms what we're hearing on the ground that the crisis of food in the north is at such a level that we have children literally going hungry, families unable to put basic, quality food items on the table because of the incredible prices they have to pay," Timmins-James Bay MP Charlie Angus said.
"What kind of country thinks it's ok not only that children don't have access to clean drinking water, but children don't have access to food on their tables?"
The study shows that the selection and quality of retail food in the Mushkegowuk territory is limited, and communities are usually serviced by only one grocery store.
"That store extracts any income that they can and people are heavily in debt for the most of it," said Joseph Leblanc, an advisor on the report and the executive director of the Social Planning Council of Sudbury.
"There is a trap that people fall into shopping at that one store and it is something that really needs to be addressed," he said.
'Solutions are empowering local people'
The elevated costs are due to increasing dependence on imported goods and the rising costs of food harvesting, according to the report.
"The solutions are empowering local people to meet as many of their needs as they can with as many local resources as they can," Leblanc said, noting that the prices of seeds, and fishing and hunting equipment is rising.
As a result of the high prices, people end up buying a lot of processed food.
Grand Chief of Mushkegowuk Council, Jonathan Soloman, calls the price of healthy food in his territory "ridiculous." (Fred Chartrand/Canadian Press) "What we see sometimes is children with pop and chips because you can get more of it than you can milk, quality vegetables or meat," Angus said.
Nutrition North Canada needs 'overhaul'
Fort Albany and Attawapiskat are serviced by the federal government's Nutrition North Canada program to subsidize the high cost of perishable, nutritious food, but the study suggests that the assistance may not be properly passed on from the retailer to the consumer in all cases.
Angus said he thinks the program needs an "overhaul," and is trying to work with the federal government to address the program's transparency and performance.
The authors of the report do not believe that lowering the costs of healthy food in northern communities is enough to address food insecurity.
Rather, a broader comprehensive strategy is needed that includes guaranteed minimum incomes that are in line with the higher cost of living in the north and having a healthy diet.
The authors recommend targeting federal funding to support grassroots and sustainable community initiatives, which Mushkegowuk Council Grand Chief Jonathan Solomon thinks could include greenhouses.
"We call on the federal and provincial governments to make access to nutritionally adequate and culturally appropriate food a basic human right in Canada," the authors write.

When Mitt Romney's presidential campaign announced a less-than-expected $18 million fundraising haul for the second quarter of this year, Democrats and Republicans alike publicly doubted the former governor's appeal with GOP voters. Some of Romney's critics even suggested that donors had “abandoned him.” But judging Romney's cash arsenal by his campaign alone is like looking at a Jackson Pollock canvas from an inch away. You need to step back to see the whole picture—in Romney's case, a sprawling web of organizations with serious financial firepower angling to help Romney win in 2012.
Romney's biggest outside ally is Restore Our Future, a so-called “super PAC” launched last month by a trio of his former aides. The PAC's goal is simple: make Mitt Romney president. And while federal law prohibits Restore Our Future from coordinating with the Romney campaign, the PAC can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on ads, mailers, and other messaging to boost Romney's White House bid. It's not unlike the Priorities USA Action super PAC that two former Barack Obama aides formed with the goal of reelecting the president.
Created in October, Restore Our Future's roster boasts one of Washington's savviest Republican strategists in Carl Forti, who's worked for Karl Rove's American Crossroads groups, the conservative dark money outfit Americans for Job Security, and the 60 Plus Association, known as the conservative answer to the AARP. Charlie Spies, a former CFO and counsel from Romney's 2008 campaign, is also on board. (Neither Spies nor Forti would comment for this story.)
Last week Spies emailed reporters to say that Restore Our Future, which reports its donors and fundraising haul twice a year, had raked in $12 million in the first six months of 2011. (The group has yet to file its official report.) Spies added that the group has $12 million in cash on hand, an indicator of just how little money it takes to operate a super PAC. Adding the Restore our Future money to the official campaign money brings the amount raised explicitly to elect Romney to $30 million.
Then there is Romney's network of Free and Strong America PACs. The federal Free and Strong PAC, headquartered in Boston, raised $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 and another $9.1 million in the 2010 election cycle. Complete 2011 data isn't available for the Free and Strong America state PACs in Alabama, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, but they did reel in $1.6 million in 2010—nearly five times as much as state PACs tied to fellow GOP contender Tim Pawlenty.
As a presidential candidate, Romney can't coordinate with his Free and Strong America armada. But there's an obvious political calculus behind running state-level PACs in presidential battleground states: It allows a candidate to court state-level allies well before the candidate himself announces a run. That's exactly what Romney's PACs did. According to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, Romney-affiliated PACs gave nearly $400,000 in campaign contributions in 25 different states in 2009 and 2010. That included $62,000 to then-gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley in South Carolina and $30,000 to then-gubernatorial candidate Terry Branstad in Iowa (some of which went to Branstad's running mate, Kim Reynolds). Both Haley and Branstad won their elections, potentially giving Romney powerful partners for his second White House run.
But more importantly, these state PACs have allowed Romney to lay the groundwork for his presidential run while skirting federal campaign limits. In Alabama, Michigan, and Iowa, individual donors can give unlimited amounts of money to PACs. (By contrast, federal law caps total donations to national PACs at $5,000.) While PACs like those in Romney's Free and Strong network supposedly exist to support other candidates, only 25 percent of 2010 spending by Romney's Free and Strong America state PACs actually went to candidates, and just 21 percent of the national PAC's 2011 haul went to candidates. The rest of the funds almost certainly went to overhead—staff salaries, travel, events, and building supporter lists that could prove crucial in a presidential race. “Major candidates including Romney are declaring their candidacy later and later, into May and some cases into June” the year before the presidential election, says Paul Ryan, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center. “The reason they delayed their announcements is because they wanted to raise more unlimited money through state-level vehicles.” (A Romney spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.)
Romney's expansive fundraising and spending machine may dwarf those of the other 2012 Republican candidates, but he didn't originate the strategy—Ronald Reagan did. After failing to win the GOP nomination in the 1976 election, Reagan took his leftover funds and started Citizens for the Republic PAC, a separate fundraising operation ostensibly created to help other GOP candidates. The group actually centered on Reagan himself, and the PAC would ultimately bring in $5 million in donations and amass a list of 300,000 active donors, according to Colby College political-science professor Anthony Corrado. The PAC also paid for consultants, volunteer drives, and pro-Reagan events—all paving the way, experts say, for Reagan's 1980 presidential victory. And here's the kicker: By not calling Citizens for the Republic a presidential committee, Reagan dodged the campaign donation laws of that era.
So can Romney follow Reagan's path to the White House? Campaign finance experts say that Romney has capitalized on state PACs and weak fundraising regulations more than any other GOP candidate. And they caution that, before drawing too many conclusions from the Romney campaign's somewhat lackluster second-quarter fundraising numbers, it's important to look at all the money marshaled in the candidate's favor. “Hands down, no one is even close to Romney on this,” says Michael Beckel, a reporter at the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the flow of money in American politics. “These groups amount to an unlimited bank account to push a message that supports him.”

Hey Schmoeville!
One of the most interesting films set to come out next year is the new Fantastic Four reboot with Josh Trank directing and a main cast filled with some of the better up and coming actors working today. There isn't really a lot known about the film yet, with only rumors and some set photos leaking online the past few months and Trank making a few statements about the tone the film will have. I'm really excited for it honestly, and with the talent involved, I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being one of the best and most interesting superhero films we end up getting.
And today Schmoeville, we here at Schmoes Know got our hands on some new interesting plot details for the film from a very reliable source! First, remember all of the controversy that happened when Michael B. Jordan was announced to be cast as Johnny Storm in the film? For those of you that don't know, in the comic books Johnny Storm and Sue Storm are brother and sister, and since Sue Storm is being played by Kate Mara in the film, people were worried and curious if they were still going to be siblings in this new reboot. The general thought among the fan community eventually became that Johnny would simply be adopted and they would still be brother and sister, just not biologically.
Well, we have heard from our source that it is actually Mara's Sue Storm who is adopted in the film, with her and Michael B. Jordan's parents being African American! (So it's still basically what we have all assumed about their relationship, only the film has flipped it around.) We have also heard that instead of the group gaining their powers from a failed scientific mission in outer space like in the original comics and (awful) existing films, this time the group's origin story will be much more like their Ultimate versions.
In the film, the team will gain their powers through a lab experiment gone wrong in a way, where they create a portal to another world or dimension (its not clear) and they get their powers after the exposure to this other dimension/planet. Much like how the group gets their powers in the Ultimate Fantastic Four comics, after they are engulfed in a failed teleporter experiment.
This definitely makes sense with what the film's screenwriter, Simon Kinberg has been saying about the film being much more scientific than the previous adaptations and some of the comics. So from both the new cast's ages and how they get their powers in the film, it seems like this reboot is going to be following the Ultimate run of the comic books much more than the original run.
The other small tidbit of news that we have is that the film is going to be VERY character-driven. I don't want to say that the action in the film takes a backseat or is secondary, but this first installment is much more focused on setting up the characters and their relationships with each other and their nemesis Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell) than it is about making things blow up in big action set pieces. Which I love! The reason Trank's earlier film, Chronicle, was so good was because it focused so heavily on it's characters and you felt emotion towards them, so this definitely makes me happy.
That about does it for this scoop Schmoeville! I love all of these new details honestly, and I'm really pumped to see where Trank and Twentieth Century Fox plan on going with this new franchise and how it fits into their cinematic universe!
So what do YOU think Schmoeville? Are you excited about the reboot? Are you not? What do you think of these new plot details? Drop some comments down below, share with your friends, and let's talk THE FANTASTIC FOUR!

Personal privacy is in danger of being killed off by the profit-making motives of firms which hold our data, security expert Bruce Schneier has warned.
BT's chief technology officer expressed his concerns at the RSA Security Europe Conference in London.
While the death of personal privacy had been predicted for a long time, rapid technological changes posed a mortal danger to it, he said.
Mr Schneier urged lawmakers to do more to help preserve and protect privacy.
The death of privacy had been predicted before with the emergence of many different technologies, he said. But before now that threat had been largely overblown.
"Just because the technology is there does not mean that privacy invasions must happen," he said.
'Unnatural state'
The difference now, he said, was that the falling cost of storage and processing power made it far easier to keep data such as e-mail conversations, Tweets or postings to a social network page than it was to spend the time managing and deleting the information.
The migration of human social interaction from ephemeral forms that took place face to face into data that never goes away and does not allow us to forget or leave behind our past actions was undoubtedly going to change society, he said.
"Forgetting is a very powerful social tool that helps us get by and get along," he said.
As lives are lived more and more online or via the phone it has led, said Mr Schneier, to a situation in which everyone has to be the guardian of their own privacy policy.
We are now seeing the death of privacy Bruce Schneier
"That's new and fundamentally unnatural," he said.
Deciding what data we are prepared to surrender would be fine if people were given a proper choice, he said.
Unfortunately, he said, users of social networking sites or any online service were being presented with choices defined by priorities they did not choose.
The choices are filtered through the law, which is being outstripped by technological change, leaving people with only what net firms give them or can get away with.
"The social rules are being set by businesses with a profit motive," he said.
Facebook has faced a barrage of criticism about its privacy settings and despite effort to address user concerns, has continued to worry privacy campaigners.
Google boss Eric Schmidt said, after the row about its StreetView service scooping up wi-fi data: "If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."
Talking about privacy policies on web sites, Mr Schneier said they were hard to find and understand because it was in the interest of those sites to confuse people into disclosing more than they were comfortable with.
Natural by-product
The more data about their members that sites gathered the better they can serve advertisers or use the data for their own marketing purposes, he said.
"We are now seeing the death of privacy," he said. "Those CEOs are doing it and doing things to hasten its demise."
In some senses, he said, this was not their fault because the production of data was a natural by-product of the way that computers work.
But, he said, this did not mean that legal and technological protections were not needed. The law was currently abdicating its role and there was a pressing need for tools that could help people manage their online presences.
He said that how we deal with privacy now would define how future generations regard us in the same way that commentators now look critically on the pollution produced as a by-product of the industrial revolution.
"They are going to look back at us and look at the things we do to deal with the pollution problem of the information age and judge us," he said.
Business Insider/Mike Nudelman These days more than ever, young people can do almost anything.
Business Insider ranked the most powerful people under 30 across all industries based on four criteria: how many people they formally command; how much they're worth; how much they have shaped the world; and how much they are likely to shape the world in the future.
It may be subjective, but power is always subjective. And everyone on this list, from celebrities to tech moguls, has it in spades.
At the top of our first annual list is 24-year-old Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel. Although his company has only a few dozen employees, this guy has created an incredibly popular and extremely disruptive social media platform, and the sky's the limit for his company, as seen by its soaring valuation. Spiegel himself is supposedly worth near $2 billion.
Mumbai, Aug 6 (PTI) The monsoon season in India, considered lean for the travel industry, seems to be picking up gradually as it saw 27 per cent growth in holiday bookings in 2017, compared to last year, as per MakeMyTrip data.
Of those bookings, 60 per cent Indians travelled overseas during the monsoon this year, says the data of the online travel company.
The data pertained to the bookings made on MakeMyTrip in April-May-June 2016 and April-May-June 2017 for the period of April-May-June-July 2016 and April-May-June-July 2017, respectively.
The data also revealed that Goa, Manali (Himachal Pradesh), Mysore (Karnataka), Ooty (Tamil Nadu) and Shimla (HP) were the top domestic leisure destinations preferred by Indians during the monsoon this year.
Besides, the few fastest growing destinations this season were - Havelock (Andaman and Nicobar), Kasol (Himachal Pradesh, Neemrana (Rajasthan), Silvassa (the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli) and Lansdown (Uttarakhand).
When it came to international vacations for monsoon holidays, short haul destinations like Dubai, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia remained the clear favourites with Indian travellers, as per the data.
The fastest growing international destinations during the monsoon were, however, a mix of short as well as long haul destinations, according to a spokesperson of MakeMyTrip.
Among the growing international destinations during monsoon, Bali in Indonesia topped the list followed by Krabi in Thailand, Toronto in Canada, Seychelles and Seoul the capital city of South Korea. PTI SM GK
Islamic State (Isis) has released a propaganda song in Mandarin, aimed at recruiting Chinese Muslims, just two weeks after executing a hostage from the country. The recording is in the form of a 'nasheeds' – an Islamic chant sung a cappella.
The four-minute song found its way to the internet via jihadist channels. Uighur Muslims have reportedly been targeted in the Chinese-language song, along with the entire Muslim community in the country.
In what is claimed to be near-perfect Mandarin pronunciation, the song roughly translates to: "The brilliance of Islam is etched in history. The purpose of our struggle is to let it shine again. Wake up! Muslim brother, now is the time to awaken. Take up your faith and courage, fulfil the lost doctrine."
The production quality is in no way inferior to the earlier releases of IS (Daesh), although no instruments have been used in the song as the Sunni group's harsh interpretation of Islam prohibits the use of music in songs. Extremist groups from the Middle East have previously tried to recruit Muslims in China, but it is unusual for them to release propaganda material in Mandarin.
It is unlikely that the recording would reach the Chinese public, as the country's cyberspace is heavily-censored. The Communist government in Beijing is critical of Muslims in the country, and Uighur separatists are in conflict with government forces in the restive Xinjiang region.
Meanwhile, officials in Beijing said they are not yet aware of the song. Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters during a routine press conference: "We hope we can safeguard the citizens of every country through international cooperation."
China has earlier expressed serious concern over the growing challenges posed by IS. It is estimated anywhere between 100 and 300 Chinese nationals are currently fighting in the conflict zones of Iraq and Syria on behalf of IS.

Credit:Sundance Resources Meanwhile, a research fellow at the US Congress-funded National Endowment for Democracy in Washington, Elie Smith, has revealed that two Sundance representatives told him in a meeting in the Congo that they had "promised a bribe to [mining minister] Pierre Oba and the family of the President" [Denis Sassou Nguesso] to win government backing for the Australian company. Mr Smith, a former prominent Congolese journalist, said he would provide the Australian Federal Police a sworn statement about this disclosure. The two company representatives made the comments after they asked him to organise a meeting with Congolese officials in around 2014. He said he believed Sundance had bribed the ruling regime in a manner that raised serious corruption and human rights concerns in a country blighted by oppression and graft. Mines and Geology Minister Pierre Oba is a controversial figure in Africa, having been previously implicated in a massacre of civilians in the Congo in a case filed in French courts.
Republic of Congo President Denis Sassou Nguesso, left, pictured with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Credit:AP Fairfax Media has obtained documents that reveal that a mysterious Congolese company called Cominvest was created by minister Oba's younger brother. In October 2008, Sundance agreed to give Australian shares to the company. Sundance's former senior figures, including former African consultant and Perth geologist David Porter, have claimed to Fairfax Media they did not know who was behind Cominvest. The leaked documents, which are in French, show that "Monsieur Corneille Oba" – the mining minister's younger brother – helped form Cominvest and was formally appointed a director during a meeting "across from the Russian embassy, Brazzaville" in October 2008. The revelations come after Fairfax Media in August uncovered a suspected plot by former Sundance figures to bribe Congo's President, Mr Nguesso, by gifting shares worth millions of dollars to his family via a frontman. That frontman, banker Fabrice Sil, is also named as a Cominvest director alongside Corneille Oba in the leaked documents.
The central allegation facing Sundance is that it gifted Sundance shares worth millions to the families of the President and the mining minister to ensure they granted Sundance exclusive mining licences and government support. The revelations in August sparked a federal police probe and forced Sundance to launch its own investigation into the share deals, which were brokered between 2006 and 2008 and led to large parcels of Sundance shares being given to Cominvest between 2008 and 2012. The federal police also announced it was launching an anti-foreign bribery taskforce in Perth, which is investigating Sundance but will also have responsibility for other WA companies accused of corporate corruption. Many mining companies headquartered in Perth are exposed to major bribery risks in Africa and Asia. While none of the former Sundance managers and directors with links to suspect share deals would comment publicly when previously contacted by Fairfax Media, several privately insisted they had no idea who controlled the mysterious company that received the three parcels of Sundance shares.
If this scenario is correct, it suggests a major and inexplicable due diligence failure by Sundance while operating in a country where bribery risks are well known. It is a breach of Australian bribery laws to give a financial benefit such as shares to a foreign politician, or any person fronting for them, in return for a business advantage. In 2012, Sundance announced publicly that Mines and Geology Minister Pierre Oba had "recommended that the Council of Ministers approves the issuing of the mining permit." "Sundance appreciates the approval and recommendation by the minister, which brings the beginning of development of Nabeba one step closer, creating significant economic, financial and social benefits for the people of the… Congo ," Sundance's CEO Giulio Casello said in the 2012 announcement. There is no suggestion Mr Casello, who joined Sundance in November 2010, was party to the suspect share deals as they were brokered before he joined the company.
In a statement to Fairfax Media, Mr Casello said the revelations about the involvement of the Congo mining minister's brother would be investigated by Sundance in addition to the bribery allegations involving Congo's president. "We have commissioned an independent law firm to conduct a thorough assessment of events involving the company between 2006 and 2008. The information regarding Corneille Oba will be examined as part of this assessment, which is in its early stages. We continue to co-operate fully with the Australian Federal Police investigation on the same matter," Mr Casello said. Loading
Sundance is seeking to restructure its finances to keep its African project – a huge iron ore venture spanning the Congo and Cameroon border – alive.

By Taylor W. Anderson The Bulletin
A civil liberties group is calling for fundamental reforms in the Oregon Department of Justice to protect free speech online in the wake of revelations that investigators weren't aware of rules that should have prevented them from monitoring Black Lives Matter supporters.
An investigator that coordinates crime-fighting efforts between state and federal law enforcement in the Oregon TITAN Fusion Center told a Portland attorney looking into the DOJ's Criminal Justice Division that he didn't know it would be an issue to search for posts made by people who speak publicly about the racial equality movement and then compile a report.
That revelation, which was detailed in the attorney's report released last week , wasn't the only example of investigators at the Fusion Center not understanding a state law and federal and agency guidelines that should have prevented the search and others like it.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon says Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum must work with outside groups to make changes within her agency to protect free speech and prevent racial profiling and biased policing.
“The report on the internal investigation of the Criminal Justice Division's surveillance of Black Lives Matter leaves us with more questions than answers,” ACLU-Oregon Executive Director David Rogers said. “They will need outside help to address these issues.”
Portland attorney Carolyn Walker, with the firm Stoel Rives, conducted a five-month study in which she interviewed DOJ employees who spend their time scouring the Internet for potential threats to events and the public.
Walker, working as a special investigator with a $440-an-hour contract worth up to $88,000 Rosenblum approved in November, created a framework of the surveillance of a Black Lives Matter supporter from September and October 2015. A spokeswoman didn't make Rosenblum available for an interview with The Bulletin for this story.
An investigator — who remains on paid leave — was trying out a new surveillance tool Sept. 29 that allows law enforcement to pinpoint within meters the location of social media users when they fire off a Tweet or Facebook post that's set to public view.
Chuck Cogburn with the TITAN Fusion Center had been working for months to secure a trial for the tool: DigitalStakeout, software created by Motorola Solutions and marketed to businesses that want to track sentiment about their brands online and law enforcement looking to prevent or investigate crime.
He'd finally secured a brief trial last September, when an investigator — reportedly James Williams, according to the Willamette Week — searched for social media users in Salem who had typed in the tag #BlackLivesMatter.
The investigator found a dot on the corresponding map that showed someone within the Department of Justice building next to the Oregon State Capitol had sent several tweets supporting the movement and sharing a wide range of commentary on high-profile police killings of unarmed black Americans.
That account belonged to Erious Johnson, the head of the Civil Rights Unit within the Department of Justice.
Johnson sent a tweet that's still viewable today with a silhouetted figure of a man with a hat in the crosshairs of a rifle scope. “Consider yourselves … WARNED!!!” Johnson wrote.
Employees within the agency later recognized the image as the logo of Public Enemy and the words a quote from the popular hip-hop group from the 1980s and 1990s. Johnson has told the state he plans to sue the DOJ and has filed a civil rights complaint with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, OPB reported Friday.
The problem? Investigators shouldn't have even gotten to that point — of zeroing in on Johnson's tweets, the ACLU says.
A 1981 state law, along with federal regulations that shape the training Fusion Center employees are supposed to receive, should have prevented the use of DigitalStakeout to search for Black Lives Matter supporters from taking place. Internal training reviewed by The Bulletin also shows employees are instructed not to violate free speech protections by collecting certain information related to social, religious or political views.
Unless there's reasonable suspicion that someone whose information is being collected and retained by the Fusion Center is connected to a crime, investigators are not supposed to collect that information, a PowerPoint presentation of the training shows.
The training also tells investigators to “use creativity and articulate your reasonable suspicion in some way” if information being collected is related to social, political or religious views.
“(Walker's) report falls short of addressing several areas of concern, but one thing it does conclude is that this search was ‘not in compliance' with state law,” said Mat dos Santos, ACLU-Oregon's legal director. “In other words, the statute that prohibits law enforcement from surveilling innocent Oregonians was broken.”
The report showed at least two investigators, whose names were redacted from the report, weren't aware of the state law. Several terms that investigators used were redacted from the report. An agency spokeswoman said the information was redacted because it relates to ongoing criminal investigations.

EDITORS NOTE: This FanPost by Mr. Overmars does a great job of testing many assumptions people have about what affects the Thrashers attendance with a look at the actual data. So I moved this to the main page so that more people would have a chance to read it.
Much has been made about Thrashers attendance from both in and outside of the fan base. I've long thought of Atlanta as an event town. Meaning that you have to make something special in order for the town folk to give you any attention. For the Thrashers I believe consistent winning constitutes an event. The one thing that makes the Thrashers appointment viewing. Since we've yet to become must-see in our own town I've decided to take a deeper dive in to the numbers focusing on the seasons following the lock out of 2004-05 and give some special consideration to some popular myths.
Since said lockout there have been 182 games played in Philips Arena including the 18 matches contested this season to date.
Looking at the big picture.
The Thrashers have averaged 15,373 attendees over these 182 games which comes to 83% of capacity (18,545). Over this same span the other 29 teams have combined to average 17,230 (94%). The Thrashers rank 29th, in average capacity (13,745; 74.1%) this season after averaging 23rd in the league the previous 4 seasons. Thanks Coyotes.
The trend?
2009-10: 13,745 (74.1%)
2008-09: 14.626 (78.9%) 76 points
2007-08: 15,831 (85.4%) 76 points
2006-07: 16,240 (87.6%) 97 points * Made Post Season
2005:06: 15,550 (83.8%) 90 points
The bloom is most certainly off the rose as we've seen Thrashers attendance settle to near worst in the league despite a team that had been successful on the ice through the first third of the 2009-10 season. In fairness, it appears as if the city has responded when the club has won. In 2006-07 the club played to 93% capacity over the last quarter of the season averaging 17,328 fans per game (5 reported sell outs in 11 games). Unfortunately this is really not a significant sample size to know if the fans will be there consistently if the team ices a winning product.
Myth: Atlanta fans wait for football season to end before focusing on the hockey season. Because of travel in the southeast for football there is less time/disposable income for hockey games. What does the data say?
Average Attendance by month
2005-09 09-10 to date
October: 14,932 14,894
November: 14,931 13,098
December: 15,970 13,994
January: 14,958 tbd
February: 16,361 tbd
March: 15,563 tbd
April: 17,287 tbd
While the numbers seem to support this theory with the average attendance spiking nicely in February and April I remain skeptical. Since February (circus) and April (season end) are typically thin for home games and my skew the data I thought it would be interesting to take a deeper dive to see if there is a correlation on days of the week during the football season.
Myth: Fridays in the south is for high school football. Families will not be available to attend games as they'll be at school functions.
The data:
Friday night average attendance from 2005-2010: 16,667 (90%).
October: 16,339 November: 16,634 December: 16,273 January: 16,355 February: 17,067 March: 17,602 April: n/a
Average attendance on Fridays
With high school football in season: 16,511
While high school football is out: 16,755
Myth: Busted. The numbers in December and January, when high schools are typically finished with their regular seasons, remain consistent with the in season numbers. There is no direct data to show that Friday Night football is the reason for keeping the people out of the seats We clearly show an uptick on Fridays later in the season but it cannot be attributed to the end of the high school football slate.
Myth: The south is college football crazy. Scheduling games on Saturdays is murder as the locals are focused on the Bulldogs and Jackets.
Lets move over to Saturdays shall we?
Average Saturday night attendance 2005-10: 17,178 (93% capacity)
October: 16,190 November: 16,466 December: 16,456 January: 18,625 February: 18,545 March: 18,070 April: 18,103
Myth: Confirmed. The numbers during the football season on Saturday are drastically lower than post bowl season. Interesting to note that Saturdays in January and February have averaged a sell out over the past 5 years. Going next level I was actually surprised to learn that the biggest inhibitor to Thrashers attendance was not the UGA Bulldogs but rather the Jackets of Tech. The numbers:
Thrasher attendance when UGA plays that same day: 16,484
Thrasher attendance when GT plays the same day: 15,990
Since there is some cross over on the weekend they play each other I thought I'd look at those weekends when ONLY Tech or UGA plays:
UGA only: 17,619 average attendance
GT only: 14,945 average attendance
As a control figure I also took a look at those Saturdays where neither Tech nor UGA played during the football season: 16,356.
In the interest of full disclosure Georgia has played on opening night twice and Tech only once. Opening nights are typically sell outs so that inflated the Bulldog numbers quite a bit. Regardless, it's clear that even if the local elevens are off the region is focused on the gridiron rather than the ice.
What about Sundays? Do the Falcons have any impact on the Thrashers attendance?
All time Sunday: 14,497 (78%)
November: 12,000 December: 16,088 January: 15,311 February: 14,175 March: 16,618
Average when Falcons play: 12,806 ; Average when Falcons don't play: 15,624
That would be yes. In a big way. The largest swing of the football competition. Don't let anyone fool you. This is a pro football town.
Does the opponent matter? We've long heard that Atlanta is a city of transplants from the north. The Thrashers are struggling to achieve a solid fan base because the out of towners have not abandoned their affiliations with the previous teams. Below are the averages for each team. Phoenix, I believe, can be taken with a grain of salt as they've only appeared in Atlanta once and that was on a non football season Friday night. I guess everyone wanted to get a glimpse at Gretzky.
Poor St Louis has come to town on Falcon Sundays twice in their 3 visits. They were doomed from the start. Also of note is the poor draw that is Nashville.
Many Thrashers fans have desired a regular meeting with the Preds due to their geographic proximity. I think we may want to temper this movement as there appears to be little interest for the Predators outside of the resident topographers
Team Avg att % cap Phoenix 18545 100.00% Detroit 18052 97.34% Pittsburgh 16221 87.47% Washington 16218 87.45% Philadelphia 16212 87.42% NY Rangers 16177 87.23% Anaheim 16028 86.43% Vancouver 15858 85.51% Tampa Bay 15788 85.13% Carolina 15758 84.97% Buffalo 15755 84.96% San Jose 15656 84.42% Toronto 15606 84.15% New Jersey 15494 83.55% Montreal 15459 83.36% AVG 15373 82.90% Minnesota 15276 82.37% Dallas 15251 82.24% Boston 15105 81.45% Calgary 14857 80.11% Ottawa 14761 79.60% Chicago 14685 79.19% Los Angeles 14422 77.77% NY Islanders 14366 77.47% Florida 14088 75.97% Nashville 13916 75.04% Edmonton 13887 74.88% Columbus 13566 73.15% Colorado 13095 70.61z St Louis 13001 70.11%
Ultimately without regard to opponent or other goings on the true trump card for Thrashers attendance is simply the day of the week. Over the past 5 seasons the average by day of the week breaks down as:
Sunday: 14,997
Monday: 13,795
Tuesday: 13,929
Wednesday: 14,702
Thursday: 14,581
Friday: 16,667
Saturday: 17,178
A bit tough for the Thrashers this season as their remaining home schedule loads them up on tough draw nights:
Sun: 2
Mon: 1
Tue: 9
Wed: 0
Thu: 6
Fri: 1

Thus I think its safe to surmise that Atlanta is NOT a hockey town. The people will allegedly show up to the arena if they are playing well but we have not seen enough winning in Atlanta to generate a passion. As it stands the Thrashers remain one of many entertainment options in the city. We see larger crowds on the “date nights” and continue to struggle on work/school nights. Until the team starts winning with regularity this team is not a must attend event.

The NFL announced Wednesday that the Los Angeles Rams will serve as the focal point for the 11th season of Hard Knocks, NFL Films' acclaimed documentary series on life in training camp.
As the Rams gear up for their Hollywood star turn, let's take a look back at some of the greatest moments in the first 10 seasons of the HBO mainstay.
Here's the scene from last summer that people probably remember most. J.J. Watt alone in the darkness, working on his craft long after teammates had retired to the locker room. Was this a peek into the ceaseless work ethic of a transcendent talent -- or a shameless play to the cameras? We'll never know ... and we're too afraid to ask.
The Baltimore Ravens' rookies set the bar extremely high in Season 1 for the annual rookie talent competition. We think of this every time we hear the word "restitution."
Three words: King Ugly competition.
There is a ton of comedy in Hard Knocks, intentional and otherwise, but the genius of the show often comes when the viewer gets to be a fly on the wall for a true football moment. The exchange between Miami Dolphins general manager Jeff Ireland and cornerback Vontae Davis when Davis gets traded stands out.
Chad Ochocinco's awkward, post-arrest release from the team also comes to mind. In what other "reality" show do you see a highly successful, high-profile career essentially end on camera?
Watt had a striking cameo in Season 9, dominating rookie tackle Jake Matthews in an intrasquad scrimmage. NFL Films gave us an up-close look at Watt's freakish combination of speed, strength and quickness, which made Matthews -- the sixth overall pick in the 2014 Draft -- look like a fan who won a contest to get on the field.
Without Hard Knocks we'd never know that the NFL has its very own version of 80s movie super villain Billy Zabka and his name is Brian Cushing.
"Don't ever push me extra like that. First of all, you're not going to block me. Second of all, you don't want to fight me. Third of all (gears grinding ... searching ... spinning beach ball) ... I'm the man."
In 2010, owner Woody Johnson wanted the New York Jets to become a national team. Taking over Hard Knocks did the trick. Episodes such as the one that featured holdout cornerback Darrelle Revis' secret meeting with the Jets at the Roscoe Diner made national news. (And ultimately made Revis very rich.)
The Kansas City Chiefs' Hard Knocks season seems to get lost in the shuffle. A few very attractive wives (October Gonzalez, Kelli Croyle) got a lot of attention, but it was another budding romance that stole the stage.
Also during the Chiefs' season: The all-time favorite Hard Knocks moment for Gregg Rosenthal's wife. The reactions are the key. Bernard Pollard, take it away:
The Dallas Cowboys' season of Hard Knocks shaped up to be a doozy with Jerry Jones, Terrell Owens, Adam "Pacman" Jones, Tony Romo and company. It surprisingly fell flat, at least in comparison to other seasons. The latter Jones did his best to keep us entertained.
Ryan Tannehill is known for his football smarts. He is not known for his NFL divisional knowledge.
We watch every season of Hard Knocks knowing that the turk is coming to cut a player. And yet it is always affecting, often heartbreaking when he shows up. Putting together a montage of the cuts is too depressing, but one other tough moment stuck out: The season-ending injury to a Cincinnati Bengals tight end in the Bengals' 2009 camp.
This was a pro's pro, accepting a cruel fate, while the team around him had no choice but to move on.
There are also the heartwarming stories, like when Tyler Starr -- the 255th pick in the 2014 Draft -- got the call from Falcons coach Mike Smith telling him he'd beaten the odds to make the final 53-man roster. Goosebumps alert.
Marvin Lewis' tirade after a preseason loss goes down as the scariest speech in Hard Knocks history. But Rex Ryan's speech in 2010 had the better closer. Wow them in the end, and you've got a hit.
Texans cornerback Kareem Jackson on Vince Wilfork's instantly iconic overalls: "You had to get that special made. I haven't seen the shorts like that in a while ... except for on babies."
And finally, Antonio Cromartie's family tree.
Apple CEO Tim Cook will appear on ABC's World News Tonight with David Muir on February 24 at 6:30 PM Eastern Time. In the interview, he explains Apple's position against a court order to create new software that would help the FBI access the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters last December.
Portions of the interview are already available.
Tim Cook said:
I think safety of the public is incredibly important -- safety of our kids, safety of our family is very important. The protection of people's data is incredibly important, and so the trade-off here is we know that doing this could expose people to incredible vulnerabilities.
The interview will also be shown on ABC's Nightline at 12:35 AM.
Apple intends to put up a vigorous defense in this matter which could affect the privacy of Americans for all time.
In this Ask the Admin, I'll explain what Microsoft's AD tier administrative model is and how it can improve security.
Access controls are an important defense mechanism for sensitive information systems. But access controls can be ineffective if poorly implemented. One bad decision can lead to a compromise. You only have to look at many organization's Active Directory (AD) to realize that little thought has been put into how to grant access to the directory, domain controllers (DCs), and other sensitive assets. It is common to find IT support staff with domain administrative privileges, domain admin accounts used to log in to users' PCs, and administrative user accounts and passwords shared across multiple devices.
Microsoft has been working to reduce the impact of breaches caused by poor access controls. For example, Windows 10 Credential Guard aims to protect domain credentials on compromised PCs. The new Azure Confidential Computing initiative uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to protect unencrypted data as it is being processed.
For more information on Azure Confidential Computing, see Microsoft Announces Azure Confidential Computing on the Petri IT Knowledgebase. You can read about Windows 10 Credential Guard on Petri here: Windows 10 Enterprise Feature: Credential Guard.
Active Directory Administrative Tier Model
Despite the security features Microsoft is including in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, implementing proper access controls is still an important defense. The tiered administrative model aims to help organizations to better secure environments. The model defines three tiers that create buffer zones to separate administration of high-risk PCs and valuable assets like domain controllers.
Tier 0 is the highest level and includes administrative accounts and groups, domain controllers, and domains that have direct or indirect administrative control of the AD forest. Tier 0 administrators can manage and control assets in all tiers but only log in interactively to Tier 0 assets. I.e. a domain administrator should never interactively log in to a Tier 2 asset.
Tier 1 is for domain member servers and applications. Accounts that control these assets have access to sensitive business data. Tier 1 administrators can access Tier 1 or Tier 0 assets (network logon) but can only manage Tier 1 or Tier 2 assets. Tier 1 administrators can only log on interactively to Tier 1 assets.
Tier 2 is for end-user devices. For example, helpdesk staff would be part of this tier. Tier 2 administrators can access all tier assets (network logon) as necessary but can only manage Tier 2 assets. Tier 2 admins can log in interactively to Tier 2 assets.
The three tiers increase the cost for an attacker trying to compromise sensitive systems. You should consider that a user that has full access to all Tier 2 assets could get access to assets in a higher tier. The tiered administrative model makes it harder for a hacker to move from a Tier 2 to a Tier 0 asset but doesn't make it impossible.
Security Best Practice
Understanding the tiered model gives you a better insight into Microsoft's security best practices. For example, a Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) that is used by a domain administrator is also considered a Tier 0 asset. A Tier 0 administrator must use a Tier 0 PAW to manage other Tier 0 assets, such as domain controllers because the account will be a member of a highly-privileged domain or forest group.
The tiered administrative model isn't hard to implement. It does require additional resources, like PAWs, and some planning in how to manage access and control between the tiers. It is achievable for most organizations and goes a long way to implementing effective access controls that will keep hackers from compromising sensitive systems.

Geek Mountain State is pleased to present the next installment of the Vermont SF Writer's Series. This bimonthly reading event focuses on science fiction, fantasy and horror writers in Vermont, often with a theme to each set of stories. On November 16th, we will present Rachel Carter, Pat Esden, Margot Harrison and Dean Whitlock, who will each read from their young adult themed works. The event will take place at the Fletcher Free Library in Burlington on November 16th at 2:00pm.
Rachel Carter is a writer, a reader, and a lover of all things pop culture. She grew up in the woods of Vermont and graduated from Columbia University with an MFA in nonfiction writing. She is the author of the So Close to You series with HarperTeen, and her nonfiction has appeared in Booktrib, The New Republic, and The Faster Times.
Pat Esden writes young adult and new adult fantasy and suspense. Her new adult paranormal trilogy, MOONHILL, will be coming from Kensington Books, starting Spring 2016. Her short stories and novelettes have been published in a variety of venues, including Orson Scott Cards Intergalactic Medicine Show. She's also an antique dealer, and was a multi-award winning florist and a regular contributor to Vermont Bride Magazine.
Margot Harrison is the author of THE KILLER IN ME, a YA thriller to be published by Disney Hyperion. She is associate editor of Burlington's alt-weekly paper SEVEN DAYS, where she reports on the local literary scene and writes movie reviews.
Dean Whitlock is a military brat who likes to think that living in so many different places naturally drove him into a fantasy world. Now he does most of his traveling through his stories (but only for want of money and time!). He is the author of two YA novels (Sky Carver and Raven, both from Clarion Books), three handfuls of short stories, and several plays and murder mystery events. A collection of short stories is in the work, along with a sequel to his YA novels. To pay the bills, Dean writes technical manuals, grant proposals, and magazine articles. And he visits schools and libraries to read and teach whenever he can. He believes that imagination is the key difference between humans and other animals, because his students can always envision such wonderful stories, no matter what grade they're in or how much they know about commas.

Since we've been talking about seniors' pharmacare, perhaps it's time to change the modifier and resume a longstanding conversation about universal pharmacare.
Canada is the only industrialized country in the world that boasts a universal health-care program but offers no parallel national scheme so those who need prescription medications can actually get them.
The reality is that most of those who aren't seniors or covered by private health-care plans -- minimum wage employees, seasonal workers, the ever increasing numbers of contract hires in the exponentially expanding freelance economy -- don't have a drug plan at all.
And, as we've discovered during the ongoing debate over changes to seniors' pharmacare in Nova Scotia, even many of those who are supposedly covered also find themselves unable to foot the extra costs for co-pays, premiums and other deductibles, and therefore go without prescribed medications.
The best estimate is that one in 10 Canadians cannot afford the prescription medications they need.
Ironically, Canada and its provincial and territorial governments pay more for prescription drugs than most other western countries.
That's because, despite best efforts by some provinces, we're still hobbled by a patchwork of public and private purchasing schemes so we can't take advantage of national bulk buying, or force pharmaceutical companies to bid for our business.
In 2014, provincial and territorial governments spent $10.4 billion on prescription medications.
The reality, according to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, is that a Canada-wide, no-deductible prescription drug benefit program financed through personal income taxes would save rather than cost taxpayers, reducing public and private spending on prescription drugs by 32 per cent.
We've been talking about the need for such a program since at least the 2002 Romanow report on the future of health care. Unfortunately, that discussion got pushed off the front burner, the stove and out of the kitchen during the Harper years.
Although Justin Trudeau has not expressed support for a national pharmacare program -- the Liberal platform simply said it would make prescription drugs "more affordable" -- his new Liberal government is committed to meeting with the provinces to discuss a new Canada Health Accord.
A national pharmacare program should be part of that discussion.
Is our premier prepared to be part of this discussion?

A company's own top management tend to have the best inside view into the business, so when company officers make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass'' over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $3M invested across 2 purchases by Wellington Denahan, CEO at Annaly Capital Management Inc (NYSE: NLY).
Click here to find out which other top insider buys by the ''top brass'' you need to know about »
Denahan bets big on NLY:
Purchased Insider Title Shares Price/Share Value 08/21/2013 Wellington Denahan Chairman of Board & CEO 181,818 $10.96 $1,993,631.28 11/08/2013 Wellington Denahan Chairman of Board & CEO 93,000 $10.68 $993,240.00
Denahan's average cost works out to $10.87/share. In trading on Friday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Annaly Capital Management Inc (NYSE: NLY) and achieve a cost basis lower than Denahan, with shares changing hands as low as $10.72 per share. Shares of Annaly Capital Management Inc were changing hands at $10.78 at last check, trading off about 1.4% on Friday. The chart below shows the one year performance of NLY shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
Looking at the chart above, NLY's low point in its 52 week range is $9.66 per share, with $16.18 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $10.78.
The current annualized dividend paid by Annaly Capital Management Inc is $1.20/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 12/27/2013. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for NLY, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 11.0% annualized yield is likely to continue.
According to the ETF Finder at ETFChannel.com, NLY makes up 14.81% of the iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF (AMEX: REM) which is trading lower by about 0.6% on the day Friday.

Occupy London Stock Exchange protesters have extended their action by taking over an empty office block in Hackney, east London, belonging to the bank UBS.
The deadline has passed for people camping outside St Paul's Cathedral to leave or face court action, but protesters remain at the site.
An Occupy London spokesman described the new move as "public repossession".
A UBS spokeswoman said: "We are aware of the situation and taking appropriate action."
Jack Holburn, a supporter of the campaign group, which is protesting against "capitalist greed", said: "As banks repossess families' homes, empty bank property needs to be repossessed by the public."
The protest group said a dozen activists gained access to the building and secured it on Thursday night, "giving them a legal claim on the space".
Occupy London said it was the group's third space and its first building, adding to its camps at St Paul's Churchyard, and at Finsbury Square, in the City of London.
The City of London Corporation said it had initiated court proceedings to remove the camp from a public highway around St Paul's Cathedral.
'Bank of Ideas'
The case will be taken up by the High Court on 23 November. The camp has been informed about the development, the corporation said.
Protesters said they planned to remain at the site and are ready for the court battle.
Mr Holburn said: "Whilst over 9,000 families were kicked out of their homes in the last three months for failing to keep up mortgage payments - mostly due to the recession caused by the banks - UBS and others financial giants are sitting on massive abandoned properties."
Occupy London said the space would be reopened on Saturday morning as the Bank of Ideas, with a programme of talks and comedy lined up.
Image caption The Corporation of London is taking legal action to evict the protesters
Sarah Layler of Occupy London said: "The Bank of Ideas will host a full events programme where people will be able to trade in creativity rather than cash.
"We will also make space available for those that have lost their nurseries, community centres and youth clubs to savage government spending cuts."
The City of London Corporation had given protesters at St Paul's until 18:00 GMT on Thursday to clear the "public highway".
But an Occupy London spokeswoman said: "We're not planning on going anywhere."
A planned concert at the cathedral by the Italia Conti stage school has had to be cancelled because of the protest.
The school's principal, Anne Sheward, told the BBC the concert - due to take place on 2 December - could not be staged because of health and safety fears.
It was to have featured over 700 performers and a congregation of 2,000.
"We can't risk there being any intimidation or trouble. It's just too big a responsibility," she said
The concert will now be held at Westminster Central Hall.

Another week, another contrived crisis. Never let a good one of those go to waste. No, it's not Kony hijacking a Malaysian Plane for Bowe Bergdahl, this week's psy op is “race riots” in Nowhere, MO, where choosing the correct side of a polarized media dialectic only feeds the soon-to-be-forgotten pseudo-hysteria of Trayvon, the Sequel. In Trayvon 2, it's the Empire Strikes Back, as the Washington establishment ramps up its disaster and COG (continuity of government) test runs. While talking heads yammer on about everything but what is relevant, this week's circus is reminiscent of the Katrina scenario, where martial law was enacted due to a huge natural disaster resulted in gun confiscations and martial law.
It is important to keep fresh in one's mind the mainstream media's number one job as psy ops central – keep everyone in fear. Unrest, disintegration and controlled chaos is essentially the only purpose of mass media, with the result being brief temporal passing interest in some inane story, utterly unconnected to 99.9999% of the population. To sum it all up, the same programs of psy ops, destabilization, controlled chaos and subversion/inversion that we have seen the establishment concoct in the Middle East and Ukraine of late are now becoming the game plan on the home front.
Those of us in alternative media who actually know what planet we're on have been pointing to documents like the 2007 British Ministry of Defense's projection of civil unrest, flash mobs and technological slavery for several years now. The report was detailed in the Guardian as follows: “Information chips implanted in the brain. Electromagnetic pulse weapons. The middle classes becoming revolutionary, taking on the role of Marx's proletariat. The population of countries in the Middle East increasing by 132%, while Europe's drops as fertility falls. “Flashmobs” – groups rapidly mobilised by criminal gangs or terrorists groups.”
The report continues, speculating about a rise in “Marxism” and inequality:
“The middle classes could become a revolutionary class, taking the role envisaged for the proletariat by Marx,” says the report. The thesis is based on a growing gap between the middle classes and the super-rich on one hand and an urban under-class threatening social order: “The world's middle classes might unite, using access to knowledge, resources and skills to shape transnational processes in their own class interest”. Marxism could also be revived, it says, because of global inequality. An increased trend towards moral relativism and pragmatic values will encourage people to seek the “sanctuary provided by more rigid belief systems, including religious orthodoxy and doctrinaire political ideologies, such as popularism and Marxism.”
In other words, the system's plan is to fund more bogus Marxism, socialism and phony equalism to cause unrest so the system can offer the solution of increased bureaucracy and technological slavery. Order out of chaos is always the game plan and it never changes. You can always look at the establishment's modus operandi and accurately predict what will come because the plays never change. And the plays never change because fallen human nature prefers to feed its animal side to its rational side.
Similar to the MOD plan from 2007, the Rand Corporation has also outlined strategies of tension and controlled chaos with the intent of fomenting justifications for increased technocratic and militaristic operations through local law enforcement, known as a Stability Police Force. The SPF would operate through local Marshals to handle riot situations, disasters, etc., and it becomes obvious that such planning need a reason for its funding. William Grigg of Lew Rockwell reported in 2009:
“The RAND study, which was conducted for the U.S. Army's Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute, recommended using the Marshals Service rather than the US Army's Military Police as host for the SPFOR in order to avoid conflicts with the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids (albeit in principle more than in practice) the domestic use of the military as a law enforcement body.
“The USMS hybrid option … provides an important nondeployed mission for the force: augmenting state and local agencies, many of which currently suffer from severe personnel shortages,” states the report without explaining how the SPFOR could at once “augment” those under-manned agencies while at the same time being “augmented” by them if necessary.”
If that wasn't wild enough, throw on top of that the Army's Small Wars Journal piece, “Full Spectrum Operations in the Homeland,” predicting a Tea Party uprising in 2016 leading to civil war and social disintegration and race war:
“The Scenario (2016)
The Great Recession of the early twenty-first century lasts far longer than anyone anticipated. After a change in control of the White House and Congress in 2012, the governing party cuts off all funding that had been dedicated to boosting the economy or toward relief. The United States economy has flatlined, much like Japan's in the 1990s, for the better part of a decade. By 2016, the economy shows signs of reawakening, but the middle and lower-middle classes have yet to experience much in the way of job growth or pay raises. Unemployment continues to hover perilously close to double digits, small businesses cannot meet bankers' terms to borrow money, and taxes on the middle class remain relatively high. A high-profile and vocal minority has directed the public's fear and frustration at nonwhites and immigrants. After almost ten years of race-baiting and immigrant-bashing by right-wing demagogues, nearly one in five Americans reports being vehemently opposed to immigration, legal or illegal, and even U.S.-born nonwhites have become occasional targets for mobs of angry whites.”
At this point, I can only think of the perceptive words of my friend Mark Hackard, who opined in his excellent “Pleasure Dome Police State:” “This regime is the culmination of liberalism's logic; it is what U.S. forces patrolling the Hindu Kush and all other corners of the earth defend. We fight them over there to invite them over here, for peace and unity in our world must first be enforced through universal war….To question this sublime experiment or (even worse) to oppose it would be an unpardonable sin against democracy, the creed of our greatness. And what is the secret of democracy, this gospel to liberate and empower all mankind?
It is the political expression of our modern faith, self-worship. Just below the rationalistic assertion of rights and equality is the abyss of desire, the wish to ultimately recognize no authority higher than one's own will made divine. Faith, ethnos and culture must be annihilated by egalitarianism and market forces, thereby giving rise to the New Man. From spiritual disorder springs social anarchy. In the contemporary West, a nation is no longer itself, but a mass of atoms, sovereign in their frenzied quest for profit and pleasure, mere demographic material for the plutocrats' global Babylon. As surely as the laws of nature, chaos will then necessitate further manipulation and control from above.”
Consider the logic in our actions, since that seems to be the least of concerns. As “freedom” increased globally with the purported expansion of Amerikan democracy, the tyranny increases at home. The only freedom is the choice of which slavery one desires more. More drugs, bobbles or worthless tech gadgets? Which brand? Who's your favorite team? The exportation of so-called freedom seems to exponentially increase the homeland servitude. All the while, the masses cry out for more equalism, more socialism and more “revolution,” all perfectly engineered by the psy op social planners and foundation operatives that fund “democratic” ideals.
The harsh reality is, the society has gone insane. The mantra is often repeated that only 3% of the population won the Revolutionary War, but what happens when 50% of the population become drugged out zombies of the PharmaCisTransgenderMediaHollywoodMonsantoGovernment Complex? The revolutionaries of yore were undoubtedly dupes of the larger foreign economic power blocs of their day, but today's scientific revolutionaries run the show. And this is precisely why Bertrand Russell's final revolution is so crucial, for it is the revolution against man himself, in his very being, identity, gender and nature.
And this why Hackard was perfectly accurate when he stated as follows:
“When the democratic principle is exalted beyond the suitable level of local institutions, it flattens all qualitative distinctions between individuals and peoples, leaving destruction, mediocrity and token tasteless amusements in its wake. As the modern West pursues the ideals of liberty and equality to their final outcomes, it draws ever nearer to a nightmarish despotism and dissolution. Immanent universal brotherhood can only be diagnosed as the fever-dream of a diseased imagination, which in its turn is seduced by a malicious deceiving spirit. In Fedor Dostoevsky's The Possessed, the revolutionary theoretician Shigalev cursorily explains the dialectic of liberation:
Setting out from limitless freedom, I bring about an unlimited despotism.
Tyranny is not democracy's tragic demise, but the logical consummation of its progress. Only by returning to an organic conception of man and the state, with humility and a record of lessons learned, can we gather strength for renewal and reaction. Life in this fallen world is struggle–toward Transcendence and eternity. Accordingly, politics must be conducted in fidelity to the moral law, whose Author is supra-natural. All power derives from God, and to Him shall it be consecrated.”
In the not very good 1998 film The Siege, directed by Robert Zwick, a predictive pre-9/11 scenario forms the plot: In the wake of staged terror, a militarized police state is erected in New York under martial law. General Bruce Willis seizes upon the opportunity to grant himself rulership of New York under a tightly controlled military dictatorship. Much like a CIA-installed dictator in some African or Latin American hellhole, Willis engages in all manner of brutality, imprisoning anyone who questions him in internment camps set up in sports stadiums. An ominous foreshadowing of future Amerika, The Siege was telling viewers what post-9/11 democracy would be like. What it would be like is what all democracies end up being, which are oligarchical mob-ocracies, run by billionaires and trillionaires steering the herd by holding out every base passion on the end of a stick. In short, the rise of helter skelter race war tensions are yet another example of the mass Stockholm Emasculation Syndrome that is democracy.
Good for: drinking Belgian beer and eating traditional European food
Notable dishes: the Monk's Burger, carbonnade
Monk's Cellar is one of many relatively new breweries in the Sacramento area serving up food (see: Oak Park Brewing Co., Yolo Brewing Co., etc.). What sets it apart from most of these other breweries? A reverence for the Old World. The décor here resembles a pub that might exist somewhere in Europe, with copious wood and dark brick throughout. Most of the beer served here is Belgian-style and most of the food is European pub-inspired—including burgers, charcuterie and stews.
The house beer is pretty good, especially the St. Arnold Ale, a Belgian quadrupel (see “Like the Belgians do,” SN&R Drink Me, January 29). There is also a handful of tasty rotating Belgian beers on tap.
This review is about the food, so if you do happen to sample the house beer (a flight of seven beers costs $10.50), it's probably a good idea to pair that brew with some appetizers. We tried almost all of them: house-marinated olives, house-made pickles, the cellar board (assorted meats and cheeses with crackers), duck-fat fries and steamed mussels.
The cellar board was just average. The meats and cheeses weren't as fine as ones from some of the charcuterie-centric spots in Sacramento such as the Rind and Block Butcher Bar. But the extra orders of pickles and olives were both tasty and hefty, and helped to spruce up the somewhat uninspired board. At $4 each, they both came in what seemed to be (approximately) 6-ounce glass jars and their combination of sweet and sour paired well with the salty meats and cheese. The steamed mussels came with fries and we chose a white wine, butter and garlic marinade, which was good—but we still prefer the mussels at Shady Lady Saloon, which may be the best in town.
The menu's standout dish came as a surprise: a bowl of carbonnade (a.k.a. carbonade flamande, or Flemish carbonade). It was like the Audrey Hepburn of the menu—an unassuming, simply beautiful star that seemingly came out of nowhere, and that we didn't really know was Belgian until we looked at its Wikipedia page. Though usually made with beef, this was a lamb version that boasts a ton of stewed onion, chunks of tender lamb and a nice combination of sweet and sour coming from stewed beer. Imagine Irish lamb stew, but with the consistency and rich, deep flavors of a goulash.
Later, we sampled a selection of sandwiches and salads: the Monk's Burger (the “standard” burger), the Brewmaster Veggie Burger, a Reuben sandwich, the Cellar Salad (arugula with apple, cabbage and candied walnuts) and a Cobb salad (egg, bacon, chicken, radish and lettuce). Out of all the sandwiches, the Monk's Burger was the best, with a juicy beef patty, pickled onions and Gruyere cheese playing well together. Both the Reuben and the veggie burger came out dry, and needed to be slathered with garlic aoili to even make then swallow-able. Like most pub food, the salads were simple but effective, with fresh ingredients and not too much pretension. A vegan might even be able to eat here by ordering the Cellar Salad and asking to hold the bleu cheese.
Overall, the menu has some pretty good selections on it, with standouts including the burger and carbonnade. Still, there are better versions of nearly everything else on the menu somewhere else in town (the duck-fat fries are better at LowBrau, the charcuterie is better at the Rind, the mussels are better at Shady Lady, etc.). So it comes down to this: Quality beer (the brewmasters have experience at Sacramento Brewing Co., Lodi Beer Co. and Sacramento Brewing Services) and a dark and beautiful ambiance (lots of brick and wood) are the best reason to visit Monk's Cellar. Four stars for the brew and ambiance, three for the food.
South Korea's advance GDP growth for 2Q expanded at a slower pace than in 1Q. Amid sluggish consumption and anemic exports, 2Q GDP growth moderated to 2.2% yoy from 2.5% yoy in 1Q. GDP growth was dragged by weaker private consumption (-0.3% qoq vs +0.6% qoq) caused by the MERS fallout and severe drought.
The recently introduced fiscal stimulus plan is expected to help offset headwinds from consumption and exports to a certain extent. The number of foreign visitors to Korea has not shown any clear signs of rebound yet. Nevertheless, June IP shows a better print than expected amid fallout from MERS in June. South Korean economy is likely to grow at 2.7% yoy in 2015, but the risk remains to the downside, says Bank of America.
Hong, Kong, Taiwan and Korea have the highest export linkages to China and, hence, will be most impacted by a weaker CNY. The recent swift and considerable weakening of KRW against USD and JPY reduced the need for easing in the near term. In the medium term, BOK is likely to retain a "weak FX" bias. Having said that, BOK will prefer to avoid a disorderly sell-off that has negative spillovers to domestic economy and asset markets.
Farmers are preparing for a second round of protests to waive off their electricity bills. Farmers from Puntambha in Ahmadnagar district, where the first farmers protest started on June 1, 2017, had met the the Nationalist Congress Party president and subsequently Chief Ministe Devendra Fadnavis and appraised him the on going agrarian crisis.
According to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL), farmers from Maharashtra owe them around Rs 17000 crore.
"For the last several years, farmers have not paid the bills. This amount is accumulating and now it has been almost Rs 17,000 crore. Waiving off the electricity bills of the farmers will be a major disaster," said an MSECL official.
"We have been paying hefty power bills, even though power has not been supplied round the clock. There has been a drought for the last three years. We had hardly used the power to pump out the water for our crops. We used electricity for four months in a year because of the depleting water table. Despite this, we have been paying the power bills. The government should waive off the power bills," said farmers.
"If the government is not keen on waiving electricity bills, then we are ready for the second round of protest," said Sarjerao Jadhav, a farmer from Puntambha.
Dhananjay Jadhav. another farmer leader said that they had demanded a complete waiving off of agriculture power bills. "However, the government has not waived off the power bill. It had withdrawn the recently increased rates and had asked farmers to pay the defaulting amount in installments. We wish the government would be more lenient towards the farmer. We told the same to chief minister Fadnavis as well," Jadhav said.
Nanansaheb Patil, farmer leader said that Fadnavis should have given the complete loan waive off for at least the marginal farmers. "Now, the loan waive off up to Rs 1.5 lakh is not helpful because farmers need to again raise the money to pay electricity bills. Most of the farmers are currently unable to pay so the government has cut off the electric supply. That will damage productions. Writing off the loan will not end the farmers' problem. The resentment is still there and it will again come out in the second round of protests," Patil said.
200 farmers organisations across the country are coming together to restart the mass farmers protest at the national level. It will start from Mandsaur where five farmers were killed by Madhya Pradesh police. The protest rally will reach Maharashtra on July 9. Ajit Navale, coordinator of the steering committee said that the Maharashtra government must waive the farmers' electricity bills. "We want a complete waiver of farmer loans, besides waiving off agriculture power bills. If the government does not agree to a waiver, we are prepared to start the second round of protest," Navale said.

There's been a minor revolution brewing lately. Not a big one, but a tiny one. But as tiny as might seem, it just might turn half the world upside down.
For many years…centuries, even…Americans have been told that bigger is better; that a massive almost-mansion is our entitled birthright, and prosperity is our deserved fate. That we can have everything we want, and need not worry about frivolous nonsense, like responsibility. Even the American Dream, to which all Americans must supposedly aspire, is purely one of materialism:
In the last few decades, we've seen American homes expand. Not in the number of residents, but in sheer size. Even with fewer and fewer people living in them, our homes have grown, adding extra bedrooms, larger kitchens, loftier ceilings, spare bathrooms, guest space, state-of-the-art appliances, and the inexplicable superfluous living room. I hate the superfluous living room.
But we're Americans, after all. We deserve our dream home.
Too bad we couldn't afford it.
How the mighty have fallen.
The housing collapse was no isolated incident, nor was it entirely the fault of eager homeowners; Americans are deeply in debt, with stagnating wages, chronic unemployment, and dreary long-term prospects. We might find our way out of this, but it's not going to be easy…and no amount of optimism is going to change the fact that we're probably going to be stuck this way for a long, long time.
And that's why some people are trying something radically different. Instead of pursuing the grandiose, they seek out the minuscule, abandoning the Bigger is Better approach with all the gusto of humble practicality.
Behold, the Tiny House, in all its itsy-bitsy glory:
It's kind of a big deal. Metaphorically, anyway.
The bedroom is usually tucked away on a 2nd-level sleeping loft, making the main floor surprisingly spacious:
Now, I know what you're thinking. Most people take one look at a tiny house and say “I could never do that.” They talk about all the wonderful things they'd miss, and the dinner parties they could never have; the kids that would have nowhere to play, and the adults who would have nowhere to hide. They might admire the resolve and discipline it takes to build and live in one, but couldn't imagine taking even one step.
But if you start listening to tiny house lovers, it starts to make a whole lot of sense.
For them, it's not a compromise. Big houses are. They're massively expensive to buy and maintain, with cavernously empty, unused space that needs to be heated, cooled, lit, furnished, and vacuumed. And for most reasonably-sized families, what's the point? Bills pile up every month, whether you enjoyed that spare kitchen or not.
A tiny house, on the other hand, might cost about $50,000, making it 90% cheaper than the average American home. It's even less if you build it yourself, for which their are innumerable instructional videos and diagrams to assist in doing just that.
You could easily save half a million dollars in mortgage costs and interest payments. That's money that could be better spent on medical care, education, kids, travel…mmm, travel…and whatever else you might need, or enjoy.
Are all the empty rooms of a spacious house really going to enrich your life enough to be worth trading all that away? Probably not. For a lot of people, it makes a lot more sense to take that dream trip to Paris than to have an outdoor pool.
And that's really the whole point. When tiny house fans see a 5-bedroom home, they imagine all the vacations they'd have to cancel to pay the mortgage; the savings that would evaporate to fill unused rooms with superfluous furniture; the doctor visits they'd skip to maintain a 3-car garage; the stability they'd undermine, building a house of cards.
When people see a tiny house, they think about everything they'd have to give up; but when minimalists see a McMansion, they think exactly the same thing.
So, what does all this have to do with infinite wandering?
Plenty.
For many of the same reasons that have motivated certain people to choose a tiny home, others have chosen none at all. For the nomads, any home is a burden. But if you can fit your whole life into a backpack, home becomes the whole world.
Travel means a lot of things to a lot of people, and for some, it's to seek the sort of enrichment that can't be found in the comforts of home, no matter how many bedrooms it might have. For others, it's because they've abandoned their possessions to collect memories instead. Others find themselves enjoying the simplicity itself.
Between the tiny housers and the nomads, you hear a lot of the same stories about what they've left behind; dead-end jobs, crushing bills, rush hour commutes, and a life fading away, without much worth remembering.
Tiny living, whether it's in a home, an apartment, or a backpack, isn't really about having less; it's about living more.
Sometimes it takes a disaster for us to realize we've got a problem, and the housing collapse hit particularly close to home. Literally. Americans will have to deal with a whole lot of reflecting in the next few decades…but when I see entire movements dedicated to getting priorities in order, I start worrying a bit less.
Plus, I kinda want one.
Talladega's district attorney wants to know if a Talladega police officer is using excessive force while handling his canine. An investigation is underway after several people claimed a dog mauled them for no reason.{}
Talladega's NAACP President tells ABC 33/40 his phone is ringing off the hook from concerned people.
"I want to let the community know we need to react like Charleston rather than Baltimore," said Talladega NAACP President Rev. Hugh Morris.{}
Rev. Morris is hearing fear from his community. A police officer and his dog are the concern.{}
"It was horrible. I had never seen anything like it. To see that dog tear that man's flesh like that, the police beat him, it was horrible," said Tenisha Richardson.{}
Richardson tells ABC 33/40 she watched a Talladega Police Department canine bite someone near an apartment complex Saturday.{}
"A lot of us are traumatized from it. I don't even want my child coming outside anymore," added Richardson.{}
The city's police chief put the dog and officer on leave after an internal investigation. The district attorney opened his own.{}
The NAACP President believes the hard part is over.
"The dog is having been pulled. The officer is on administrative leave. The Talladega County District Attorney has taken this case over," added Rev. Morris.{}
The NAACP hopes for healing for the victims and transparency in the investigation.{}
The NAACP President says the district attorney's investigation includes 4-5 victim's. He expects the total number of people bitten by this dog to rise. Family and friends of two victims shared pictures showing the dog bites. ABC 33/40 chose not to show them because they are graphic.
A "captain's challenge" will be trialled in the NRL for the first time this weekend.
The initiative will be used in Saturday's match between St George Illawarra and Newcastle at Jubilee Oval as well as upcoming NYC finals.
Under the trial rules, each captain will be allowed to challenge the referee's decision in relation to tries only.
The referee will be required to make a decision on the field and it will only be reviewed by the bunker if a challenge is made.
Each team will be allowed one incorrect challenge per half but there will be no limit on how many times a captain can contest a ruling by the match officials if he continues to be proven right.
An additional challenge will be allowed in the final 5 minutes of the game and in golden point.
CEO Todd Greenberg said the NRL had been considering a captain's challenge system for several years but did not previously have the technology to be confident the correct decision would be delivered.
"However, the bunker gives us the opportunity to trial the captain's challenge with state of the art technology to help determine whether a try has been scored," Mr Greenberg said.
"We will assess the trial to determine if there is scope to use the captain's challenge more widely in the future."
In the Dragons v Knights trial, the bunker will continue to be used for 40/20 rulings, goal line drop outs and 20 metre restarts, reportable foul play, double knock-on rulings and to determine which team touched the ball last before going over the touchline.
In the NYC Finals, the bunker will only be used to determine whether a challenge to a try scoring decision is valid.
The trial of the Captain's Challenge has been endorsed by the Competition Committee and the ARL Commission.
Head of Football, Brian Canavan thanked the Dragons and Knights for agreeing to trial the captain's challenge during a Telstra Premiership match.
"This will give us a chance to evaluate the captain's challenge in a live NRL game where teams are still playing for two competition points," he said.
How the Captain's Challenge will work:
- Can only be used to challenge a try or no-try ruling
- Captains will have 20 seconds following a try/no-try decision to challenge the decision.
- No replays either at normal speed or in slow motion, will be shown on a big screen at the ground until the time allowed for requesting of a captain's challenge has elapsed.
- A captain may request a review of any try/point-scoring decision made by an on-field official in relation to: groundings, knock-ons, obstruction, double movement, offside, touchline /touch-in-goal/dead-in-goal, tackle in the air, steals involving two or more defenders, foul play, as well as goals and field goals.
Mass Effect: Andromeda Patch – Animations, Romance, and Character Creation Changes Inbound
Mass Effect: Andromeda has been out for a couple weeks and players have spent countless hours exploring the vast galaxy. However, there have been bugs along the way, which can be expected of any newly released title. There is no need to fear, though, as BioWare has just detailed a new patch that will go live on April 6. The update will be tackling some of the issues that have plagued players' experiences, such as animations, character creation, and even romance options. Here is the list of what Andromeda Patch 1.05 will be fixing:
Improved tutorial placement
Single player balance changes: Ammo crates, armor, weapons, nomad, profiles, attacks, and progression
Multiplayer balance changes: Weapons, cover, and enemies (check back for detailed notes on balance changes)
Added option to skip autopilot sequences in the galaxy map
Improved logic, timing, and continuity for relationships and story arcs
Improved lip-sync and facial acting during conversations, including localized VO
Fixed various collision issues
Fixed bugs where music or VO wouldn't play or wasn't correct
Fixed issue where global squad mate banter sometimes wasn't firing on UNCs
Fixed issue where player was unable to access the Remnant Console Interface after failing decryption multiple times
Fixed issue where fast travel is sometimes disabled after recruiting Drack until the player reloads a save
Fixed issue where Ryder can become stuck in the start of Biotic Charge Pose
Fix issues related to some saves
Fixed issue where objective sometimes becomes un-interactable for players in multiplayer
Streaming and stability improvements
It really seems that BioWare has been paying attention to fans' concerns, as is evident by the upcoming Andromeda patch. In fact, Aaryn Flynn even said, “Since launch, our team has been poring over your comments and feedback, looking to discover what you like about the game, as well as areas we can evolve or improve.” Flynn also mentioned that BioWare will be releasing an additional Andromeda patch(s) over the next two months that will cover other areas of concern. Here's that list:
More options and variety in the character creator
Improvements to hair and general appearance for characters
Ongoing improvements to cinematic scenes and animations
Improvements to male romance options for Scott Ryder
Adjustments to conversations with Hainly Abrams
Much like the Andromeda patch that will be released on April 6, the upcoming updates will also improve performance and stability. Flynn also spoke about the multiplayer aspect of the title, and that the team will “continue to build on the APEX missions.” Aaryn also mentioned that Patch 1.05 won't be the only thing being released on April 6:
We'll be adding new maps, characters, and weapons. On Thursday, we kick off the first of three new chapters centered around The Remnant Investigation.”
Everything Aaryn detailed can be found right here. Will the upcoming Andromeda patch solve a bulk of the issues players have experienced in the first two weeks?

New Democrat Leader Thomas Mulcair continues to ramp up his rhetoric against the Liberals — his main rivals for the support of Canadians desiring a change in government — and his frustration is now extending to Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne. “I respect Kathleen Wynne as the premier of Ontario. I just wish that people who keep trying to come up with excuses for the Liberals' opposition to things like child care would realize that you shouldn't be ransoming support for one political party on the backs of families who desperately need affordable child care,” Mulcair said Thursday in an interview with the Star.

“Here in Toronto, it's $2,000 a month for an infant in child care. That's $24,000 a year. We're proposing to lower that radically and I think that's something that most families want. I don't think they should be held to ransom. I just don't think they should be told, well, ‘you have to vote for Justin Trudeau', which means that you won't get your child care,” Mulcair said when asked about his relationship with Wynne, who has made no secret of her desire to see Trudeau be the one to move into 24 Sussex Drive. The New Democrats entered this long election campaign as unlikely front-runners, allowing Mulcair to make the argument to Canadians who desire change after nearly a decade under Conservative Leader Stephen Harper that they, and not the Liberals, have the most credible chance to defeat him Oct. 19. The public opinion polls have since challenged that narrative, as NDP support is sliding, even in their stronghold of Quebec, where the so-called Orange Wave swept them into Official Opposition status in 2011, and the Liberals are appearing to pick up the anti-Harper vote, especially in Ontario.

Mulcair dismissed a question asking him to assess what has gone wrong with his campaign. “The only party that is standing up for real change is the NDP. We have the confidence that we can replace Stephen Harper and start repairing the damage he has caused. Canadians have the confidence. They know we've got experience. We can do it. Watch us go,” he said.

The past few days have seen the reappearance of re-emergence of ‘Angry Tom' — he prefers the term ‘passionate', he said, while staffers referred to the ‘Harper Fighter' — as Mulcair promises to reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership over clauses affecting dairy farmers and auto manufacturers. And, on Thursday, Mulcair said he was “appalled” to read a report in a Toronto newspaper that indicated the Prime Minister's Office had earlier this year halted the processing of Syrian refugees. That passion was evident in the interview Thursday as Mulcair responded to questions about the tough slog he would face implementing his biggest campaign promise — one million child care spaces costing no more than $15 a day — as it relies on the provinces to kick in 40 per cent of the funding. “I think that Justin Trudeau believes that because the Liberals couldn't do it, it can't be done. So they spend their days trying to imagine scenarios where something might break down. I spend my days trying to think of all the good things we could do to help families, including affordable quality child care. I am going to maintain that optimism that we are going to get that result,” Mulcair said.

Mulcair also defended the NDP's decision to commit to running a balanced budget in its first year, and rejected the idea that he had accepted the premise, promoted by Conservatives, that not running a deficit is a litmus test for good governance, or, on the flip-side, that his platform is not as progressive as the deficit-financed one promoted by Trudeau. “Look at the NDP's tradition. Tommy Douglas brought in 17 balanced budgets in a row and was able, based on that rock-solid foundation, then to bring in quality, affordable, universal, public health care for everyone in Saskatchewan and it became the Canadian model,” Mulcair said. “We don't want a flash in the pan on child care. We want something that's solid, long-term and that will be there for years to come,” Mulcair said.
The midfielder will soon enter the final two years of his contract and, despite being a regular fixture in the Barça starting XI this season, could be on his way out of Camp Nou
VIEW FROM SPAIN
Pilar Suarez | Goal Spain
Cesc Fabregas would love to stay with his beloved Barcelona but the club's fans aren't as keen on the midfielder remaining at Camp Nou.
Under Tata Martino, Fabregas has become a key figure but the 51-year-old could leave the club at the end of the season after a potentially trophyless campaign.
Fabregas has a contract until June 2016 and there has been no suggestion of a new deal for the Spain international thus far, so this summer could present a good chance for Barça to cash in.
By Wayne Veysey | Chief Correspondent Barcelona are set to put Arsenal and Manchester United on alert by preparing to listen to offers this summer for Cesc Fabregas understands.The Barça academy graduate is at a crossroads in his career as he enters the final two years of his contract with the Catalan club in July.Fabregas was jeered by home supporters during Barcelona's recent 2-1 home victory over Athletic Bilbao and has become a scapegoat for fans during some troubled times for the club on and off the pitch.Goal has learned that the Spanish giants are now open to the possibility of selling the versatile midfielder, who turns 27 on Sunday, this summer.The player himself is also said to be ready to consider the possibility of being lured from the club to which he returned in 2011 after controversially leaving for Arsenal as a 16-year-old.Fabregas is likely to sit down for talks with senior Barcelona officials at the end of the season, when his future and the issue of whether or not he is to be offered a contract extension will be top of the agenda.The Spain international is on the radar of both United and Arsenal, where he spent eight highly successful years and finished up as club captain.Both Premier League clubs have been given informal indications that Fabregas could be available, although the player's lengthy association with Barcelona and the politics involved with him leaving would make a move extremely delicate.United tabled two bids for Fabregas last summer, when former manager David Moyes made no attempt to hide the club's attempt to prise him from Camp Nou.Arsenal also explored utilising the first-option clause inserted in Fabregas's Barça contract, with Arsene Wenger understood to have talked on the phone "quite a bit" with his former skipper about returning to the club where he blossomed into one of Europe's outstanding young midfielders.Arsenal has a fixed price on Fabregas's buy-back clause, believed to be €29 million (£23.8m at current currency rates), and, should another club make a concrete offer for the midfielder, Barça would be obliged to inform the Londoners, who would then be given first refusal.Only Sergio Busquets (43) has started more than Fabregas's 42 matches for Barcelona this season and his tally of 14 assists is the best at the club, while he has also weighed in with 13 goals.However, Fabregas has often found himself on the bench for the marquee matches during the last three seasons or withdrawn from the team when he starts the key games.Even though Xavi is 34 and Andre Iniesta turns 30 in June, Barça are ready to consider the possibility of Fabregas leaving as they step up plans to add more pace in their midfield.Barcelona were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of the Champions League, lost the Copa del Rey final to Real Madrid and currently sit second in La Liga, four points behind leaders Atletico Madrid with three matches remaining.
Press Release
Vienna, August 2nd 2017 – Noctua today presented three high-end heatsinks for the TR4 and SP3 sockets of AMD's latest Ryzen Threadripper (X399) and Epyc platforms. The new TR4-SP3 versions of the award-winning NH-U14S, NH-U12S and NH-U9 coolers are tailored custom models that feature a larger contact surface as well as a SecuFirm2™ mounting system for TR4/SP3. Supplied with Noctua's renowned NF-A15, NF-F12 and NF-A9 premium fans, the new coolers combine outstanding cooling performance with exceptional quietness of operation.
“A high-end platform usually calls for high-end cooling solutions and that's precisely the case with AMD's new Epyc and upcoming Ryzen Threadripper ecosystems”, explains Roland Mossig (Noctua CEO). “We have therefore customised our award-winning NH-U14S, NH-U12S and NH-U9 coolers so that users can enjoy the performance and quietness of these proven premium heatsinks on the new AMD platforms.”
At 70x56mm, the copper contact surface of the new TR4-SP3 coolers is more than double the size of the standard models. Tailored to fit the enormous integrated heat-spreaders (IHS) of AMD's TR4/SP3-based processors, this customised design allows for an optimal heat flow from the CPU over the base to the heatpipes and on to the cooling fins.
The coolers' SecuFirm2™ mounting system for TR4 and SP3 has been completely custom-designed for the new sockets and is particularly easy to install: put on the heatsink, fix the four spring-loaded screws and you're done! In order to ensure optimal compatibility with SLI and CrossFire multi-GPU setups, the new SecuFirm2™ mounting also makes it possible to offset the cooler by 3 or 6mm towards the upper edge of the motherboard, thereby increasing clearance of the top PCIe slot.
Coming in 140mm, 120mm and 92mm form factors, the three new coolers target specific application profiles. Whereas the 140mm size NH-U14S TR4-SP3 provides the highest level of cooling performance, which makes it ideal for top-end, enthusiast-grade TR4/SP3 systems, the 120mm size NH-U12S TR4-SP3 combines outstanding cooling performance with excellent compatibility: at 158mm height and 125mm width, it is short enough to fit most modern tower cases and stays clear of the top PCIe slot on most motherboards. Last but not least, the 92mm size NH-U9 TR4-SP3 provides 100% PCIe clearance and, at the same time, its height of only 125mm allows it to fit smaller cases and most 4U size rack-mount enclosures.
While the NH-U14S TR4-SP3 and NH-U12S TR4-SP3 are supplied with one of Noctua's premium-grade NF-A15 PWM and NF-F12 PWM fans respectively, the NH-U9 TR4-SP3 is equipped with two NF-A9 PWM 92mm fans. This push/pull dual fan configuration allows it to achieve a level of quiet cooling performance that is remarkable for such a compact cooler and comes close to the bigger NH-U12S TR4-SP3.
Topped off with Noctua's proven NT-H1 thermal compound and a full 6-year manufacturer's warranty, the NH-U14S TR4-SP3, NH-U12S TR4-SP3 and NH-U9 TR4-SP3 are complete premium-quality solutions that combine outstanding performance and superb acoustics for TR4 and SP3 based high-end systems.
Prices and availability
All three models will be shipping shortly and should start to appear in stores towards the end of August. The suggested retail prices are as follows:
NH-U14S TR4-SP3: EUR 79.90 / USD 79.90
NH-U12S TR4-SP3: EUR 69.90 / USD 69.90

Press Release
According to two reports, Georgia Tech has made its hire to replace special-teams coordinator Ray Rychleski. Ron West, formerly an assistant at Clemson, Illinois, Arizona State and most recently North Carolina, will help coach the offensive line, according to Jackets Online and Football Scoop.
Reached Sunday, coach Paul Johnson said by text message that he could not confirm nor deny the reports.
West has coached offense and defense over his 35-year coaching career. He was North Carolina's co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach in 2013-14, but was not retained when Gene Chizik was hired as defensive coordinator prior to the 2015 season. He previously coached with Tech linebackers coach Andy McCollum at Baylor 1994-96.
After Rychleski's departure, Johnson said that he would fill the sole vacancy on his staff with an offensive line coach rather than continue with a special-teams coach, which he had done for the past four seasons. Johnson said that the offensive line needed more than one coach.
Among West's tasks will be helping improve pass protection, which Johnson called his No. 1 priority going into spring practice.
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is called high-intensity for a reason: It's hard! “HIIT—any workout where you're alternating periods of intense work and less-intense work, or even complete rest—can be a fantastic method for burning fat, strengthening muscle, increasing your resting metabolic rate, and improving overall conditioning in less time than steady-state workouts,” says Adam Rosante, certified personal trainer and author of The 30-Second Body.
Just because you can get them over with faster doesn't mean you should be crushing HIIT workouts every day though. How often you work HIIT into your routine depends on your fitness goals, but Rosante recommends three to four days a week max, with a day or two of rest in between. “Depending on the type of HIIT you're doing, a day or two is often enough to allow your body's energy systems to recover and adapt to the training stimulus, allowing you to attack your next session, hard,” he explains.
And don't worry—just three days of HIIT a week is enough to burn serious fat, according to one study conducted by The University of Western Ontario. When participants did four to six 30-second treadmill sprints (resting for four to six minutes in between each sprint), they burned way more fat than another group of participants who slogged it out doing steady-state cardio for 30 to 60 minutes three times a week.
Not sure where to start? HIIT can really be applied to most workouts. “A great way for beginners to incorporate HIIT is to pick an exercise you're familiar with—running, cycling and swimming are great examples—and alternate between 30-second bursts of intense work, where you're working at your maximum capacity, then backing off to a moderate or even resting pace for 30 seconds,” says Rosante. “Alternate between that 30 seconds of work/30 seconds of rest combo for 15 to 35 minutes.” (Dance your way fit with High-Intensity Dance Cardio, the first-ever socanomics DVD!)
Find out why you should try interval running:
But if you're not familiar with a certain exercises—say, strength training—don't jump right in and start applying HIIT to those workouts. “You don't want to apply intensity to something you're not good at,” says Rosante. “Focus on learning the exercises with great form at a moderate tempo first, then add intensity.”
Whatever your exercise of choice, remember that half of HIIT stands for high-intensity. “You have to really push to your max during the intense intervals,” says Rosante. “Half-hearted efforts won't produce the same results as giving it your all.” When it comes to HIIT, less truly is more—you want to feel like you literally could not do another minute when your HIIT session is over; if you feel like you could keep going, well, you probably weren't pushing yourself enough.
The plus side is if you're only doing 30 second sprints versus 30 consecutive minutes on the treadmill for example, 30 seconds of high-intensity is a lot easier to maintain than 30 minutes—even if you're doing it over and over again.
Speaking of things that sent my Twitter feed into a frenzy of conservative "Tu quoquing", earlier in the week the Daily Caller found an interesting way to settle the ongoing debate about the demographics of Occupy Wall Street: they looked up the addresses of people who had been arrested in conjunction with the New York protest. It turns out that these houses are relatively pricey:
Among addresses for which information is available, single-family homes listed on those police intake forms have a median value of $305,000 -- a far higher number than the $185,400 median value of owner-occupied housing units in the United States.
Some of the homes where "Occupy" arrestees reside, viewed through Google Maps and the Multiple Listing Service real estate database, are the definition of opulence.
Using county assessors and online resources such as Zillow.com, TheDC estimated property values and rents for 87 percent of the homes and 59 percent of the apartments listed in the arrest records.
Even in the nation's currently depressed housing market, at least 95 of the protesters' residences are worth approximately $500,000 or more. (RELATED SLIDESHOW: Opulent homes of the '99 percent')
The median monthly rent for those living in apartments whose information is readily available is $1,850. My initial reaction was the same as many people I've seen in comments sections: the protest is in New York, which is expensive. This is hardly surprising. My initial reaction was the same as many people I've seen in comments sections: the protest is in New York, which is expensive. This is hardly surprising.
But on second thought, I don't think that's quite right. At least some of the houses identified by the Daily Caller are in places like Texas and Wisconsin. But more importantly, I'm not sure we should "discount" these home values for location. The fact is that living in an expensive city is a consumption choice.
You hear this argument all the time from people in New York. "Rich? Hah! We've got four people in 1600 square feet, and our school bills are going to put us into bankruptcy." Many New Yorkers believe that they should be given some sort of income tax abatement because of the expense of living there (with the lost revenue being made up from "really rich" people, natch). Slightly less affluent New Yorkers frequently believe that landlords should be forced to offer them "reasonably sized" apartments at a modest fraction of their income, because after all, otherwise they couldn't afford to live in New York.
Don't think this is necessarily ideological--the fact is that in thirty-five years of New York, I'm not sure I heard anyone admit to being rich. Even people with eight-digit wealth routinely refer to themselves as "middle class". As a friend used to mutter when he heard this, "middle of what?"
There's a sort of irritating supposition in all of this that living in New York (or San Francisco, or Boston) is something that just happens to you, like getting cholera. And that therefore high incomes, expensive real estate, and so forth, somehow don't count for the purposes of assessing how well off you are relative to the rest of society. In fact, perhaps society should get busy making it up to you for all the hardships.
Perhaps we should offer such a perceptual discount to the small number of people who really couldn't make anything like their current incomes in any other place--investment bankers, some securities lawyers, a handful of entertainers and creative types. But in most cases, this is ludicrous. For starters, not everything costs more--online purchases, to name just one obvious example.
But more to the point, if you own a $795,000 one-bedroom apartment that you are eventually likely to pay off, you own a very expensive asset far beyond what most ordinary Americans could ever hope to accumulate. You can sell that place and move to a red state and live very well, any time you want. Most red-staters can't do the reverse.
After all, to state the obvious, that apartment costs so much because many, many people want to live in New York. And no matter what the song told you, it is not actually true that all of the best things in life are free. Living a subway ride away from all that New York has to offer is really great, and also, really pricey. Which is one reason that I don't live there any more.
Living in a blue state is a choice. If coming to New York meant that you had to put four people in a three-bedroom apartment that's uncomfortably far from a subway line, instead of buying a nice little condo in Omaha, this does not mean that you are not "really" better off than your counterpart in Omaha; it means that you have chosen to consume your extra wealth in the form of "living in New York" rather than in the form of spacious real estate, cheap groceries, and an easy commute.
So yes, the people at those protests--at least the ones who get arrested--really are, on average, unusually affluent. (Or at least, their parents are). Whether that matters are a different question I won't opine on.
Dean Lombardi might be a fine choice for the Sabres, either as a president of hockey operations or the general manger to replace Tim Murray. He's closely tied in with USA Hockey, just like the Sabres are now with advent of HarborCenter. And it's hard to ignore his two Stanley Cups in Los Angeles.
But in the wake of sweeping Murray and Dan Bylsma out the door, what Terry Pegula needs to do is look for the red flags. Too often in the past, the Sabres have ignored them. There's plenty of them around Lombardi that make the 59-year-old far from an automatic choice even though he's perceived to be the quick frontrunner because of his experience
The Kings' two Cups were a result of great goaltending from Jonathan Quick and a bruising style of play that was perfect for the playoffs but would not work in the regular season. And it's quickly gone out of favor in a league built on youth and speed. Would Lombardi be able to adapt?
The Kings, remember, were only third in the Pacific in both Cup years and won in 2012 as a No. 8 seed. They won one or more playoff series in only three times in Lombardi's 11 seasons; three other times, they were first-round losers. After winning their second Cup in 2014, the Kings missed the playoffs in 2015 and this spring. They were knocked out in five games by the Sharks last year. So one playoff win in three years got both Lombardi and coach Darryl Sutter their exit papers.
Lombardi fired Bylsma assistant Terry Murray midway through the 2011-12 season and recycled Sutter from their time together in San Jose. Sutter would not be the kind of coach the Sabres would want while trying to build a team around Jack Eichel. If players in that room had problems with Bylsma, how would they handle Sutter?
Sutter has coached in Chicago, San Jose, Calgary and Los Angeles. He was out of the game for five years after the Flames fired him in 2006 and there's plenty of chatter he simply wants to ride off into the sunset of the family Alberta farm. I'm not hiring a 58-year-old coach for the Sabres who would clearly be in the sunset of his career. If Lombardi wants to come here and push Sutter as a package deal, Pegula should run away.
If Lombardi is willing to come unhitched from Sutter, the conversation can continue but Pegula better ask some tough questions about Lombardi's butchering of the salary cap in his time in Los Angeles. Because the new executive branch in Buffalo is going to have a hard time undoing some of Murray's handiwork.
The Kings were completely hamstrung by Lombardi's deals. Anze Kopitar got an eight-year, $80 million contract -- which has a $10 million cap hit through 2024. He hasn't been a 30-goal man since 2010 and had just 12 goals and 52 points this season. You can talk all the Selke Trophy nods you want but that's a bad contract for those numbers. Far too similar to what Murray gave Ryan O'Reilly.
There's plenty more where that came from. Ten years and $58 million for Quick, running through 2023 when he will be 37. Seven years and $34.1 million for Marian Gaborik through age 39. And the ultimate albatross: Eight years and $47 million to Dustin Brown through 2022 and age 37. Brown has averaged 13 goals and 29.5 points over the last four years. Ouch.
And let's not forget that it was Lombardi who butchered the United States entry for the World Cup of Hockey. He chose the likes of Justin Abdelkader, Blake Wheeler and Brandon Dubinsky while leaving off names like Phil Kessel, Tyler Johnson, Kyle Okposo, Kevin Shattenkirk and Cam Fowler. Seriously.
The World Cup is not the NHL but it speaks to Lombardi's mentality. Sure sounds like dinosaur potential here. Pegula should darn well discuss what went wrong in this tournament before he hands over his keys to Lombardi.
Pegula said he wanted an experienced executive to replace Murray and it makes sense you would go that route after the first-time GM didn't work out as you hoped. But this organization better do its homework here. Plenty of Canadian media types quickly floated Lombardi's name when the Sabres fired Murray. My response: Not so fast.
Wrap on Bylsma and Murray
Bylsma and Murray can both sit around and make plenty of Pegula's money but you would imagine each man will have plenty of fires to rekindle in the wake of what happened in Buffalo. It will be interesting to see how the rest of the league views their time here: Underachieving and not worthy of another chance, or no chance because of organizational dysfunction?
Bylsma obviously has a good resume from his time in Pittsburgh and can also point to the Sabres' 27-point improvement last season as notches on his resume. Certainly, his clear issues with star players and dubious run with Team USA in the Sochi Olympics won't cast him in a favorable light.
His only chance at a head coaching job for now would seem to be in Los Angeles, since he was a teammate for two years with new Kings GM and Hall of Fame defenseman Rob Blake when both were at Bowling Green. But the Kings seem focused on associate coach John Stevens to replace Sutter. The Florida Panthers were interested in Bylsma two years ago but have much of their attention on University of Denver coach Jim Montgomery.
Bylsma may have to go for an assistant's job, in a role much like Terry Murray served for the Sabres the last two years, or lay in wait during the season as a replacement for a fired coach.
Murray's run of rough moves make him far more likely to be someone's scouting director than a GM again. Murray is a rinkrat. He loves watching junior and college games and thrived on that during the tank years here. But once the bulk of the Sabres' key young talent was acquired, Murray didn't get the chance to go to nearly as many amateur games as he wanted to because the NHL games suddenly became the focus. It didn't seem like being the GM was much fun for him at that point. It will be interesting to see what becomes of him going forward.
It should be noted publicly in this space that both Bylsma and Murray were solid in their dealings with the media. Neither has spoken publicly, and the Pegulas' infamous non-disclosure agreements may keep things that way going forward.
Murray simply responded "thanks" in response to a text from this corner asking for comment and wishing him well. Late Friday night, Bylsma sent a gracious response back also declining comment and accepting the well wishes. Nothing about their dismissals.
Tough time for Hawks
It's going to be an interesting offseason in Chicago, where the Blackhawks piled up 109 points and a No. 1 seed in the West but very much looked the part of the league's oldest team in getting swept by the Predators. Thursday's 4-1 defeat marked the Hawks' second straight first-round exit and the first sweep against them since 1993.
“It was a major disappointment across the board,” said coach Joel Quenneville, who made it clear the playoff flameout nullifies his team's 50 regular-season wins.
Chicago reporters said GM Stan Bowman was flat-out angry when he met the media Saturday morning.
"We did not even come close to reaching the standard we have set. And that's unacceptable," Bowman said. "Not close to good enough.... Joel is our head coach. He will continue to be our head coach. And Joel and I will work together to make sure this never happens again"
Here is #Blackhawks GM Stan Bowman's complete opening statement this morning: pic.twitter.com/fd4q7mOo63 — Mark Lazerus (@MarkLazerus) April 22, 2017
“We probably all thought it was going to go a different way, especially with the regular season,” added South Buffalo native Patrick Kane. “Coming into the playoffs, we felt pretty confident. So yeah. Disappointing. Shocked. I don't know. It's going to be a long summer for sure. ... To score three goals in four games, I mean, there's no way you're going to win doing that."
The Hawks clearly had their foot off the gas at the end of the season and never got their engine revved back up. They finished 0-2-2 -- meaning they went winless their last eight times on the ice. Their defense is aging and Bowman has the same problem Lombardi has with the cap.
It's an even bigger issue next season with Artemi Panarin's deal kicking in at a $6 million hit. The Kings and Blackhawks alternated Cups for four straight years from 2012-2015 and knocked out the other in the West final in 2013 and 2014. Only those losses prevented a dynastic run by one or the other. Neither has won a series since their last cup (LA in 2014, Chicago in '15). It just shows you how tough it is to keep things together in a cap world.
Around the boards
---Minnesota coach Bruce Boudreau got testy with reporters as his team fell into a 3-0 hole against St. Louis and he probably had a point. The Blues' 3-1 series lead heading into Game Five Saturday was mostly about goaltender Jake Allen and not about the Wild's play.
The Wild took 61.1 percent of the shot attempts at even strength over the first four games and were by far the best Corsi team but had nothing to show for it. The actual shots on goal through four games were 145-107 -- including 125-80 at even strength. Allen had a 1.07 goals-against average and .966 save percentage in the four games while Minnesota counterpart Devan Dubynk was hardly a slouch at 1.42/.943.
---"See you in a couple days": Leafs coach Mike Babcock, to service-level staffers in Washington's Verizon Center as he walked to the team bus after Toronto lost Game Five in overtime Friday night. The Leafs try to even the series in Game Six Sunday in Air Canada Centre.
---Speaking of Babcock, the Leafs' four OT games against the Capitals are their most in any series since the 1951 Stanley Cup final, when they posted a five-game victory over Montreal as every game went into extra time. It ended on the Cup-winning goal by defenseman Bill Barilko, who was killed in a plane crash that summer.
---We entered Saturday with 15 overtime games in the first round and a lot of hockey left to be played. According to Elias Sports, the record for first-round OT since the playoffs were expanded to 16 teams in 1980 is 17 games, set in 2013. We're likely to fly by that.
This game comes from the minds of Ex-Ubisoft Devs. It's an Action Online RPG with Fighting game elements. From what I've gathered in the trailer, the combat is going to involve a lot of timing. Feints will be thrown, followed by some punishing combinations. Similar to a lot of the fighting games we today. The game's camera angle is different from your traditional fighter, which I think is great because it gives it a more close up hand-to-hand combat feeling.
In the trailer not only do we see hand-to-hand combat, but we also see the materialization of weapons and magic. That raises the question of whether or not the combos will be intertwined with the melee combat. In between all the action, I noticed that the characters had similar Kung Fu/ Wastelander style regarding clothing. I also noticed that the melee weapons varied from swords, and knives to staffs.
I think this level of detail will allow players to develop their identities in-game. The more face you cave in, the more people know to watch out for the guy with the straw hat and staff. The world's art style also looks amazing. I'm not sure if this will be more of an Action MMO, where players will be able to traverse a map and run into confrontation or if you will be like more of traditional fighter where players load into a stage. I would love option number one, but we'll have to wait for more information.
Something that's needed for any online game in today's gaming is the ability to play with your friends. By the looks of it, the game will include team combat, where you and your squad can face off against another. How will this play out? I have no clue. I can only imagine that players will start off fighting one on one, but once they've gotten rid of their opponent, they would help their friend. Then that would to a two versus one fight which sparks the question, will there be mechanics that allow a player to handle fighting two people like we would see in a Kung Fu movie? So many questions to be answered, but for now enjoy this trailer!
All clothing Prada.
"I… don't… know," Kendrick Lamar says when asked to explain why Donald Trump became President of the United States. Few people understand America the way Kendrick does, so surely he must know something about how the billionaire reality TV star has happened to his country. He's sitting in a little dark gray room backstage at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on a Sunday afternoon. It's just a few hours before his show. He's in silver Nike Air Maxs and a maroon sweatsuit, top and bottom, with the TDE logo. That's Top Dawg Entertainment, Lamar's label. He's calm and softly spoken and radiates intensity because his words are well chosen and carry weight. Kendrick isn't voluble but he is deep. He's perceptive, wise, and quite often brilliant, so like many Americans, when it comes to Trump he's still in shock. "We all are baffled," he says. "It is something that completely disregards our moral compass." The shift is almost tangible for Kendrick because Obama is not just a president he respected and admired, he's also a friend who loves his music and invited him to the White House.
"I was talking to Obama," he says, "and the craziest thing he said was, 'Wow, how did we both get here?' Blew my mind away. I mean, it's just a surreal moment when you have two black individuals, knowledgeable individuals, but who also come from these backgrounds where they say we'll never touch ground inside these floors." A pause. He briefly recalls his grandmother, who died when Kendrick was a teenager; how incredible she might have found this, a black man in office, talking to her grandson. "That's what blows me up. Being in there and talking to him and seeing the type of intelligence that he has and the influence that he has, not only on me, but on my community. It just always takes me back to the idea of how far we have come along with this idea about how [much] further we can go. Just him being in office sparks the idea that us as a people, we can do anything that we want to do. And we have smarts and the brains and the intelligence to do it."
Both Barack and Kendrick came from nothing and ascended to legendary status on the strength of their words and their gifts for oration. They sat and talked in the Oval Office about the improbability of their lives – how did we both get here? And now, as far as the White House is concerned, both are all but considered enemies of the state. "It's a complete mindfuck," Lamar says of going from visiting the White House to feeling hated by it.
"The key differences [between Obama and Trump] are morals, dignity, principles, common sense," he says. Where Obama was an inspiration, it's hard for him to even respect Trump. "How can you follow someone who doesn't know how to approach someone or speak to them kindly and with compassion and sensitivity?" But ultimately the rise of Trump has brought out something new in Kendrick. "It's just building up the fire in me. It builds the fire for me to keep pushing as hard as I want to push."
The fire inside must be blazing right now because Kendrick's newest release, Damn, his fourth studio album, is both a commercial and critical smash. It's sold over two million copies and has every review writer struggling to outdo the praise showered by all those who superpraised Kendrick before them. Pitchfork's review calls Damn, "a widescreen masterpiece of rap, full of expensive beats, furious rhymes, and peerless storytelling about Kendrick's destiny in America." Lamar's vision for Damn meant asking his producers, "'What can we do to make it live in another space and be ourselves, but also challenge ourselves?' As far as the sonics of the album, we wanted to make it where it was really back to the future, something you've never heard before, but something you've heard before. If that makes sense." At this point the hip-hop universe seems to be unanimous in its belief that the greatest MC in the world right now is Kendrick Lamar. He could win a battle against most underground MCs and he could outsell most pop rappers. He is the undisputed current king of hip-hop.
Kendrick lives a life that befits the king of hip-hop, if you think what truly befits the king of hip-hop is to basically live in the studio looking for the perfect beat and the ultimate rhyme. "I can sometimes cut the whole world off to write a verse that is perfect to me," he says. "I could be in the studio all day and turn the phone off and completely zone out, because I feel like this was what I was chosen to do. And I can't let anyone get in between that." Unlike many MCs, when Kendrick creates, he's not high. "I want to make the music in the most sober mind as possible, that way I know it's me making it, not just the liquor!" If hip-hop is a game, Kendrick wants to win. "Hip-hop plays two ways in my head. It plays as a contact sport, and also as something that you connect to – songwriting. Growing up and listening to battles between Nas and Jay-Z, that's the sport for me. That's where it can get funky, that's where I can say whatever I want, however I want, whenever I want. Then there's the other side, which is showing something that people can actually relate to, and connect with. I have that competitive nature, and I also have the compassion to talk about something that's real."
"Hip-hop plays two ways in my head. It plays as a contact sport, and also as something that you connect to – songwriting. Growing up and listening to battles between Nas and Jay-Z, that's the sport for me."
Asked if he's written the perfect rhyme yet, Kendrick decides the album's 12th song, Fear, contains the best verses he's ever written. "It's completely honest," he says. "The first verse is everything that I feared from the time that I was seven years old. The second verse I was 17, in the third it's everything I feared when I was 27. These verses are completely honest." He got to that honesty through years of work with a studio family that helped keep the king humble. "Everything you write is not dope," he says. "Even if you're a great writer, a bunch of the stuff you write is wack. But most people don't have somebody around to be like, 'That's wack.'" Kendrick has friends who are empowered to tell him what's not working and he says that has made a huge difference. "I've been in that studio writing terrible verses, writing terrible hooks, with homeboys and friends and people that you trust telling you, 'That's garbage.' I grew thick skin and got back in there and did it all over again. And then you eventually grow an ability to know when something is too far. I learned how to challenge myself to take it to the next level."
But for Kendrick to reach his throne he's had to do much more than learn how to rhyme. He grew up in Compton, California, a rough place that has sucked up many souls, a place where gangs, killers, and dead bodies littered Rosecrans Avenue, where he lived until relatively recently. Music wasn't just an outlet, he needed it to save his spirit. He grew up obsessed with Snoop, Dre, Pac, Public Enemy, KRS-One, Rakim, Jay-Z, and Kanye, as well as Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Prince, Marvin Gaye, the Isley Brothers, Luther Vandross, and Malcolm X. "His ideas rooted my approach to music," he says. Reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X as a teenager contributed to shaping Kendrick as an artist. "That was the first idea that inspired how I was going to approach my music. From the simple idea of wanting to better myself by being in this mind-state, [the] same way Malcolm was." Without music to give him purpose, he might have grown lost. "We used to have these successful people come around and tell us what's good and what's bad in the world, but from our perspective it didn't mean shit to us, because you're telling us all these positive things but when we walk outside and see somebody's head get blown off, whatever you just said went out the window. And it just chips away at the confidence. It makes you feel belittled in the world. The more violence you're exposed to as a kid, the more it chips away at you. For the most part, the kids that I was around, it broke them. It broke them to say, 'Fuck everything, I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do to survive.'" How did Kendrick escape falling into that? "Before I let it chip away at me 100%, I was making my transition into music."
Later that night, at Brooklyn's Barclays Center, Lamar comes up from under the floor to a screaming, sold out crowd. He's wearing a yellow tracksuit with black trim, recalling Bruce Lee in Game of Death, and he commands the stage, working alone for most of the show and dominating the arena. His small body exudes power as he moves about the stage. Like Rakim and Nas before him, he doesn't dance and he's as serious as a heart attack. The crowd can't take their eyes off of him. In between songs, Lamar is on the big screen in clips from The Legend of Kung Fu Kenny, a little film he made, inspired by 70s kung fu flicks. In it, Lamar gets to look like he's in a kung fu movie, but this is not costume play, it gets at the core of who he is. In those movies there was often an obsession with acquiring skill and showing off mastery and an internal battle to excel. That's who Kendrick is as an artist – he's focused on polishing his skills and displaying his mastery and pushing himself to greatness. Asked about his favorite words, besides "perspective" Lamar says, "discipline." "I love that word," he says, "because it shows who you really are. There are so many vices in the world, especially being in the entertainment business. You're exposed to so much at any given time. Whatever you need is right there in your face. But how much discipline do you have when the camera's off, when the light's off? That inspires me. How to restrain that. And that shows who you really are. To control yourself, that is the ultimate power."
Kendrick is learning more and more about how to control himself, partly through daily meditation sessions each morning. "I need 30 minutes a day of just reflecting on the moment," he says. "When you're in this business, everything is," he snaps his fingers. "Years go by so quick, because you're working and you're also planning for more work within the next six months to a year. So for me, I just have to sit down and reflect on what's going on in these 30 minutes." His meditation practice helps him gain perspective, which he says is his, "number one favorite word".
"I'm a human being, I'm a person, I have family, I have my own personal problems. But I have to give to the world. That's my responsibility. It's not just a job or entertainment for me; this is what I have to offer to the world."
But Kendrick still lives in Trump's America, where racism is becoming more overt, more prevalent, and more violent. Some in the resistance have adopted To Pimp A Butterfly's " Alright" as an anthem and he knows the power that song has. "I'd say that's one of my greatest records because it gave these kids an actual voice and an actual practice to go out there and make a difference. They're going out and they're walking the walk and talking the talk whether it's inside their communities, whether it's inside their juvenile systems. They wanna make change." Is there a sense of accountability in some way; does Kendrick carry the weight of the community on his shoulders? "It's definitely a responsibility," he acknowledges. "I'm still a human being, I'm still a person, I still have family, I still have my own personal problems. But I have to give to the world. I think that's my responsibility, [to learn] from my mistakes [and to spread] the knowledge that I have, the wisdom that I have. It's not just a job or entertainment for me, this is what I have to offer to the world."
As well as his impact on global pop culture, Kendrick's local community is also benefitting from his success; he has helped dozens of his peers find jobs that aren't just "making money" but "earning a living". "You put YMCAs inside your community and you give a job to these cats that can't be hired anywhere else. You make the opportunities, and that's what I'm doing personally. Because once I put the power in their hands, they can put it in the next. People can't believe that it can change that way. But it has to start with one." Dr. Dre and Venus and Serena Williams are also active in the city of Compton, while its female mayor, 35-year-old Aja Brown, is effecting real change. "This generation has opportunities that my generation didn't have," he notes, adding that to be present in these communities holds true power. It's not enough to merely donate or write powerful songs or tweet messages of positivity; you must show and prove. "There's a lot of people that are scared of their own people, the gang culture that is still there, but you can't be scared. You gotta be there, because it shows confidence not only in yourself but in those in the neighbourhood. People want a reason to hate you. Don't give them that reason. What's going on now is that transformation of us not being scared of where we come from. And that idea is gonna get passed on."
Lots of people want change but how does true structural revolution happen? Is " Alright" just a song or is there something more behind it? Lamar promises that we gonna be alright, but how? How do we get to actually being alright in such a crazy nation? "I always go back to the community," Lamar says. "Simple as that. Because I see these kids growing up without a father and they don't have this confidence of knowing that they're better than the environment that they're in. So getting to alright is just installing confidence in them. To let them know that I come from where you come from, and you can ultimately make a change." Kendrick Lamar knows that he is an artist who has the power to change the world and he's working on trying to do just that. "When I'm gone," he says, "I can rest peacefully knowing that I contributed to the evolution of this right here, the mind."

PS4 Exclusive Dissidia Final Fantasy NT Gets New Videos Showing Story; Core Battle Mode Announced
Giuseppe Nelva October 24, 2017 10:31:05 AM EST
Square Enix showcased new footage and info about Dissidia Final Fantasy NT for PS4, including story cutscenes and the announcement of the Core Battle mode.
Today Square Enix hosted a livestream from Tokyo featuring the upcoming Dissidia Final Fantasy NT for PS4.
Director Takeo Kujiraoka and Producer Ichiro Hazama were among the hosts, and Yoshinori Kitase also joined to talk about the game's story.
Like in previous games of the series we had Cosmos and Chaos, the story of Dissidia Final Fantasy NT sees deities struggle by pitching warriors summoned from different dimensions against each other.
While the game doesn't have a traditional “story mode,” it does include story and event cutscenes between battles. We get to see a few brief videos showing examples of that.
After that, we get to see gameplay from the Arcade Mode, showing the characters that have been announced so far in action. More gameplay further into the stream shows Brave Attacks and more.
A new mode was also announced, named “Core Battle.” We get to see how it works (in the second clip). It's pretty much exactly what it says on the tin, a pitched fight in which teams have to attack the enemy crystal core and defend their own.
Lastly, we get to see two UI modes that you can select, Arcade and Normal. You can see the difference in the picture at the bottom of the post. The original Arcade version is on the left, while the much simplified Normal version is on the right.
You can watch all the footage below. If you want to read more, you can also check out our recent interview with Kujiraoka-san and Hazama-san. You can also enjoy the latest trailer featuring villain Cloud of Darkness from Final Fantasy III.
Dissidia Final Fantasy NT will release in North America and Europe on January 30th, 2018 exclusively for PS4.
A crowd of around 200 illegal migrants from Africa stormed Alfortville town hall on Tuesday morning, demanding the government relax criteria for regularisation and give them residence papers.
Illegal migrants occupied the town hall for about an hour, frightening members of the public in the building as well as staff who had to retreat to their offices.
The migrants, who work at Rungis International Market, the world's largest wholesale food market, began piling into the town hall at around 8.30 am, but staff didn't notice their arrival until it was “too late”, according to Le Parisien.
When officers arrived to break up the protest and evacuate the town hall, they were forced to use tear gas as a group of around forty illegal immigrants were blocking access to the building. Le Parisien reports that following clashes, 14 people received medical treatment with three hospitalised.
“This illegal occupation prevented Alfortvillians from accessing public services throughout the morning, and caused anxiety among town hall staff and families who were already present in the building,” the commune's Socialist mayor Luc Carvounas said in a statement.
“Although staff received the men, and listened to their demands, the members of the collective did not wish to enter into any dialogue, instead contenting themselves with denouncing government policy.”
Suggesting the protest was linked to the far left, the mayor denounced the action as having been “exploitation of human misery for political purposes”.
Carvounas argued that it is unreasonable for far left groups to target his town hall, “since, in October 2015, Alfortville was one of the first communes in France to declare itself in favour of welcoming migrants”.

So you're vacationing in Europe... And itching to get arrested? Hit with a hefty fine? Yeah, we didn't think so. Nonetheless, weird laws abound here, as elsewhere. In fact, committing an illegal activity in the EU might be as simple as wearing high heels at the wrong place or smooching your honey while waiting for the train (get a room!). To help you keep your crazy lawbreaking to a minimum--or simply avoid looking like a total newbie--we've compiled this cautionary list. Call it what not to do on your European vacay:
Running out of fuel is verboten.
1. Run out of gas on the German autobahn
Driving on a highway in Germany? Better fill 'er up. As if it weren't annoying enough to deal with the repercussions of an empty fuel tank--including smugness from the passenger seat: "See, I told you to pull over 10 kilometers ago!"--running out of gas on the autobahn means you're also breaking the law...breaking the law (insert Judas Priest guitar riff here).
Never on Sunday.
2. Hang clothes out to dry on a Sunday in Switzerland
Ah, Switzerland: Land of snow-capped peaks, magnificent wildflower meadows and...So. Many. Rules. Like, you know, not drying your laundry outside on a Sunday. Online mag Newly Swissed put it (cheekily) this way: "Because who wants to see your white socks waving in the wind during their Sunday stroll?"
Break it up, break it up.
3. Kiss on train platforms in France
You're not starring in a French New Wave film. The world is not in black and white. And there's no quirky voice-over narration rhapsodizing on the beauty and melancholy of your every move. But, hey, if you find yourself in France and you want to give your boo a quick kiss before he/she boards a train at the Gare du Nord, we doubt you'll face much of a penalty--even though, by some accounts, a 1910 ban on kissing on train platforms (to help prevent rail delays) is still on the books.
Clearly not a toilet, people.
4. Urinate in a canal in the Netherlands (unless you're pregnant)
Sorry if you've had one too many, fellas, and can't find a public WC in Amsterdam -- or don't have enough euro to pay to use one: You'll be slapped with a fine if you're caught urinating into a canal. Let's keep it classy and let only the pregnant women relieve themselves there, mmmkay? (In all seriousness, several people die per year attempting to pee into an Amsterdam canal while inebriated. So literally: let's not go there!)
Just don't.
5. While you're at it, don't pee in the ocean while in Portugal
It's illegal, see. Not sure if anyone in Portugal has ever actually been busted for this, though. I mean, the ocean's pretty big.
Not in Italy, guys.
6. Wear a skirt in Italy if you're a man
Attention, Scotsmen and any guys who like to don the occasional skirt: If you're wearing one in public in Italy, you can be arrested. Way to put a damper on self-expression, Italy! (Not that we recommend you skirt around the law.)
These ladies got the memo.
7. Wear stilettos while visiting Greek monuments
Ladies: Your six-inch Louboutins are wounding the ancient monuments. Given Greece's crazy-amazing and crazy-old archaeological sites, this is a big deal. Which is why at many of these landmarks, heels are banned. Why not slip on some more marble-friendly sandals or tennis shoes for your tour of the Odeon?
So, what can you do legally in Europe, if anything?!
Nope, nothing illegal to see here.
8. Murder someone with the ancient city walls of York, Scotland--but only if carrying a bow and arrow
This archaic law is allegedly still on the books, though fortunately, no one has gone all Katniss Everdeen and taken advantage of it. But maybe don't make it the aim of your Scottish vacation?
THE Huon Valley's popular fishing spot Eggs and Bacon Bay has had its name for 140 years, but an international animal rights group now reckons the moniker is unsavoury.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has called on the Huon Valley Council to change the name of Eggs and Bacon Bay to a vegan alternative.
The group has proposed Apple and Cherry Bay – to promote the region's local agriculture industry – as a suitable replacement.
What are your thoughts? Join the debate below or on our Facebook page.
PETA Australia campaign director Ashley Fruno said the group hoped the change would highlight the need to keep animal-derived foods off the plates of Huon Valley residents.
“Considering the high levels of cholesterol and saturated fat in both eggs and bacon, the area may as well be called ‘Heart Attack Bay',” she said.
“The Huon Valley is famous for its delectable apples and cherries, so we are asking the council ‘WTF?' – that's ‘Where's The Fruit?' – in the hope that it will apply to change the name.”
Huon Valley residents may even receive vegan apple pies if the name change is adopted.
In a letter to Huon Valley Mayor Peter Coad, Ms Fruno wrote that Tasmania had the highest rate of lap-band surgery in Australia, and 93 per cent of people did not eat enough fruit and vegetables.
“Reminding residents to stay away from cholesterol and fat-laden bacon and eggs and instead to eat the fresh plant produce of the Huon Valley might be just what the doctor ordered,” she wrote.
Cr Coad said the council would need to consider the merits of the proposal and conduct community consultation before moving forward with any name change.

“It's certainly unique. It is a well-established name – Eggs and Bacon Bay – and any changes need to be considered with community in mind.”
The State Government's place names database lists the name Eggs and Bacon Bay as originating either from Lady Jane Franklin ordering or being served eggs and bacon near Franklin, or from Sir John Franklin noticing Eggs and Bacon flowers in the area.
A “Save Eggs and Bacon Bay” Facebook page has been set up since news of the proposed change broke.
PETA wrote to the mayor of San Francisco in 2011 to call for the Tenderloin District to be renamed the Tempeh District.
Mayor Ed Lee's response to that request? A very meaty “no thanks”.
Isaac Hayden says no player can rest on his laurels at Newcastle United.
Championship-leading Newcastle – who take on Blackburn Rovers at St James's Park on Saturday – have won their last nine games in all competitions.
Rafa Benitez's side beat Leeds United on Sunday to go five points clear at the top of the division.
United manager Benitez does not tell his players the team until an hour and a half before kick-off time.
And midfielder Hayden – who has impressed since joining the club from Arsenal in the summer – feels that ensures that “keeps everyone on their toes” day in, day out at the club's training ground as they prepare for each game.
“It's the best way for me,” said the England Under-21 international.
“It keeps everyone on their toes. Nobody's certain of anything and nobody can rest on their laurels when it comes to training. For me, it helps the group.
“Others might have a different opinion and prefer to know the day before or two days before.
“But, for me, I always give 100% in every training session. I always want to do well and improve.
“If that means I'm starting, then I'm starting. If not, I'll still go out with the same mentality.”
Newcastle takes on Hayden's former loan club Hull City in an EFL Cup quarter-final at the KCOM Stadium on November 29.
Hayden, 21, helped the club win promotion to the Premier League last season.
Since contactless payments were first accepted on London buses a few years ago, it's become increasingly easy to get around the capital without cash or a loaded Oyster card. Whether you're equipped with a contactless card, Apple Pay or another mobile wallet, you can ride the vast majority of London transport services hassle-free. And as of today, you can now use contactless payments on the Emirates Air Line cable car, too. Sure, it's a limited service that only travels between the Royal Docks and the Greenwich Peninsula, but if you're after some lofty views of the capital, an empty wallet will no longer impede you. With this addition, London's transport network is almost as contactless-friendly as it can get, with Thames riverboats now the only service that still requires an old-fashioned ticket purchase.
A team of scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research (MPI-P) discovered that electrical conduction in graphene on the picosecond timescale -- a picosecond being one thousandth of one billionth of a second -- is governed by the same basic laws that describe the thermal properties of gases. This much simpler thermodynamic approach to the electrical conduction in graphene will allow scientists and engineers not only to better understand but also to improve the performance of graphene-based nanoelectronic devices.
The researchers found that the energy of ultrafast electrical currents passing through graphene is very efficiently converted into electron heat, making graphene electrons behave just like a hot gas. "The heat is distributed evenly over all electrons. And the rise in electronic temperature, caused by the passing currents, in turn has a strong effect on the electrical conduction of graphene" explains Professor Mischa Bonn, Director at the MPI-P. The study, entitled "Thermodynamic picture of ultrafast charge transport in graphene," has recently been published in Nature Communications.
Graphene -- a single sheet of carbon atoms -- is known to be a very good electrical conductor. As a result, graphene finds a multitude of applications in modern nanoelectronics. They range from highly efficient detectors for optical and wireless communications to transistors operating at very high speeds. A constantly increasing demand for telecommunication bandwidth requires an ever faster operation of electronic devices, pushing their response times to be as short as a picosecond. "The results of this study will help improve the performance of graphene-based nanoelectronic devices such as ultra-high speed transistors and photodetectors" says Professor Dmitry Turchinovich, who led the research at the MPI-P. In particular they show the way for breaking the terahertz operation speed barrier -- i.e. one thousand billion oscillations per second -- for graphene transistors.
ABC has cancelled freshman series “Forever” and “Cristela,” plus sophomore drama “Resurrection” and reality competition “The Taste,” Variety has learned.
The network has renewed all other series on its current slate with the exception of “Last Man Standing,” which still awaits a decision.
“Forever” starred Ioan Gruffudd as Dr. Henry Morgan, a medical examiner born in 1779 who studies the dead for criminal cases, truly to solve the mystery of his own immortality. Alana de la Garza, Joel David Moore, Donnie Keshawarz, Lorraine Toussaint and Judd Hirsch also starred. The drama premiered to almost 12 million total viewers in Sept. 2014, and dipped to just under 7 million for its most recent episode this spring.
“Cristela” also will not be returning for a second season. The multi-cam comedy was created by standup comedian Cristela Alonzo. Averaging just over 5 million total viewers for its first season, the premiere launched to a total audience of about 6.5 million and wrapped up with roughly 4.7 million.
Resurrection” won't live to see its third season. The supernatural drama explored when loved dead ones come back to life with no change in age since they died. Omar Epps (“House M.D.”) starred, along with Frances Fisher, Matt Craven, David Kelley, Mark Hildreth, Samaire Armstrong, Landon Gimenez and Kurtwood Smith.
However, the returning slate is full.
Renewed dramas include “Castle,” “Grey's Anatomy,” “How To Get Away With Murder,” “Marvel's Agents of SHIELD,” “Nashville,” “Once Upon A Time,” “Scandal,” “American Crime,” “Secrets and Lies” and “Marvel's Agent Carter.”
Comedies coming back are “Black-ish,” “Fresh Off The Boat,” “The Goldbergs,” “The Middle,” Modern Family” and “Galavant.”
Unscripted hits “The Bachelor,” “Dancing With the Stars,” “America's Funniest Home Videos,” “Shark Tank,” “Beyond the Tank,” plus “20/20” were also renewed.
In an interview with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, the star also talks about his role opposite Hayden Christensen in the upcoming U.S.-China co-production "Outcast."
Nicolas Cage just wrapped up shooting on location in China for British director Nick Powell's upcoming period drama Outcast, co-starring Hayden Christensen. But before Cage left the country, he gave an interview to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, in which he reveals a few things about his role in the film, discusses his acting methods and speaks out against the dearth of lead roles offered to male Asian actors in Hollywood.
Answering a question about his experience working with the Chinese crew on Outcast, Cage took the opportunity to briefly turn the interview in a more serious direction.

After praising his female co-star Liu Yifei's performance and saying how much he enjoyed working with the Chinese industry, Cage added: “I hope that we will see more Chinese actors in American cinema too. We do see Gong Li, Zhang Ziyi and Chow Yun Fat, but it's very rare to see the Chinese male actor in Hollywood movies, which is something I take great umbrage with. You know, my son is Asian. He may want to direct one day; he may want to be an actor like his father -- and I want that to be open to him. So I want to make some kind of effort to see more of that happen in Hollywood.”
Cage's wife Alice Kim is Korean-American. He said their 8-year-old son, Kal-El (named after Superman's birth name on planet Krypton), came along with him to China.
“He was here with me for the first few weeks, but he had to go back to the States to go back to school," he said. "Selfishly, I wanted him to stay with me the whole time, but the teachers said he had to go back to school, so he went home."
Outcast is the first film Cage – whose filmography spans some 75 films – has shot in China. He described the experience as positive and noted that he has "no doubt" China will soon surpass North America to become the world's largest film market, as many analysts have forecasted.
The film is a co-production between China's Yunnan Film Group and U.S.-Australian outfit Arclight Films.
“I do want to come back, and I want to work with a Chinese director and Chinese actors,” Cage said. “If there's something that makes sense for a white guy like me, I'd like to do that here in China.”
He said he views Tony Leung (In the Mood for Love, Lust, Caution) as one of the world's great actors.
“I would like to make a movie with Tony, but I don't know how to do it,” he said. “I want to do it.”

Last month Cage attended China's Huading Awards, an award show that honors talent across all categories of the arts. At the time he told The Hollywood Reporter that he hopes to soon move to Hong Kong.
He reiterated that desire in the CCTV interview, saying, “One of my goals is to have a base near mainland China. I think Hong Kong would be a good match for me. I like being in Hong Kong.”
Cage also gave a few hints about his role in Outcast, describing his character as a "reformed crusader," adding that Powell, who is British, asked him to put on an English accent for the part.
“I'm working with a character who goes through a catharsis -- who transforms from a violent man, as a crusader, to someone who no longer wants that life -- and he leaves,” he said.
The hardworking actor also shared a few of his methods: “When I act, I hear it like music,” he said. “In my head, I hear the dialogue like music. And the movements, like dance…I do design my performances, and then when I get to the set, the part I can't talk about -- the magic inside, the sacred part, the emotion -- I fill it with that. But I design it first like a performance.”
Near the end of the segment, CCTV's anchor gently challenged Cage on his recent filmography, noting that some critics have questioned his choice of projects.
“You can't make your choices based on what critics think. You have to make your choices based on what's honest for you,” Cage replied.
He added: "I can't let it bother me. I'm happy. I'm making movies I want to make. Something is working."

The leadership of populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD) has issued an official warning to Andre Poggenburg on Friday after comments found in an internal WhatsApp chat leaked last week.
Party leaders Alice Weidel and Alexander Gauland issued the official warning, telling the Deutsche Presse Agentur his comments "massively damaged" the party's image and "pushed the party closer to right extremism."
AfD leader Alice Weidel says blunt slogans do not help the party
The left-wing news site "linksunten" published a WhatsApp group chat last Monday containing AfD members, called "AfD Info LSA." Federal police and domestic intelligence is combing through the chat dated from February to May of this year.
Read More: Ten things you need to know about the AfD
Poggenburg was found using the slogan "Deutschland den Deutschen" (roughly: "Germany for the Germans") - a phrase commonly used by neo-Nazi groups in Germany and often used by the far-right NPD party. The AfD warned its deputy chairman in Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania, Ralph Weber, in April for using the same slogan on Facebook.
AfD leaders have sought to distance themselves from the NPD.
Facing initial criticism last week after the leak, Poggenburg at first defended his use of the slogan in a tweet: "Why should this put pressure on me? Of course 'Germany belongs to the Germans,' and that's how it should stay!"
He also suggested AfD members receive a seminar on "Erweiterung der Aussengrenzen" ("expanding external borders"), a suggestion that another unnamed WhatsApp group member responded with thumbs up signs and flexed biceps emojis. Leadership has condemned this exchange as well, saying it was inconsistent with the AfD's platform.
He has said he was referring to securing Europe's borders.
Weidel, AfD's candidate for chancellor along with Gauland in Germany's election later this year, said the AfD sees itself as a "party for political realism" and "blunt sayings do not help [this image] and hurt the party. Whoever doesn't understand that has no place at the AfD."

In 2009, federal agents received a tip that Devon Samuels, then a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, was smuggling drug money through the airport in exchange for a fee of as much as $5,000. But the scope of the Stockbridge resident's misdeeds, investigators soon found, was much broader. His position allowed him access to a secure database called TECS (Treasury Enforcement Communications System) from which he could see which of his drug-trafficking friends were being investigated. Undercover agents hired Samuels to carry cash-filled luggage or clothing to Jamaica, where he delivered it to agents posing as traffickers. Another time, Samuels smuggled five handguns through the Atlanta airport and into the hands of an undercover officer he thought was in cahoots with a Mexican drug cartel.
When federal agents checked the names in Samuels's TECS searches against airline passenger lists, they stumbled onto a colorful cast of drug runners, mostly from suburban Atlanta, with nicknames like “Nigel the Barber,” “Fatman,” and “Damage.” The joint investigation between several federal agencies also implicated a former DeKalb County police officer named Donald Bristol. The resulting 2010 takedown netted one of the largest domestic seizures of the party drug BZP in United States history. In June 2011, a federal judge sentenced Samuels to eight years in prison.
“Operation Rude Beast,” as investigators coined the bust that began with the Samuels tip, isn't even the most publicized smuggling case involving employees at Atlanta's airport in recent memory. That dubious honor would go to the arrest of Eugene Harvey, a Delta baggage handler from College Park, who is accused of using his security badge last year to bypass screening in order to smuggle 153 firearms—many of them loaded—onto 17 passenger planes.
Harvey allegedly would enter public restrooms and give gun-filled bags to former Delta employee Mark Quentin Henry. Prosecutors say Henry then flew the weapons to New York, where they were being sold on the street until an undercover NYPD officer bought one, which led to the arrests of both suspects, who now await trial in Atlanta. Kenneth Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, called it an “egregious breach of security,” an assertion that, to Hartsfield-Jackson officials, was as obvious as it was embarrassing. The root of the problem, Thompson insisted, was lax screening for Atlanta airport employees. If a baggage handler could smuggle assault rifles onto planes, he could easily sneak aboard a bomb, he said.
“That kind of trafficking—whether it's money or guns—within the airport, it creates an additional layer of harm to the community,” says John Horn, U.S. attorney in Atlanta. “The airport is such a huge institution to [Atlanta]; we have the obligation to make sure that it's safe.”
That's exactly what airport and airline officials insist they're trying to do now. And while the security clampdown has been swift, officials acknowledge that ATL's sheer vastness—with dozens of “access points,” such as locked doors to the airfield that require security badges for entry—doesn't lend itself to one-size-fits-all solutions.
Airport general manager Miguel Southwell speaks of Hartsfield-Jackson as a mini city. Indeed, on any given day, some 63,000 employees report to the world's busiest airport, to assist, feed, and protect more than a quarter million passengers—enough people to fill the Georgia Dome almost four and a half times. Of those employees, about 43,000 have been approved to access secure areas, which include the concourses and the airfield. They come and go around the clock.
Anyone hoping to work in a secure area—from concessions employees on up—must pass a fingerprint-based background check conducted by the FBI that stretches back more than a decade and a security threat assessment that checks terrorist data-bases and immigration records, as well as undergo training in order to obtain an ID badge. Applicants who want to work with international flights in any form must pass a more stringent custom and Border Protection probe. Any of about 30 types of criminal convictions will disqualify an applicant.
Prior to the headline-grabbing arrests last December, screening protocol for airport employees was indeed laxer than it is today, though airport director of policy and communications Reese McCranie is quick to point out the “multilayered security plan” had been approved by the Transportation Security Administration. At the time, all employees who were boarding planes—except for known crew members and air marshals—were required to be screened by magnetometers and their bags x-rayed. Harvey allegedly exploited a loophole in the TSA protocol that allowed him to bypass concourse screening—simply coming to work and bringing guns in via the “backdoor method,” as security experts have called it. The old theory went that subjecting every employee to full screenings every day would be cost-prohibitive.
By March, though, Hartsfield-Jackson officials had whittled 70 employee access points around the airport down to 17. Doing so means that thousands of employees have had their access restricted and must now enter through an alternative inspection or screening area. Once inside, they're also subject to more frequent checks of their possessions—“random pullovers, if you will,” Southwell says. Several Atlanta police officers were transferred to fill vacant airport security positions, and vehicle inspections for employees and construction workers entering the perimeter fence were ramped up, Southwell says. Construction of an employees-only checkpoint—one that won't lengthen public lines at TSA scanners—wrapped in August at a cost of $7 million. It's operated by about 70 newly hired and privately contracted screeners. As of September, the airport had begun screening all employees and airline workers except those who work for Delta—with a goal of screening 100 percent before 2016. (Delta is on track to screen all employees by year's end, too, says spokesman Morgan Durrant, while implementing other “covert measures” he can't discuss.) Doing so would make Atlanta the third of 452 commercial airports in the U.S. (behind Miami and Orlando) to screen employees across the board. The boosted security measures will cost the airport about $5 million annually, mostly to pay for the new inspectors. The additional cash will come from the airport's half-billion-dollar operating budget, officials say, not from added costs or fees for travelers. Southwell is confident the changes have tamped down the potential for insider threats. “We have taken the steps to provide the public with assurance that it is safe to fly through [Atlanta],” he says. Despite the sheer number of employees, Southwell says violations of security protocol are “still a pretty remote occurrence.” Flight stats 153

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday it was no time to build walls between nations and criticized steps towards cancelling world trade agreements, without naming new U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trump on Wednesday ordered the construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration.
“Today is not the time to erect walls between nations. They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago,” Rouhani said in a speech carried live on Iranian state television.
“To annul world trade accords does not help their economy and does not serve the development and blooming of the world economy,” Rouhani told a tourism conference in Tehran. “This is the day for the world to get closer through trade.”
The protectionist-minded Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday, fulfilling a campaign pledge to end American involvement in the 2015 pact.
Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013, thawed Iran's relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its 2015 deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions.
For Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, the agreement was a landmark foreign policy achievement but the new president has threatened to annul it or seek a better deal. The other five powers party to the deal have reaffirmed their commitment to it.
Rouhani said earlier this month that Trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was “meaningless”.
Since sanctions were lifted, Iran has signed major deals with Western firms, particularly with planemakers Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N).
Rouhani said on Saturday: “Today is the time for peaceful co-existence, not the time to create distance among nations.”
Rouhani made no direct reference to Trump's order on Friday curbing the entry of refugees into the United States and temporarily barring travelers from Iran and six other Muslim-majority countries. Trump said the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks.
Software Engineering Best Practices from a General of the Thirty Years' War
Abstract
Software engineering lessons can be found in very curious places such as natural wild life or in common objects around us. Object oriented advocates found their model in an architect (Christopher Alexander) but I never thought that the best lesson of software engineering that I could ever find was in the story of an amazing general of the Thirty Years' War.
The (Hi)Story so Far...
Many people do not know very much about the Thirty Years' War. Especially if you are not from Europe, where we study European's history at school, or you did not study European history of the 17th Century in some classes in college, you probably just heard of that war.
The Thirty Years' War shattered Europe for 30 years (1618-1648) and more than a single war; it is to be considered a series of conflicts that took place in the Central Europe involving, at different moments, all the political and military powers of the time: Holy Roman Empire, Austria, Spanish Empire, Swedish Empire, France...
Summarizing to the extreme, it was a war of religion between Protestants and Catholics. The outcome of the war was a rebalance of power across Europe with the division of the Holy Roman Empire, the independence of Portugal, Sweden transformed from Kingdom to Empire and many more.
For a better summary, or for the full story, please go to the local library and pick up a good history book, or just take a look at the Wikepedia page of the Thirty Years' War which provides a good enough summary.
For what concerns this document, we are interested only in one specific period of the Thirty Years' War. We are interested in the so called the Swedish intervention (1630-1635) and, even more specifically, into the Battle of Breitenfeld (September 7th, 1631) and in the general that guided the Sweden army to victory. The name of this general was Gustaf II Adolf, better known with through the Latin version of his name, Gustavus Adolphus, or through the name that his opponents gave him: "The Lion from the North".
Gustavus Adolphus and the Battle of Breitenfeld
Gustavus Adolphus was, and still is, considered the greatest general of his time and his fame comes not only from the large amount of battles and wars that he was able to win, but mainly his innovations to the way war was done in the 17th Century.
Just to name two, both Napoleon Bonaparte and George S. Patton recognize in him the inventor of modern warfare and a model that every general or commander should study and follow.
The battle that permitted Gustavus Adolphus to show to the world his ability as a general and his innovations was the Battle of Breitenfeld.
The Battle of Breitenfeld saw the forces of the Kingdom of Sweden facing the Imperial forces guided by the Count of Tilly. This last one was a very expert general. At the time of the battle, he was 35 years older than Gustavus Adolphus and with a long record of wars and battles: he joined the Spanish army when he was 15 years old and he died in 1632 at the age of 73, of tetanus, 15 days after he was wounded by a cannonball during the Battle of Rain.
Which innovations did Gustavus Adolphus make in the Battle of Breitenfeld?
The forces of Gustavus Adolphus were very well trained and organised; every infantryman or cavalry soldier was trained in the use of the artillery. The Swedish artillery used only three different calibers and each infantry regiment had a small caliber cannon to shot against troops or cavalry charges.
Everything of the previous list sounds obvious but it did not exist, at least at that level of perfection, before the battle.
It was not only something special with his army, Gustavus Adolphus was able to operate an artillery piece himself and he personally used to guide the cavalry charges guiding his men on the battlefield.
Innovations in the 17th Century Art of War and Modern Software Enginering
Each one of the innovations that Gustavus Adolphus took to the battlefield was as important as the other ones.
Let us analyse each one of them and let us try to draw parallels between those innovations and how we can try to learn something from the software engineering point of view.
Well trained troops — The Swedish army, as reported by the historians of the time, was the best-trained force of the Thirty Years' War. Just as an example, the musketeers were able to reload their muskets three times faster than every other army's musketeers were and they were trained to shot, at the same time, from three ranks. These two facts alone were able to multiply by 9 the effect of the musketeers (which is, more or less, an order of magnitude).
Where is the parallel with software engineering?
Being "well trained" is not something that only troops can benefit from. Programmers, DBAs and system administrators who have a deep knowledge of the systems that they work on are able to be more effective and fast in the execution of their tasks. Moreover, as in the "firing from three ranks" part, having a good coordination among the people in the team, as well as among the teams, is a crucial aspect of developing software in a company.
Infantry and cavalry were able to use the artillery — Every man in the Swedish army was trained to be an artillerist. Now, try to immagine the surprise of the Imperial forces when the Swedish cavalry, after killing the Imperial artillerists, dismounted from their horses and turned the cannons against their (former) owners and started shooting at them.
Where is the parallel with software engineering?
Every member of the team should know the full-stack of the application that is being built and should be able to understand the design and the choices made. Moreover, every member of the team should be able to contribute into the development of all the parts composing the product. This reduces (1) the possibility of having one single person owning the full knowledge of a single piece and (2) having everyone being able to integrate more easily his part of the work into the big picture.
Only three calibers — All the cannons in the Swedish army were only of three possible calibers. From that very moment on, those three calibers become the "standard" calibers of modern artillery. The total weight of bullets and cannonballs that an army can transport is limited and it is quite useful to have always the right kind of ammunition that is needed for the job.
Where is the parallel with software engineering?
A software project should use only a limited amount of programming languages, DBs and operating systems. In an ideal world, only one of each. Let us imagine a project programmed in 7 different languages, 3 DBs and everything runs on 2 different operating systems. Every one of those pieces needs specific knowledge and limits a lot the reusability of the code and the exchange of ideas among the teams: not even the DBAs are able to share properly ideas and practices.
Small caliber artillery — Each the brigade of the Swedish army had 3 small cannons (to be precise: a 3 pounds piece). These cannons were very easy to use, faster to reload than normal cannons and had a longer range than muskets. The infantry used them to shot at the enemy when it was too far for the muskets or against cavalry charges. Before then, the artillery was typically used in sieges and it was not very effective against the infantry. Gustavus Adolphus took to the battlefield the very first type of highly mobile artillery ever invented.
Where is the parallel with software engineering?
Having the right tools to be able to get the work done is essential. This is not just a reference to editors and compilers, which should be there by default in each development team. This is a reference to all the other tools, physical and practical, to help a team to do its job: test environments, code versioning systems, system that performs nightly builds of the code and runs automatically tests. Moreover, using the best software engineering practices such as code reviews, daily stand-ups etc.
Knowledge and example — Gustavus Adolphus was an incredible general and a great strategical mind. He changed the way war was done and his innovations in the western art of war survived him. Nevertheless, he was a practical man as well: he was able to operate an artillery piece himself and he used to guide the cavalry charges in person.
Where is the parallel with software engineering?
As it appears obvious, it is quite difficult to change the way programming and software engineering are done. Anyway, a good development leader (or any other name is used in your team) should have at least two characteristics: (1) he/she needs to be technical aware in order to be able to guide the design and the discussions and (2) he/she needs to "lead by example" actively taking part to the development, testing and deployment phases. Only in these two ways, the development leader can always maintain a sense of what is going one, where the problems are or try to predict where they will be.
Conclusions
In this document, we have drawn an interesting parallel between Software Engineering best practices and the war innovations of one of the greatest generals of the Thirty Years' War.
There is also a final point about Gustavus Adolphus: he was a real gentleman. When he discovered that the Count of Tilly was wounded during the battle, he sent him his personal physician.
Unfortunately, being a real gentleman is not something that someone can learn easily but this does not mean that you cannot try to be always respectful of the other members of your team and of the partner teams.
Dallas has been chosen as the host of the 2018 NFL draft, with all three days taking place at AT&T Stadium, commissioner Roger Goodell announced Wednesday.
The event will be held April 26-28 at the Dallas Cowboys' stadium in Arlington, Texas. The Cowboys had earlier pushed for the draft to be held at both AT&T Stadium and The Star, the team's new training facility in Frisco.
"Philadelphia raised the bar by taking the draft to another level, and this new opportunity in Dallas will enable us to continue the event's evolution and grow it even further," Goodell said at the NFL owners meetings in New York. "We are grateful to the Dallas Cowboys, the cities of Arlington, Dallas, and Frisco, and the Dallas Sports Commission for their leadership in turning this vision into reality."
The NFL said the draft site will use the AT&T Stadium field, stands and outdoor plazas, where the NFL Draft Experience festival will take place. The three-day event will again be televised live by ESPN.
"I really think we came up with an idea and concept that will deliver a unique experience unlike anything seen at the NFL draft so far," Cowboys executive Charlotte Jones Anderson said.
Philadelphia had been in contention to again host the draft, while Green Bay and Kansas City were considered long shots.
It will be the first time the draft will happen in an NFL stadium. Last year's event drew an estimated 250,000 fans and was held outdoors for the first time, taking place on the steps of the iconic Philadelphia Museum of Art.
The draft never has been held in Texas. A move there represents yet another venue for the event after a run from 1965 to 2014 in which the draft was held annually in New York.
After two years in Chicago, the draft returned to Philadelphia earlier this year for the first time since 1961.

UK unemployment fell by 4,000 in the three months to June leaving 2.51 million out of work, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in July fell more sharply, down by 29,000 to 1.4 million.
The unemployment rate remains at 7.8%, still well above the 7% rate target set by the Bank of England.
The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, says interest rates are unlikely to rise before that target is reached.
The ONS said the figures meant unemployment was "broadly unchanged" from the first three months of the year.
The number of people in work increased by 69,000 in the three months to June, up to 29.78 million. That is the highest level since records began in 1971.
That means 307,000 more people are in employment in the UK, compared with the same time last year.
Unemployment mapped The Latest unemployment figures across the UK
The ONS's David Freeman said two-thirds of this increase had been seen in UK nationals. A third of the employment increase came from non-UK nationals working in the UK.
Mixed picture
Analysis by Hugh Pym, chief economics correspondent Suddenly everyone is watching out for the unemployment rate. That's because the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has said future interest rate rises will not start until, barring unexpected events, the rate falls to 7% of the workforce. The latest figures, the first since the Bank's forward guidance announcement, showed the rate was unchanged at 7.8%. Yet the figures also showed the number in work was at a record high. And therein lies a problem for the Bank. The economy is creating jobs but the workforce is growing. So there may be solid economic growth over the next couple of years, but the unemployment rate still takes a while to come down. And during that time, inflation alarm bells may start to ring.
Analysts said the figures portrayed a mixed picture of the UK jobs market.
"Despite some good news in the latest jobs figures there are worrying signs about the underlying state of the UK jobs market," said John Philpott, from the think tank, The Jobs Economist.
"The rise in employment is almost matched by an increase in the size of the workforce, which means the unemployment rate is unchanged at 7.8%.
"The headline jobs figures may continue to be broadly positive but one only has to dig a little deeper into the statistics to see that millions of people are continuing to be hit by a combination of lack of jobs and a ceaseless sharp fall in the real value of their pay."
Long-term
Youth unemployment, among those aged 16-24, increased by 15,000 to reach 973,000.
The number of people out of work for more than two years also rose by 10,000 to 474,000, the highest number in 16 years.
The ONS also released figures showing that wages grew by 1.1% over the past 12 months. When bonuses were included, wages grew by 2.1% - the highest annual growth rate since June 2011.
The small fall in unemployment comes a week after Mr Carney linked the Bank of England's interest rate policy decisions to the unemployment rate for the first time.

He said the MPC will not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate falls below 7%, which he predicted would take about three years and the creation of 750,000 jobs.
Work and Pensions minister Steve Webb told the BBC that "things were starting to look much more positive". He said the jobs figures added to a general picture of an economy that was starting to pick up.
But Labour's shadow employment minister, Stephen Timms, said the reality was that for ordinary families things were getting "harder not easier", highlighting the rise in part-time workers.
"Ministers just sound out of touch when they ignore the fact that the number of people who are working part-time because they cannot find a full-time job is at record levels," he said.
Social Media Turmoil: Technofascism & the Slow Death of Free Speech
The left turned fascists and the right wants their rights.
Guest Post by Carter
Once upon a time the innovation and the fight for our rights to speak freely came from the progressives. In 1957 poet and anti-capitalist free speech activist Allen Ginsberg saw his groundbreaking work “Howl” at the center of an obscenity trial when the right attempted to restrict creative expression . . . It seems we have been taken back all the way to 1957 but now the tables have turned and the creativity and satire of the right are being shut down – welcome to 2017 and the slow death of free speech.
Enter YouTube . . . After advertisers began losing their minds over their ads being shown on “extremist” videos, they called on the video hosting service to pull their ads from certain content. Just as you might have suspected, this meant a direct assault on rightwing vloggers and those deemed by the left as “fascists”, “Nazis” and “white supremacists”.
The definition of “extremism” being used here directly attacks individuals who in no way are preaching hate, individuals who are in no way “extremists”. Take, for example, Paul Joseph Watson. Watson is the Editor-at-Large at Infowars and covers much of the same topics as CNN and other media outlets such as NBC and MSNBC yet his personal account seems to be the target of this new brand of censorship.
Watson is known for actively pointing out the hypocrisy of these institutions and has done a wonderful job granting his massive audience examples. Since this assault is not limited to YouTube and other Google products, Watson showed the world the duplicity of another tech giant – Facebook.
The website began implementing a “hate speech” tool wherein users can report instances of hate speech that might violate the company's policies, but the accuracy and consistency seems to be missing, just take a look at this woman's anti-white post – Facebook did not deem this hate speech. Go figure.
Facebook is using “fact checkers” like Snopes – a left-aligned semi-truth propagator – to inform you of the validity or invalidity of links you attempt to post. It seems even down to the news you choose to share you are being told that you are wrong and that your ideas are wrong and that the ideas you agree with are wrong.
Now even Instagram, Facebook's adopted mess, is beginning to blur images that they feel are a bit too risqué or offensive promising a future where only bland, derivative individuals can post their mind-numbingly irrelevant pictures unhindered by anything too on the nose. Though the specifics of what Instagram is going to censor is still up in the air, the threat mirrors the same threat YouTube presented with their “restricted mode”.
This type of deliberate and targeted censorship is ruining the free exchange of ideas and the technofascism being employed by the Silicon Valley elite is going to drive their users away and drive our dialogue into the ground and out of sight.
Amazon's Jeff Bezos Reuters Amazon just reported disappointing Q3 earnings.
Here are the numbers:
This is a miss on both the top and bottom line. The stock was down as much as ~12.89% after-hours.
Besides misses on EPS and revenue, Amazon also spooked investors by reporting a significant operating loss with similarly bleak Q4 guidance.
Operating loss was $544 million in the third quarter (the company had predicted between $410 and $810 million). In the third quarter last year, the operating loss was only $25 million. Amazon reported operating income guidance of between a $570 million loss and $430 million for Q4. About $470 million will be used for stock-based compensation. Net loss was $437 million.
On its earnings call, Amazon also confirmed suspicions that its smartphone — the Amazon Fire— was a bit of a flop. The company said it took a $170 million hit and that it had $83 million worth of unsold inventory on hand at the end of the quarter.
Here's Amazon's historical operating income:
Amazon
Amazon spent $2.6 billion on fulfillment expenses this quarter, up from $2 billion in Q3 last year (Amazon announced in Q2 that it was adding six new fulfillment centers and 15 more "sortation" centers by the end of the year). That's about 12% of the total $21 billion operating expenses.
Operating cash flow increased 15% year-over-year to $5.71 billion and free cash flow increased to $1.08 billion, which is up from $388 million in Q3 2013.
Going into the holiday season, Amazon expects net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion, or a growth of between 7% and 18% year-over-year. Analysts were expecting $30.89 billion in revenue for the holiday quarter.
Here's a look at its historical net sales:
Amazon
The company also reported that Amazon Web Services usage had grown nearly 90% year-over-year for the third quarter. CEO Jeff Bezos has said in the past that he one day expects AWS to be the company's biggest business. Amazon doesn't specifically break out AWS revenue — it's part of the "other" category — but it saw 37% year-over-year growth.
On the earnings call, Amazon attributed the slow-down in media growth to the fact that more students are renting their textbooks than ever before, instead of buying them.
Here's where Amazon's growth comes from:
BI Intelligence
Amazon made a lot of investments in Q3. The company bought video game streaming startup Twitch for nearly $1 billion. It fired shots at Square by launching a mobile card reader called Local Register. Amazon Prime Fresh, the company's delivery service, expanded to New York. Amazon announced last quarter it would spend more than $100 million on original video content (its original TV show "Transparent" thrilled critics this quarter). Although investors generally have accepted Bezos' mantra of taking long-term losses for long-term success, the 10% stock plunge is clearly an indicator that they're running out of patience.
On the earnings call, one testily asked which metrics were important to Amazon because it didn't seem like "any of them are making positive progress."
CFO Tom Szkutak gave a very "Amazon" answer, saying that the company is trying to maximize free cash flow and then use its capital to make investments that will pay off in the long term.
Here's a closer look at some of the numbers:

Here's the full report:
This horrifying footage shows the moment two young sisters were left paralysed when a Jaguar Land Rover manager pulled in front of their family car during a road rage chase.
Katrina and Karlina Raiba, aged five and eight, suffered life-changing injuries when Andrew Nay, 39, made an 'absolutely ridiculous' right-hand turn across oncoming traffic.
The court heard he was tailgating and 'bullying' a woman in a Mazda people carrier moments before the crash on the A509 near Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, in October last year.
Sisters Katrina and Karlina Raiba, aged five and eight, right, were left paralysed after Andrew Nay, left, crashed into their family car on the A509 near Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, in October last year
Video captured on the family's dashcam captures Nay's white Land Rover Discovery 3 recklessly pulling out into their lane, giving father Roberts Raibais no time to swerve out of the way.
Mr Raibais and his wife Renate Raiba, who suffered broken bones in the accident, said Nay had 'robbed' their daughters of their active childhoods.
Their lawyer added the girls will now face a 'lifetime of profound disability'.
Nay, of Corby, Northamptonshire, admitted four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving but denied chasing the Mazda before hitting the victims' Vauxhall Signum.
Northampton Crown Court heard Nay, who worked as an off-road instructor for Land Rover, had been chasing the Mazda because he believed the driver had cut him up.
Giving evidence, the female Mazda driver said Nay was aggressively tailgating and 'bullying' her as he followed her vehicle.
Matthew Rowcliffe, prosecuting, said the woman admitted putting her hand out the window and 'sticking her middle finger up' at Nay as he was 'less than a car length' away from her vehicle.
The court heard the woman overtook a Mercedes to put a car between the two vehicles but was not able to make much further progress up the road due to heavy traffic.

Moment of impact: Nay drove in front of the family car, giving the driver no time to swerve out of the way
Carnage: The video captures what appears to be airbags inflating when the 4x4 smashed into the family car
Fraser Hopes, the driver of the Mercedes, said Nay's Land Rover then began to tailgate him and in his rear view mirror he could see two men 'smiling' and 'having a laugh'.
Dashcam footage shows Nay later pulling out of his lane as he tried to make a right-turn, crashing into the family car.
Witness Leslie Miller, said of the manoeuvre: 'It was absolutely ridiculous. There was no reason why it couldn't have waited.'
In evidence, Nay denied chasing the Mazda, saying he had noticed 'nothing in particular' during his journey and was turning towards a garden centre in his car when he crashed.
But Judge Adrienne Lucking QC rejected Nay's testimony, ruling that he crashed while chasing the Mazda.
Describing the evidence against Nay as overwhelming, Judge Lucking said the driver had 'harried' the people carrier after being prevented from leaving a roundabout on the A14.
The judge told Nay: 'I have heard evidence from a series of witnesses travelling in the same direction as the Land Rover.
'In each case their evidence was given in measured terms, without exaggeration. By contrast I found the defendant's evidence unconvincing and inconsistent.'
Devastated: Parents Roberts Raibais and Renate Raiba, pictured, suffered broken bones in the crash
After the ruling, parents Roberts Raibais and Renate Raiba, said their lives had been 'completely shattered' by Nay's actions and that no sentence would be enough.
They said 'Andrew Nay's reckless actions had devastating consequences for our two beautiful daughters.
'Katrina and Karlina were happy, active children and he has robbed them of that. We will never be able to forgive him.
'Every day they ask 'when will we start feeling our legs again?' They think it's going to get better and it's too hard to tell them.'
Representing the family, Richard Langton, a serious injury specialist from law firm Slater and Gordon, added: 'This is one of the most heartbreaking cases I have ever had to deal with.
'Nay was an experienced driver, yet his complete disregard for other road users has left two innocent children paralysed from the waist down.
'Because of him Katrina and Karlina face a lifetime of profound disability.'
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House vowed Wednesday that the United States would still meet international commitments to cut carbon emissions, seeking to allay concerns that the Supreme Court might take away one of its main weapons against climate change.

The court dealt a blow on Tuesday to the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which would steer electricity plants away from burning coal to cleaner fuel sources, delaying its implementation until all legal challenges are decided.
But the White House said it remained confident it would ultimately win the lawsuits brought by industry groups and 29 states opposed to the plan.
And White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the administration has an array of tools available to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to rising global temperatures.
He cited the long-term extension of tax credits for renewable energy that were enacted in last year's budget deal as an example of other policy measures driving the power sector's shift to cleaner energy.
“The inclusion of those tax credits is going to have more impact over the short term than the Clean Power Plan,” Schultz said.
Still, the court-ordered pause that could push a final legal ruling back a year or more and onto the desk of the next president raised questions about the U.S. ability to deliver on pledges made at December's Paris climate talks.
The Paris accord requires countries to set and meet their own national targets to reduce carbon emissions, and the United States presented the Clean Power Plan as a major step to shrink power plant emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels over the next 15 years.
The prospect of a legal delay and possible rejection of the plan rattled some environmental groups and foreign governments that have embraced the Paris formula.
Outgoing French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who was praised for his smooth chairmanship that brought about a deal in Paris, was quoted by French government officials saying the Supreme Court's move was “not good news.”
FAMILIARITY WITH U.S. SYSTEM
But other observers, noting the endemic gyrations of global climate politics over the past two decades, warned against panic over the court's move.
“No country naively made an agreement with the United States on the basis of one or two of its policies,” said Robert Orr, special adviser on climate change to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
“The Paris agreement wasn't about what commitments were extracted from one country and whether they can be lived up to,” Orr said. “It was a recognition by all the major countries that it is in their own best interest to solve this problem.”
Michelle Patron, formerly a top adviser to Obama's National Security Council on energy and climate issues, said she expected other signatories to the climate deal to take the U.S. news in stride.
“Our partners are well aware of the legal tests and hurdles that our policies now have to go through, and they've seen it before,” Patron said, describing climate diplomats as having a “sophisticated” level of knowledge about the U.S. political system.
Market reaction seemed to reflect a similar long view. Coal companies have blamed clean air regulations for the collapse of much of the domestic industry in recent years, even though much of the power sector's shift from coal to natural gas has been driven by low prices for the latter.
Coal stocks rose quickly in early trading Wednesday after the court's move. But after jumping nearly 7 percent early in the session, the Thomson Reuters U.S. coal index was down 3 percent in afternoon trading, reflecting the deeply ingrained skepticism about the long-term prospects for coal.
“Whenever you get a rally in these stocks initially it's from short-covering that helps propel the stock,” said King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.
“But people start realizing it's still very difficult for a lot of these companies because they're so leveraged. They come back to Earth and the selling starts to pick up again. That's what you saw today with some of these coal stocks.”
College football fans, especially those in Big 12 country, will long remember Baylor 52, Kansas State 24 as the night when the Wildcats' wildest dreams — and those of the conference's top star, Collin Klein — were dashed.
No national championship opportunity for K-State.
No legit shot at the Heisman Trophy for Klein.
But that game, and that resounding final score, resonates for very different reasons in Waco, Texas.
The Bears indicated that night that their 2012 season — otherwise knows as Year 1 ARG3 — wasn't a bust. And they proved, in winning their final three games to finish 7-5, that both the present and future for Baylor football are bright.
And there was something else: the long-awaited breakout performance for Lache Seastrunk.
If coach Art Briles is correct, that blowout of K-State will go down in Baylor history as the night a banner 2013 season was born.
— Holiday Bowl: UCLA (9-4) vs. Baylor (7-5), Dec. 27, San Diego, 9:45 p.m. ET, ESPN
"We think we certainly have the potential to win the Big 12 conference championship—without question," Briles told Sporting News this week.
And the biggest single part of that potential is Seastrunk. Life after Robert Griffin III won't be as difficult to manage for the Bears because they—and how many programs out there can truly say this?—have a player with the potential to be similarly transcendent.
Briles says he hasn't seen a more gifted college running back since Adrian Peterson.
Seastrunk, who'll be a redshirt junior nest season, says he's merely the best back in the country right now.
"I feel like there's no back who can do what I do," he told SN. "I know I'm the fastest back in the country. I know I'm the best back in the country. Nobody's going to work harder."
But that's not all. Are you listening?
"I'm going to win the Heisman. I'm going to win it in 2013. If I don't, I'm going to get very close.
"I'm shooting for that goal. I will gladly say it."
Briles says that's "certainly a goal that's realistic." We say he's absolutely right. That win over K-State also was the night a Heisman campaign was born.
Seastrunk had a season-high 185 yards on only 19 carries vs. the Wildcats. And about that only: the 19 carries also was a season high.
Imagine it: a running back who ripped up Big 12 defenses for 693 yards rushing over his final five games—and who commanded the attention of fans around the country with 499 yards and five TDs in his last three games—has yet to have 20 totes in a game. He topped off at seven carries (twice) in his first seven games when he rushed for 181 yards (6.2 yards per carry).
Wisconsin's Montee Ball has had 10 games with at least 20 carries in 2012. Kenjon Barner, the star running back at Oregon—where Seastrunk began his college career—has had eight.
Those season highs are also career highs for the 21-year-old Seastrunk. He redshirted at Oregon in 2010 before transferring to Baylor—amidst a recruiting scandal that still circles the Ducks' program—and sitting out all of 2011.
Then he languished on Briles' bench for seven games in 2012—while many fans around the country stopped caring about the long-anticipated debut of the No. 1-rated high school running back of 2009. At Baylor, though, fans waited. And waited.
So did Seastrunk, for whom the wait was tolerable, if not easy.
"He had a good attitude when he wasn't playing," quarterback Nick Florence said. "Actually, he had a great attitude."
It was all part of a learning process for the native of Temple, Texas.
At Oregon, he'd wanted—expected—to walk right in and dominate. As a freshman, though, he wasn't about to unseat LaMichael James or his then-backup, Barner.
"It was very, very, very hard, I'm not going to lie. It was very painful," Seastrunk said. "I don't like talking about it, but I will.
"When I came out, I was a top-ranked athlete. I could've gone anywhere I wanted to. I felt I couldn't be touched. I was in the sky. I was a little arrogant. That year humbled me. But I think God wanted me to learn something about myself."
Seastrunk says—and both Briles and Florence provide compelling backup to his story—that his attitude and approach completely changed at Baylor, and that, even though he wasn't playing, it actually helped his team withstand a frustrating first two months of this season.
After a year away from football, Florence said, "Lache really just needed some time to get the offense under his belt."
"I knew it would come in time," Seastrunk said. "I'm a lot more disciplined now. I stay more focused during practice than I did at Oregon. I listen more. I analyze defenses now. I know what coverages they're in.
"I'll tell you why I had such a good game against Kansas State: I knew where the holes were going to be at."
Seastrunk's season total of 874 yards won't land him on 2013 preseason Heisman lists, but his 7.6 yards per carry (entering next Thursday's bowl game vs. UCLA) might. And it should; only one FBS player, Kent State's Dri Archer, had a higher average.
But Seastrunk isn't just a big-play-waiting-to-happen type like Archer or, for a more fitting comparison, Oregon burner De'Anthony Thomas.
Seastrunk has major-league workhorse potential.
"His strength and ability just takes over," Briles said.
If Seastrunk isn't RG3-fast, he's close. "The way we judge speed is if he's ever been caught," Briles said. "I've never seen Robert caught and have yet to see Lache caught."
At 5-10 and nearly 210 pounds, he's a powerhouse, too.
"What this guy can do is unreal," Florence said. "It's kind of crazy that someone that big can move like he does and still go in the weight room and squat 500, 600 pounds."
Barring the unforeseeable, Seastrunk's 20-carry breakthrough is just a week away vs. UCLA.
In 2013, it'll be a regular occurrence.
"Without question," Briles said. "I think he'll average in the low 20s throughout the season."
Even at 5.2 yards per carry, Ball—the workhorse of workhorses in the college game—is working on a 1,700-yard-plus season. How high can Seastrunk go?
High enough that the Heisman hype can officially begin right now.
Masinton Pasaribu, a DPR member from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), may face criminal charges after he allegedly hit one of his female staff members in the face some time ago.
The victim, Dita Aditia Ismawati, claimed she received a bruised eye after Masinton allegedly hit her while they were both inside a car on January 21.
Secretary of the National Democratic Party (Nasdem) Regional Leaders Council Wibi Andrino plans to report Masinton to the DPR Ethics Council and the police for his alleged crime.
“The man (Masinton) does not have the soul of a knight. He victimizes other people,” Wibi said, as quoted by Tempo yesterday.
As is usually the case with allegations like this, Masinton has his own version of events of what happened on January 21.
According to Masinton, he picked up a visibly drunk Dita from Camden bar in Cikini that evening with a driver, Husni, and another staff member named Abraham. As Dita was too drunk to drive home, Husni drove Dita's car while Abraham drove Masinton's car with Dita sitting on the front passenger seat and Masinton in the back seat.
Supposedly, Dita then suddenly pulled the steering wheel, causing Abraham to swerve the car and, out of reflex, smacked Dita in the face with his left arm. Abraham admitted to this version of events, and added that the bruise on Dita's eye was severe because he was wearing a batu akik ring on one of his fingers.
When mass civil protests in Russia were defeated in 2011-12 the Putinist police regime started open political repressions against militants of social and political movements, including anarchists and antifascists. Many activists have been sentenced to prison terms in the course of the last 5 years in Russia.
We call on comrades from the whole world to show solidarity with Russian anarchists and antifascists – prisoners of the Putinist police state, and distribute information about the international solidarity decade as widely as possible, maybe organise an event in your own town.
It could be an info-party where letters could be written, a film show, a fund-raising event, a benefit gig, a protest action at the Russian embassy in your own country, a solidarity action – only your fantasy is the limit.
Facebook event: https://www.facebook.com/events/1774132002816021/

Please see brief description of repressions to which Russian anarchists and antifascists were subjected.
Dmitry Buchenkov
A well-known antifascist and anarchist Dmitry Buchenkov, PhD in political science, was arrested in Moscow in December 2015. He is suspected of participating in the riots of May 6, 2012. More than 400 persons were arrested as a result of a mass protest action against Putin's politics that took place on May 6, 2012 in Moscow. Dmitry was not in Moscow on that day, he was in Nizhny Novgorod, more than 300 km away from Moscow.
Dmitry is a long-time participant of the antifascist and anarchist movements and he has done a lot for their development. Dmitry's comrades and friends believe that the arrest is related to his political militancy and his active position regarding the developments taking place in the country.
Dmitry Buchenkov, 36, lecturer of history and political science, PhD in political science, associate professor, worked as Deputy Chairman of the Medicine History and Socio-Humanitarian Science Department in the Russian National Research Medical University named after N.I.Pirogov in Moscow. Prior to 2008 he worked as an associate professor of the Philosophy Department in the Volga State Pedagogy University (Nizhny Novgorod) for five years. He was fired for his political activism. Dmitry moved to Moscow after he had had to quit the Volga University.
In Moscow Dmitry joined the local cell of the Autonomous Action, whose member he had already been since 2002. This is how he describes the ideology he shares in a book entitled “Anarchists in the late XX century in Russia” published in 2009: «Basic worldview values of anarchism (self-management, self-organisation, anticapitalism) are still relevant today». In 2013 Dmitry quit the Autonomous Action organization, but he did not give up his political activism.
He authored several books on history and modern condition of anarchism in Russia. He is an activist of the antifascist and anarchist movements.
Dmitry actively participated in organising efforts and life of the antifascist and anarchist movements in Moscow. He organised many street antifascist protest actions, different cultural events. He took part in the establishment of an antifascist centre called «V project», where antifascists and anarchists held their gigs, meetings, and prepared their actions. Police and FSB more than once threatened to attack Dmitry physically for his political activities and struggles. In 2015 unknown persons, probably police or FSB agents, severely beat Dmitry up, so that he got brain concussion, was all covered in blood and couldn't even remember how the assault occurred.
Dmitry Buchenkov planned to organise an all-Russian antifascist and anarchist forum “Self-management and Libertarian Communism” in early 2016. But the authoritarian Putinist regime police arrested him.

Alexei Gaskarov
A well-known antifascist and anarchist. An organiser and participant of many anarchist and left-wing conferences. He was arrested on 3 August 2010 on the Khmiki case after an administrative building in Khimki had been assaulted on 28 July 2010. An environmental protest action took place in Khimki against deforestation of big chunks of a reserve forest in order to build a toll road. On 15 October, 2010, the court decision on the arrest was recalled. On 24 June, 2011, he was legally acquitted by the Khimki municipal court.
He was strongly beaten by police on 6 May, 2012, at Bolotnaya square during a political opposition protest, so he filed a petition on riot police power abuses involving violence and riot control weapons.
On 28 April, 2013, he was apprehended and the following day arrested on accusation of leading a group of persons who actively participated in mass riots that supposedly took place at Bolotnaya square and of violence against a policeman. Later the accusation included two policemen supposedly attacked by Gaskarov: according to investigation data, Gaskarov grabbed a shoulder of an interior troops soldier and then he grabbed a leg of Igor Ibatulin, a riot police officer. The final version of the charge is also saying that he participated in mass riots at Bolotnaya square. On 18 August, 2014, the court sentenced Gaskarov to three and a half years in a general regime penal colony.
Many political activists relate Gaskarov's imprisonment to a direct revenge from political police called the «Centre for Combating Extremism» for his long-time political activism. Gaskarov support website — gaskarov.info

Alexei Sutuga
A well-known antifascist and anarchist from «Autonomous Action». Charged with hooliganism for supposedly beating up nationalists in a brawl. Sentenced to three years and one month of colony.
Sutuga was apprehended in April 2014 in Moscow by political police from the «Centre for Combating Extremism» after an antifa gig. During interrogation he was asked about his trip to Maidan (Ukrainian protests in Kyiv in 2014). Alexei was accused of participation in a brawl on 2 January, 2014, in «Sbarro» bar, where he kicked and beat several persons with a chair and a selfmade hammer.
Sutuga himself said he tried to stop other people fighting — the brawl was between Neo-Nazis and some other youths. On October 1 Sutuga was sentenced to three years and one month of colony. On December 17 the appeal court left the sentence unchanged.
On 17 March, 2015, while in Irkutsk remand prison, from where he had to be transferred to a colony, Sutuga went on a dry hunger strike because he had been pressurised in the remand prison: he was offered to stay there instead of the colony, and when Sutuga had refused, they got hold of his letters and books. When the news on his hunger strike leaked outside the remand prison, he was transferred to the colony. The stopped his hunger strike. In the colony Sutuga was subjected to a solitary confinement cell. He is constantly pressurised by the prison administration.

Ilya Romanov
On 6 August, 2015, a visiting board of the Moscow district military court passed a sentence upon Ilya Romanov, anarchist from Nizhny Novgorod – 10 years of high-security prison. The court ignored all arguments brought forward by defence. Afterwards the term was changed to 9 years of high-security prison.
Romanov was injured by a self-made firecracker's explosion in October 2013, but they re-qualified him from an unfortunate experimenter to a “terrorist”. Apart from that firecracker an “interview” that he had given in December 2012 in a suburb of Donetsk was used in his case. Both “crimes” were incomplete: Ilya Romanov is accused of trying to menace local population and authorities of Nizhny Novgorod in order to save Kulibinsky park from tree-felling, but he didn't manage because the device exploded during a test. He also supposedly tried to propagate terrorism through Ukrainian media, namely «Radio RKAS - Libertaire», but he didn't manage to accomplish it either. It appears that it is not a radio station, rather an internet blog. The interview itself is just a Dictaphone record made at a party following his release from prison.
Romanov, whose family consists of retired parents and a teenage daughter is the poorest of all inmates. His family hardly manages to bring him parcels now and then, while Romanov also has to pay for a lawyer working on two supervisory complaints.

Alexander Kolchenko
On 25 August, 2015, the military court in Rostov-upon-Don passed a cruel sentence against Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov and Crimean antifascist Alexander Kolchenko. The investigation authorities called them “terrorists” — allegedly Sentzov guided by the «Right Sector» from Kyiv (banned in Russia) founded a “terrorist group” in Simpheropol that sought to bring Crimea back to Ukraine.
Kolchenko supposedly made part of the group. The “terrorists” set fire on the office doors of “Crimean Russian Community” and a window in the local office of the “United Russia” (the ruling party in Russia). During the court, Gennady Afanasiyev — one of key witnesses upon whose words the accusation was built — said that his testimony was either given under torture or simply invented. Afanasyev got 7 years in prison on the “Crimean terrorists” case. Oleg Sentzov was sentenced to 20 years and Alexander Kolchenko to10 years in prison for burning a door and a window.

Elizaveta Tsvetkova
31 May 2016 Taganrog City Court Judge Georgy Serebryanikov sentenced 31-year-old local resident Elizaveta Tsvetkova to a year of corrective labor for disseminating leaflets criticizing the police. As published on the court's website, the verdict stipulates that Tsvetkova will be assigned to a workplace she may not choose herself, and fifteen percent of Tsvetkova's wages will be docked by the state for a year. The activist has also been charged 6,000 rubles in court costs.
Serebryanikov found the defendant guilty under Criminal Code Article 281.2 (incitement of hatred or enmity toward the social group “police officers”), which stipulates a maximum punishment of four years in a penal colony.
During closing arguments on May 16, Taganrog Deputy Chief Prosecutor Vadim Dikaryov asked that Tsetkova be sentenced to one year in a work-release colony. Serebryanikov thus imposed a lighter sentence than was requested by the prosecution.
The activist, however, pleaded not guilty. During her closing statement, on May 27, she stressed she had protested the illegal actions of law enforcement officers. She reminded Judge Serebryanikov of high-profile criminal cases against policemen, including the cases of Major Denis Yevsyukov and the Dalny police station in Kazan.
Lawyer Yuri Chupilkin had also asked the court to acquit his client. Initially, the reading of the verdict in Tsvetkova's trial had been scheduled for May 30. However, an hour before the scheduled hearing, the activist was called and informed it would be postponed. The reasons for the delay were not explained to the defendant.
It is unclear whether Tsvetkova would appeal the verdict.
Charges were filed against the activist in January 2015. According to investigators, Tsvetkova downloaded a leaflet criticizing the police from the Vkontakte social network, printed it out, and the day before Law Enforcement Officers Day, in November 2014, posted it at public transport stops and on street lamps.
The investigation was completed in August 2015. However, in September, the acting Taganrog city prosecutor uncovered numerous legal violations in the investigation, refused to confirm the indictment, and sent the case back to the Russian Investigative Committee. The indictment was confirmed the second time round, in November.
However, investigators ignored a sociological forensic study, carried out by Professor Vladimir Kozyrkov at Nizhny Novgorod University. Professor Kozyrkov rejected claims that police officers constitute a social group.
At preliminary hearings in December, Chupilkin insisted on striking a number of pieces of evidence from consideration, in particular, studies done by the regional interior ministry. Judge Serebryanikov, however, rejected the defense's motions.
The hearing on the merits began on January 15, 2016. During the April 20 hearing, Viktor Chernous, a sociology professor at Southern Federal University in Rostov-on-Don, subpoenaed as an expert witness, also testified that police officers were not a social group, and consequently there had been nothing criminally culpable in the actions imputed to the defendant.
In turn, Elizaveta Koltunova, an assistant professor of linguistics at Nizhny Novgorod University, who was subpoenaed as an expert witness, noted that she could find nothing extremist about the leaflet that had led to the charges filed against Tsvetkova.
Rosfinmonitoring has included Tsvetkova in its list of terrorists and extremists and blocked her bank account.

Anarchist Black Cross – Moscow
RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - The commander in chief of the Sons of Confederate Veterans says he fails to understand the wave of hostility directed at the Confederate flag following the massacre of nine black people at a South Carolina church last month.

“I'll use the words of Jefferson Davis: ‘We just want to be left alone,'” Charles Kelly Barrow said on Wednesday, quoting the man who served as the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War of 1861-65.
Barrow and about 1,000 members of his organization were in Richmond, Virginia, this week for the 120th national reunion of the SCV, formed in 1896 and open to male descendants of Confederate soldiers. Richmond is the former capital city of the Confederacy.
The massacre at the Charleston church sparked a national debate over the display of the Confederate flag and other symbols of the pro-slavery Confederacy. Photos of the white suspect posing with the flag have galvanized critics and led South Carolina to stop flying it on the State House grounds.
“They want to remove our flags, the names on our streets, our monuments,” Barrow said in an interview, referring to pressure to take down statues and rename streets named after Confederate heroes such as Jefferson Davis.
“We're in a country that's supposed to be tolerant, and suddenly they're targeting our culture,” he said. “I can't wait to wake up from this nightmare.”
His comments followed a ceremony in Richmond's Hollywood Cemetery to honor a Pennsylvania doctor who in the 1870s exhumed the remains of thousands of Confederate soldiers killed at the Battle of Gettysburg and shipped them back to Southern states.
About 18,000 Confederate soldiers are buried in Hollywood, many of them in an area called Gettysburg Hill, where small Confederate flags fluttered among the tombstones.
Davis, along with U.S. Presidents James Monroe and John Tyler, also are buried in Hollywood.
Barrow said he had seen no protests at this year's convention, which runs through the end of the week.
Following the South Carolina shootings, some of Richmond's Confederate monuments were defaced, and some people called for taking down Confederate statuary along Monument Avenue, the city's most famous thoroughfare.
Dwight Jones, its African-American mayor, disagrees and has instead called for more monuments recognizing heroes from other eras. He pointed to African-American tennis great Arthur Ashe's statue on Monument Avenue as a step in the right direction.
Last month, Democratic Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe called for removing Confederate flags from state-issued license plates. Jones and many other black officials applauded the decision.

[img]http://i.imgur.com/eI8HD4J.png[/img]Week 3 of the SMITE OPL is super week, every team plays two series and with double the matches comes double the predictions! This week could decide who goes to LAN and who is forced into relegations so make sure you tune in to twitch.tv/cgtv_smite to catch all the action.[SPOILER=Click to view][/SPOILER]A top of the table clash to start of the week and this very well could be a preview of the CGPL LAN finals in mid April. Both of these teams have had strong early season performances and are looking to solidify their position as top dogs. Tainted Minds took out Sin Gaming in a close 2 - 0 whilst Team Pandamonium, swiftly felled the once mighty Dire Wolves 2 - 0. Only 1 game behind Team Pandamonium, Tainted Minds want to make their mark on the OCE SMITE scene and there's no better way to do that than to take out the reigning champs.Tainted Minds and Team Pandamonium will both be putting their full attention to this match this week as it is clearly their most difficult and have the most impact to the overall standings and the possibility of going to LAN. And despite likely being one of the best series of the split, Pandamonium should prove too strong for Tainted Minds and take this series 2 - 0.[SPOILER=Click to view][/SPOILER]This match showcases why no one (not even handsome and intelligent casters) can ever be totally accurate about how a season will play out before it begins. Before the beginning of the split, Dire Wolves were widely held to be the team to watch not only for split 1 but for the whole year, and have thus far disappointed on those expectations. A total record of 1 - 4 has them on the bottom of the table tied with their opponents Trident Esports. Trident have had their share of misery as well, losing mid-laner LloydInSpace to personal issues and moving star player theBeasttt out of his most comfortable role to fill that void.Trident though have shown flashes of potential with their squad, theBeasttt becoming more and more comfortable in the mid-lane and JustLaney regaining some of his old form from the ADC position. Nonetheless, the innate talent of Dire Wolves should show through in this game but Trident have the capability to take a game of last years runners-up and a 2 - 1 would be no surprise.[SPOILER=Click to view][/SPOILER]A rivalry matchup here to round of Day 1 of super week, both teams sitting in the middle of the pack and looking to make the final push to the CGPL LAN. Sin Gaming fell 0 - 2 to Tainted Minds while Avant Garde managed to get past Trident with a 2 - 1. Avant has to be wary of all opponents after that close scrape with Trident and will give Sin a lot of attention this week. Sin Gaming will have the looming shadow of their contest against Team Pandamonium on their minds so they may find themselves a little distracted, as well as missing star midlaner Agony.This series should still be a close one although Avant appears to be the stronger team overall and if they get on a roll can take down any opponent. A bit of simmering bad blood between the teams can also provide that extra motivation needed to push a player beyond their usual limits. While Sin taking a game off of Avant wouldn't be a surprise, Avant Garde seem to be the hungrier team and looking to make it to LAN right now, and to do that they need this to be a 2 - 0.[SPOILER=Click to view][/SPOILER]A rough week for Sin Gaming with two extremely difficult series for them. Sin Gaming's strongest players also happen to be the strongest players on Team Pandamonium. The Hs247 v Rowe matchup should be entertaining to watch but ultimately should go the way of Team Pandamonium. Sin's tough matches against Avant should serve to give them some good practice for this series but it likely won't be enough to take down top dogs (or bears) Pandamonium.[SPOILER=Click to view][/SPOILER]This is perhaps the toughest matchup of the week to call and a number of unknown factors can influence the outcome of this one. What order will the teams play their games in, the time of day and the state of Australian Internet at the time of play can all have a major impact on both team's performances. Ultimately, Avant Garde seem to have a plan in place for the season and have been studying hard for Dire Wolves all season long, whilst Dire Wolves seem to be a squad lacking direction. This one can go either way but at this point, I'm giving it to a hungry Avant team.[SPOILER=Click to view][/SPOILER]We round off the week with what I believe to be the most underrated series of the split as Trident Esports takes on Tainted Minds. Tainted Minds need to put it all on the line this week to solidify their place at LAN and should take out this series but Trident can play the role of spoil sport to almost any team in the OPL. If Tainted Minds want to be the best in OCE they will need to down Trident 2 - 0 but Trident are looking to keep themselves out of the bottom relegation spot and to do so they must take at least one game away from Tainted Minds.Guys if you have any predictions please share them below! Also note that these are my personal predictions and should not be considered BM against any team, simply how I feel those teams have performed previously and will perform in the week at hand.Stream: www.twitch.tv/cgtv_smite Time: 4PM AEDT Saturday 26th of March 2016 and Sunday 27th of March 2016
Tech giant Apple has struck a new pay deal with retail staff that locks in starting rates lower than supermarket checkout workers and probable pay cuts in real terms every year for the next four years.
Last year, Apple recorded revenues of $6.1 billion from its Australian operations and a profit of $88.5 million in the country, which was lower than the previous year after its operation paid a $154 million dividend to its US parent.

The 2013 net profit after tax was $52 million, down from $58.5 million in 2012.
The new pay deal was ratified by the Fair Work Commission on Thursday and will give Apple's lowest paid staff a base hourly rate of $20.55 from November.
President Obama popped in on the White House press briefing today for one of his first question-and-answer sessions since July. And the two big topics where this White House health care summit scheduled for February 25, as well as the subject of bipartisanship and both parties working together in Washington. To that end, the President said that, if his nominees for routine appointments keep getting held up in the Senate for no good reason, he would consider moving many of them through recess appointments “in the upcoming recess” which begins next week.
On health care, the President reiterated his pledge to get a bill done, similar to his Organizing for America compatriots today. He called the rate hike by Anthem Blue Cross in California a “preview of coming attractions,” and while he acknowledged there was little he could do about that, he maintained this is why a reform bill is so important. “I don't have authority to issue an order lowering everyone's rates, if I could, I would have done that already…. There's no shortcut in dealing with this issue… Without some action, it is very unlikely that we see any improvement over the current trajectory.” He added that this was the first year in history where more people were getting health care from the government than the private sector, and that the erosion of the employer-based system had to be shored up by something that controls costs and covers more people.
Speaking about the issue with nominees, Obama said that, while he respected the Senate's role to advise and consent, “qualified nominees have been held up despite having overwhelming support… That's not advise and consent, that's delay and obstruct.” He made note of the blanket hold, recently lifted, by Richard Shelby, and the 96-0 vote to confirm Martha Johnson to run the General Services Administration, which took 9 months. President Obama today asked Republican Congressional leaders to put a stop to all the holds on his nominees, and he said that if they persisted, “I will consider making several recess appointments during the upcoming recess.”
The President proceeded from the expectation that the Feb. 25 health care summit would actually take place, although he did not agree to any of the list of demands put forth by Republicans in their recent letter, particularly the idea of scrapping the bill entirely and starting over. He said that he's starting from scratch only in the sense that he would be open to ideas that meet core goals of coverage expansion and cost containment. What he would not do, he said, is to agree to every single aspect of a Republican wish list for health care without getting them to vote for it. “Bipartisanship can't be, I agree to all the things they believe in or want, and they agree to nothing that I believe in or want. That cannot be the price of bipartisanship … that's not how it works in any other walk of life.”
It's unclear how much more the President can concede on these points, anyway. The Senate health care bill is chock full of concessions to Republicans already. Presumably the idea of the meeting is to add on, or pretend to add on, one more layer of that, and then advance to a vote to get this done.
Obama said that the process of the last year had the effect of contaminating the substance of the bills. He thinks that a public airing of the relevant parts will actually increase public support in the process and the policy. In exchange, Republicans get a public showcase for their ideas.
He said that the White House has not refined the agenda for the health care summit, though he did say that he wanted to make sure the CBO would be available to answer questions. “Let's establish some common facts,” the President said.
Other topics included energy, financial regulation, Iran's nuclear program, and jobs.
Google Chrome users are probably familiar with the T. rex dinosaur that shows up when your computer is not connected to the Internet. The T. rex had short arms and therefore a lot of things were out of its reach. Chrome, like that dinosaur, too is having trouble reaching the Internet.
What's even more interesting is that the offline dinosaur in Chrome is also a game. Press the space bar to activate and your Chrome tab will quickly turn into a moderately addictive game. The T. rex will run and your mission is to prevent it from bumping into the saguaros.
The game is written in JavaScript and you can find the complete source code in the Chromium repository. Thanks Codepo8 for the discovery.
And it's not just about Chrome for desktop, the dinosaur game is available in Chrome for Android as well. Switch to airplane mode and give it a shot. The only difference is that instead of the space bar, you need to tap on the screen to jump / fly the dinosaur.
A 19-year-old boy has been detained by the police in Palghar near Mumbai for allegedly writing an "abusive" Facebook post against Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray. The police has not charged the teen yet; he has now been taken to the Cyber Crime cell in Thane."We are questioning him as we do not want to repeat the same mistakes committed a few days ago," an officer at Palghar police station told PTI, speaking on condition of anonymity.The detained boy's brother says even though the account belongs to the 19-year-old, he still could not have done this.The police is being careful after running into trouble over the arrest of two women last week, also in Palghar, for objecting to the shutdown of Mumbai on the day of Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray's cremation. Two Palghar policemen have been suspended after an inquiry into those arrests after nationwide outrage. But the charges against the two young women are yet to be dropped.The boy was detained there for questioning on a complaint filed by Raj Thackeray's party. Kundan Sankhe, the president of Thane rural unit of the MNS, claimed the boy had made "vulgar" comments about Raj Thackeray. He said, "Our Thane rural district MNS student wing president Bhavish complained to police and asked them to investigate the matter."A mob of MNS supporters reportedly surrounded the boy's home today and forced him to the police station.There were reports that the teenager was beaten up by the MNS workers before being handed over to the police, but his mother says they did not beat him in front of her."They did not beat him in front of me. I do not know what they did later... They told us not to worry if he has not done anything wrong... I am sure my boy has not done this. He is a poor boy. He would not have such guts," she said.Raj Thackeray is Bal Thackeray's nephew; he split from the Shiv Sena in 2006 and formed his own party, the MNS.The Shiv Sena had called for a shutdown in Palghar today in support of the policemen suspended for arresting the two girls. Because of the bandh, schools, colleges and markets remained closed. Bus services were limited. The courts were working, but not many people turned up there.There was heavy police presence all around. At least 500 police officers and the Rapid Action Force were posted to maintain peace. "People have joined the bandh on their own. The entire taluka is shut. Business establishments are closed," said Shiv Sena leader Prabhakar Raul.
NEW YORK—A statement from America's National Headquarters revealed Thursday that, after just two years heading the Executive Branch, President Barack Obama has been promoted to Senior Vice President of American Affairs.
Obama, whose work on health care reform reportedly caught the eye of the nation's higher-ups, has eagerly accepted the more prestigious new position and will join the 12 other members of the American Affairs division starting Monday. He replaces outgoing SVPAA Tom Coleman, who was promoted in February to Chief Administrative Officer of America's North Atlantic Branch.

Pending final approval from the National Board of Directors, Friday will be Obama's last day as President of the United States.
"Barack is clearly a go-getter and one of our brightest up-and-coming talents," Vice Chairman of America Bill Donaldson was quoted in the statement as saying. "His work in the financial and international sectors shows promise and a capacity for handling some of the more difficult issues this country faces. He is young and this will be a lot of responsibility for him, but we're excited to bring him to headquarters and watch him grow."

Sources close to the White House said the president was offered the position during a call last Wednesday from Associate Director of National Operations Dave Lennox. According to aides, Obama "jumped at the opportunity," believing he had accomplished all he could in his role as chief liaison between the national office and Congress.
Obama will be the second- youngest Senior Vice President of American Affairs in the country's history, the youngest being current General Manager of the United States Mark D'Angelo.
"When you become president, you always hope that something might open up at National before your term is out," said Obama, who as SVPAA will now receive matching 401(k) contributions, free access to the executive gym, and an annual bonus that includes a percentage of the GDP. "So when that call from the ADNO finally came, I was really excited. The fact that he actually took time out of his busy schedule to call me personally was a huge thrill."

"Dave said to me, 'Barack, how would you like to come to New York and work with the big boys?'" Obama continued. "And believe me, when Dave Lennox asks you to do something, you don't say no."
In his capacity as SVPAA, Obama will be the co-leader of a four-person team that reports directly to President of American Affairs Peter McNaughton and U.S. Co-Chair Helen Kristiniak. According to the National Headquarters website, Obama's job will primarily involve "facilitating real-time communications between commercial and residential sectors within the United States while working to invigorate foreign and domestic revenue streams through the development of more efficiently monetized diplomatic models."
Though the job consists of fewer menial tasks and more vacation time, beltway insiders said the position's main benefit is that it opens up a lot of doors for the president, who could step into Max Donnelly's shoes as Assistant Co-Chair of the Mid-Atlantic Coordinating Committee within the next 10 years.

"Some have called this a lateral move, but I couldn't disagree more," Andrew Sullivan wrote in The Atlantic. "All of Obama's heroes were SVPAAs at one point or another: Jeff Lawrence, Amy DeMuth, Thomas Jefferson, Dave McCormick, just to name a few."
"And it's no secret he's always had his eye on the Chief Intercontinental Adviser to the Director of U.S. and Global Affairs job," Sullivan added. "You can't make it that far staying in Washington. Just ask Kent Leventhal."
According to sources with knowledge of the hiring process, the decision to promote Obama came from the top. Looking to groom diverse new talents at the national level, Chief Executive Officer Ben Glick and Chairman of the Board Myron Bell reportedly narrowed the list of potential applicants to three names: Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Bob Chang.

Chancellor of America Molly Lipman, whom Obama has never directly spoken to, made the final decision.
"I am happy that Barack Obama has decided to take the position of Senior Vice President of American Affairs," Lipman said through a spokesperson. "As for who will take over as President of the United States, we are keeping our options open. The talent pool available through the traditional line of succession is limited, so we may be forced to bring in somebody from the outside."

Depending on when exactly you ask the question, Darren Aronofsky is one of the most adventurous and distinct American filmmakers currently working or, perhaps more accurately, trying to work. For many cinephiles, Aronofsky is a hit-and-miss artist, in the same vein as someone like Danny Boyle or Claire Denis, with new classics like Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream, and The Wrestler hovering above more ambitious projects like Noah or The Fountain. From my point of view, Aronofsky is an artist who has been limited only by his means: The Wrestler is far more fluid and impactful than Noah specifically because it was cheap(-ish) to make and therefore didn't require constant nitpicks from producers or other overseers.
That's perhaps exactly why Aronofsky's long-teased new movie, a mysterious relationship drama starring Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, seems so promising from afar. Almost nothing but the cast for the film, which also includes the likes of Domnhall Gleeson and Michelle Pfeiffer, has been announced thus far but during an interview in Reykjavik, he dropped a few facts that should fascinate any fan of the director. According to Indiewire, the filmmaker revealed that the new movie was shot entirely on 16mm, which would be reason enough to get curious about Aronofsky's project alone. On top of that, however, he also said that this will be his first film not working with Clint Mansell, who has been with him since Pi. Instead, the Sicario and The Theory of Everything composer Johann Johannsson will be putting together the score for Aronofsky's latest.
Conversely, Aronofsky has indeed worked with 16mm before, specifically in Pi, his exquisite, beguiling debut. Following the relative failure of Noah, a very good movie that got lambasted upon its release, it would make sense that Aronofsky might want to move back towards something more personal and less dependent on flashy visual effects. So, though the movie has big names like Bardem and Lawrence might suggest otherwise, Aronofsky's latest may be an attempt to reconnect and explore with the basic ideas that got him interested in movies. He did let out this last quote about the new movie during the Reykjavik discussion that hints at bigger ambitions, however. Here's what he said:
“I think all my early films were more about ideas…When it came to ‘Noah,' there was this clear environmental statement in the original gospel, which was interesting to push forward. My latest project probably has similar political intentions behind it, but first and foremost responsibility as a narrative filmmaker is making something that is emotional and can connect with an audience.”
From my angle, Aronofsky's film have always had a political undercurrent, even if the politics aren't particularly clean or simple or important in a national sense. Black Swan and The Wrestler consider identity politics and the liberating aspects of expression in ways that touch on matters of money, sexuality, and drugs, which are about as political as modern subjects go. Still, one has to be a little fascinated by what Aronofsky means by what he said, and I'm impatient to see how it will play out in this mysterious upcoming drama.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Thursday said there was no reason to worry about the curbs on H1B visas or the job security of Indian IT professionals working in the US for the time being as the Indian government is in talks with the US regarding this."Currently there are four bills in the US Congress about curbs on H1B visas. We are engaged (in a dialogue) with the US at very high level regarding this... We are making all efforts (through diplomatic channels) to ensure these bills are not passed," Ms Swaraj said in the Rajya Sabha."So there is no reason to worry about it as of now," she added.The minister pointed out that even before Donald Trump became President, there had been a "flip-flop" in the H1B visa policy by the US."In 1990 when H1B visas were first introduced, the cap was 65,000. In 2000 it was raised to 1,95,000 for three years. In 2004 the number of these visas was again reversed to 65,000 by the US. So there has been a flip-flop on this policy even before Donald Trump government," she said.The minister also informed the house that the visa facility extended to the spouse of the Indian professionals has not been withdrawn by the US so far.On illegal migrants, Ms Swaraj said that the US authorities have given a list of 271 persons who they have identified for deportation."We have asked for more details about these 271 persons. Once we check their antecedents and find they are actually Indian citizens, we'll provide them travel documents back to India so that they are not put behind bars by US authorities," she said.She said India will once again raise the issue of totalisation once "the jobs of Indian IT professionals are ensured to be secure".
The ice had emptied, save for the players who were not in the Edmonton Oilers' lineup for Monday night's game against the Carolina Hurricanes.
Among the holdovers was Connor McDavid, who continues to take steps back from a fractured clavicle.
Injured on Nov. 3, McDavid had his first practice with the team on New Year's Day. While he is still not involved in contact situations, he is taking faceoffs and participating in drills.
“We're asking each other, ‘Can he play tonight?' but that's not real,” said head coach Todd McLellan. “We're all aware of him getting closer and being more involved. I think he has found a way, as have some of the others who have returned to the ice, to energize our group. They're able to take some reps at high speed … it drags everybody else along.
“As soon as we can get him back, we will.”
McDavid underwent surgery to repair the damage caused when he slammed into the end boards under the weight of Philadelphia Flyers defencemen Michael Del Zotto and Brandon Manning.
McDavid had just found his stride when he was knocked out of the lineup just 13 games into his NHL career. He had scored five goals and 12 points.
“It's good to see him. I think he's feeling good now, but obviously, the team is going to take the time to make sure he's 100 per cent,” said centre Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, who required shoulder surgery April 23, 2013.
Nugent-Hopkins returned to the Oilers lineup on Oct. 7 that same year, and it took him a while to get up to speed.
“It can be a little bit frustrating,” Nugent-Hopkins said of the final hurdle in the recovery process. “You feel really good; everything is kind of firing, but there's always one thing, maybe two, that's holding you back a little bit.
“He looks like he's feeling good and I know talking to him he does feel strong, but it's just a matter of whether he gets hit or falls on it. Can it take that right now?
“Obviously, the team takes your feedback — the player knows his body best — but sometimes guys do want to come back a little early. You get antsy waiting to come back … (but) we've had so many shoulder injuries, so many upper-body injuries, that the team doctors and trainers know how to handle it now.”
Iiro Pakarinen, who left the lineup on Dec. 29 with an upper-body injury, and Nail Yakupov, out for 19 games with a sprained ankle, were also skating, as were Jujhar Khaira and Mark Fayne.

Taser International, the company that popularized the use of stun guns in everyday police work, is set to experiment with where Google Glass might take law enforcement. The company's co-founder and CEO, Rick Smith tells us that Taser has been accepted onto the Glass Explorer program and is excited about digging into the technology.
In our recent piece looking at how wearable camera technology like Google Glass might transform society, I mentioned how first-person perspective cameras could be useful for citizen eyewitnesses to crimes. However, the flipside of that is how police use the technology.
Taser got in touch following that article to tell us about its AXON Flex camera, the latest iteration of which launched last year and is worn by police officers to record evidence from incidents as they work their patrols. As the camera captures evidence, the video is sent by Bluetooth to an iPhone or Android device and streamed over 3G to Taser's cloud platform, Evidence.com. From here, officers can later watch back and download anything important.
Here's Taser's promo video for AXON Flex:
For more background on AXON Flex and Evidence.com, and the privacy issues they raise, it's worth checking out The Verge's look at the technology published earlier today. However, what's particularly interesting is where the technology is going next, and Google Glass could well be an important part of that.
Glass for cops
Talking to us earlier this week, Smith suggested that automated vehicle number plate recognition and driving license recognition were obvious quick wins, with face recognition of wanted criminals and missing persons a possibility further down the road. “We see this shifting to more real-time applications over the next decade,” he said, adding that Taser is working towards a future in which police records are gathered in real-time, using technology like voice-to-text conversion to capture statements and other spoken evidence. The company plans to roll such tech into Evidence.com.
While using a third-party cloud solution may seem like an odd step for police forces to take with such sensitive data, Smith says that it allows the technology to be introduced much more easily, quickly and cheaply than if it had to be integrated on-site with existing IT systems at each force's HQ. He says that 90-95% of the police forces using AXON Flex opt for using Evidence.com over integrating the cameras with their own systems. Data is protected with two-factor authentication logins (using Google Authenticator, SMS or email) and 256-bit SSL encryption.
While Smith says that Glass-style technologies will become part of everyday police work over the coming ten years, the next development Taser is working on is allowing officers to redact sections of videos recorded with AXON Flex so that they can be released for public consumption. Surprisingly, there has been less demand from police for live-streaming video. While you may think that allowing staff back at base to watch a live feed of what police in the field are seeing and doing would be a hotly demanded feature, the redaction capability is far higher up the list of what they want and are prepared to pay for.
Google Glass in its current form wouldn't be good enough for police use. Smith notes that a police-ready version would need strong low-light performance for nighttime encounters and a battery that can last throughout an officer's shift. The AXON Flex comes with a 12-hour battery for this reason – it's critical to officers' jobs, not just a mild inconvenience like if your smartphone battery dies in the middle of the afternoon while you're at work.
A decade from now, the average police officer could be a lot more like Robocop than you might think.

Claims that the United States is less safe under President Obama are not credible, former Secretary of State Colin Powell said onSunday.
He also challenged criticism by some (including former Vice President Dick Cheney, who say that by not using extreme interrogation techniques such as waterboarding on terror suspects the United States is more vulnerable.
"The point is made, 'We don't waterboard anymore or use extreme interrogation techniques.' Most of those extreme interrogation techniques and waterboarding were done away with in the Bush administration," Powell said. "They've been made officially done away with in this current administration."
"The Transportation Security Administration created by George Bush is still in action working in our airports; they take care of me every day that I go to an airport," Powell told moderator Bob Schieffer.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was also created under President Bush, "and it is still under President Obama working hard," he said. "Our counterterrorism authorities and forces are hard at work. Our law enforcement officials are hard at work. We have gone after the enemy in Afghanistan with 50,000 more troops, more predators are striking al Qaeda and Taliban leaders in Pakistan. We have continued the policies that President Bush put in place with respect to Iraq.
"The bottom line answer is the nation is still at risk. Terrorists are out there. They're trying to get through. But to suggest that somehow we have become much less safe because of the actions of the administration, I don't think that's borne out by the facts," Powell said.
He admitted he was "surprised" by the lack of coordination among different agencies in dealing with Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the suspect in the Christmas Day bombing attempt of an airliner.
"Should he have been given his Miranda rights either after 90 minutes or 15 hours? The story kept changing," Powell said. "I would have thought after all these years we would have had a process in place - either in the previous administration or in this administration - that when you get somebody like that, we all know how to respond and how to interrogate him, or not interrogate him. But he's in jail. He's facing trial. I don't think it will be a difficult trial to handle. And also he's still talking. They found other ways to interrogate him."
Powell stuck by his conviction that Guantanamo Bay prison facility should be closed. "I think Guantanamo has cost us a lot over the years in terms of our standing in the world and the way in which despots have hidden behind what we have at Guantanamo to justify their own positions," he said.
"I think we ought to remove this incentive that exists in the presence of Guantanamo to encourage people and to give radicals an opportunity to say, 'You see? This is what America is all about. They're all about torture and detention centers.'"
"Let's get this population of 192 sorted out," Powel said, adding that "I have no problem with them being tried here in the United States."
However, while he favors a federal court trial for Kaleid Sheik Mohammed, he said he would not have picked downtown New York City to try the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, opting rather for a secure military base, "where it would not become a circus."
For years, rappers have been pouring lean into both their rhymes and double cups. A few have been able to kick the nasty habit—while others prefer to merely fake the funk—but the abuse of promethazine has had an undeniably profound effect on the hip-hop community. And not the good kind, either.
Pimp C, A$AP Yams and DJ Screw died of accidental drug overdoses where codeine syrup was found to be, in part, the cause of death, Lil Wayne's lean addiction nearly killed Curren$y and inspired Chief Keef's habit, not to mention being the cause of his own health issues, and it wasn't until Gucci Mane dropped lean like a bad habit that he was able to resurrect his life and his career.

Still, despite the growing awareness of the side effects and health concerns related to the abuse of promethazine, many popular rappers continue to not only consume lean but also love to showcase the practice on their social media.
Last week, while browsing Instagram for potential story ideas, I came across the following post from Young Thug:
ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website
ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website
The caption attached to this haunting image of Thugger—eyes glassy, sickly looking and staring off into the distance—reads, "My eyes turn YELLOW when I drank TUSS...."
There is no emoji present to convey Thug's feelings on the side effect—Is he scared? Concerned? Proud? Does he find it amusing?—but the fact that he chose to not only post the image but also point out that Tussionex abuse is what he believes is causing his eyes to turn yellow is concerning.
"The yellowing of the eyes is what we call jaundice and should be a worrisome sign that one's liver is not in good shape," explained Harlem-based emergency room physician Dr. Esther Ihezie when I spoke with her via e-mail. "[Young Thug] probably consumed large doses of the cough syrup—the syrups contain [either] promethazine, codeine or acetaminophen—which when consumed in large doses can cause liver damage."
A growing misconception among those who abuse lean is that its effects will only take a toll on the brain and body with extended use. However, according to Dr. Ihezie, who attended SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse and did her residency in Emergency Medicine at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, liver injury can occur from just one episode.
"These medications contain small dosages of each ingredient so when people try to get the desired euphoria, they end up consuming large, toxic doses that can cause organ damage," said Ihezie. "For Tylenol, it is recommended that you don't go over three-to-four grams a day or else your liver takes a hit. Essentially, what I am saying is that liver injury from does not take time; it can happen in one episode."
While treatment for an addiction to promethazine, according to Ihezie, is among the nastiest and most difficult, what lean abusers like Young Thug need to be aware of beyond peripheral nerve damage, spasms, hallucinations, vomiting, and diarrhea, is that liver failure can ultimately be fatal. "Your liver is responsible for clearing toxins, producing clotting factors so you don't bleed to death, produces albumin which prevents you from developing ascites and also helps the kidney do its job," Ihezie added.
To make matters worse, liver damage is irreversible. The only way to treat a failing liver that has suffered the effects of short or long-term promethazine abuse is to get a transplant, which, Dr. Ihezie says, isn't exactly a walk in the park. "I know for a fact that people die every day from their disease [while] waiting on those lists."
I don't expect Young Thug to read this article—although if he does see it pop up on his timeline, my fingers are crossed that he gives it a click—but my hope is that someone who likes Young Thug, follows him on social media or listens to his music is able to realize that drug abuse is not as cool as Young Thug and rappers like him make it out to be. It's deadly.
Don't take my word for it, though. Just ask Dr. Ihezie: "My advice to Young Thug is to go see your doctor immediately. The high you seek [from those substances] is definitely not worth it."
Editor's Note: A previous version of this article indicated that all cough syrups contain "promethazine/codeine/acetaminophen." To be clear, not all cough syrups contain all three ingredients, but rather one or more of these ingredients.

The latest meeting of the University of Toronto Student's Union (UTSU) board of directors this June contained the introduction of two controversial motions; the approval of the report on the new hiring procedure for the vp campus life, and a motion to accept the CRO report for the recent UTSU elections.
Motion to approve report on hiring procedure
At the board's last meeting, Akshan Bansal was hired as the new vp campus life. The decision was made following several changes to the original hiring procedure — controversy had arisen from the number of outgoing union executives on the initial hiring committee.
At the June meeting, a motion was put forward to approve the report on the changes to the hiring process. The approval of the report would acknowledge that the decisions made at the last board meeting — during which the changes were introduced — were valid and constitutional. However, the result of the vote was insufficient to pass the motion.
“I felt satisfied that the motion to approve the report failed. Although it was related purely to the procedure, it made sense solely on that basis for the board to reject the report,” stated Ryan Gomes, vice president internal & services.
Similar sentiments were echoed by Vere-Marie Khan, vice president university affairs, who explained, “the failure of the motion is an indicator that majority of the board finds that there was a problem in the way [the hiring of the vp campus life] was conducted and eventually upheld… I believe it is a message from our board that we should ensure that all problems or concerns that they have with any process we do should be investigated and revisited to the best of our ability.”
Problematic hiring process
According to Gomes and Khan, the central issue with the hiring process was inaccessibility; both expressed that the timing and location of the hiring meeting — which was held at UTM — as well as the technical difficulties associated with the electronic communications, led to a disproportionately low number of board members in attendance.
“To elect an executive who will be on equal footing as other execs who have been elected across both campuses, I feel that the vast majority of the board should be present. Without many board members being present, some colleges or divisions wouldn't have a say in their selection as their representatives would be absent, and I don't think that's appropriate in the slightest,” Gomes stated.
Allegations of executive misconduct
In addition to dissent regarding the hiring procedure, allegations of misconduct on behalf of Bansal were also brought forward. However, further discussion was ruled out of order, with UTSU president Ben Coleman stating that the executive review committee would deal with allegations against the conduct of the executives.
“I believe [the allegations] should have been allowed to be discussed, but as it was ruled out of order. I believe we should wait for our internal processes (ie. the executive review committee) to begin its own proceedings and bring those allegations to light in due course,” Gomes said.
Coleman emphasized that the motion to approve the report on the hiring procedure is not a means to alter the hiring of Bansal, but rather a means of validating the hiring process.
Stephen Warner, a Victoria College board director, who opened the discussion on the vp campus life allegations, explained that “Procedurally, the failure of the motion is simply symbolic; the chair stated at the meeting that failing the motion did not reverse the decision of appointing the vp campus life. I think that the failure of the motion should be a warning bell to the executive and to the executive review committee that there are confidence issues from many members of the board regarding [Bansal].”
There is the possibility of a motion to impeach Bansal — it would be introduced at the board's next meeting on July 12.
CRO report on recent elections
The other report that received criticism during the meeting was from the out-going CRO of the recent elections.
At the onset of the discussion, Coleman amended the motion to recognize the inaccuracy and error in reporting the numbers of votes, referring the report to the elections and referenda committee for review. The motion passed as such.
“This is not a great report,” Coleman said, and went on to explain that the voting numbers in the report do not include paper ballots, but instead only online votes.
Worryingly, two sets of numbers in the report did not match with the online vote numbers, with their percentages adding up to over 100 per cent, a figure that is impossible given the system used.
Gomes noted his dissatisfaction with the report, stating, “I personally don't feel there are any merits to this report — it feels like it was thrown together haphazardly and does not reflect the depth and thought-out reasoning that would be expected from such a report.”
There were several attempts by the UTSU executives to get in touch with the CRO, but Gomes explained that they were unsuccessful.
The follow-up to the report will be a review by the elections and referenda committee. However, Gomes feels that the recommendations offered in the CRO's report are “highly problematic.” “…particularly the ones about arms-length parties,” he said, adding, “I don't think they're particularly useful — in fact, I think they could even be destructive, given the issues regarding online sites giving teams demerit points even though they weren't connected to them in any way. Personally, I don't think the ERC will implement any of them.”
Gomes does, however, plan on introducing a requirement to the elections & referenda committee that the CRO must submit a report that meets certain standards before they receive pay or are considered to have completed their term, in hopes of subverting similar problems in future.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article made reference to an UTSU elections review committee in error. The body in question is the elections and referenda committee. This article has been updated to reflect the change.
A reference group has been set up to examine black lung disease in the coal industry.
A fifth case of black lung disease has been confirmed in Queensland, prompting suggestions the numbers so far are just the "tip of the iceberg."
The potentially fatal disease, which can affect coal workers, was thought to have been eradicated in Australia, until new cases were discovered in Queensland's coal industry last year.

CFMEU state mining and energy division president Steve Smyth said the latest man to be diagnosed with black lung had submitted documents for a worker's compensation claim this week and his X-rays and scans had been sent to the United States for further examination.
"This actually now, unfortunately, may be the tip of the iceberg," he said.
"We believe that, whilst we welcome the review of the health scheme, that will not go far enough.
"There needs to be a public inquiry with an independent commissioner with public submissions to get to the bottom of this, [and the question of] how we can have such a terrible disease that people thought was eradicated, suddenly be back and maybe worse than ever."
Queensland's Department for Natural Resources and Mines confirmed the latest case this afternoon.
Apart from the five confirmed cases of black lung so far, there are another five 'potential cases,' in which the patients are waiting for the results of tests.
It's a terrible state of affairs when here in Queensland in the 21st century we don't' have qualified people that can read these X-rays, for a disease that has been around since the 18th and 19th centuries. CFMEU state mining and energy division president Steve Smyth
Mr Smyth said those potential cases included one Central Queensland man in his aged in his 30s, who had scans yesterday and now faced an anxious wait for results.
He repeated the union's claim that Australia lacked medical experts with the expertise to identify black lung disease from X-rays and other scans.
"Whilst we have trained and qualified radiologists here, we don't have people that can read these X-rays to a B-Reader standard.
"They say they will have, but they don't.
"That has been proven by the number of cases that have all been confirmed in the United States [after Australian X-rays were sent there] or have been confirmed by a lung biopsy, which is a very invasive procedure.
"It's a terrible state of affairs when here in Queensland in the 21st century we don't' have qualified people that can read these X-rays, for a disease that has been around since the 18th and 19th centuries."
A reference group examining the re-emergence of black lung is due meet in Brisbane next week.
Monash university's Professor Malcolm Sim, who is part of that group, said it was too early to say whether the current number of cases was 'the tip of the iceberg.'
"This is what we have been asked to do — to try and assess the extent of that and we will be doing that in several ways," he said.
Perhaps what is needed is a greater awareness of the dust exposure in coal mines and also look at the ways the medical monitoring is reported back to the mines department. Professor Malcolm Sim of Monash University
"One [way] is that we will be doing a review of a random set of X-rays that are currently being compiled.
"So they will be reviewed by a panel of radiologists and respiratory physicians and we will assess the results of that and compare that against the original X-ray reports.
"That is really the only way that we can get some clarity around that issue.
"It's a really important one and we need to do it fairly quickly."
Professor Sim also rejected suggestions by the CFMEU that Queensland lacked suitably skilled radiologists to identify black lung cases.
"I think we do have a well-trained group of professionals in this country," he said.
"Perhaps what is needed is a greater awareness of the dust exposure in coal mines and also look at the ways the medical monitoring is reported back to the mines department."
The amendment was part of the fiscal 2017 defense appropriations bill, and actually passed through the House twice in 2014 and 2015, but was removed by the Senate on both occasions. After Sunday's tragedy, the measure's opponents pointed to suspected Islamic State sympathizer Omar Mateen's attack on a gay nightclub to justify giving law enforcement increased spying powers and easier access to private data.
"Sunday's deadly attack proves once again that the terror threat has not dissipated," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) said during the bill's debate. "Now is not the time to block a critical investigative tool."
Law enforcement officials investigating Sunday's events are trying to determine whether Mateen was in contact with any terrorist groups. Like the shootings in San Bernardino and the subsequent privacy debate, the measure's detractors say this bill would make it more difficult for law enforcement to search encrypted phones or computers. Those same opponents believe the encryption technology included in the latest phones and messaging apps will prevent the government from obtaining crucial information even in cases where they have a warrant. On the other hand, privacy advocates argued those who voted against the amendment were using "fear tactics" to give law enforcement easier access to private data.
"It's unfortunate my colleagues would take advantage of that situation," the measure's co-author Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) said.
Supporters and privacy advocates point out that the bill simply would prevent the NSA or CIA from requiring companies to alter the products, weaken encryption or leave a backdoor for law enforcement. According to Massie, the amendment "does not take any tools away from those that want to investigate what happened in Orlando."
ALL BALL NERVE CENTER — What if I told you that someone had put together a hilarious spoof of ESPN's terrific 30 For 30 documentary series? Well, it's true — the people at Yahoo's Screen Sketchy have poked fun at the ridiculousness of Michael Jordan‘s iconic cartoon movie Space Jam in the best way possible: By talking about it as if it were completely serious. As one of the talking heads notes in the video, “I was home watching TV, when they broke in and said Michael Jordan is teaming up with a bunny to take on a team of alien basketball players.”

The Metropolitan Police has dropped an investigation into alleged comments by referee Mark Clattenburg towards Chelsea's John Obi Mikel and Juan Mata.
Police said there was no evidence an offence was committed during Manchester United's 3-2 win over Chelsea.
The Football Association launched its own investigation that will continue and Chelsea made an official complaint to the FA that solely concerned Mikel.
Clattenburg has always denied the allegation he used racial words.
Chelsea's complaint came after the police had already begun its investigation and followed a thorough investigation, which they claimed was led by outside legal counsel and used information from interviews with club players and staff.
Mark Clattenburg timeline 28 Oct: Sends off Ivanovic and Torres, as Chelsea lose to Manchester United. Accused of using "inappropriate language" to two Chelsea players - John Obi Mikel and Juan Mata. Chelsea complains to Premier League delegate. 29 Oct: Offered full support of referees' union, but is stood down for next round of matches. FA starts investigation, Society of Black Lawyers sends a letter to the Metropolitan Police calling for a legal investigation. 30 Oct: Met Police begin investigation. 31 Oct: Chelsea lodge formal complaint with FA over Mikel but decide not to pursue allegations against Juan Mata. 13 Nov: Met Police drop investigation.
Police said in a statement on Tuesday: "Inquiries were made and no victims have come forward. The matter will remain as a recorded incident.
"Without a victim and/or any evidence that any offence has been committed, the matter cannot currently be investigated.
"If the situation changes and a victim and/or evidence to support an allegation of a crime comes to police attention, then further inquiries will, if appropriate, be made."
Earlier on Tuesday, Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck insisted the club are not hypocrites for supporting skipper John Terry while lodging a complaint against Clattenburg.
Buck said Chelsea has a "duty of care" towards Terry even though he was banned for four matches for racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand.
Buck told London's Evening Standard newspaper: "Suppose we had tried to sweep this under the rug and said to the various players, 'Look, it's not a big deal and the press are going to be all over us, maybe you want to reconsider'. If that had leaked out, we would've really been crucified."
Police started their probe after a complaint from outside the game.
The Football Association is expected to announce the outcome of its investigation on Friday.
The governing body has spoken to Clattenburg, along with assistant referees Michael McDonough and Simon Long and fourth official Michael Jones, who were on duty with him at Stamford Bridge.
It is believed all the other officials, who were wired up together with Clattenburg, have said they did not hear any use of the racial terms alleged by Chelsea.
FA officials are keen to ensure a swift conclusion to the case, which follows the recent four-match ban handed to Terry for racist abuse.
Clattenburg returned to training with the Select Group of referees on Monday for the first time since the start of the investigations.
But he will not take charge of a top-flight match this weekend, having been omitted from the list of match officials for the third straight week in the list issued by the Premier League.
The 37-year-old is viewed by the Professional Game Match Officials, the referees' organisation, as one of the leading officials in the country.
He regularly referees games in European competitions and was put in charge of the League Cup final in February and the Olympic final between Brazil and Mexico in August.
The hits keep coming for Leigh Alexander and her corrupt benefactors, such as Gamasutra. After my articles last week initially started the fire, we further learned that Leigh has a nasty propensity for racist language and violent imagery. Late this afternoon, Breitbart.com's Milo Yiannopoulos broke perhaps the biggest story yet, revealing that mainstream gaming journalists use a master email list to facilitate propaganda and collusion. GamerGate has exploded once again, and is now approaching it's previous all-time high on Twitter.
Earlier this week, sources provided me with even more disturbing material from our Dear Leader's Twitter account. You would think she would just shut that shit down by now, or at least pay someone to comb through it. But apparently she thinks she's untouchable (that's what our anonymous industry source believes as well). Here's the first one, where she says the drunken Irish population of Massachusetts is responsible for their Republican Party voter base:
In the next tweet, she talks about a “hood rat” kicking her ass back in the 7th grade. It seems everything can be traced back to this time period in Leigh's life:
This tweet really could have an article of it's own based around it. If you've spent anytime following these SJWs on Twitter, you will see that they commonly cry about what they call “punching down.” If you look back at Nathan Grayson‘s Twitter, you can witness him crying to Adam Baldwin because the Firefly star mentioned Grayson and Zoe Quinn in a tweet. This is something that others talked about as well, including Jenn Frank and Leigh Alexander. Well, simply add this to the long list of things that the Dear Leader is disingenuous about. Here, witness her advise game designer Steve Gaynor to do exactly what all the feminists whine about our high profile supporters doing:
This is a woman who has no problems preaching one thing, and then acting in a completely opposite fashion. She is a phony who uses her position of privilege to entrench a gender hierarchy, rather than strive towards the elimination of gender roles. She gets rich off a “patriarchy” she claims to despise, all while being dismissive to the past and current hardships of other marginalized people. How can the mainstream media continue to perpetuate blatantly false narratives like “Leigh Alexander, champion of the oppressed?” With just the smallest amount of research, the idea becomes laughable.

EDIT: I was right! They did indeed nerf the "limitless" spirits and added a 50 spirit cap at release. Still sweet though!
So yes, I'm excited about desecrate + detonate dead like everyone else... but I'm super excited by the following idea Cast on Crit ("CoC") and would be happy to hear your suggestions on this:
BACKGROUND
So we all hate-to-love or love-to-hate cast on crit builds, but it has always had a few key issues. 1. Reflect. 2. Reflect. 3. Reflect. 4. Thorns (which really is kinda like reflect). 5. Kills your GPU (sorry can't help you here)
The new raging spirit skill seems to solve that problems 1 to 3. Minion attacks don't reflect damage on to you but minions never fit into CoC builds due to limits on the number available. Most have capped limits, and those that don't were restricted by corpses (dominating blow) or drops (animate weapon). Finally, we have a minion type that's not restricted in any of these ways.
MAIN SKILL
Cast on Crit
Spectral Throw or Split Arrow
LMP or Chain
RAGING SPIRIT
Multistrike
Melee Splash
Other potential support ideas: Melee Physical Damage, Blind, Knockback, Faster attack
PLAY STYLE
Same as a CoC build but instead of casting tonnes of spells, you create tonnes of skulls that JUST OBLITERATE EVERYTHING.
You're immune to reflect.
Thorns would still hurt you on your ST or Arrow attacks, but not on your Raging Spirit hits.
I'm guessing it'll be pretty decent for bosses (especially for those which have adds) as well as your skulls will all concentrate on one target instead of casting fireballs in 5 different directions.
Buy a new GPU to support the 100 over flying skulls you'll have floating on your screen
NERF POTENTIAL
I suspect this will likely be nerfed. Probably even before it gets released. If so, I'd be a sad panda. Last edited by dlrr on Jan 30, 2014, 2:18:20 AM
Scouting The Gates of Hell: A Visit To The Abandoned Glenwood Power Plant
For years, I've been interested in scouting the Gates of Hell. Which, oddly enough, happens to be in Yonkers.
Located on the shores of the Hudson, this is the local nickname for the Glenwood Power Plant, built from 1904 – 1906 and in operation until 1963. It has been abandoned ever since.
For most of my time as a scout, it's been off-limits due to safety issues. However, in the past few years, its new owners have been working hard to stabilize it for its eventual rebirth as an arts-centered events complex, and I finally had a chance to visit this past week.
The Glenwood Power plant was originally built by the New York Central Railroad to provide electricity for its tracks heading north from Grand Central. It was later sold to Edison Light & Electric in 1936 and converted from coal to oil.
Today, walking amongst its buildings is like exploring a post-apocalyptic ghost town.
Though much has been cleared away (most of its machinery was sold for scrap in 1965), there are still some fantastic original elements, like this electrical pole visible from the Glenwood train stop:
I love this boarded-up doorway…
…which still has an ENTRANCE sign written across the top:
Piles of bricks are everywhere, some with really intricate patterns:
Hanging a left through two buildings near the river…
…we passed through a door…
…and arrived in the grandest of the four buildings on the complex: the gorgeous, cathedral-like turbine hall:
This atrium space was originally home to the plant's turbines, long since removed:
I love the latticework leading up to the ceiling – would be amazing if the glass was one day restored.
The floors on the northern end are slowly being reinstalled – watch your step…
Meanwhile, the southern wall has become a canvas of sorts:
The turbine hall's overhead crane is still in place…
…hook still ready for work:
Here's a look at the crane's machinery up top…
…a pretty impressive assembly of cogs, courtesy of Philadelphia's Alfred Box & Co:
View from one of the side floors:
Looking north:
Scouting NY readers know I'm a big fan of skybridges…
…and man do I love the bridge connecting Glenwood's turbine hall to the neighboring substation building…
…with gorgeous views of the Hudson:
What makes it especially distinctive are the two beautiful light stanchions…
…which just scream the era they hail from:
Really hoping to see these working again someday:
The substation building is dominated by four enormous floor-mounted rotary converters, used to convert alternating current to direct current for third rail power:
Each unit has its own distinct character…
A second for comparison. Amazing how industrial symmetry can be so gorgeous:
A peek below reveals quite a drop:
Next time you see it, this might be a restaurant:
A bit of floor tile work that has managed to survive:
The western end of the floor:
There's no shortage of great industrial staircases:
The rest of the floors in the substation are pretty barren…
But you can always count on an impressive view:
I took a quick peek in this smaller building on the southwestern end of the property…
Here, the floor has completely caved in…
…and as water from the Hudson surges against the shore below, the sound of waves crashing explodes through the room like an echo chamber.
Some of the most interesting spaces can be found just walking between the buildings.
Love this passageway at the eastern end…
…strewn with all sorts of industrial bits that I assume once did something vital:
There's quite a lot of interesting salvage spread about the grounds…
…which hopefully will be reintegrated back into the complex:
One particularly haunting ruin: the skeletal remains of the docks at the southern end of the property. In 1929, a worker at the plant drowned here after being pinned underwater by a concrete bucket. These may someday be rebuilt to allow boat access from New York City:
And finally, the view from the roof:
It's nothing short of tragic that Glenwood's grandeur was allowed to rot for decades, and I'm very much hoping it finds a new, assured existence as an arts/events space ala Dia:Beacon in the coming years. In the meantime, they're willing to consider paying film/photo shoots, which will obviously help fund the restoration. Blade Runner 2, I'm looking in your direction…
As it turns out, the Gates of Hell are a lot more beautiful than you might have thought.

Like a walk-on who becomes the star of the team, Jumps Restaurant has achieved much more than it promised in its early days as a glorified coffee shop.
The Grosse Pointe Farms restaurant started on the lower level of its small building. It moved up one flight to much more appealing first-floor quarters where it has flourished quietly for 27 years, with a loyal fan base.
It is unpretentious yet has high culinary standards.
The restaurant has gained steadily in scope and ambition under proprietors Chad and Mavelle Stewart, she in the front of the house, with their daughter Nicole, and he in the open kitchen. With Stewart in the kitchen is Brandon Koskoszki, who has been there since he was just 11 with his stepfather and their colleague, Andrew Sipley.
It's a close-knit group and that longevity really counts.
The menu has just had its seasonal change. Certain dishes are perennials, including pecan-crusted whitefish served with sweet potato gratin, caramelized cauliflower and fig gastrique and the soup du every jour, chicken chili. Other sturdier stuff has just been added to the lineup, including linguini with meatballs and marinara sauce, and porcini-dusted tenderloin and at the top of the price scale at $38, grilled rack of lamb.
My favorite dish at a recent visit was shrimp Bolognese over wide pappardelle noodles that included ground shrimp with garlic, as well as large whole shrimp, the meat sauce applied subtly, a dish I will go back for. Also joining the cool weather lineup is such sturdy stuff as lobster mac and cheese — which is also on the lunch menu — braised beef short ribs, and pan-roasted veal chop.
Breakfast is simpler, but does feature burritos with Bavarian ham and hot pepper jack, and quesadillas with wild boar and roasted poblano sausage, along with salsa and guacamole.
Chad and staff do not neglect desserts. Eyes usually widen at the apple tart with whisky caramel sauce and especially the individual baked Alaska. That vintage treat is rarely seen, and I can't recall another local spot that serves it.
The setting is a single room with banquettes and linen-covered tables nicely spaced for quiet dining. There are a few seats at the bar overlooking the kitchen.
And in keeping with the low-key nature of Jumps, the entrance is in the rear, along with the parking.

Wow. I am still taken aback by what we were all a part of. The turnout to the Salt Lake Comic Con was tremendous. Seeing the carpet on the floor was a rare site, while seeing amazing costumes was not. For three days the Salt Palace was jam packed with people geeking out. This con wasn't just a big deal for local fans of all things comics, but for the Salt Lake Valley. According to the Governor's office this was the largest convention ever held in Utah. Our first year we rivaled some of the biggest comic conventions in the nation.Because of this there were some hiccups, but nothing catastrophic. Even the long lines it didn't seem to get most of the attendees down. In the same sentence we would hear, "I just waited for two hours to get in here and it is so awesome!"
There was lots to do, and even more to check out. If you didn't want to wait in line for a signature there were tons of vendors with amazing stuff to buy. If you didn't feel like spending cash you could attend one of the panels. Or maybe take a photo with one of the many cosplay groups there. The Ghostbusters of Salt Lake and the 501st had a huge presence.
Here is what the official Salt Lake Comic Con had to say in response to the event:
According to fire marshalls and Salt Palace Convention personnel we had 70-80,000 people attend Saturday which makes 2013 Salt Lake Comic Con the largest 1st year Comic Con in the nation. The Governor's office tells us we had the largest convention of any kind in the State of Utah.You were a part of history. Next year Salt Lake Comic Con will rival San Diego, thanks to you. There were some glitches, without a doubt. We will make sure that next year, things will be better in every way.
When Stan Lee tells you at the last minute he's willing to come to Salt Lake City for your first Comic Con, do you say, "Sorry Stan, we don't have enough time to plan for your participation."
When Adam West and William Shatner tell you in the last week that they will agree for the first time in history to be on stage together, do you say, "Sorry Gods of Geeks, we don't have enough time to plan for this."
We did the best we could. And we hope that you, our fans, sponsors, vendors, volunteers, guests will look at the best that we did, rather than the worst. You'll find whatever you're looking for.
Thanks again for making this a super fun, record breaking event.
Those are some big numbers. Thanks to all of those that stopped by and said, "Hello." And a special thanks to all the cosplayers that let us take their picture to post up on the site. We have shared some in our posts about Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3. For all of our pictures of the cosplayers visit our FaceBook page. Oh, and of course go check out our audio recording of Stan Lee's Q and A. We will definitely see you all at next year's Comic Con in Salt Lake City.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- “Man, your boy looked good in the Sugar Bowl,” they tell Bobby Ramsay.
Ramsay has heard that phrase, he said, about 150 times since January. He's heard it from fans around town in Yulee, Fla. He's heard it from fellow high school coaches at clinics. He's heard it from college coaches who have stopped through scouting talent.
If Ramsay turned on the radio, flipped on the TV or simply walked the streets here in Tuscaloosa, he'd hear about his former running back even more. In fact, he might be overwhelmed by the number of people saying how good Derrick Henry looked for Alabama in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma: 161 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns. When Henry broke his 43-yard touchdown run the fourth quarter, Ramsay said he received something like 18 text messages in under 30 seconds.

It's easy to see why people got excited. The run had the look of a seminal moment for the former five-star athlete who set the national career rushing yards record at Yulee High. The 6-foot-3, 243-pound talent finally showed on a national stage why he was so highly sought after. After carrying the ball minimally throughout the regular season, he blew people away in the bowl game.
All told, Henry ran for 382 yards and three touchdowns as a true freshman. And now? Despite being the backup to T.J. Yeldon, he's listed on the sports betting website Bovada as 28-to-1 to win the Heisman Trophy, ahead of Dak Prescott, Duke Johnson and Myles Jack.
Too big? Please
It's almost laughable to think about it now, but for a long time people questioned whether Henry was cut out to be a running back. He was too big, they thought, too bulky to fit through running lanes. He was too tall to have the proper pad level.
And then there was the Sugar Bowl.
Somewhere in Yulee, Ramsay smiled. What he'd seen in high school and what he saw in bits and pieces throughout the season was showing up on a much larger, unavoidable scale: Henry was meant to play running back.
“I told some people, ‘Man, that looked just like high school. Those DBs didn't want to tackle him any more than the DBs who played here,'” Ramsay said. “The first touchdown he scored, I was joking, ‘That kid from Oklahoma, he's running with Derrick so he won't get yelled at when he goes back to the bench.' He wasn't going to try and get him on the ground.”
No one wants to tackle Henry, not even his teammates.
Tide linebacker Reggie Ragland, no slouch at 6-2 and 259 pounds, described his meetings with Henry during practice as both “mean” and “peaceful” because they can't take one another to the ground.
“He's a big guy,” he said of Henry. “A lot of people are scared to tackle him.”
Said Henry: “During the Oklahoma game, I could tell that they didn't want to tackle me. I just kept the mindset of being physical and keep running hard so everything will open up.”
Growing pains
Henry says one of his goals is to be a starter, but for now he's “focused on getting better and becoming a complete player.”
A year ago that might not have been the case.
Like most blue-chip recruits, Henry first had to deal with reality. Though his talent was undeniable, there were things he hadn't yet mastered. At Yulee High, he didn't have to block, pass protect or catch passes out of the backfield. Ramsay only needed him to run the ball. But at Alabama, he wouldn't see the field until he could do it all.
“Not getting that much playing time really taught me a lot,” Henry said. There wasn't a game during the regular season where he carried the ball more than six times. “It humbled me. Everything isn't just going to come to you. You have to work for it. You have to take time. This is college football so it's more technique. You have to put more effort into by watching film and really paying attention to the little things”
Saban said the light came on for Henry in the lead up to the Sugar Bowl. Like a lot of freshmen, the chance for extra practice time paid off.
Now he's taking that momentum and running with it.
"Derrick Henry has had a fabulous spring," Saban said on Wednesday. "He picked up right where he left off at bowl practice last year. He works really hard. He runs really hard. He plays with a lot of toughness. He gets it."
Everything has changed, nothing has changed
In a way, Henry is built to be the center of attention. At Yulee High, he was the biggest thing going. As early as the ninth grade, Ramsay said, “They could play football for 500 years in our county and there's going to be no one better than him.”
“I think it's helping him now,” Ramsay said. “They protected him from that as a freshman. Now he's going to have a little more on his plate. … It's crazy because he hasn't played a ton but I've got people from Alabama, and these are people who have been around the program for years, who have said they haven't ever seen a guy with this much popularity.
“In a town where every other street is named after Paul Bryant, for someone to say that is big.”
Has Henry changed? Not according to Ramsay: “Nothing. Same guy. Nothing different.”
“Offseason has been good,” Henry said in the most understated way possible. “Coming back from the Sugar Bowl and getting back to lifting weights and doing 4th Quarter [Program], it's been going well. Just trying to get better.”
That simple, singular focus will suit him well. As spring practice wraps up and the march toward the regular season intensifies, so will the scrutiny.
What will aid him most will be his work ethic, the same determination that helped him get through the lows of last season and reach the high of the Sugar Bowl.
“Right now he's in a very comfortable place,” Ramsay said. “Initially all freshmen go through the process of being in a new place and having a new way of doing things. One thing with Derrick is he's never let it affect his effort level. ... Every time I talked to [running backs coach Burton Burns] about it, he'd say, ‘Oh man, We want all the guys to be like Derrick. He's pulling G.A.'s aside to work on things extra after practice, he's getting extra film work.'”
A moment later, Ramsay put an exclamation point on the subject.
“He's not expecting to have rose pedals thrown at his feet,” he said of Henry.
Ramsay's boy looked awfully good in one game, but both he and Henry understand that last season was only the first step. What comes next is a whole different set of challenges.
Rob Edwards (seen here in 2000 with Sarah Fisher's Indianapolis 500 car) has joined Andretti Autosport (Photo: RICH MILLER)
The IndyCar shakeup continues, but this portion of it is outside the cockpit.
Following the departure of longtime team director Kyle Moyer to Team Penske, Andretti Autosport has hired Rob Edwards from Schmidt Peterson Motorsports.
Edwards becomes Andretti Autosport's director of race operations and engineering, effectively immediately, the team confirmed Monday.
Under Edwards' direction, the team co-owned by Sam Schmidt and Ric Peterson won four races over the past two seasons with Simon Pagenaud driving the No. 77 car. Pagenaud signed with Roger Penske's team last fall. James Hinchcliffe, formerly with Andretti, was hired as Pagenaud's replacement.
Edwards also worked for Schmidt when the team helped with Dan Wheldon's Indianapolis 500-winning entry.
"His experience in racing will be valuable in moving our organization forward across multiple racing platforms," Michael Andretti said in a statement.
In confirming Edwards' hiring, Andretti's team said George Klotz will remain team manager of the IndyCar program with Dave Popielarz (Indy Lights) and Fran Reilly (Pro Mazda) the other team managers.
Edwards won't have to move as both teams are based in Indianapolis.
Andretti Autosport is the reigning champion of the Indianapolis 500, having fielded the No. 28 car of Ryan Hunter-Reay last May. The team has won the 500 three times since 2005 with three different drivers: Wheldon in 2005, Dario Franchitti in 2007 and Hunter-Reay last year.
But while some Democrats see the movement as providing a political boost, the party's alignment with the eclectic mix of protesters makes others nervous. They see the prospect of the protesters' pushing the party dangerously to the left — just as the Tea Party has often pushed Republicans farther to the right and made for intraparty run-ins.
Mr. Obama has spoken sympathetically of the Wall Street protests, saying they reflect “the frustration” that many struggling Americans are feeling. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Nancy Pelosi , the House Democratic leader, have sounded similar themes.
The role of groups like the Democratic campaign committee and Mr. Podesta's group, sometimes working in recent weeks with labor unions, moves support from talking points to the realm of organizational guidance.
It is not at all clear whether the leaders of the amorphous movement actually want the support of the Democratic establishment, given that some of the protesters' complaints are directed at the Obama administration. Among their grievances, the protesters say they want to see steps taken to ensure that the rich pay a fairer share of their income in taxes , that banks are held accountable for reckless practices and that more attention is paid to finding jobs for the unemployed.
The movement has chosen not to have a spokesman and did not offer official comment on the Democrats' attentions. But whether sought or not, the blessing of senior Democrats holds the potential to give the movement added heft in the same way that the role of senior Republicans like the former House leader Dick Armey did for the Tea Party as it grew from an offshoot movement to a much more organized and potent force.
The protests also provide yet another bright dividing line between Democrats and Republicans in Washington — one that seems likely to help shape the competing themes of the 2012 presidential election.
Democrats and Republicans were already largely divided over the Dodd-Frank legislation, which set out hundreds of new restrictions governing the way financial institutions operate and are regulated. But while the regulations were dense and difficult for many Americans to understand, much less seen as a rallying point, the widespread images of the sprawling protests have offered both parties a colorful and powerful symbol around which to frame their perspectives.

Leading Republicans have grown increasingly critical of the protests. Eric Cantor , the House majority leader, called the protesters “a growing mob,” and Herman Cain , a Republican presidential candidate, said the protests are the work of “jealous” anti-capitalists.

The Republican National Committee is also eager to use the protests against Mr. Obama.
“The protests began with anger aimed at Wall Street, but the anger is also directed at the failure of leadership in Washington and that starts with the president,” Kristen Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the committee, said Monday.

The protesters “realize that if they want change, the one-person most responsible for the status quo and for making change is President Obama,” she said.
While many Democrats have praised the protesters, some officials in the party remain wary of their potential impact — especially if the protests were to turn more disruptive or even violent.
“That's the danger with something like this — that you go from peaceful protests to throwing trash cans,” said a senior House Democratic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“Sure, there's been some crazy anarchy stuff, but over all, the Democrats like their message about Wall Street and accountability,” the official said. “It overlaps with our own message.”
Matt Bennett, vice president for Third Way, a Democratic policy institute in Washington that favors a more centrist approach, said he believes the angry and sometimes radical tone of the protests may turn off moderate swing voters who will be critical in the 2012 elections, just as many moderates are put off by the rhetoric of the Tea Party on the right.
Embracing the protests may prove a mistake for Democrats, Mr. Bennett said. “There's not much upside,” he said, “and there's a lot of downside.”
Robert Reich , the former labor secretary under President Bill Clinton , wrote in a blog posting Friday that the protesters' demands on taxes dovetail with Democrats' themes, but he said the protests should still make the party wary — in part because Democrats rely on Wall Street for significant campaign contributions.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
“If Occupy Wall Street coalesces into something like a real movement, the Democratic Party may have more difficulty digesting it than the G.O.P. has had with the Tea Party,” Mr. Reich wrote.
Some Tea Party leaders are already using the headlines generated by the Wall Street protesters to try to appeal for financial help for a national advertising campaign of their own.
In an e-mail sent over the weekend, Todd Cefaratti, representing TeaParty.net , explained the goal of the first television advertisement would be to introduce the face of the Tea Party movement as a “diverse group of everyday Americans who are only special in that they are patriots who want to put our country back on the right track!” He included a link to the ad that is posted on YouTube and already had more than 37,000 views by Monday night.
Mr. Cefaratti dismissed comparisons that some people have been making about the Tea Party movement and the Occupy Wall Street group.
